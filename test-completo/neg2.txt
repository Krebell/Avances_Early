 Totally. I'm really enjoying these!   Longest yet!   I love this one.   or A Walk to Remember Me Myself and Irene   What is the longest title you can make using movie titles.   For example: License to Kill Billy Elliot    I know its for comedic value, but its so overdone, that yes, it needs to stop. A joke is only funny so many times.   "Kids get scared." "Whats there to be scared of?" "No, no, I didn't say I was scared." "I didn't say you were scared." "I know."   In Carl's defense, he's always liked that word "gargantuan." Its so rare he ever afforded the opportunity to use it in a sentence.    Don't forget the constant one true dog posts.    Yeah, and Bryan Cranston would play everyone. Every single role.    Or the OVERUSAGE of "plot armor."   Yeah, agreed. I think this sub is willing to post even the most absurd "theory" just for the sake of posting something. I don't think anyone honestly believes there are Ms.    This isn't exclusive to this sub, but I see it a lot on here: When someone comments with just "this"   Same with Morgan. They've made it clear that Morgan will return in some fashion but every episode that passes, Reddit tried to create clues that lead to Morgan. Knock.It.Off.   Actually that's a good call. I was thinking about others roles too and I'm inclined to agree with you.    Yeah this gets old fast. It's even worse when they are right about something though because then they feel like they have a license to FORESHADOW CONSTANTLY.    I'm over reading about the Rick/Shane transformation personally, and every comment in regard to Eugene being "That's classified." What're yours?   I don't exactly agree, but this is the kind of answer I was looking for. Actors who could play each other's roles convincingly enough. Thanks.    Not necessarily looking for doppelgangers, but actors/actresses who could play each others roles.   Don't Judge me.    YEAH! Best level in the game. I can never quite make it all the way through without shooting the scientists and failing the mission :/ It's just too much fun.    I don't know why it is being downvoted either, BUT if we're talking Bond....Peirce Brosnan hanging upside down and punching the Russian in the face while he's on the can in Goldeneye is probably better.    There's Something About Mary also comes to mind.   Detroit Rock City is such a great movie. So much fun to watch.    Nothing off limits. What do you got?   Well I want you to try....rearry...hard to get a missile.    My dad says that Tom Hanks looks like his mouth was ripped out and then taped back on. I don't know what he means by this, but thought you should know.    I take pleasure in downvoting assholes who just post "this."   This movie has my all-time favorite trailer.   	29
 My neighbor asked me to help her move a couch.  When I went into the room she had all of her previous pets stuffed and mounted.  She still said hello to all of them.               Why is there a puppy's paw sticking out of its mouth?   What is the kilo to couric conversion factor?   Do you know the formula to calculate those?  	8
 The Harry Potter references make this story that much better! I laughed so hard at the Golden Snitch line!   That's been my fear. That's why I haven't tried to talk to it. I don't want to open myself up to possession. I know the full history of the house I'm in now. The other was a bit more blurry! I don't even know if my town has a historian, sadly    I definitely am! Just glad to be out of the other house! Never liked it from the first time we toured it.   Thank you! I have thought about that. I really hope it's him. It would make life that much easier. :)   Thank you. I would try to talk to it, but I'm really worried that it might be something more sinister. Something  trying to lead me into false comfort.   I wasn't going to post my story because I thought my life was back to normal. That was before last night. When weird things started happening, my step father had just been diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. The only people in my house were my mom, my step dad, my boyfriend, and me. My step father couldn't go to the bathroom himself, and if my mom had to go, she would call me into the living room to sit with him. He was never unattended. Furthermore, my room was right beside the bathroom. I could hear anyone coming in or out.  Let me also explain about my step father, he was a police officer and where I live, police have to get extensive physicals every year to stay on the force. He also frequently got strep, so he had blood work done every time he had it due to the hospital visit. We had just moved into an older house, and I always felt uneasy in the house. There was just something off about it. Less than a year after we move, my step dad who has always been given a clean bill of health was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. They said it had to have been there for at least 6-7 years. We had no clue where it had come from. I immediately thought of A Haunting in Connecticut, how the boy got sicker after moving into an old house. How else would I explain my step father getting so sick so fast?  When the weird stuff started happening to me, my boyfriend isn't living with me. I have always been deathly afraid of the dark. I've slept with my tv on for as long as I can remember. I can't stand the sounds houses make at night, so the sound drowns it out and provides light. I sleeping pretty peacefully when it was disturbed by a dream that wouldn't be scary to normal people. It was an older lady glaring at me. I've never seen this lady, but I had a deep feeling that she was evil and wanted to cause me harm. I woke up with a jolt and was overwhelmed with the same feeling I had in the dream. I can't explain how I know, but I knew it was her. Then I quickly noticed my tv was off. My mom wouldn't turn my tv off because she knows I need it. I got a horrible feeling of dread through me. I quickly grabbed my remote to get the tv back on. Needless to say, I didn't go back to sleep that night.  About a month and a half later, I was still getting that terrified feeling throughout my house occasionally, but I was starting I get used to it because my boyfriend started staying with me. We had been laying in bed all day because it was one of my few days off, so I would know if anyone had gone to the bathroom recently. When I got up to use the bathroom, I could hear water running, which was very odd because no one had been in there. It wasn't possible. When I opened the bathroom door, our bathroom was flooded because someone (something?) had turned our sink on full blast. I quickly called out to my mom who confirmed my suspicions. No one had been to the bathroom. As we cleaned the mess, my mom was comforting me, and I let her reason calm me, quickly turning away any thoughts of paranormal.  Sadly, the next part in my story was the worst time in my life. My step father had just been taken to the hospital, and the family had been called in. We were living at the hospital basically. My mom made me go to my grandmother's to get some rest, so my friend Molly drove me and My friend Robin to our respective houses. On the way to Robin's, Molly slammed the brakes and asked if we had seen something run I front of the car. Neither of us had, so we just assumed it was an animal because we live in a mountainous area. Animals weren't uncommon. Nothing happened the rest of the ride, until Molly dropped me off at the end of my drive way. As I was walking toward my house, I saw the figure of a man duck behind a car, so I took off at a sprint to get to the safety of home. When I turned around, I saw a black cat walking toward me from where I had just seen the man. I got into the house and locked the door. I texted Molly what had happened. She replied, "I don't want to scare you anymore, but I thought it was a black cat that I saw driving Robin home..." After a short conversation, I drifted off into an uneasy sleep. The next day, I went to my house to clean up some. I must explain that I lived in a high class neighborhood, so there were no stray animals around. When I got to my house, I saw a black cat sitting beside the door. After that, I quickly cleaned up because I didn't want to be in that house any longer. My step father died that night.  For a couple months after my step father died, everything was calm, so I chocked everything that had happened as stress. Then one morning as I was getting ready for class, I was brushing my teeth before I showered. I went to turn the water off, but I didn't turn the handle all the way, so I had to reach and turn the handle further. I got in the shower, but when I got out. The water was turned on full blast. After that, I started getting ready faster in the mornings, so I didn't have to be in the house. One morning, my mom was still home, so I decided to take my time getting ready. When I was in the shower, I could clearly hear my step father saying hello to me. I didn't get the terrified feeling I normally got. Instead I was filled with joy. The last thing that happened in that house before we moved happened around 3 am. I was working late shift, so it was common that I would be cooking at these times. As I was waiting on the oven to heat up, the coffee pot came on without anyone touching it. Now, some might think it could have been set like an alarm, but no one in my house drinks coffee. It was my step father's, so I went to investigate and the coffee pot wasn't even plugged in.  Finally, this brings me to the present. My mother went to the beach, but I stayed home because I had to work. One night, I heard growling coming from my living room, but both dogs were in bed with me. There was nothing in the house to make that sound. I closed my bedroom door and laid in bed, until I couldn't stay awake anymore. I was ecstatic when Mom came home the next day.  Finally, last night, the thing that made me post my story. I was going to get ready for work, so I walked through the house to get a towel. When I came back through, my mom asked what I was doing. I told her going to shower for work. She looked at me confused and said she thought I had already showered. She heard it running. My mom and I are the only ones in the house. I went to the bathroom to check out her claim. Nothing was out of place, no running water. I still didn't shower that night.  Please, tell me what is following my family and why it only affects me.  [Edit] Grammar and puncheon due to posting from phone.   That's so sad. Rape culture hurts men just as much as girls though. I just don't understand blaming a victim. I'm always horrified at those attitudes... "Well, she was showing cleavage, so she clearly wanted to have sex." What logic is that?! Most dressier women's clothing has some sort of cut to it.   I work at a small chain grocery store. In our store, anyone can walk into the meat department and from there the meat cooler. People leave the meat shop at probably 8-8:30 every night and manager leaves at 7. The problem? Everyone left is a regular associate. Regular associate's can't say anything to shoplifters, and if they would and something would happen, said store won't compensate because it's "not in the job description." Leading to a lot of stolen merchandise and workers getting yelled at by management...   Considering that you said it's lower class, it's kinda sad that it might have been nice to her. It might have been the best she could get, and she was just happy for it...   It could be PTSD. He could have been having a flashback to a military funeral where he was looking at the coffin of someone he knew and was saluting it... It's very sad.   I don't know if you looked at The Noble Collection online. They have a lot of cool stuff!  	11
 How much for the books?    I think you meant to post this on /r/UnmadeBeds   Isn't entropy the best? :) Everyone should die ;)    MURICA!   comments    As a college student, I am successful in my studies and refer  to myself often. Every time a quarter ends, I scan all my notes/papers/projects. I then store then in two places. Online and hard drive. I delete the hard copy, and enjoy a clutter, but organized academic folders.

Since you are not a candidate for any government assistance, you should invest into to look into third parties who will give you a loan with interest. Depends what UC, but tuition at UCR is 14k a year. If you tend to graduate in 4 years, you would owe. 56k in just tuition, not including the textbooks, parking passes, misconlanious purchases. If you're poor, it's better to stick to a CC, I've seen people who were in the same situation as you only to fail the 2nd year and owe 30k in money they aren't investable anymore.    How much $ do you make a year?    Here is a smile for you young adults entering the big scary world. Titties control a man, boom that's some wisdom you learn when you're 19.

Since you helped me, I'll  tell you something. **YOU'RE MISSING LOVE**. You don't lose yourself if you want to die, voluntarily. You need love to fill your life. From reading your capricious text, I concluded to this analysis. Make yourself look/feel good and be promiscuous or just love yourself. No bulshit. I'm a year older than you and I got my life together- give or take. I've  never been where you are unlike the miliqtoast of commentators who  have.

 "You don't expect the FBI to clean up after multiple murders?"  "Why else do you think they're run by a man called Hoover?"  +1 excellent, underrated film. Tim Curry is excellent.   Cyclocross. Do what you like :-)  And yes, the chap cycling up was the target...    I have only 20 friends on Facebook. The funny thing is that they really are all friends. I consider myself very lucky indeed :-)   It would be a cold day in hell before I used SSDs in RAID0! They are just way to likely to dump your data....and the best part is that you've just made it 4x as likely to happen....    Fair, but any company that's charging that much for such a small amount of labour would get grumpy customers. I know I would be pretty unhappy as I would be certain that I'd been ripped off on the installation charges!   On the day this was released, my then girlfriend and I noticed that the cover image was a painting held at a museum in Manchester (UK, to avoid confusion). We immediately skipped lectures and went to find it.  In short, it was in storage but the nice lady at the museum desk was slightly surprised that a few people had come in that day asking about the same obscure painting.  Still think fondly of this with my uni years. It's always been a favourite of mine and I still think it's Weezer's best album...   Interesting story, but $300k/yr for installing kitchens...? Are you quite sure they were making a profit?  My domestic kitchen cost me about $2k to have installed (in the Uk) and took a few days (big kitchen!)... Certainly someone asking that kinda money isn't going to be doing many domestic jobs here!   I challenge anyone placed in a situation where green means success to /not/ utter the immortal:  "light is green...trap is clean."  Wonderful!   I use Tasker to only allow specific apps to rotate the screen. Sorted for me.  Also, never rotate when powered - I read on my side in bed so this sorts that too as the phone is usually powered.   Kinda agree, but notice how supermarkets sell a 4-Pinter, but these are /always/ 2 litres from more expensive shops (convenience stores, filling stations etc) because 2 litres  4 pints so they can charge higher prices for less product.  If 4-pinters were banned tomorrow, no one would notice that we were paying the same for less.     Most, but not all:  My main bike has:  Hope hubs, brakes, headset, QRs etc (Lancashire, UK),  Pace frame and fork (Yorkshire, UK),  USE seatpost (Sussex, UK) Shimano XT drivetrain (Japan) Conti tyres (Germany)  Plenty of other options out there that you can use on your own doorstep, even in poor, third-world America where you don't have HopeTech on your doorstep ;-)  Buy local! Support these businesses!   Too much good to mention it all: the drunk odd couple, napkins, the world's greatest speech, plenty of real emotion and some awesome acting.  It takes a brave man to make the whodunit part of a Sherlock story incidental to the episode, but it worked very well. Top notch writing and a first class screenplay.  The best thing about Sherlock is that you never know what you're going to get each week. If I wanted predictability, I'd watch Murder She Wrote ;-)     Depends on school - ours in uk has cheapest possible uniform that costs peanuts from the supermarket. Even the kit with the school logo on comes from Tesco and is super cheap!  School uniform FTW as both parent and child.   Not sure if serious, but my gym is silent (well, no music anyway) and most people wear 'phones so they can choose their own pain :-)  I have some custom moulds for my Etymotics that block out everyone else and allows me to curse and complain in complete isolation. Recommended.   Great idea. Thank heavens the UK only has one major city that we can stuff all of this great investment into, otherwise it might look like we're only capable of making major capital investment south of Milton Keynes...  Pah.   Ah, yes. That's very true. I'm making the assumption that in the US, "shoulders" work like they do on UK motorways - that is, they are reserved for emergency vehicles and / or breakdowns. They should not be routinely driven in.  Interestingly, on more and more busy sections of the UK motorway network, the hard shoulder (as it's called in the UK) is being opened up to flowing traffic by use of special signs above that clearly indicate when you can and can't drive in these lanes. In addition, refuges have been built so if you break down, you can park in one of these. Obviously, if you can't make it to one of these, you must stop on the regular hard shoulder, which is closely monitored by automated camera and will automatically switch traffic away from this lane to avoid the blockage.  Not ideal, but we have too many cars and not enough lanes :/   Lot of swearing, anger and gun references, so not sure if you're rational. Still...  Yes, merge-in-turn does work. By having everyone evenly merge in whilst making use of all available road, the traffic backlog is kept in a smaller section of road, this avoiding it from backlogging to the next big intersection and causing a cascaded traffic jam.  Obviously it only takes a few muppets that think they know better to block the merging traffic and the queue becomes worse...and said drivers will always blame this on the merging traffic because they are always right, and therefore the others are wrong.  Grow up, chill out and expand your knowledge and experience on the road. There's no such thing as a fully educated driver :-)   Looks like you've burnt a fair few of those fake internet points, so not sure if "swimming against the tide" hasn't just turned into "being downright wrong"   Called "zip merging" and it helps to keep traffic flowing by avoiding stalls and minimising queues backing up into other parts of the network. Good practice :-)  Shame most truck drivers here (UK) equate this with pushing in front of their disabled grandma in the queue at the theatre :-/    OK, hard shoulder is fair. But I've seen trucks do this when two (legitimate) lanes merge into one and they've decided that 1 mile from the merge, everyone should be in the inside lane so they block the outside lane.  They should read the bit in the book about zip merging...and then go fuck themselves too :-)    No, that was Piz Gloria on the Schilthorn in Switzerland.   Fair comment...except that by not liking iTunes (and I really, really can't stand it) this excludes me from both the iPods and iPhones, which both insist on using iTunes and only iTunes for updates and media activities.  So I have Android and I use other media sources (Amazon and Google) for music. Oh, and as I've not bought into the rest, I never bothered buying a Mac either.  Sorry Apple, my Android plugs into anything and is trivially easy to get stuff on and off it without the need for crapware. Your insistence on a closed ecosystem keeps me 100% outside it and thus it will remain.   And this all begins and ends with fucking iTunes...   Your comments are fair but I suspect that you may have a biased view of things (sadly, like me, simply posting on this story gives this away :-)  My wife, brother and both parents were bored silly and while I enjoyed it (it /is/ doctor who after all!) I could see its flaws.   The episode did jump around a lot and where others have said was because it was too short, I think was because they tried to do too much in a short time resulting in a flawed presentation (too rushed *and* too confusing depending on your level of series immersion)  All I'll say is that my wife has says that she has no interest in the next series and I've got a right bloody task ahead of me to persuade her otherwise. At least I've got a few months!  Perhaps regenerations should be either left out of the Xmas specials or (perhaps better still) done right at the start so that the new actor gets a good run at it.   Ho hum, I like burning imaginary internet points :-)   Awesome. So, we've established that while he didn't invent The Internet (this was obviously done by The Elders, as everyone knows) we are in agreement that he was heavily influential in creating the mechanism that most people use to access it.  Now that we've cleared that up, what piece of mainstream technology have /you/ contributed to society...?   Sorry guys, but while it may have appealed to Who geekdom, it bombed in our house. Frankly, it was dragged out way too long and once it was apparent that Smith was on his way, I'd have preferred to see it dealt with and get a bit more time in with the new 'un.  Too much geek, not enough story. Is it too late to get Kylie back?  Looking forward to Capaldi though... Guess it's a few months to wait :-/   Err, didn't Rowling's solicitor's wife drop the ball at a dinner party to show off? Not quite sure this should be bundled with mass surveillance...!   Scotland is Northern England!  Piffle. Scotland isn't a real country...you're thinking of Yorkshire, which clearly /is/.  :-)      I'd heard tell that when the injection moulds wear out, they are buried in the concrete foundations of their buildings to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.....  I like this. It's very James Bond :-)   Yup, it probably was. Sorry :-/   Useful link but as mentioned elsewhere, hardly comparable. I can make a computer out of wood but I'm not really doing that...I'm just shoving modern bits in a wooden case.  Amazing that anyone can actually make such a thing. In fact, I'm amazed by my own (traditional) automatic watch that holds to about 3s per day using nothing more than springs and cogs and shit!  Worth noting that while quartz watches are usually "better" than mechanical ones, they are rarely as collectable nor as interesting. If I wanted a quartz watch, I'd just use my atomically-synced phone :-)   [Citation needed]   You do know that no one outside of the US gives more than a passing shit about US congressmen too?  It's all about perspective and I'm afraid that your username implies that yours may be a trifle biased...   You are technically correct....the best kind of correct!  	33
 He suffered it in the 2nd to last drive.  He had a couple of good runs at the beginning of the last drive and then came in for that last atrocious play.   No details at the moment.

The NFL as an attempt to spread football has offered free game streams there.  You could also just use an antennae to watch local games in HD.  Check out [r/cordcutters](http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/) for more info regarding ditching cable.   We have the inalienable right to say and express any idea we want.  If an nfl player is willing to deal with the consequences (ie fines or media/fan attention), he should say whatever he wants.  I really don't see how this is a slippery slope.   I feel like a simple, but costly solution concerning player health and safety would be that the NFL just covers the cost of medical expenses for each player for life after they retire from the sport.  I feel that is a fair compromise considering NFL players do not get guaranteed contracts and that the NFL owners do nothing.  The players provide the entertainment, not the owners and not the other NFL executives.  I just really wish the NFLPA was a better run organization and actually used that reality as leverage.   I think it would be "pretty dumb" to jump to the conclusion that the Chargers would run it like that based off of a one game sample size against a bad run defense.   From what we have seen ALL season, not just one game, the Chargers are more likely to be passing more than they will be running it.    As for Allen's value, he should be a top 30 WR.  It is a positive that he did well despite the fact that the team went so run heavy.  I'm not saying he will put up the same numbers he has had the past 2 weeks but he will be a solid WR3 for standard 10 team leagues.   Chiefs D, Moreno, Fred Jackson, Reggie Bush, Julius Thomas, Jordan Cameron, Desean Jackson, Gordon, Blackmon, and Allen. Although the latter 2 still have a small sample size of success this year.  I would also put Peyton Manning and Jimmy Graham as steals.  These guys were drafted in the 2nd or 3rd round and are probably worth a top 8 draft pick.   Yesterday was the first time this season that the Chargers were so balanced.  They have consistently been a pass first team during their 5 other games.     The biggest issue with the healthcare in the US is that it is a for profit industry. Ideally the development and applications of medicine should be motivated by benefitting the well being of humanity not concerned with increasing cash flows.   But unfortunately people just aren't that intelligent or empathetic,  especially in the US.   	15

I love the 70's vibe, the militaristic sound and the use of brass instruments in Yamato 2199...really got me pumped for the huge battles. While Kyousogiga's music hit that sentimental spot.

I love how Gintama manges to make juvenile humor funny again. These are the type of humor that you feel like you have moved on from as you got older but then you see something like Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon and Peen-san and you just can't help but burst out laughing.   The whole harem arc. Also any Shinpachi romance arc is hilarious.   Resident Evil is a popular Japanese made game so there's a decent brand recognition.       The filler and non-filler episodes prior to the Kyoto arc weren't good either but the ones past the Kyoto arc really are an absolute bore. Well I guess the the Shougo Arc was some what decent.   To anyone who played the VN, which route do you think is the anime taking?  I don't mind being spoiled.   Despite being selfish and not doing what's best for both Touma and Haruki, Setsuna is still the most honest one of the group therefore my best girl.   lol this show has gone completely bonkers.

I think Haruki is overcompensating. He realizes he has feelings for Touma which makes him feel guilty so he compensates for that by rushing his relationship with Setsuna hoping it would drown out whatever he feels for Touma.      I'm so confused by this show right now. I thought the show was starting to hit its stride in ep. 6 and in the second half of 7. I was starting to have a grasp on what direction the show is going then this wacky tonal shift happened.  I'm just hoping for a payoff that would make sense and justify this tonal shift in a gratifying manner.

[This dog story](http://vimeo.com/38013872) was such a tearjerker, almost as good as Futurama's Jurassic Bark.      Holy shit I don't know how to respond to this.  I was half expecting the show to go Steins;Gate on us, which means having a slow build up leading to shit hitting the fan really fast but I didn't expect the show to go full blown superhero.  I'll go with a wait and see approach before I react to this.   Robert de flato                     Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is my runaway AOTY.      [They're following the Gintama strategy](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/070/4/9/gintama_yaoi_motivational_by_sweetshounenai-d3bdrp2.jpg)  edit: FYI Gin and Goto share the same voice actor.   Oh man, this episode was hilarious. It also did a fine job of showing Masayoshi's dedication and pure intentions in a charming way without coming off corny or overly preachy.  Another thing I liked was Mari's little slip of the tongue about letting off steam, I guess that confirms she's really in it for thrill and excitement.  Also Gotobro exuded so much broness in this episode.  I need more Sumi screentime.         This was an excellent episode but then again most things about Yamato 2199 are excellent. More people should watch this show!   Reaper and Pushing Daisies, both have the quirkiness and eccentricity that might be better expressed in anime form. Also Better Off Ted as a SOL anime.  Maybe I'm just mentioning shows I felt were canceled so abruptly.       Moe waiting for a kiss from Mari was funny.  I like how both Mari and Masayoshi hit a lull in their superhero career and how they dealt with it differently. Masayoshi's passion for heroism was starting to fade and he was becoming jaded, then he realized he's doing this not for fun, not for the hero ego boost but for justice. While Mari was just getting bored since she has little purpose other than entertainment so she dealt with her boredom by upping the ante of her antics.  Looks like both Goto and Hazama will find a common sense of purpose and really start working together.         I'm surprised there were no Faye Valentine versions. The Haruhi bunny costume one was the best.         as expected akira loses to mori  I'm glad they didn't drag that out into a love triangle. The romance was unobtrusive and served as a good complement to the main story.   The Walking Dead is mainstream. The ratings for last season were high and this season's are even better.   Highly recommended anime.

I mean, this show is about a treasure hunt basically, but this episode didn't include any part of the treasure-hunting! I'm feeling like the show doesn't really know how much time they should spend on characterization that is not the best I've ever seen but still, fairly standard.  Totally agreed with this. The lack of balance between character development and storytelling leads to pretty bad pacing. As a result the treasure just conveniently shows up instead of being discovered. Then there are these random action scenes that just pop up out of nowhere with very little set up.  Despite these glaring flaws I can't get myself to drop this show.   Crotch shots is cheap humor but the show somehow made it work. I guess the character, sound effects and the delivery are what got a laugh out of me.  I'm still enjoying this but it's the Goto and Masayoshi dialogue that made the show engaging and it's kind of veering away from that. Also it feels a bit directionless, other than character introductions the main story has been stagnant. I hope we see more progression since most of the main cast have been established.

Some of the more recent Ghibli movies are pretty underrated.  From Up on Poppy Hill [(Watch it here)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQD4VH4Drvk)  Arrietty   **Wolf Children.** It's a sentimental and emotionally moving movie about a young mother raising her two kids that are part wolf in the Japanese countryside.  [Here's some stills](http://imgur.com/a/7yBMB)  [Watch it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7H0Vcl8kIw)  Also check out Le jour des corneilles (The Day Of Crows). It's a very sweet french animation movie.         With that much muscle mass I highly doubt he neglected developing glamour muscles like the chest. Some people are just lacking genetically in certain areas.      Synopsis:  Hana is a 19-year-old student who falls in a "fairy-tale like" love with a "wolf man". Over the course of the 13-year story Hana gives birth to two children - older sister Yuki, and younger brother Ame, or "Snow and Rain". At first the family quietly lives in the city trying to hide their wolf heritage, but when the "wolf man" suddenly dies Hana makes the decision to move to a rural town, far from their previous city life.      They would all get it...get congratulations for graduating.

At a distance it looks like it could be interesting, but up close it's just a ton shit you don't need.   I was at Wrigley Field the night of the [Bartman Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident). After the game I watched a mob chase his police escort down the street.   I came here to make sure someone corrected the *isle.*   I don't know know the specifics, but I believe the police had narrowed down the suspects and he was one of them. I think they got a warrant.   As for how much my mother knew... I just don't know. She was not involved in the trial for some reason and whenever I ask about her the staff here are very vague.    When you grow up with something your whole life, you just never think it's weird. When I was younger I knew there was another room there. As I got older, I trusted my parents more and my instincts less.    I haven't looked into it much as I just can't take it, but they were gagged somehow. One person managed to scream at one point but that scream was cut off very...abruptly.    I believe they stopped making noise when they heard my dad's voice yelling at them. If I were experiencing what went on on the other side of that wall, I would have listened to him too.    Yes. The scratching that terrified me all my life was people resigned to death, carving their last word to their families into the wall.    This actually means a lot. That story took the most out of me to write and is my favorite but it doesn't seem to get a lot of notice on Nosleep.    He was arrested and I gave testimony at his trial. Whether or not he was arrested at the house that night or elsewhere, I don't know. If he was, he'd been carted away by the time I got home.   He was caught, arrested and is currently on death row. But, no, I will never see him again.   He was caught and arrested. Whether he was arrested at home or elsewhere I'm not sure. He had been taken away by the time I showed up. He is currently on death row.    If I knew how to break into that - I totally would. And thank you!   I do complex math in my head for no reason.    We've always lived at 423 Stockholm Street, so there really wasn't ever a time that I didnt hear the creature. Hed been living in the room on the other side of my wall since I was born.  When I was a very young child, I thought He was my friend. I would knock and He would bang back. I would giggle and He would mumble words to me that I couldnt understand. I thought He was there to protect me from my nightmares. But as I got older, I started to be afraid. My parents insisted that there wasnt a room on the other side of my wall. Over time, I realized that He wasnt my friend at all. Thats when the scratching, moaning and sporadic banging began to scare me.  When I was eight I finally broke down and told my parents about the creature in my wall. I was terrified that He would come into my room one night and kill me. My mother rolled her eyes and told me it was mice. She never listened to me, anyway. My father agreed with her that it was animals, but he hugged me and told me he would protect me and not to be scared.  So from then on whenever I'd hear the noises I would scream for my father and he would come running into my room less than a minute later to see what the matter was. I would point at the wall and cower. My dad would smile, bang on the wall with his fist and say: "Quiet down in there or else!" The noise would stop, Id give my dad a teary smile and he would hug me. He was always my protector. I miss him so much, now.  As I matured into a teenager I started inviting my friends to sleepover. They didnt believe my stories at first but after one night in my room - they were convinced. We called ourselves the Stockholm Street Ghostbusters and we spent hours trying to exorcise the entity (a demon, according to our research) through awkward sances and Ouija boards. We decided that the scratching must be the creature etching satanic sigils and drawings into the other side of my wall.  One slumber party, running on heightened bravado and caffeine, I waited until the familiar scratching started and I pounded on the wall, just like my dad.   "QUIET DOWN IN THERE OR ELSE. YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD. THE LIVING ARE TRYING TO SLEEP!"   We giggled and my friends were impressed - for a moment. I should have known not to provoke him.   Suddenly there was an answering enraged banging on my wall, louder than Id ever heard, and a sort of angry yelling. We all screamed and hid in the closet, yelling for my dad. When he came running, my friends begged him to take them home. I was left alone while they were gone. I could feel Him, almost see Him impatiently pacing behind the wall, back and forth, 5 inches of wood and wallpaper between He and I. I was so scared that I stayed hidden in the closet. Then the scratching started again.  That was when I realized what it was doing: it was trying to carve its way through the wall and into my bedroom. I whimpered at the thought and then scratching stopped and the banging resumed on the walls. It didn't stop again until the headlights of my dad's car lit up my room. I cried until my dad, always the hero, came sprinting into my room and banged on the wall.   Its still in the walls, Dad! I wailed.   He nodded, gave me a pitying look and pounded his fist on the demons wall. "Quiet down in there or else!"   Then he held me, let me cry out my fears, and told me it was okay if I slept on the sofa that night. Sometimes I thought he believed it was all in my head. But it wasnt. The murmurs, the knocking, and the scratching, Id been hearing it all my life. It was real. But if he didnt believe he never let on and never made me feel crazy. He just played along. I guess I never really understood my dad.   One night when I was 16, I was awoken by an otherworldly, ear-splitting scream. It was so loud, so high and so piercing that I screamed as well, in terror. The scream ended abruptly then and a moment later my dad came running in.  "You heard it!" I cried as my body wracked with sobs. "How could you not hear it? You had to have heard it."  "Oh sweetie." My dad sat at the end of my bed, his hair disheveled and a far-off look in his middle-of-the-night, bloodshot eyes. "Of course I heard it, but it was just an owl, I'm sure of it. We've been seeing a few in the neighborhood."  "No dad, listen to the walls."  Lindsey-  Please, Dad.  He sighed but nodded and we sat and listened for awhile. I needed my dad to know the truth and to finally believe me. We were all in danger. But no more sounds came from the wall that night.  I didn't hear Him again after that, not for a long time. The wall suddenly felt empty to me for the first time in my life. Maybe it was dormant or maybe it had been called back to Hell. But either way, I knew it would be back.  Oddly, when the creature did return I didn't really notice at first. After 16 years it was simply white noise to me: a background soundtrack as familiar to me as my own face. It took so long for me to process that it was back that I cant put my finger on when it actually started. I think that's what sealed our fates, in the end. The noises were just so inherent to me that I failed to understand how unusual they really were, and had been all along. When I finally did realize what I was hearing I'm ashamed to say I felt almost relieved.   The haunt progressed in the same cycle it had all my life. First, the groans, then the banging, then light, lazy tapping, and then, finally, the scratching, always the scratching.    I'd told my dad about the scratching, and about how I thought the creature was trying to rip through the wall and into my room. My dad laughed and told me there were 3 inches of solid metal on the other side of my wall and that nothing; not mice, raccoons, feral cats or even ghosts could come through my wall. And he should know, he'd built the house himself. And besides, he assured me, he would always be there to protect me. But in the end, he wasn't.  Since I was moving out in a year, I decided I had no choice but to just stick it out. After 16 years with Him, what was 12 more months? I grew unconcerned, lazy, and complacent. I ignored the noises, even started to bang back, again. I used logic to pacify my fear: whatever it was, it couldn't come through the wall. If it could, it would've done so years ago. And I sensed that more than anything else in the world, it wanted OUT. And since it was still in there, obviously, it was trapped. And I was right.  The night the door was opened is the most vivid memory I have. I was at a friend's house when my mother called me and told me to come home immediately. This, in itself, was strange as my mother barely even acknowledged me and never, ever called me.  I drove the 5 miles back to my neighborhood but I had a hard time getting in. I started to panic as I desperately weaved through all the media vans, police cars, and SWAT trucks. I had to park and walk the final three blocks to my house, tears rolling down my cheeks as I realized that my street was at the epicenter of it all. Because I knew. As soon as I saw my house, I realized it - my dad must be dead. It had finally gotten out and it had killed my dad.  I took off at a dead run then, ignoring all the voices yelling at me to stop. I dodged in between the vehicles, pushing past dozens of people, ran through the crime scene tape and directly into my house - and there it was. Across from the living room, next to my bedroom, the hall closet stood with its door open. All the jackets and sweaters had been pulled out of it and on the back wall I saw it - another door. For whatever reason, no one stopped me. I stumbled into the closet, through the hidden door, and out into the room I'd always known was there. But it wasn't what I thought it'd be.  The media called my dad The Skinner of Stockholm Street. And from what I saw in that room, it was a very fitting name. There were knives, all sorts really. And there were metal devices stacked along one wall, at least a hundred of them. Most I didn't recognize, but a few I had seen in history books. There were 4 set of manacles, a wall of chains and rolls of duct tape. In the middle of the room there was a flat table which was, very clearly, blood soaked. A tall stool sat at the head of the table.  But the worst of it was the wall - my wall. Every inch of it was covered in carvings. But the carvings weren't satanic or evil like I'd thought.  The carvings were words.  *Jacob, I love you. Diana Hobb*  T*ell my father I forgive him. Brian Woodlin*  *Tara, I'm so sorry. Michael Mcnulty*  *Tell my daughters they were my world. Angela Waterstone*  According to the evidence file there were over 60 of these messages. And I made myself read every single one. They haunt me every night. I had spent ten years tormenting them and they would now forever torment me.  I live in a hospital now and I can still hear the scratching. Every time I close my eyes, I hear it. I haven't really slept in a year. My doctor says if I dont sleep soon, Ill die. I spend my days watching news coverage of my father's trial, and I spend my nights staring at the walls. The drugs don't work, but they keep giving them to me anyway. And though I try every night, I can never fall asleep. I always hear the scratching. And I always will.  [C.

And you're like 'Why the fuck did he just start talking about fried chicken?'   I had a layover in Kyoto, Japan and had met some other backpackers on the plane who also had a layover. The 5 of us went out and ate dinner, had some booze and pretty much just started walking around the city looking for a bar we wouldn't embarrass ourselves in.   Suddenly this giant bus (like a coach) rolls up and the bus driver asks us if we'd like to go to a bar. For whatever reason we decide to go and get on the bus. We are all handed one beer each and went to sit down at the back of the bus. There was a TV mounted to the roof and people were passing around a microphone singing karaoke.   We got to someplace kinda rural and piled off the bus. It was like a few semi trailers that had been stacked together, the walls broken down in between them, and cheap wooden panels mounted everywhere. But other than that it was a regular bar with tables, chairs and, of course Karaoke. Most people there were Westerns. We had a lot of fun and got pretty drunk. Took a taxi home.  Through the course of the night we did learn that the "bar" was created for the flight crews of European and American airlines so that they would have somewhere to drink in Kyoto.  The whole thing was pretty surreal.   Not literally.   No other buildings that we could see, but I'm assuming that's because the church couldn't vanish, due to it being the "cage" of the statue.

I am so glad you told her no.   That is one of the nicest people I have ever heard of.   I got into a pretty bad t-bone with my 5 years old daughter. The other driver was drunk and tried to run - as did the 2 other people in his car - so the police were very busy. My daughter and I were ok enough to climb out of the car, but I was an absolute wreck. Shaking etc.  This woman who had seen the accident came to talk to us and saw the state I was in. She ran back to her house and came back with bottles of water, stuffed animals and a coloring book with crayons for my kid.   This lady totally saved the day. It calmed us both down until the cops could come deal with me and what was left of my car.She kinda disappeared and I'm still sad I didn't get to thank her.   "Bring back Firefly" Then they'd have to do it. Right? I mean, right?  	80

The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic.    #**What flair is available?**  All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar. However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...  The general format is:  Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)  When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.  #**How does one obtain flair?**   First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available. Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .  This can be provided several ways:  1) Message the mods with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification.   Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.   2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.   3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record.   This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.  Edit:  Hi.  We're getting flooded with requests, we're adding people as fast as we can, if we miss you somehow, we apologize, if you don't see your flair or get a response in the next two days, message us again.

 Whatever happened to this series? Do the arcade elements not translate to modern consoles anymore?    More choices. I love that video games are becoming more like movies, but the reason I love video games is that YOU control the plot and story.   Safe. It's a bizarre film where Julianne Moore gets "20th Century Disease". Basically it causes her to mysteriously break out in sores and have seizures due to certain chemicals and fumes like car exhaust. Nobody understands why she is having these ailments and the film is full of these sterile, long static shots that make you feel uncomfortable.   	3
 It cost me a fortune in stamps.   Nothing. They were both stuck up bitches.   Reminds me of Ski Patrol www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK8fsGGqyp4 Sorry for awful dubbed link, only one I could find   It's seriously a gladiator school in there. You hang the phone up too loud and you can get a "rainbow" (jumped by someone from each race at the same time)  	4
 I was pretty disappointed in the execution. That said, I do plan on reading the "companion book," A God in Ruins, which is supposed to come out in May 2015.   New York Public Library.   Because I can get pretty much any movie I want for free from my library.    She's the one with the problem if you're being honest about not cheating or using pornography excessively and about showing her that you love her and find her attractive. If you can't have an open, honest conversation just the two of you, you might want to consider couples counseling for the two of you and individual counseling for her or for you if she refuses, so you can learn to respond to her comments effectively instead of defensively.   Only when there is absolutely no positive aspect to the relationship. After all, you never know when you might need a kidney.   You should get a food scale and all kinds of measuring implements and make sure that she's not overeating. That's what my problem was as a kid -- even though I ate healthy foods, I ate way too much of it.   Also, regarding dessert, try to avoid having it on a daily basis -- keep it for special occasions only.   An example would be helpful.   This year Scotland voted for independence. It's not such an imaginary line.   Looks almost like nazi-propaganda.  But, but, but the video description says it's not propaganda!   Clive Owen.   Either way, she isn't supposed to look like Jennifer Lawrence.   In the UK, national identity is pretty important. Someone who is English is not Scottish. They are not any more interchangeable than black and white are.   They need to do a study where the students are randomly assigned to their seats. Or they can look at schools where kids are seated by alphabetical order, which makes things relatively random.   You don't need to have an excess of iron for your blood to help someone and potentially save their life. Go donate!   I think you should ask your girlfriend why she thinks it's an awful idea.    In most cases the person is mentally ill, so it's not a rational decision that they make.   Or the opposite way around: A civil suit is legalized extortion. Pay me X amount of money and I'll stop accusing you in public of rape. Don't feel like paying me? I'll keep talking and we'll go to trial then the accusations will be on public record forever.   People in high school when I was in middle school looked 20. People in high school when I was in college looked 12.  In other words: This is just your perspective. And a backwards one at that.   There used to be a picture of me on Google Streetview near my work. Thank goodness it's not there anymore. I thought they caught me a second time in almost the exact same spot, but I'm not there so I guess the camera wasn't on -- the car must have just been passing by.   They also reposted the title without thinking.   Telivah  *tevilah    It usually takes about two hours for a play to be performed, so considering you're reading it to yourself, it should take under two hours. Even though it's 120 pages, it's mostly white space.   Certainly there is a genetic susceptibility to cancer. For example, a woman with a BRCA1 or 2 gene is far more likely to get breast cancer than a woman without the mutation.  But even if you don't have a specific genetic susceptibility, you are exposing yourself to cancer-causing agents all the time, knowingly or not. Though I don't believe they have any explanation for why someone who smokes can die at 35 of lung cancer while someone else who smokes can die at 100 of natural causes.   That is so awesome. I would love to have a pet goat that I took on adventures around town. My life would be a children's book!   Component parts: "curly-twirly"  LOL.   He is wrong. Probably he confused kiddush with havdalah.   While I'm sure you're intentions are good I feel I should ask if you've brought the issue to the attention of the library staff.   I haven't, but if I can figure out who to contact, I can send an e-mail.   Could you, perhaps, volunteer at the library so they could use your desire to shelve where they deem it most necessary?  At the moment they're only accepting volunteers during the day, and I'm not available then.   Agree, though MIT is a specialized science school, so I suppose it's a bit more prestigious in its field than Oxford or Cambridge, which I don't even know if they offer science degrees.    Interesting etymology of the -crat ending.  -cracy   word-forming element forming nouns meaning "rule or government by," from French -cratie or directly from Medieval Latin -cratia, from Greek -kratia "power, might; rule, sway; power over; a power, authority," from kratos "strength," from PIE *kre-tes- "power, strength," suffixed form of root *kar-/*ker- "hard" (see hard). The connective -o- has come to be viewed as part of it. Productive in English from c.1800.  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-cracy allowed_in_frame=0   Some of you might remember from a little while back that I was doing some amateur shelf reading. Someone recommended that I avoid doing non-fiction and I wholeheartedly agreed until today. I was looking for a play and discovered the non-fiction was in just as bad shape -- if not worse -- than the fiction.  The play I was looking for was listed in the catalogue as available but was nowhere to be seen. Which was not surprising considering what I found. It might have been anywhere.   There was one thing I didn't understand. A dual-language book of poetry had the Dewey Decimal Number of something like Gle 891.621 N Dhomhnail. (I don't think this is the exact book, but it was a similar number.) I couldn't figure out what the Gle was supposed to mean so I just left the book on a shelf and hoped somebody who worked there would find its correct home, which, now that I'm looking in the catalogue, appears to be on a different floor entirely.   I have the feeling that this poor little book will never find its home. And nobody will ever take it out because it's not where it's supposed to be and then it'll get weeded because nobody's taken it out in X number of years.  Oh the humanity!    I liked the Rithmatist. The writing was clearly for kids and the story cliched at times, but the concept was clever and different. Seems like something many Redditors would like.   My neighbor gave me cookies.    *Series. It's singular and plural.   I don't find this is true at all. His books are hit and miss and his most recent books haven't been good at all. I couldn't get through even one Tiffany Aching book.   Absolutely. When I was younger I pretty much only got books by browsing the library shelves, but as I've gotten older, that hasn't worked out for me as well. So now I keep extensive to-read lists.   Though I still love browsing. Looking at the different covers and reading through summaries are great, even if I don't even up taking the books.   It's actually recommended that you don't read right before bed because reading is stimulating -- it makes you think, and thinking can keep you from falling asleep. I have personally found that even a boring book can be stimulating. Once I stopped reading right before bed, I started falling asleep a lot faster.   This news was posted to like four other subreddits ages ago, so why is this the first I'm hearing of it?!?!      This is the original journal article: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3087/full  There must be parts I'm not understanding because I'm not seeing what OP's article says.   I do believe that, with patience and practice, the concepts laid out in these books can be effective and can actually work.  I'll believe it when I see it.    Bret Easton Ellis is known to be a nasty guy so I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't do it.   My old boss used to swear by that book and also Getting To Yes. You know how often he got to yes? Never. Never ever. These sorts of things only work when both parties are there in good faith, that even though the parties don't agree, they're both are interested in resolving the situation. When you're dealing with somebody whose attitude is "my way or the highway" you can build rapport with them until the cows come home, you'll still never get anywhere.   Or just drink tap water.    He's not really dumb, he's just self-centered and disorganized.   The police will look for you. If you don't tell anybody what you're doing, how are they supposed to to know you're alive and okay, not kidnapped or dead?   I don't know where you shop, but it's generally very easy to find plus-size clothing. It's not as easy to find plus-size clothing that doesn't look horrible, but that's been changing.   Because they can't talk.    In the UK a far lower percentage of teens go to college than in the US so there isn't a glut yet. Also in the UK it's much more acceptable for people to do things that don't require a degree. In America, parents aspire for their children to be professionals regardless of whether they're cut out for it or not.   The Pill increases a woman's chance of getting cancer and blood clots. On the more minor side side, many women gain weight on it or get acne. Hormonal birth control is very far from being completely safe and having little to no side effects.   The second video isn't a music video, it's a live performance.  Start reading here:   In his autobiography, Tony Bennett claims to have created "...the first music video" when he was filmed walking along the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London in 1956, with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song "Stranger in Paradise".[8] The clip was sent to UK and US television stations and aired on shows including Dick Clark's American Bandstand.[9]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video#1950s:_Early_music_clips   Here's a site selling them. They don't remotely scream "Jewish" to me: http://www.leelach.com/tichel/sinar-tichel.html   I watched the movie a couple of weeks ago and am currently in middle of the book. It's a very faithful adaptation so it really doesn't matter which you experienced first, and anyway, it's almost always better to watch the movie first.   I'm going in early spring. I'm interested in the arts, hopefully with a local flavor.    I love her for who she is, not because I have to as her mom.  I don't see the problem here. That's exactly how a parent should love their kid -- for who they are. In my opinion people who only love their kid because it's their kid are usually pretty messed up. Having both is ideal, but if you only can have one, I'll choose your way over the other way any time.   At my work, back in the day when they issued paper checks, employees were given an extra 15-minute break on payday in order to go to the bank.   I'm not sure why "most people" in OP's question can't go to the bank during their lunch hour if this extra break isn't a perk they get.   It's been a while since I've read them, but IIRC in Very Bad Deaths and Very Hard Choices by Spider Robinson a character had uncontrollable telepathy and couldn't stand to be around anyone except this one guy. (Not romances.) I didn't like them as much as I wanted to, but I'd generally recommend Spider Robinson so long as you're willing to put up with blatant political preaching.   Thanks!   A bunch of university libraries and the NYPL have it. See if you can get to one of those libraries or if your local library can request it via interlibrary-loan. Unless you want to buy it for upwards of $100.   I've read books with that premise. Maybe not with vampires, but the person who can read everybody's mind except for that one special someone.   Thanks, but I guess I should have specified how is it that they play the game so well? I've played various levels of, say, Angry Birds, like 50 times and I'm lucky to get 1 star and they're getting 3 stars.   ETA: I meant how is it that they play the games so well? I've played a level of say, Angry Birds like 50 times and I'm lucky to get past it with 1 star, forget 3 stars. Sometimes I can't manage 3 stars even when I'm copying the walkthrough.    It's a relatively common phrase/sentiment that's been around way before the Office (started in 2005) and Reddit (started in 2005).   MI5 comes to mind. It's not "the MI5."   Honestly, I don't believe there's any real answer to this aside from "that's just the way we talk," but certainly the answer is not "there needs to be a the." There doesn't *need* to be a "the."   That's not an answer. In America we don't say "the ABC" (American Broadcasting Company).   Yes, 35. And that's one of my problems with the books -- I don't get the feeling that Rowling has any idea what 35-year-old men are actually like.   Too old. Despite the fact that Strike comes across as old and grumpy and decrepit in the books, he's only 35. Dominic West is 45 and looks it.   Weird fonts. Right now I'm reading a book that looks like it came out of a mid-1990s inkjet printer. It's so distracting.   I'd say I read 90% genre fiction. Literary fiction almost always disappoints and I like to take my time with classics, so I tend not to read very many of those types of books.   See if your library has an interlibrary-loan service.   Ha-ha.   "a recessed landscape design element that creates a vertical barrier while preserving views"   People who have trouble backing out of parking spaces usually taking 2-3 times the amount of time than usual.  Can't say I've ever seen this particularly. Though maybe they're being careful. That's a sign of a good driver, not a bad one.  People who insist on yielding to you when it's clear they have the right of way.  Have experienced this all over NYC, nothing to do with wealth or competence. People think they're being polite by yielding.  People who drive well below the speed limit in broad daylight and perfect weather.  Do you live in a city with a lot of old people?  People react much slower whenever the light turns green at intersections.  Yup, you live in a city with a lot of old people.   I hear it everywhere that it had a big influence on today's world.  Where have you heard that? In relation to what?   Da Vinci worked on commission.   Galileo worked in academia.  Wikipedia is your friend.   Yup. I don't think the art linked in the pictures is particularly good. In fact, it barely qualifies as fine art. As far as I can tell it's the artistic equivalent of Muzak -- bland and uninteresting.      What are some things to do in the cities in the evening besides for bars and clubs?   NYC housing market -- Mitchell Lama is mentioned but not public housing?   Me too. It recommended the Monster at the End of This Book. While that's a super book, I'm not sure it follows as a recommendation based on my ratings.  Also, a lot of books I searched for didn't come up. Maybe they would have if I had the ISBN's, but I don't have time for that.    That's right. It's old school sexism. Huge difference between sexism and misogyny.    I had to look at the picture three times before I saw the swastikas.    "Lincoln, sometimes I think I've walked into a Quentin Tarantino move when I'm talking to you."  The Skin Collector by Jeffery Deaver. Not one of this best.   The Book of Raziel the Angel. I found it somewhere and thought it was cool, so I stuck it in my bag and never took it out. It's about two inches square and the print is so small you can barely read it without a magnifying glass.   but don't know enough of the back story to understand how it came about  So that's the thing. The person wasn't necessarily "involuntarily" put there like they were committed to a mental hospital, but more likely were pressured into going most likely because the family didn't want to and/or couldn't afford to take care of them at home.   It's not an old wives' tale, the toothbrush makers do suggest this, but it's really just their way of trying to force you to buy a new toothbrush.   French, German, Dutch.  Laotian, Tagalog, Malay.  So, the answer is that neither of these is a typical ending for either language group, they're just ones you can think off the top of your head.   Sure they do. I once interviewed with an editor of a mystery magazine. I don't remember how it came up but she said they didn't take stories from bestselling authors because they refused to be edited.    Nobody's perfect. I recently watched a news interview from the studio that the station also streamed online. When they went to commercial, the screen was supposed to go blank and the mikes were supposed to cut out, but the first time they went to commercial, the mikes stayed on. They kept talking. I don't think anybody embarrassed themselves, but what they said wasn't really meant for public consumption either.  Point is, the camera and the mikes are controlled separately. You assume that when the camera is off so are the mikes, but obviously it's not always the case and there's no little red dot to show you that the mikes are off.   In many cases, curing a disease would have to entail gene therapy and we're very very far away from that being a typical treatment.   Like anything else that people try to do, learning a language requires a bit of talent. Not everybody has it. So when they hear a foreign sound, they simply aren't able to recreate it. Or they can't hear that they haven't pronounced it correctly -- like being tone deaf and trying to sing.   Also, not everybody learns a foreign language from a native speaker. My French teacher in high school was American and her French accent wasn't that great. So it's not like I had anywhere to learn a French accent from in the first place.   I can't understand that thinking. People I know either enjoy reading or they just don't read. I never knew anybody who felt the need to force themselves to read if they didn't enjoy doing it.   Psalms are always good for when you're feeling bad.   I wouldn't recommend talking to a rabbi regarding serious psychological issues. It has nothing to do with respect for them, that's silly, they're pastoral leaders, it's part of their job to help congregants, but at the same time, if you're have serious issues, unless they're also trained in psychology, I don't think they'd have much to offer to you any more than a close friend would.   Unless you're specifically interested in learning about Judaism and Jewish rituals. Then by all means, go for it.   Not everybody affiliates themselves with a denomination. They just recognize that they were born to Jewish mothers and then don't incorporate a Jewish identity into their lives in any way. Considering that Lisa Bonet and her mother both married non-Jewish men, I'm going to have to go with no denomination.   Why do people who read have to have goals? I mean, what are your TV goals for 2015? What are you music goals for 2015?   It's because if a series is successful, the editors stop editing. They just publish all what the author wrote and particularly when it comes to fantasy series, these authors have a tendency to be wordy.    There's really no way of knowing why it hasn't come out yet. Things were happening behind the scenes that prevented it from being published, that's all that's possible to say. At the moment it's scheduled to be released in July 2015.   HP wasn't good, it was a phenomenon. The next phenomenon will come around sooner or later but you won't be the right age group to appreciate it.   The Percy Jackson series is almost entirely for preteens.  You say that like it's a problem. Not all books are written for teens, you know.   A while back I had this type of dream. I interpreted it to mean that I was going on the Internet too much and was yearning for it like an addict.   Good on you.   It's inappropriate, that's for sure. Considering your friend is 16, family counseling might be better idea than going into foster care.   I could use $1,000 right now, so yes.   I liked Infernal Affairs much better though I kind of got the impression that if I hadn't seen The Departed first, I might not have known what was going on.   Beats me, I thought Viggo was severely miscast.    Not that I particularly disagree with what's already been said, but my grandparents had opaque glass, so clear glass is at least partially just a trend. If you Google "frosted shower glass" you'll see that it's around. It's just not as popular as clear.   The difference is that Santa Claus has its origins in Saint Nicholas, who was a real person. There's nothing to believe there in the first place. It's just a story and everybody who isn't 6 knows that.   No.  This sort of thinking made me want to throw Divergent across the room.   I bought one, but I guess it wasn't good quality because all it did was give me a headache. And honestly I don't feel like spending hundreds of dollars on a lamp.   114 so far. Huh. That's on the low side for me. Though I will definitely finish at least 6 more by year's end. I already posted the best books, so here are my worst:  2.5/5 stars:  - The Monkey's Raincoat by Robert Crais  - Murder on Bamboo Lane by Naomi Hirahara  2/5 stars:  - The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger  - The Death Trade by Jack Higgins   Entirely true, but might be more appropriate to post in /r/writing.   Definitely keep it. It can never hurt to work on yourself to be a stronger, happier, healthier person.   25% or less.   I only wear concealer to cover up the dark circles under my eyes and the occasional spot. Takes a few seconds.   Entirely depends when and where the person died. On someone's doorstep, probably pretty quickly. Under a bridge, not so quickly, especially in the winter.   Einstein's Dreams! Definitely go with that. In terms of readability, it's short and very easy reading, very easy to understand, but it gives you a lot to think about.    I don't use Goodreads, but I just checked a few of the books I've read recently against Amazon's ratings and Goodreads seems slightly more accurate. Not by a lot, but on Amazon, almost every distribution of ratings is the same: A huge amount of 5 star reviews and then fewer and fewer of the rest. While on Goodreads the distributions don't have any kind of pattern.   But I don't really find overall ratings all that helpful anyway. Usually it's the 3-star reviews that have the most objective reviews and you can get 3-star reviews on both sites.   Agreed. He's projecting his own stress, unhappiness and resentment. While I'm unhappy with my work I'm not especially stressed (not a secretary, but still an underling). My bosses on the other hand, are super-stressed. They have high-power, high-pressure jobs and bosses that come down on them harder than anyone ever comes down on me if I mess up. They have a lot more responsibility than I do, and that creates stress.  When I moved into a windowless cubicle it definitely disrupted my sleeping pattern to the extent that it was night for me twice a day. Ever since I started taking Vitamin D about a month ago I've been sleeping better and losing weight without altering anything else in my life.    It is frowned upon.    How is obesity escapism?  Eating in order to drown your feelings is definitely viewed negatively. So is laziness, if it's excessive.  	117
 They never use it because the company purposely clocks them at lower speeds by forcing them to be slower than what they paid for.    Use more tha. One devise at the same time (think a family full of iPhones abd/or laptops), any decent gaming, browsing that loads a page in I see a minute. Etcetera.    Dear AT T:   It's because you fucking suck.    Because motion controls and a mirror world made it different, no naturally, gamers didn't like it.    That still happened. Priest Seto and Atem were rivals in competition. Step was loyal to Atem.    *facepalm*   /r/nosleep. The rules say that the stories must be real. I don't know why the discord posts here say no sleep is full of fiction.    It would use a comma, not a colon or semicolon. the effect is continuous and does not start a chain at any point.   How? Apple said they cannot decrypt the data.   I think burning down some major ISP buildings (at a time when nobody is there of corse) might be what we need to send a fucking message. Let's turn the buildings of ISPs into parking lots. We're better off like that anyway.   Some networks got huge upgrades rolled out... but companies are still using the old technology. They literally refuse to give us better service.   So, because they will no longer be allowed to throttle any data whatsoever, they wont be able to improve their service? BULLSHIT. They're already bleeding money trying to bribe congress to get what they want.  Did i mention Wolf-pac.com?   So, basically, any time priority is opened to a player, PPP takes place to check if anything was triggered. Is this correct?   It depends on the game. Smash bros an amiibo can put a fighter in the game that learns based on the play styles of those who play against it. Mario Kart, the same amiibo could unlock a costume for your mii racer. Some amiibo are not compatible with certain games, but beside that point, a single amiibo can count more than once while a single DLC purchase is a one and done deal.    My best guess is because Enter play didn't see a need for a side-board.   I've been reading up on priority and pre priority processing. I still don't fully get it the way enter play explains it. Could someone explain it in a way that will make a Yugioh player understand?   In yugioh, we have what is called an open game state where turn player has first priority to do something. Non-turn player wait to respond. When an action takes place, the game looks for triggered effects, then for either player to start or continue a chain of effects. If nothing, then the game state goes back to open. If an effect is activated, a chain is built, resolved, then the game goes back to checking for triggered effects.  How does our priority compare in this context?    You're welcome.   The fact that the PS4 and Xbox One have almost identical libraries with little to no true-must-have games on their exclusive line-ups is a big deal. Especially when you look at the Library for the Wii U which has had plenty of exclusives that you simply cannot play anywhere else. The Wii U may not be as powerful on paper, but the games are built around fun instead of built around pushing graphical boundaries.   Seriously, almost anything that is on PS4 or XBox One that isn't exclusive is also for PC, so why even buy one of those consoles when a general computer could run them and be useful for far more than gaming? The Wii U at least has exclusives that aren't just highly rated, but they are fun and widely loved by those who play the games.  You can probably use the great scores that Wii U games have been getting to back up some of your arguments.    I think another idea would be that pressing L + R + Z while hovering over a name would open the controls for that tag. And if you just press Z, it can toggle tap jump. Faster way to access controls. Would definitely save time in the long run.    I stopped after the first paragraph. Couldn't take it seriously.    That would only work for people who have tap jump off with no other custom controls. Also, it cannot be chosen by multiple people  which easily becomes a problem.    Antivirus isn't a big issue. Some people install it just for safe measure. I sometimes install one temporarily just to make sure I'm not spreading windows viruses to my friends.   For the first time on a battery's usage, it is good for the battery to be fully drained, then fully charged without being used. After doing this two or three times, it is pretty safe for the battery to charge and use whenever. Constantly using the battery isn't horrendously bad for it, but constantly turning it on or off or plugging and unplugging a charger could take a toll on the battery life. It's not constant use that takes a toll but constant change in which way the power is flowing to or from the battery.    Nobody is even going to read the post unless it is properly formatted.    I'm not counting on Nintendo actually going through with putting emulators on mobile phones. They probably just want to make sure they can get anybody else who does it to stop by threatening a lawsuit.       I'm willing to go as low as 21.   I'll admit, I'm curious as to how Sonic would turn out if transferred whole-heartedly to Nintendo's methods and staff.   I went on ebay and matched the lowest prices  * Gaia Dragon $8.00 * Star Eater $5.95 * Baxia $3.50 * Blade Armor Ninja $1.36 * Crane Crane $1.00 * Kerykeion $1.63 * 2 Summoner Monk $1.87 each  The total technically comes out to $25.18. But, hell, it's the Christmas Season, and I need to sell soon. How does $23.00 sound for the lot?   If you use a USB loader, make sure you update the code file that the USB loader uses. The launcher will not update that for you.    I think either one would be a good machine. The air is definitely more of a first time buyer kind of thing, but the Pro would be more future proof and have more I/O. And since you plan on playing WOW and using it for school, I think the extra i/o and bit more juice behind it might be much more worth it in the longer run.    Three things  * That's genius * That's Devious * That's awesome!   Memes with typos shouldn't get upvotes.   Just updated it [here](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs).   I felt it would have been fine to just need up the cool-down time on the teleport so teleport - attack isn't so fast as to catch people off guard.   Is thee anything else you can take off my hands? Either for a friend or as trade-bait?   Dude, I seriousely fucking doubt she *only* uses it for email.   When are people going to realize that Black Friday deals happen because they ship crappy , malfunctioning, or ill-built devices to be sold for Black Friday. Manufactures literally stow the shit away so they can make profit from it.  Good stuff isn't cheap.   Cheap stuff isn't good.   If that's a strain on the network, then American companies seriously need some freakin updates. Other countries have better networks than we do at half the price. And somehow, everyone seems to be dodging that fact to make sure American providers get what they want.   I have a Cyber Dragon Deck which I'm taking apart and selling. I really need the money right now as I struggle to find a job and pay college loans.  I'm not leaving the game by any means (I'm using a budget deck right now). I'm moving on to a different deck after Cyber Dragons anyways.  I'll accept reasonable offers on big bundles. I have a few more cards to sell that I will be putting here at a later time.  In the mean time, [Here's a link](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs) to what's for sale. Just ask about price/rarity.  I'm not trading, nor can I buy right now.   [](/paypal)  **[What's for sale?](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)**   If it was an option to move them to the bottom, that'd seem pretty okay.  But, there are things that pop up in certain apps that would intrude on pressing buttons at the bottom which would be a problem.   Seriously, sometimes I wish a Pokemon game would just Bomb so Nintendo would at least consider stopping it. I think we have plenty of Pokemon games. More than enough to satisfy. My friend Dicen plays during all of his free time and still wasn't even half done with X or Y. (Obviously he beat the game, but he hadn't done everything he wanted to do with them.)  It seems like Nintendo depends on this franchise to take in money while they continue to freely risk failure in many other pursuits. At its bare bones, Pokemon is the definition of the same game over and over. It's truly different than any other RPG due to team building and competitive aspects, but there are enough Pikemon games for us to be entertained for years to come. Can they please not release one or even think about announcing one until 2016?   Two movies or three-four episodes of a tv show, there ARE people who do this. We use our devices more than we think.   How much more to I need to cut it? One person on this thread stated he easily hits 700GB each month. How it purposing a 2TB extreme for heavy Internet users insane? Whether it's 400GB over or 1TB over, it's an ugly number that users should not have to pay for because one company insisted we'll love being told how much we can use our internet.   I did the math for this.   Let me just start off that nobody will be constantly clicking links for a full 30 month day. Take into account that we spend 1/3 of our lives asleep. That's shortens it to 20 days (480 hours, 28,800 minutes, 1,728,000 seconds) which accounts for 10.8 million megabytes. That's about 10,800 Gigabytes. Now, if that's from one device from one person who also spends half of his awake time away at a job, that cuts it to 5,400GB. Now let's say he only spends half of his home time clicking links (and keeping the line busy). That's down to 2,700GB. I've cut it time after time after time.   Shoot, far over the 300GB cap that Comcast insists that we will love and I've made some generous deductions. And, by OP's overage fees, that's 48 fees equating to $480 just to use internet how we've always been using it.  TL:DR, average person watching a few movies on Netflix every day, surfing the web now and then, and doing the occasional download could easily take a terabyte in less than a month.   I did the math accounting for sleep time and a 9-5 job. It still comes around to about 5 terabytes of data usage if you're always on the internet at home. That's just one person. Obviously homes that make constant use of streaming services or have multiple people with multiple devices could get a a lot higher.   From my own comment:   Let me just start off that nobody will be constantly clicking links for a full 30 month day. Take into account that we spend 1/3 of our lives asleep. That's shortens it to 20 days (480 hours, 28,800 minutes, 1,728,000 seconds) which accounts for 10.8 million megabytes. That's about 10,800 Gigabytes.

And, by OP's overage fees, that's 48 fees equating to $480 just to use internet how we've always been using it.  Assuming sleep time and a 9-5 job, that's 8 hours at home using the network. We'll also assume it's in constant use at full potential. That's 1,440,000 megabits per day, divide by 8 for megabytes which is 180,000 megabytes per day. Multiply that by 30 days for 5.4 million megabytes or 5,400 gigabytes. That's 18x the cap that Comcasts assume you'll love. I could understand a 5,000 gigabyte cap, but not a miserable 300.   Let me just start off that nobody will be constantly clicking links for a full 30 month day. Take into account that we spend 1/3 of our lives asleep.

Because of that, AT T will only offer them up to 6mbps. And they were capped at 80GB for the month. But, they also had the option to remove the cap... by signing up for the business plan for almost twice as much with no speed increase.  How the fuck is this legal?  Internet should be just internet. Shouldn't have to pay to be faster. It isn't like service providers build all of these websites and upgrade/maintain the servers for all of these sites. They just give us access to wires and tubes. Why should we be charged so much for that?  After all, I don't have to pay extra just to use LTE on my phone. If my phone has LTE, god dammit, it will use LTE. The provider never throttles my speed just because I don't pay for it. For fuck's sake, it's purely based on usage. And it's because they're pretty much forced to treat my data as only data, not data moving at a certain speed.   "None of my business" states a few dodgy facts.  "that's just my opinion" obviously is about someone opinion about an observation.  Similar, Yes. Ripoff, No.   I might just employ you to make an 'add-on' for my custom build. I wouldn't feel like going through all this.   Amusing yes. Still, a business card shouldn't abbreviate what the person's title is unless the abbreviation is widely known. I can't think of any right now. Maybe it's just me because I work in visual communications. (Notice, I didn't abbreviate it to viscom like some of my peers insist on doing.)   **Quick-Compose**. A button in notification center or control center that allows you to choose recipients, then compose a message to them and send it without opening the messages app. As it stands right now, you need an "unread" message from someone you want to send a message to just to start a quick-compose.  **Rebindable buttons** on the bottom row of Control Center. Seriously, not everyone uses calculator, camera, or clock more than any other apps. Saying that we do when we know we don't kind of sucks. I mean, it's a phone. Wouldn't messages and phone app make sense there?  **Safari Search**. Why can we still not search for a word on a page on our mobile phones? If you're at the top of the page, it could be as simple as pulling the page down to reveal a search bar. Enter what you want to find, then have a list of matches pop up.  **Hide apps**. We all have those apps we don't want to see. If we hit that (X) on a default app, it should ask if we want to "hide" the app. Then, if we need it later, it can be unhidden using the settings.  **Nested Folders**. Users can handle it. I guarantee it.  And for Apple to **STOP INSISTING THAT TRANSLUCENCY MAKES FLAT DESIGN 'GOOD' BY DEFAULT**. By god, I can't stand so many parts in iOS 7+ and the new OS X because of their fucking indulgence in translucency like it's free candy.   Step 1: Download Netflix (with this feature)  Step 2: Jailbreak phone  Step 3: Download movie to offline queue  Step 4: Transfer movie file from phone to computer  Step 5: repeat steps 3 and 4.  Step 6: ???  Step 7: Eat a cookie   Just don't put the acronym on the card. Spell it out. This will allow more people to easily know who you are and those who point it out are likely too immature to be worth your time.   I was probably going to do my own version of the announcer. So if anybody likes it, I volunteer.   What did they expect? They launched it too many months after it's other versions. MONTHS after the other versions. This coming from the scumbag company that thought Raymand Legends should be released on all platforms at the same time.  * The hype already died * Everyone already thought the game was terrible * This was the last version to be released * The DLC allegedly wasn't coming to this port  Ubisoft was great up until the 8th generation. Now they're nothing more than another scumbag game developer.   I'm hoping they can fix a problem I'm having. Every time I open Safari or Youtube, it feels the need to tell me that Cellular data cannot be used with the app and I can change it in settings. Even if I'm on Wifi, it feels the f *(ing need to tell me this. And I don't have the option to turn these alerts off.  If anyone knows what I'm talking about, make sure to log this complaint as well.   Smash.   Yes it is. It was pretty much doomed to be that way. This is the first mobile OS apple made that allowed apps to talk to each other and use each other. Not to mention, they just added so darn much to the inner workings of this thing. And it pretty much supported more devices than any iOS before it. Especially all of the features that are dependent on communication with other apps and/or devices.  Yeah, I'm a little down that safari crashes more often that it used to (not like I should be browsing that much on my phone anyway). I'm also a little bummed that airplay or airdrop simply don't see other devices with these enabled sometimes. Such a shame. I'm also disappointed that the wifi simply cuts out sometimes in places where it didn't before iOS 8.  Nevertheless, the least we can do to help is go to Apple's feedback page and leave feeedback. Don't sit here complaining fruitlessly if you have an issue. Report everything to Apple. They need to hear the same complaints over and over from different users so they know that each issue IS an actual issue.   The subject of the speech is about feeling like an outcast. The people that pay me prevent me from saying too much since I can't risk giving away the entire lecture. But, it has to do with my life story being more relocatable to others' lives than they really think. I start with turning "everyone's unique" into a double edge sword.  Sometimes I second-guess my own lectures and life seeing how ending up about as alone as a person can get isn't exactly relate-able to the entire human population. Especially because hardly anyone else just happened to meet a girl who was pregnant with four kids. I haven't met a single other person whose even started dating a girl who just happened to be pregnant with one child, let alone four.   My name is Blaine. Well, I have my next motivation speech in just a few days and I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle it. I want to just dump the script and leave all my thoughts and feelings on random strangers, but I'm not sure what good that will do.  My mom passed away about a month ago leaving half of her money and property to me and the other half to my younger sister. I gave half of my half to my younger sister since she definitely needs it more than I do. I thought that before my ex-girlfriend, Winter, broke up with me a week later. She says she didn't fall out of love with me, but that she realized she only ever loved what I did for her.  My friend Luke just broke up with his girlfriend too. Although, for them, it was a clean break. They agreed that they were going different ways and decided to break it off. And now, he's moving to New York to seek a career playing brass instruments live for plays. Good for him.  I would have started this AMA sooner had I not been in tears last night. I was simply too emotional to care.  I hope I don't look like I'm dumping my entire agenda on you. I just need to get out these feelings so they don't come out during my job.   Sure, Google, Youtube, and Netflix may be able to afford fastlanes since they make a lot of money. But, there are many sights that run out of their owner's pocket or by visitor support. So if you frequently visit those sights that cannot afford to use Comcast's or Verizon's "fast lanes", then there'd be no point in paying for high-speed internet since everything would run at the throttled speed Comcast or Verizon would want them to run at.  And that is a load of bullshit.  P.S. My dad has a business of selling his own original spice blends online. He'll NEVER be able to afford internet fast-lanes. But if Comcast or Verizon want to throttle his website to 1mbps because he can't pay up, nobody would ever find it reasonable to buy from him due to how slowly his sight would load.                  Will replays work?  Seriously, that would be the best thing evar!!!      Yes, we all have our custom builds and what-not, but lets be mindful to what vanilla 3.5 will have to offer. I feel like we can never truly appreciate what the PMDT went through and especially what they put into the look and feel of each aesthetic change unless we take just an hour or two to play the mod without any of our arbitrary changes.  By the way, you can all expect my custom build in January. My friends and I (along with feedback from my previous builds) will be working hard on it once we've truly enjoyed this new taste of PM.      Mr Krabs has let Spongebob use Krabs's bank card, so they definitely exist. But not used at the Krusty Krab.         Is Apple trying to tell us they don't want feedback? Take a look at [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3i2vSMn.png). I was trying to submit feedback to apple. I even read their policy on unsolicited ideas like they asked and found the submit page again. Still, there seems to be no sign of a submit button anywhere.  This is a real problem. iOS 8 has bugs and users have feedback, but it seems Apple simply doesn't want to hear it.  [Link to Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3i2vSMn.png)  [Link to page](https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html)         (Names have been changed to protect the innocent)  So, a short while ago I received two notes on my apartment door. One was from the apartment staff telling my (former) roommate and I that the keys and electronics were stolen from the office and that they would replace everything including the locks. After my lock was replaced, we got another note on our door that said "try again". This was was hand-written. After that, I replaced the lock myself with my own lock and installed a latch lock as well. While on skype with a potential roommate a few days later, I noticed a draft I did not make in my email account that also said "try again".  My old roommate just moved out yesterday into his girlfriend's house. Lucky him, he has someone else to move in with. He admitted that the notes we received taped to our door both spooked him and made him fear for his stuff. Yeah, his stuff. He doesn't want his stuff to be stolen. That's his biggest concern. While he was packing up yesterday morning with his girlfriend, I begged them to move quickly since I had a potential roommate to interview later. I was busy calling the apartment staff to get him off the lease since he failed to do it before-hand when it should have been his responsibility. Again, I got a lot of back-talk from the staff. This time I was accused of trying to lower the rent a week before rent is due. They didn't notice that rent is over 12 days away, plenty of days over a week.  Other long story short, he tried to take my 42" flat-screen with him that I had payed for. He was yelling and acting as if he was going to take a swing at me. Thank my lucky stars he didn't. He left bitching and screaming about how I was too cheap to buy my own TV. Yes, he's one of those guys, and I'm fucking glad he's moving out now.  Eric, my new potential roommate, arrived plenty after the other guy was done moving out. Another lucky break. After he was done apologizing for being late I had to tell him it was actually very fortunate. So, first I got his permission to record the interview so I can look back and review it later. He agreed. I took the time to transcribe the interview. Here it is for you guys:  ---  **Me:** So, let's start first with something important.  **Eric:** Okay.  **Me:** How soon can you move in?  **Eric:** (slight groan)  **Me:** No rush or anything, It's just that rent is due in just under two weeks and I can take a lot of it, but I can't handle it all.  **Eric:** It's not a big deal. I've been looking to move out for a while, as soon as possible actually. I had a few other people ask me, but they later decided their girlfriend, boyfriend, or who the fuck ever was more important.  **Me:** I understand that. So what are some things you'll be up to if you move in?  **Eric:** Other than work, I'll mostly just be playing music and video games. Maybe invite a friend over every once in a while.  **Me:** Just to let you know, if you're going to do anything sexual just keep it to yourself or make sure I'm going to be out-  **Eric:** Oh no, you don't have to worry about that. I don't have a girlfriend or anything. I don't even want to get married, like, ever, dude.  **Me:** Oh, of course, but some people just like to pair up and do whatever.  **Eric:** Oh, you're talking about swinger people, I get ya.  **Me:** It's whatever, don't worry about it.  **Eric:** Yeah, most people don't like hearing that I don't want a relationship.  **Me:** How come?  **Eric:** Everyone wants me to have someone to keep me out of the house or a reason to move out when I want or some other bullshit reason. I just want to enjoy life alone, really. I'm not working on getting a girlfriend just to move out, and I don't need a house. A house is for families.  **Me:** I've never actually heard that logic before.  **Eric:** What logic?  **Me:** Houses are for families, because a lot of people dream of owning a house just for the space.  **Eric:** How much space does one person need? A room and a kitchen, that's it.  **Me:** Cool. So, you said on skype that you like loud rock music. What sort of bands would you be-  **Eric:** Oh, the greats. You know, like: The Beetles; Jimmy Hendrix; Joe Satriani; bit of Coldplay here and there. And I know most people hate them, but a hint of Nickelback every so often.  **Me:** Eh, I don't think they're that bad.   **Eric:** Oh, wonderful.  **Me:** Just keep in mind, these are apartments. So, after dark, keep it quiet.  **Eric:** Oh of course, last thing I need is to be kicked out and live like a homeless fuck, ya-know?  **Me:** Don't let the friends of homeless here you on that, they might take offense to that.  **Eric:** Oh, I'm sorry, was that over the line?  **Me:** Not for me, just be respectful while you're here.  **Eric:** Oh, question?  **Me:** Shoot.  **Eric:** Is the pool here free of charge?  **Me:** Yeah, you just need a key. I never use the pool, so I don't know how good it is, how deep it is, I've never looked.  **Eric:** That's not a problem.  **Me:** Any more questions you have for me?  **Eric:** Ummmm, hmm (Long pause). Would you be cool with me moving in this weekend?  **Me:** If that's how it has to be, then fine. I can't guarantee anything though.  **Eric:** Perfectly understandable.  ---  After that, we got up, shook hands, and he left (but not without offering to take me out for a drink). I cannot wrap my head around this guy. Whether he was trying his hardest to impress or not, the "too good to be true" regime kept my heart pounding. I kept waiting for him to say something suspicious, or even "try again". I was tempted to bring it up, but if he really was anything to worry about, it may have set him off and put me in more danger.  I think I'll let him move in at least on a trial basis. I searched my apartment this morning for anything suspicious or anything missing. Nothing seemed particularly wrong until I saw that the latch wasn't.. well, latched. I couldn't remember if I had locked it up or not before I went to bed. The other lock was still locked, but that couldn't really indicate anything. After doing a second inspection of the apartment, I continued not to find anything.  I have my email open right now so I can email Eric. The draft is gone. I deleted it, and it hasn't come back. I'm worried about if I'm even going to be able to sleep tonight.  If anyone has any thoughts on this interview or something that could help me sleep, that would be wonderful. I really just need to talk to a few more sane people.   Okay, two points to make off the top:  1. Yes this is a fun deck  2. I still want this deck to be as good as it can be  This is why I'm here.  I've been working on this experiment for a bit over a format's time. It's held up pretty well to many modern decks.  I'm willing to spend as much time as necessary to complete this deck since my Cyber Dragons are done outside of a Foolish Burial. Now for the cards.  ---  **Monsters** (25)  * 3 Hazy Flame Hydra * 3 Hazy Flame Cerberus * 3 Hazy Flame Peryton * 3 Swap Frog * 3 Treeborn Frog * 2 Ronintoadin  Here is the core. 3 Hydra keeps Peryton - Solda plays as live as possible. This keeps drawing 1 Peryton and 1 Hydra from being a problem. Odly enough, I don't feel that Hazy filled hands are dead since Cerbereus can be used to float itself and other Hazies out of the deck. Just one frog is enough to get this going since Swap Frog puts Treeborn in the grave, Treeborn dying puts Treeborn in the Grave, and Ronin has a big defensive butt.  * 3 Battle Fader * 1 Gorz, the Emissary of Darkness  Two points to these. First one is to stall. The other one is to give me something to tribute for a Hazy Flame.  * 2 Maxx "C" * 2 Effect Veiler  Very good hand traps. Not sure about veilers lately. Maxx "C" is a double for stall and drawing. This deck needs to draw. Veiler helps handle my opponent's monster effects on their turn. Breakthrough Skill wasn't quite usable in this deck.  **Spells** (15)  * 3 Upstart Goblin  This decks needs to draw  * 2 Mystical Space Typhoon * 2 Forbidden Lance  A good amount of back-row hate/protection without clogging up so bad that I cannot start my combos.  * 3 Enemy Controller  Paired with Treeborn Frog, I can take my opponent's monsters to use as I please.  * 2 Soul Exchange  Tribute my opponent's monsters for my many monsters I can tribute summon. Huge drawback is no battle phase. Not too much better than Soul Charge when you think about it. Tributing my opponent's problem monsters is sometimes the best way to get rid of them. Soul Charge cannot do that.  * 2 Creature Swap  Major troll card. I love using this to exchange my little Treeborn Frog for my opponent's lone beater. And it's for keeps too.  * 1 Rekindling  Ironically incredible in this deck. Even at first turn, Peryton and Cerbereus put in the work to dump Rekindling fodder into the Graveyard.  **Extra Deck** (11 Xyz, 4 Synchro)  * 2 Slacker Magician * 1 Gachi Gachi Gantetsu  These are pretty good stall cards. As well, Gachi can boost my already big monsters to even bigger. Even brings Hydra to 2700 which is enough to beat over an Ophion. Yes, I've done it before.  * 1 Daigusto Phoenix  Can attack twice or allow Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger to attack twice. Either way, a valuable asset to have and is very easy to make.  * 3 Hazy Flame Basiltrice  Didn't you read the core of the deck? You don't just run Hazy Flames and not run at least two of these. Two of them are often delt with easily since not all Basiltrice's have 5 Materials. But when one's in the Grave and you use Hydras to Xyz summon, you can attach some basiltrice to your Xyz monster.  * 2 Evolzar Solda  In a way, this is my Vanity's Emptiness. This deck absolutely lost to my friend's Gladiator Beasts until I finally got a hold of a physical copy of this card. Damn was Ren so goddamn mad that he couldn't deal with this card. He couldn't keep a Gladiator beast on the board long enough.  * 1 Constellar Ptolemy M7  Not only putting my girlfriend's gift to me to work, but is stupid use for those monsters who "cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects." I'm looking at you, beelze.  * 1 Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger  For those pesky defense position monsters trying to protect those lifepoints that I want to destroy oh so much. Paired with Daigusto Phoenix, this card can be pretty darn useful. Especially when any of my Xyz monsters run out of material (heaven forbid).  * 1 Formula Synchron  The deck needs to draw  * 1 Black Rose Dragon  Awesome Field Wiping Ability  * 1 Stardust Dragon  Decent Protection  * 1 Scrap Dragon  Pair this with that Treeborn frog that just keeps coming back for hilarity. Not to mention, choose your targets, then chain Enemy Controller to deal with 2 of your opponent's cards at once.  ---  I love my Hazy Flames. And I really love Hydra. I really love being able to use my collection and showing off what they can do. And this is hands down the most consistent build I've ever come up with. I no longer lose to that oh so common MST destroying a Hazy Pillar. Hazy Pillar is temporary, but Treeborn frog is practically forever.  I just feel that this has room for improvement. So help me with this experiment.   In case you haven't already heard, after my apartments having their keys stolen and having to replace the locks, I received a handwritten note scotch taped to my door saying "try again".  For those of you who don't know (long story short), this is what the first letter from the apartments said:   At some time after 1:00pm on Monday, the... office was broken into. Computers, monitors, and phones were stolen. Also taken were some of the apartment keys. The good news is that all keys are on a key tracking system and none of the keys have actual apartment numbers on them.   We are telling you this so you can be extra cautious and if you see any unusual activity, please dial 911. Additionally, we will have extended ours for our courtesy patrol.   That being said we are implementing a new key system and will be installing brand new apartment locks as well as new mailbox locks. This project will begin on Wednesday.  That note was stuck to the door with two pieces of duct tape like the apartment staff always does. But the handwritten "try again" note was attached with scotch tape.  ---  Thanks to suggestions from the /r/nosleep community, I was doing well to feel safer. My apartment complex didn't want me changing the locks to the front door because they have their keys on a system and they would need to be able to get in if I moved out. I thought it was complete crap and stated again that I was being targeted by someone or something, and they dismissed it. One lady even accused me of making the whole thing up.  I changed the locks anyways. I also installed a latch. I have the only key. My roommate couldn't care less since he's home all the time lately. A different long story short: he lost his job and he is planning to move in with his girlfriend next month.  Now I've been looking for a new roommate. I'm hesitant to invite anyone in given that I have no idea who could have left the note or why they even left the note in the first place. I'm still hoping someone will surprise me on live TV telling me it was all a prank. (Right, a harmless prank that cost me roughly 50 dollars is new locks, 30 minutes of installation time, and many nights of sleep.)  For the past few days, I've been emailing my friends, family, employer, anyone I can think of about my situation and need for a roommate that could pay his end of the rent next month.  One seemingly trustworthy person has contacted me for a roommate interview which will be tomorrow. We chatted over Skype the past three days and he seems like an okay guy. He's roughly my height with a beard, likes action movies, and loud rock music as far as I've heard from him so far. He even promised to keep the music down or use headphones when I'm home.  After we set up the meeting, I wanted to email him directions to the place. I had one tab open with google maps and one tab open with my email. Between switching tabs to grab directions, the number of drafts I had went from zero to one. That's right, I was looking at my email tab which had 0 drafts, and after looking at the google maps tab and heading back over, the number of drafts went to 1. This was bizarre.  Quick gmail tip, Gmail automatically saves a newly started email as a draft, but not until a few moments after you opened it. I didn't have compose new email window open yet, but somehow I had a draft.  The draft had no recipients and said "try again".   So here's the rule:  * If you Special Summon a monster, it cannot attack that turn unless it is an Xyz, Synchro, or Fusion Monster.   Let me give you an example of *that* guy.  I have a co-player at my locals who also happens to be a vendor worker at Frank and Sons. Translated, he thinks he can get away with vendor pricing while he himself is a customer. Most he would pay me for a Wiretap or Breakthrough Skill is $2. Why? Because he buys them for $2 while he's working at Frank and Sons. When I pulled a Dracossack from a tin, he was trying to get it from me for less than $15 (trades or cash, doesn't matter, makes no difference to him.) I just don't see how he would value my freshly pulled card for half of what he would value it at if it were his.  I respect that he is a vendor, but while he is at locals, he doesn't work for the card shop nor is his own shop even open.  Is it really fair for him to expect people to put up with this? Or should he cut the bullshit and act like a customer like the rest of us there?  So what person at locals do you have that's "that guy".   We all cancel, learn to live without internet for a few weeks (or just tether onto our phones which may even be cheaper), and they all tumble down and are forced to be fair. Too bad we're all too dependent on the Internet (myself included) to be able to do this.   Seriously, this should be a fucking default. This could be the funniest and most random subreddit ever.  Poodles are also stupid as fuck, just saying.      I am hoping to get some inexpensive samples from Delano. I'm strongly considering them as the manufacturer. If I do get samples, I'll have concrete game pieces to use to demonstrate the game in a proper "How To Play" explanation video.  Keep your fingers crossed.      I made this mat with this image for a friend. I had to remove a lot of big lettering but decided to keep the letters saying Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack. Also, I put a Big-Eye in the reflection of Dracossack's eye and branded the Dracossack making it personal for him.  The picture ended up being very small, and John wanted a border around it, so I quickly put in a sloppy metal-and-bolts border. He's not going to be too picky. It was partly to keep the image small enough to that the quality wouldn't be completely shot.  Note: I misplaced an eyebrow and blurred the name to make using this for yourself a hassle.

I had quotes for 500, 1500, 2500, and 5000 cards. This would equate to anywhere from 10 to 108 starter decks. That's not a lot, but it still costs quite a pretty penny. Here's what the numbers look like  | Quantity | Cost | |----:|:-------------| | 500 | $4,050 | | 1500 | $5,025 | | 2500 | $6,219 | | 5000 | $7,913 |  Hardly seems worth the money we might put into it. But, here's the kicker. This is quantity per deck. After other costs, I'm told that production would equate to around $3 per deck. Here is what they had to say:   This price does not include shipping of the product or proofs, storage and/or fulfillment, or costs related due to changes in the art or product specifications. Industry standard overrun is 10% of the total ordered. Shipping costs, overruns and any other fees will be invoiced once production is complete. (Shipping is invoiced separately after DeLano Service is billed by the shipping company).  **This is difficult**  I am still in touch with the manufacturer hoping they can help me crush more numbers.. I'll keep you updated.      I have French lances, and I would love to get more French cards, especially in halo. Mega-tin seems like a good way to do this. Any way I can get one for a reasonable price?  EDIT: I live in the USA.  EDIT: SOLVED; ebay.fr      **Apologies**  I am extremely sorry that I have not been able to set up users lately. I will get to them later today. If in a few days you set up a thread but still do not have flair or a link on the list of traders, then PM me with the link to your feedback thread.  **Update**  I believe I am caught up in setting up and updating feedback threads. If I didn't set you up, it is because there is one or more problems with the feedback thread. I will have alerted any users of these problems. Just set up a new thread and this time, read all of the instructions and follow them correctly.  **Please read before setting up**  [Rules and Regulations V3 - READ BEFORE SUBMITTING](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOFeedback/comments/20dtie/rules_and_regulations_v3_read_before_submitting/)   So we've all seen that "balance a card you think is OP" post. Let's do something a bit different. Take those cards that you have all the goddamn salt in the world for and obliterate them. Or change them suddenly. You can give Change of Heart an effect where your opponent gains a token if you want. I really don't care.  LET THE SALT RUN FREE!   Restricting cards is a diverse topic and one we haven't spent much time discussing. We are 0% sure what we are going to do with this. My team often doesn't see themselves as a part of creating the game even though I've tried to make them feel like co-creators or co-handlers of the game. So, I'm looking deeply for feedback. Keep in mind that we may test any of these out at any given time.  **Restrictions**  Default card limits have been at two, four, and three. I even once had a system where characters were limited to four and items were limited to two. At that time, the way items worked was pretty game-breaking. Yet again, that was also a time when items could be picked up on the field and cards had/used up to 4 slots. (The game also had a rank-up system, but I won't go into that.)  Now, the limit for any card in the deck is at 5. This means that with a 45 card deck and a commander, you will have at least 10 different cards. The main deck can be made up of 5 copies each of 9 different cards. The 10th card comes from the commander. This partially came from rushing out test decks. It ended up being a good system, although in the future, we may bring it down to 4 if we feel the desire for more diverse decks or if interested parties show a demand.  Commanders are strictly limited to existing only in the commander position (stacked on top of the Life Pile). Despite being a type of character, commanders will never be allowed in the main deck. *Note: Commanders are allowed to be changed between games. I will cover this more in the rules as the develop.*  **Artificial Restrictions**  There are a few options we could do here. The first list of options is assuming the default limit for any card (outside of commanders) is 5.  * Option 1: Have 6 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The default limit remains at 5 for cards without these restrictions.  * Option 2: Have 4 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, or 3. The default limit remains at 5 for cards without these restrictions.  * Option 3: Either a card is banned or it isn't.  This second list of options is assuming the default limit for any card (outside of commanders) is 4.  * Option 1: Have 5 levels of restrictions. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0, 1, 2, or 3. The default limit remains at 4 for cards without these restrictions.  * Option 2: Have 3 levels of restriction. In this plan, a card may be artificially restricted to 0 or 2. The default limit remains at 4 for cards without these restrictions.  * Option 3: Either a card is banned or it isn't.  **Notes**  Of course, any players picking it up without tournament play in mind can play however they want. We don't intend on limiting anything for casual play that disregards tournament regulation. Reason: It's impossible. Players will end up playing how they want to play and we have no problem with them having fun.  **Feedback**  Please tell us which of these options is most appealing to you. This will help us finish up the planning for our first starter decks.      **Card games... they have their qwircks**  In all honesty... we don't have any definite plans since we are still pursuing the right manufacturer. I will depend on their capabilities combined with out designs and ideas. But, the topic has been brought up among the team (by me, admittedly) that the games will never be 100% balanced unless every player had access to any card they wanted. And, as time goes on, creating more and more cards would just upset any balances previously put into place.  I say "good". We never intended this to be 100% balanced. Chance is going to take place on and off the battlefield. I have recently started watching a series on the science of good and bad elements in gaming and came across [this very good explanation on the effect of chance in competitive games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9ZI9kMsvRQ). Yes, it talks mainly about e-sports and video games, but it applies fully for trading card games as well. We're not going to be able to completely take out the random factors in the game. Not unless we can let you choose what card you draw each turn which simply wouldn't be healthy for any TCG.  To set up an example, when I was playing Yugioh on Duelingnetwork.com a few days ago, I came across a situation where I had 1 card in my hand that would allow me to win as long as I drew a Spell Card. That's exactly what I did. But, would I have won without that chance? the chance would have fallen to near 0 for most other possibilities. These situations are hard to control, and we have no interest in drawing from these experiences to influence our card design.  There are factors we can control and have interest in controlling. In Magic: The Gathering, there are over 200 possible cards you can receive from a core set. In Yugioh, sets range from 100 to 300 cards. Most sets are 99 cards. They even take it a step further in making many cards hard to get. In MTG, you may find it hard to come by a card you need if it's a mythic rare. In Yugioh, the same applies to secret rare, ultimate rare, and ghost rare. These drive up prices for a lot of these cards putting skilled, yet poorer, contestants at a disadvantage.  **So what do we plan to do about this?**  Well, one thing We've decided to do is lower the set amounts. We're not interested in bulking out 100 card sets multiple times a year with little opportunity for re-prints in the future. We think 80 is a reasonable number to keep sets minimal but somewhat profitable. Please understand that without profit, this game would fail. Some cards will be more rare than others, but these will likely be key cards and commanders that make some decks work.  But, what about reprints for those who cannot afford the first print? I myself am not a fan of that. After waiting months for Constellar Ptolemy M7 (Yugioh Card) to become affordable again, I finally got a hold of a key component of one of my decks. It felt good. The poor players with patients should be rewarded. I know many Yugioh players are still waiting for Evilswarm Exciton Knight to be less than 60 dollars to purchase reasonable. 60 dollars. That's the price of a modern video game (or a very rare retro video game).  To keep that price cap, we may occasionally release sets that simply aim to control costs of absurdly expensive cards. Especially cards we might not be printing any more.  Keep in mind that these plans are not set in stone. We still want to see how many cards we want in each pack. 8 seems likely, but again, it may not be up to us.  **Feedback is Welcome**  *I'll be continuing to make these posts so long as I have something to talk about. Please be sure to ask questions and leave feedback and suggestions.*   **Our goal for balance**  We've studied other card games to see how balance is handled. What we concluded is that we couldn't exactly conclude anything. All of these other games (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, Cardfight Vanguard, My Little Pony CCG, etc.) seemed to have their guidelines change for what is balanced and healthy for the game over time.  So we are not aiming for an environment that is inherently perfectly balanced: Instead, we're aiming for the same asymmetrical aspects of the game that keep all other TCGs fun. However, we still want to keep every deck playable and fun for each player that decides to play them.  Yes, there will definitely be intentional imbalances between decks. This shouldn't come from one deck simply having better tools and statistics but from certain decks having tools that counteract other parts of the game.  **Guidelines for creating cards**  Each of these guidelines will be tested and adjusted and even disobeyed on a card-by-card or a deck-by-deck basis. These are just some of the guidelines that we have come up with to keep anything from starting out over-powered.  * Nothing is free. Everything that could give the player some sort of advantage should come at some sort of cost to keep anything from being abusable. This hopefully will emphesize a pro-con style of thinking in each turn from the beginning to end of each game. * Decks should never become too fast without a price. Pretty simply, if a deck becomes too fast in testing, we may weaken some characters or nerf a deck's commander(s) to balance something out. * Commanders are used as come-back tools, not game-breaking tools. In this aspect, if a leader ever becomes game-breaking, we will try to take away what makes it game-breaking. But if it would would require too much, we may simply ban the commander from play and design a new one that is more balanced for that deck. * Slots: This was one of the very first things we decided on. We wanted all characters to be useful. More powerful items require more slots, so we restricted them to being used by characters who have less inherent fire-power. Therefore, any character with a trait other than "Normal", or any character with an effect will have only 1 slot. The only exception to this are commanders who will always have 3 slots. Characters with 2 slots will always have a trait of "Normal" with no effect. *Note: Thanks to this, we always do out best to make sure that whatever effect or trait is given to a character makes that effect or trait worth while to the player.*  **Feedback**  These are just a few things that we will be doing to make sure this game is completely fun for everyone. Picking up weaker decks (as long as they are well constructed) shouldn't be a chore or burden but feel more like a challenge. I have been testing with weaker decks letting my opponent use the stronger decks. And the mechanics have proven to reenforce the balance of the game.  If you have any suggestions, questions, or concerns, please post about them here. I'll be trying to post often about what we're doing.   **You can view the wiki [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HuntForGems/wiki/)**  This wiki includes the following links on how to play:  * [Characters](http://www.reddit.com/r/HuntForGems/wiki/characters) * [Items](http://www.reddit.com/r/HuntForGems/wiki/items) * [Field](http://www.reddit.com/r/HuntForGems/wiki/field) * [Turns](http://www.reddit.com/r/HuntForGems/wiki/turns)  If anything is unclear about how to play the game, please ask questions here. The goal of this is to help us making this game as clear as possible.      I run a self.post only subreddit which strictly forbids linking to ebay for sales outside of our ebay thread. I have tried to automatically remove posts with "ebay.com" in the content, but if it's linked [using this method](http://www.reddit.com), automoderator completely skips over it.  I can't remove posts that simply mention ebay because users are constantly messaging me that their posts are removed because they said something like "I sell 10% off ebay's lowest price".  **If this is already possible, someone please make it clear how to do it. I looked in Automods guides and didn't find a fucking thing. To be honest, it doesn't make very much clear for novice users.**   [remove this post](http://www.ebay.com)   In /r/ygosales, it would be nice if I could have the audomoderator do two things for me.  1. When a post reaches 10 minutes old, if it doesn't have flair, comment on the post "Your post does not have flair. Please add flair to your post."  2. When a post reaches 10 minutes old, if it doesn't have flair, remove the post and message the user, "Your post has been removed because you did not assign flair within the time span allowed. If you cannot assign flair, visit the desktop version of the site."  PLUS: THERE NEEDS TO BE A SIMPLE PAGE EXPLAINING HOW TO WRITE AN EXPRESSION. The guides seem to leave the users to figure it out based on examples.   My friend H2Overdrive picked up ice clovers and has pretty much mastered ~~f-throw~~ down-throw dair re-grab to a point where he can carry me across the stage and fair me to death. I really don't know how the hell to get out of it. It makes his climbers unfair to play against. I can't learn the matchup if his character doesn't let me play.  My Main is Ness, and the PK shenanigans are turning out to not be enough. Even my Pit (who is surpassing my Ness if you ask my other smash buddies) is finding this to be a stupidly frustrating matchup.  All of a sudden, I decided to screw around and challenge his climbers with Yoshi; A character I never thought I would pick up. But his climbers became easier to get off the edge and convert to a KO. What the hell?  So in other news:  * Any Yoshi tips? * What can I do to avoid getting carried to my death by ICs?  EDIT: Downvote hell hu? I thought admitting what I don't know and asking for help would garner some discussion. Guess people just hate me.   Please do not use abbreviations unless you have explicitly described in the post what that abbreviation means. They are a pain to everyone who doesn't know what they mean. Even with MST (Mystical Space Typhoon), probably the most known abbreviation in Yu-Gi-Oh!, not everyone automatically knows what it means.  **TL:DR** Spell out your cards' names.   Shadolls can kiss my ass. On the bright side, no more drawing on first turn!   There's a subreddit where you can complain about anything you want all day and nobody can tell you to stop complaining.  I think everyone should give it a gander. It's called /r/complainaboutanything and there really are no rules as long as your complaining about something and you're not hurting anyone else.   I wanted to address the differences in the rules that are enforced here and on YGOBinders. And there's one big difference that has raised a bit of confusion. So let me clear it up.  **YGOSales is a much different subreddit than YGOBinders**  YGOSales is purely for buying and selling to get or get rid of Yu-Gi-Oh! merchandise. Whether it's cards, manga, DVDs, duel disks, even top-loaders. Sales get huge. Listings here go for up to 300 or even 500 dollars with users trying to sell decks. (These are removed due to exceeding the $80 price cap.)  We don't need users frequently arguing over scams because an envelope with 30 or more dollars was lost or even stolen when going through the mail. It happens a lot because, put bluntly, some greedy fucks work there waiting for those envelopes so they can steal for their own gain. YGOSales would be putting money through the mail very frequently if it wasn't for this rule.  **Cards with a dollar or two**  Using a dollar bill or two to even out a trade is not as risky as sending a straight 10 dollars through the mail. It's a reason I hold a preference of NEVER accepting concealed cash as a full payment on YGOBinders. A dollar or two to even out a trade is always okay in my book. Prohibiting concealed cash on YGOBinders would also prohibit this practice, and is rather unfair to those who take part in it.  Of course, tracking and insurance always helps, but is it really worth 10-20 dollars to track and insure sending 20-30 dollars in cold hard cash just to get it through the mail? Even then, if it fails, it was a waste of your money and every user's time.  **Lack of Price Caps**  There's no price cap over on YGOBinders. Why? Because tracking and insuring a deck through parcel mail is far less risky than putting a 20 dollar bill through an envelope. Sending decks has proved far less risky when proper care is taken (bubble mailer and tracking).  Price caps are enforced on YGOSales because buyers and sellers should never have a bad experience because (for whatever god-awful reason) a deck went missing in the mail. Paypal doesn't have a very sophisticated resolution center. Ebay's is far more evolved. That's why we have an Ebay thread which you can access from the header at any time.  Buying from Ebay is far less risky because of their great resolution center.  **Wrap Up**  I hope you enjoyed this quick explanation on why YGOBinders and YGOSales don't share all of the sames rules. Now please, be safe and stay honest.   I wanted to address the differences in the rules that are enforced here and on YGOSales. And there's one big difference that has raised a bit of confusion.

Buying from ebay is far less risky because of their great resolution center.  **Wrap Up**  I hope you enjoyed this quick explanation on why YGOBinders and YGOSales don't share all of the sames rules. Now please, be safe and stay honest.   **Willing to pay: PAYPAL**  **Binder Link: http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs**  *wants*  Here's something unusual.

Verification of [her and me together](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65160123/trading/_img/notapage/IMG_0094.JPG).  Previous Thread http://redd.it/1r3h1l   Could there really be a did inutile combination of these? I've tried to do it, but some of this coding and placing and file modding seems to be going over my head.  Someone should release a code set with a set of tools to let us all build cool builds that combine multiples of these. Plus, it would make for some awesome builds and interesting reviews.  Wouldn't you like something like this?   Breakthrough skill just got confirmed as a card in the Lightsworn structure deck. Would selling now be worth it? Mine are ultra and ultimate, so 17 and 25. If those fall too much, I'd like to profit from it.         Here's a game we do often at /r/Yugioh. We would take a card and add or subtract just a few words from the text to make the card OP.  So I challenge you all, make one minimal change to a character that you think would make that character OP. It could be giving Jogglypuff instant damage-to-zero on every rest or making Ganondorf's warlock punch only take half a second to do. (Nothing like 100% on a move or 15x knock back growth on a move. Those are boring, obvious, and uncreative.)  This will allow us all to see how delicate balancing the game really is and probably even peek into the mind of bored PMBR devs. But moreover, I think this will be fun for everyone.   So I was buying Hazy Flame cards on /r/ygosales and wanted to buy any amount of alternate art Hazy Flames. Naturally, I got a response. A bit of negotiating and a few weeks later, HERE THEY ARE!  http://imgur.com/0Zb0bKu  These are awesome, and at only 5 dollars a card, it felt really good.  Remember, that's sam90fox who made these.   I think this imgur album explains the problem:  http://imgur.com/a/RRQVN  I got a common5.pac file and started making a lot of changes. All of them going stable and keeping the size small enough so that P:M won't crash. BUT, when I try to replace bg_icon on the stage select screen, it gives me an error. If I try to make another change and save the file, brawlbox crashes without saving and I must make those changes over again.  I'm using brawlbox 0.71 for reference.  I'm trying to replace sc_selmap_en  MiscData[20]  textures  bg_icon   **[Project M! 3.02 - My Main Characters ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlezjvo-BXk)**  I have gone on record saying that Ness is my best. But, I wanted the community's opinion. I took the 3 mains I've been putting the most time into, Pokemon Stadium 2, and all three spacies to give you an idea on my skill level with each one.  Each of these are the first and only recording of each set. There weren't any resets to make sure I looked good. All of these sets were played one after the other in the order shown (Lucas, Ness, Pit).  **So I ask**  1. Who is my best character? Lucas, Ness, or Pit?  2. What can I work on across my characters? For each character individually?  Fun fact: I captured the main cap with an iPhone 5s and the face-cam with an iPhone 5. I edited it together entirely on the iPhone 5s using iMovie.   I'm buying Hazy Flames, and I'd prefer to buy them at least 4 at a time. I'm willing to pay 50 cents for each card. (35 cents for extra huge bundles.) Here is what I am looking for:  * Any amount of extended art Hazy Flames * ~~2 Hazy Flame Peryton~~ * ~~5~~ 3 Hazy Flame Hyppogrif * 16 Hazy Flame Hydra * ~~5 Hazy Flame Cerbereus~~ * ~~9~~ 3 Hazy Flame Manticore * ~~7 Hazy Flame Sphynx~~ * ~~9 Hazy Glory~~   Reiden Lightman here to remind everyone to read the rules and always use the desktop version of reddit for this subreddit.

And my next music pack is about to start production.)  Thanks everyone. You guys are awesome. And you've helped others find cool balanced-ish stages to add.  	128
 I'm not the best at getting my thoughts written down. I thought I made the point that if you have been designing for a while it is part of the natural progression of things, or at least it seems that way for me.  A huge portion of my job recently when developing apps or websites is the UX end of things, and it naturally lead to choosing to do that full time as opposed to just doing it along with developing the UI and actually building it all (html, javascript, Xcode etc).  If your job already has you doing these things, and you enjoy that end of it, then you should consider doing it full time as it is a good way to step into a higher position and make more money. I should have been more clear on that point. I didn't mean to come across as saying you should do UX only for the money, as in my experience that is one of the last reasons to do work. I think I actually had an entire section about doing work you enjoy but my friend who read through the article told my I had too many tangents :)   Sorry I've been in the digital end of design for so long now I just assume everyone knows what it is :)  Part of my new years resolution is to "not be such a shitty writer" and I suppose part of that is not making assumptions about the audience. It actually took me most of the day to write this. I didn't know getting my thoughts out on 'paper' was so difficult.   It's partly an exaggeration..  $10 / hour http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/med/4236943939.html  $13 an hour http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/med/4230121582.html  $13 an hour http://phoenix.craigslist.org/wvl/med/4227767941.html  $12 an hour http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/med/4231823697.html  I know none of those ask for a decade of experience and a masters degree, but I have seen those posts in the past.

 Good point, but no one in my family smokes... and that one cigarette had some drawings in it (which my friend had done).  It was, with no doubt, the same cigarette.   Yea mate, ain't nobody is american :D     Well, so I'm on my class waiting for the last bell rang, so we can go home. My friend, just for fun, puts a cigarette (which is very prohibited in my school) in my ear. I immediately take it off my ear and it falls in the ground.   But the thing is, we looked down so we can hide the cigarette again, but it completely disappeared. We looked for it for what felt like 15 minutes, looked our backpacks, the ground, everywhere. I even went to the bathroom so I could take my clothes off to see if it fell within me: nothing, the cigarette was gone.  We just accepted it and went home.   This was 3 days ago. Yesterday, I was using my PC when I noticed, on the top of my desk, the same cigarette that fell on the ground and disappeared. I was like: WTF?!? The first thing I've done was to talk with my parents to see if they found it in my clothes: they didn't. I even talked with my brother who, somehow, could have found it: he didn't. The cigarette just TELEPORTED to the top of my desk (which I am always using) 2 days after he fell into the ground of my class and completely disappeared.  Glitch? Probably.         -   X room mod!

 "I see" said the blind man, as he picked up his hammer and saw.   In hospital patients small volumes (1-10 mL) of deuterated water are routinely used to estimate the total body water content.   I agree that fish farming makes sense but emphasise that it is a controversial topic.   Farmed salmon are dyed orange. Otherwise, theyd be an unappetizing grey. Dyes harvested from microorganisms (canthaxanthin   astaxanthin) and added to the food can account for up to one-third of total feed costs.  	3

 I know right, assholes.   It has to be Ryan Gosling right??   Don't know why you're getting down voted for explaining your situation. I think the same thing, the kinect would be soooo much better if at least the voice controls were integrated onto the headset.   exactly this, The Xbox and Wii u controller are ergonomic. They have evolved for modern game where you are using the analogue constantly. Play station for some reason refuse to change their layout and for that reason I haven't owned one since the PS2.   I'm in the same exact boat as you are, Ahoy fellow sailor!!   Ha things just keep getting better, got EA access just two days ago.   ~~Hotwired is fun?? what?? That is the most retarded game mode I have seen in a while, how can you have a game mode where it is required to drive if the driving physics of the game are complete and utter shit on stick. Hiest I would've understood, but Hotwired?? You know nothing. Rant over.~~ Hotwired is fun. Sorry for having a strong opinion..   Awesome, I just got EA access two days ago.   I had to close the window after a handful of loops or I would've lost a lot of time.   Right!! Your only pant button is just exposed to the world.   I just tried it, first result: is Mayweather mexican?   If the windshield flies off that means the car is dead.

It's pretty much primal instinct.   Is there an article on this story??   "HA! remember that time I put your dick in my mouth and gave you a BJ. I got you soo good man!!"   Here's my version of [slutty brownies](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=900515035) NSFW   YES PLEASE!! You have no idea how much I need the help atm. I'm in the middle of fighting Tahir, I managed to take half his half away before some henchmen came out and killed me. Now I just keep dying cause my weapon is ineffective and I have nothing to repair it with and to top it off Tahir's health has now gone all the way back up from dying so much. I reallyyyyyyyy need a hand, was even contemplating on leaving the Hard campaign and going back to the normal one. My GT is kiwi1990.   OK just so you don't miss anything else out, So far we have the salute, the swastika and the first person to the left of the middle of the swastika is black. how'd you like dem apples.   Who's the Jesus fellow?   But in all seriousness though IMO modding isn't really gaming and that is why I don't believe it belongs here. Modders could create a sub and have a modding community on Reddit to help each other with mods and show off their work instead of this current circle jerk (that rhyme was free, then next one I'm charging). Also to replay to the actual point you made the answer is simple, the game was new back then...1 and half years ago.   Who's the Jesus fellow?

Yeah you're right, thats clears up fuck all.   I think you've misunderstood. We are talking about EA access not local shops.   When you left things took a turn for the worse. Mother didn't look at dad the same way for not being able to find you, their marriage got rocky quickly. She started having an affair with our neighbour Mr.Bonobo and sadly contracted AID's. She tried to hide it from dad but he found out eventually like he always does. When dad found out he couldn't take it and he left us a note telling us he is going to take a long walk...into the enchanted lake in hope he could join his lost son once more. I told mum that dad had moved out of town to spare her because her AIDs had gotten really bad and this would've just pushed her over the edge. Unfortunately she lost her battle soon after and I was left all alone at the age of 9. No food, or money I did what I had to do to survive, I sold my colours to any one who would take them, how I miss them. They were the only thing keeping me going but survival was more important than living at that point in my life so they had to go. a few years of begging on the streets later I finally landed my first real job in a McKFC, the pay wasn't great but I finally had warm food daily. Slowly but surely I made my way up the ladder and I am now based in the Headquaters on a farm in Kentucky. I have a wife and 2 kids of my own now and I'm finally in place where I fell good about my life. Until you showed yourself all these years later and reminded me of the past suffering you caused you selfish son of a bitch. I'll be seeing you soon....very soon.   "Pitbull", killed me.   But, but it's white..   I wonder if they will be luxurious beheading's. Like a soft silk pillow to lay your head on for one last time and another one for your knees so they don't get scraped whilst your head is being chopped off.    would be cool if the kept building it from the inside then one day just reveal the whole thing like a magnificent butterfly.   But you can see people in online fall and get hit and run over in ragdoll why wouldn't allowing the same effect to be done manually not work?? I honestly don't know the answer and I'm quite curios know.   Strangely enough though I really want to "catch" them all.......^p^o^k^e^m^o^n    No, if you keep flipping the car you should ride a bike, psht.   Well I just bought my years subscription and I'm leaving that baby on auto-renew. 20 a year for a vault soon to be full of games? Don't mind if I do.   Dude I live in Gibraltar, one of the smallest most unknown countries on the planet. If I can get it I'm sure you can too.    Why are you commenting on everything with "cunt"?? Are you butt hurt today??   They already do this on big farms, guided by GPS.   I'm on xbone =( thanks anyway dude!   It can't be, is that really you?? Mother told me you got lost that day we went to the enchanted lake by marshmallow forest. I searched for years but all I was ever able to find was a piece of bacon where we last frolicked together. Please come home brother!   Yup, he just went R Kelly on that poor thing.   I'm tempted not to get the game as a Fuck You to EA but we all know that's not going to happen, I'm weak =(   This is currently happening to me in DYing Light. None of my friends game like they used too and I'm left alone playing on hard because I don't like playing with strangers.   I'm glad, this sub was getting out of hand with all these stupid mod gifs.   Not only that it's become a GTA V Mod gifworld and I am sick of it. We should really have a separate sub for PC gamers to jerk off to their mods in private.   it's not a feature online, just like animals and ragdoll and many other features. Honestly I don;t know why they would take it out.   Yeah I learned this yesterday, they really do save lives.   There were some cars you could swing side to side like a turtle trying to right itself and eventually get it right side up before the flames started.   I personally don't like it. It defeats the need to land properly. One of the better "oh Fuck" moments in recent GTA's was the fact that if you flipped your car over during a chase you had to escape and find another car ASAP or have a stand off.   Yea but the could shear some wiring which in turn causes a spark, you never know.   All she did was have an operation and eat less. not much of a struggle in my opinion.   **RKO OUT OF NO WHERE**   [Sooooo many questions](http://kobitos.com/en/kobitos/15.html).   ....nice try.   I mean like [really](http://imgur.com/5GXudek).   "Awesome"   OOOhhhh fair enough and wow, I'm getting downvoted because I didn't know a racist swear word. Stay Awesome Reddit.   I got it for free, but then again im on the other side fo the world so I was up till 5L30 in the morning to watch that..^n^e^v^e^r ^a^g^a^i^n   I actually don't, im guessing it's a swear word somewhere but I've never heard it before. I was basing it Southpark.   *swoooshhhhh*   No not at all If you read my first comment I said it stupid the way they react. What I'm saying is to not be surprised when they react because at the end of the day to them it seems like a provocation.    Wait....what?? Thanks!!   Woah dude, niceee.   That guy's a douche.   Fine but Christians do not mind, Muslims do so why provoke? What point is trying to be made? that you can do what you like without consequence? That's not how the world works. I see it just as disrespectful as calling a black man N....   Im not American or Muslim so I have a pretty good outside perspective and yes it does look like bullying, teasing, provoking whatever you want to call it except Freedom of Speech because that's just the excuse being used to hold these types of events.   When there's something strange in the neighbourhood, who you gonna call?   Why, you trying to hide something??   I'm not religious and I do think the way they react to this kind of shit is pretty stupid **but** to me this just feels like bullying. You know they don't like their prophet being drawn etc then why do it?? Freedom of speech?? No, it's just and excuse to piss them off and feel "rebellious". Then when they react, as they always do, you guys seem surprised. I'm not saying do not do it out of fear, I'm saying do not do it out of respect. Stop poking the wounded dog because it will bite.    "I'm a Shirt"   It is crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying, how crazy is it?...I'll go now.   That's the plan, if I had one, I'm too lazy   Watchdogs I can't say much about but IMO Ryse was a "preview game" to show what the new console could do, it has little to no story and or things to do and AC has basically been the same for the past 8 years now.   You know why this **REALLY** pisses me off. Online I have my character in a suit and raccoon mask, I want him to be named "The Coon" and for some fucking reason it's banned. dafuq.   ...but why??   I never finished this game, got stuck in the garage with that big monster with that antenna with an eye poking out of its head. Fuck that guy.   And I'm here at work looking at it muted =( [also, commenting to remind myself later]   I don't want to go down that river.   I would make a simple game app and probably make a lot of money if it went viral and provide me with the life I desire not having to worry about money and live each day with no worries, but I'm too lazy.   Then OP should make his roommate fork out the cash, simple as.   One of my favourite MK's to date, definitely should buy.   DLC killed achievement hunting, not that I used to do it much but yeah that happened.   You're all wrong. They're call Points and Plasters.   You spend hours daily playing AC Unity?? I guess everyone has their favourite games but AC Unity?? **REALLY!?**   Meh, once I found out this was going to be AR and not VR I lost all interest. Don't get me wrong it's an amazing piece of technology but let's stop fooling ourselves into thinking this is made for gaming, because it's not. Gaming is one of the last things this thing will be used for and it's a real shame they didn't focus on VR instead. Imagine playing GTA V or Dying Light with VR. As the article says it one of the games it is focused on is Minecraft, a game played by kids who obviously don't have money to buy this thing. I don't know it just feels like they are telling us what we need instead of providing us with what we want.   Welcome buddy, add me if you need to some people to play with!  GT:  kiwi1990   You wouldn't download a car.   Loved this film, was a really pleasant surprise.   No one asked you.   These onions are really getting to me..   oh the parking garage, I dropped all my melee weapons except my fav two and picked up all the guns I could carry. I ended up with over 20k in cash but as always I'm holding onto it for the "right time" and I will probably end the game before buying something cool.    Yeah, then you alert everything in the near vicinity. Nice Job.   I wish I would've done this. I started on hard straight away, worst decision ever. Ended up having to train my guy by running around and killing a few walkers before being able to complete any missions. But then again it does make it a lot more fun in the survival sense having to learn from your mistakes etc.   chiminea?? That's just Spanish for chimney.   yeah european toilets have their downfall too.    Also, Urapeeing toilets. Thats is all.   Only if your not browsing Reddit.   Broadband internet by 2002?? I didn't even have dail-up until 2004   I'm imagining him saying "good game".   Too spoon man.   Just as I expected, gaming is on the back burner for this thing.   Wow, can't believe you got to meet Harry Potter!! looks younger than I thought he would be.   Are we allowed to say that??   The circle of life.   I wanted Manny to win as much as the next guy and yes I agree Mayweather's tactics makes for shit viewing but Manny only has himself to blame. I was screaming at my TV for him to throw a left but unfortunately it didn't seem like he heard me. The few times he did throw a straight left instead of jabbing with the right first he would get Mayweather unprepared. It was frustrating to watch because the match was there for him to win but he lacked aggression and pressure.   Exactly, just pay your dollar and hope you're luckier next month. No need to go all CSI on the winners and determine if they are worth 1 of your measly dollars.   Play, Pay and Pray.   What, you mean those moments my mind replays like a fail compilation every night before bed?   Yeah those suck.    I love seeing things like this happen, made my night!! Thanks for being awesome.   They're just waiting for player 1 to get to the multiplayer spot for player 2 to spawn.   Banana peels!? Are you trying to kill us all!?   Plus tax.  	111
 If your at university in California I would check through your school. I know that lots of California schools are very water sports oriented. I would be surprised if your school didn't have a team.   Ohh I see.

    Well, if there's an unused android mobile going around, these apps will help. Though it must be noted that if the camera views an area outside a person's property - the law and regulations become, understandably, part of the equation. At the same time, a phone on a window sill may not be so noticed.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexvas.dvr        I don't recommend it as a part of a confrontation, but without evidence of who did it - the council will do nothing.  I'd be very wary of it too hence the parenthesis.   "As Bible-believing Christians [must meet the other type], we will also turn our attention to the tragic compromise and downgrade of so many once-sound fundamentalist, Evangelical churches."  I dont consider myself extreme at all  I would  if I had the power  make homosexuality a criminal offence once again. I would also make adultery a criminal offence, so Im pretty fair in that respect."  "The Islam threat is in the form of halal meat"  Eh wa shuh wha?  These are psychiatric symptoms not policy models.   I thought it read 'Democracy **of** Party Whip' at first, but then I remembered that's the last 20(?) years of Irish Politics and so this guy must be a spanner, or it says 'or'.   Have you caught them in the act e.g. kicking cap-stones?  It was a problem around where I live, and the council came down and talked to everyone involved, when there were definite council things damaged. Things calmed down a fair bit. Mind, it took a lot longer than it should have.  If you've video from your phone (as awkward as that is as a resolution step), at least you could show it around the other discomfited houses and see how it goes.   That'd be shocking really though, there's no work in the construction sector generally but there's loads to be done in this country. Money is becoming less of an object (at the government level, our bonds are doing well).  Wouldn't it be a perfect time for a stimulus that simultaneously brings jobs and infrastructure upgrades?  Ahhh, I wouldn't last a day in the Dil. It's opposite-land.   [Fair Enough](http://i.imgur.com/BXm4B5y.gif)   One thing I don't get - don't we need more schools, hospitals and infrastructure/repairs?   Wouldn't that equally help the construction sector without artificially tampering with the housing market?  Though I'm sure first-time buyers need all the help that's going.   It looks like you're missing [something](https://imgur.com/Rg5uWtr)   I doubt we've filled them all by now.      Naturally!  Bananas can join in too [right?](https://imgur.com/RtX8WXl.gif) [;)](https://imgur.com/JSldjoJ.gif)   Nah, that's the carrots, and you're a whole of box of them.  They smell a snack.   Ah, Leave Angela out of it   Yeah, doesn't inspire confidence that the diary is filled out after the fact. I'm sure other ministers can confirm whether that's a regular occurrence.  Plus, we don't need this speculation at all. We can just ask 'Alan Shatter   Officials' when the meeting was held and check their diaries.  I'm sure the Taoiseach doesn't drive around on his own either, so wouldn't the driver service have a record of where he was that day and when they drove him there?     Yeap same day as Sinn Fin are asking about.  I'd be inclined to go with the harmless interpretation that "I wasn't in Dublin until around 4", grand, the meeting in the Shelbourne was at 4.30; plus "Sunday morning meetings are rare, but I wasn't in Dublin at all." [at that time, but I was in Dublin later].  However, considering the early morning Shatter meeting was in the diary for the 23rd and is about the Garda business - it's all seeming a little suspect. Alan Shatter had no intention of resigning back in March. Plus the idea that the diary is filled out retrospectively is bad practice or just smoke-screen.   "Obviously, my apologies if that was sent out in error, it's not true. Sunday morning meetings are rare, but I wasn't in Dublin at all." [on the 23rd March]  9th Broadband Commission for Digital Development Meeting on the 23rd March:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_He4wjyEbHs   Had some interesting attendees too:  http://www.gov.rw/President-Paul-Kagame-co-chairs-the-9th-meeting-of-the-UN-Broadband-Commission-for-Digital-Development-in-Dublin-Republic-of-Ireland  edit: And this error (assuming it was one) was never corrected. The 7.30 pm meeting is not on Enda's [schedule for the following day.](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2014/05/taoiseach-diary-pg-2-3.pdf)      It's quite the story:  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/10/shell-pipeline-protests-county-mayo    It's a cash-grab when it's not being used for its stated purpose.   PRSI is used to provide for you if you fall ill   can't work or lose your job (i.e. social insurance)  I'm for water charges in principle   practice, but as a conservation and infrastructure maintenance measure. Not this cludge from a government that still hasn't told us the cost per litre. Do they not know or are they not saying? Well, it's election time so I'm guessing it's both.  Putting in meters rather than fixing the leaks first, tells me this is more the prelude to privatisation than an environment resource measure. No commodity suits the needs of hedge funds better than water - people will always need it. And the push for privatisation has been going on for some time.  * [The World Bank and the International Development Bank highlighted **water privatization as a requirement for the Bolivian government in order to retain ongoing state loans**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_Bolivia)  * [The World Bank and water privatisation: public money down the drain](http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2008/09/art-562458/)  * [Even as the World Bank Group continues to promote water privatization, its own data reveal that a high percentage of its private water projects are in distress. Its project database for private participation in infrastructure documents a 34 percent failure rate for all private water and sewerage contracts entered into between 2000 and 2010](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/water-managementprivatizationworldbankgroupifc.html)      Smithers, Release the Cows!   It absolutely would. But what are the chances that the other 2 taxes we pay for water will remain in place?  This is a cash-grab, not a conservation measure.  Irish Water are spending our money on meters now, not fixing leaks which would be the ultimate conservation measure.   We are already pay for water via taxes (twice). The new water charge is not going to be spent on water infrastructure for some time. It's to pay off county council debts. That's the reality there.  There are many other deserving sources of revenue generation that could be tapped, rather than another charge on our tapped-out citizenry.   In this election, I'm voting **against** candidates as much as I'm voting **for** candidates.      I reckon it's more of a story than the non-story about [not queuing for one direction tickets](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0514/617285-one-direction/), RT thought that was news-worthy on the same day.  Anyway, it's such a non-story there are four links about it above. Plus no-one's being charged for water yet, many things could change, though we'd have to be non-defeatist about it.     Let's hope he doesn't realise any new ones      http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/irish-water-contractors-remove-meters-from-cork-estate-protests-to-continue-630488.html  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/campaigners-welcome-removal-of-water-meters-from-cork-estate-1.1794594  http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/irish-water-denies-that-removal-of-meters-is-a-uturn-30276462.html   http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-water-cork-removed-1464171-May2014/    I reckon a lot of people will see this as a bad thing (until they want something removed themselves), but as long as it's kept narrowly to its purpose I don't see it as much more than going ex-directory from the phone-book. Sure the phone's still active but it's not indexed.  Though I thought the 'right to be forgotten' was more about forcing companies to delete **all** the data they had about when you cancelled or otherwise severed ties with them.      If the medical card mess is anything to go by, the government is going to sit around and watch this trend continue.  Sometimes I think they look at the US and decide which unethical business practice to adopt from it next.         My view too.  Brand new AAA games are 70 ($95) in Ireland, not worth preordering at that price.  It'll have to be many good reviews   positive sentiment on the web before I'll consider spending that much money on a game, especially a Ubisoft game after buying AC3.   * unclutter  * deluge, instead of transmission  * dolphin  * guayadeque  * bleachbit   Oh yeah that sounds very possible, plus Leo likes to opine about other ministers' portfolios - so then he'd get the chance to move around.  And being a qualified doctor ... oh no wait   Wonder who they'll give Health to, who wants it?   Please let there be a hat-trick         Woops, meant to put this in /r/meath but sure while it's here             If I remember correctly the downgrade in Gaeilege's status started under Fianna Fil's watch while Mr Byrne was a sitting member of FF in the Dil.  Ah, almost prescisely so:  "The derogation was originally in place for five years from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011 but this was then extended for another five-year period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016." http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/(indexlookupdail)/20131128~PP?opendocument  Mr Byrne, a TD, from 2007 to 2011.  Hmmmm   by spelling 'thrive' correctly  ;)   I guess it comes down to 'store credit' for what type of 'store'?  The cash is usually lower than the store equivalent, e.g. xtravision.   I imagine he does, I also reckon he doesn't represent the views of another lot in an admittedly huge constituency.   http://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-mullen-on-europe-bid-1399922-Apr2014/  Seantor and director of [Catholic Comment](http://www.catholiccomment.ie/about.html), Friend of the [Iona Institute](http://d2539.cp.irishdomains.com/index.php?id=624) and you can probably guess some of the others.  He is such a step backwards, I'd be appalled and a little nervous if he got a seat in Europe.      Go for a RaspberryPi with Raspbmc (xbmc) on it!  The whole package will be about the same price as a new AAA game, and is the best little media player around (blows the PS3 out of the water, bar the blu-ray). And it's fanless, so noiseless :) ~~^and^no^cinavia~~       I'm enjoying it, wish there were more games but that's my fault for buying early.  What's really holding me back is 70 per game!  If new AAA games stay at that price - I'll wait for second-hand at 50 , or PS+      I think the Ireland that believes what Labour says or promises is long gone.      I am crossing my fingers         Needs more fabulous, :-) ;-) :O :~~ ~~:   Ouch, down my preference list he goes.      Don't let [Superintendent Foxtrot](https://imgur.com/Sc8af2c) have anything to do with your life (page 306).  And from [RT](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0509/616164-guerin-report/):  The report concluded that Mr Shatter did not heed the voice of Sgt McCabe despite the high esteem in which he was held.  Mr Guerin said that was despite the minister having specific statutory powers in the area of complaints from members.  Mr Guerin said there was a "near total absence" in the papers he had examined of written records of submissions made, or advice given, to the minister by his officials.  He said he had seen no written internal records of decisions made by the minister.  Guerin said the approach adopted "had the result that there was no independent investigation" of Sgt McCabe's complaints.  He concluded that the absence of written records was a "matter of some concern", saying it appeared that the minister had acted "on foot of advice received by the commissioner", without that advice being questioned or analysed.  That is atrocious, Shatter looks like he completely sided with whatever Callinan wanted.   Wow, GSOC didn't give him a single document!   So she wasn't elected on the 3 occasions she was on the ballot, got a senate seat courtesy of the government and yet thinks she's a better prospect than a person who was duly elected.  Labour sure know how to pick 'em.   I'm going to put this in the same box as the Russian lad who wanted to mine helium 3 on the moon by 2015, or the giant inflatable ring they were going to orbit beside the moon about 20 years ago.   l'oreal      You'll have to wait until the identity of the Joker is revealed!  /same bat time, same bat channel   I'd be happy to overtake the UK, Japan's education system though creates a fair few zombies (I taught an 11 year old over there with grey hair) so let's not aim too high.   Here's another one, though I've no idea about the paper mentioned - maybe someone here knows it:  http://ronancasey.ie/2014/05/woman-tears-up-election-leaflet-fined-e150/    You can use [ES file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop) to connect to the Pi and thus it's harddrive and download them to the tablet that way.  Though if it's simply to watch movies on the tablet while within range of your home network you are much better off streaming the movies to your tablet. Use either the tablet's built-in video player, many come with network streaming now, or use something like [YAACC](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=yaacc fdid=de.yaacc) to provide the bridging-link between the Pi, your tablet and its video app.      I see he's going to give Defence to a [current minister](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/fitzgerald-confirmed-as-new-justice-minister-629934.html), wonder who that'll be.   Which I can totally see, what I can't see is how the volume of water used by 13 million people is ultimately cheaper than the volume of water used by 4.5.  Together with the Tube, the awkwardness of city infrastructure in general - I imagine digging up for repairs is more costly in London also.   I know one person in that situation, it's an old row of houses in a small town - so I reckon it could be very common.  And then there's my brother's house where nobody knows where to put his meter. He even called the original builder (in his 70s now) and he'd no clue where it met up with the town supply either.  Three different people called my brother about it from the contracting company without knowing about the other calls, so you can imagine phonecall #3 was shorter and louder than 2 previous.   The situation I mean is where the branching points from the main pipe to all the other houses (after house A) are under house A or otherwise inaccessible.   Making house A the only one that can be metered, or the piping has to be redone from scratch for all the houses.   According to the Irish Times we'll be [paying 0.2 cents per litre](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/bath-set-to-cost-16-cent-while-a-shower-will-set-you-back-25-cent-1.1787308).  So 0.2 cents per litre = 200 cents per 1000 litres or  2 per 1000 litres.  So we'll be more expensive than London, a city with a greater population than our whole country.  Wouldn't it be great if Phil Hogan or Irish Water actually told us the charge?      One thing I haven't seen resolved are the cases where a row of houses share the one pipe - making it impossible to individually meter each house's usage.  What happens if the house that can be metered (or simply one of the houses) refuses to pay the bill - do all the houses have their pressure reduced to a trickle?      I can really see a motive for Microsoft in this,  they are facing a future where windows becomes a legacy OS. With only a few copies of windows required inside a VM even within an enterprise context.  Then I looked at the permissions for the new android version of Firefox today, I reckon Firefox is more deserving of an arched eyebrow in this case and in a more general sense - than the purists posting user controlled solutions on forums      No one is Shatter resistant  vintage   You're too kind, it was an underage rent-boy and the cocaine was bought with tax-dodge money.   Cheers, but don't worry it's outside all year round!  It's an Irish [Ash tree](http://www.treecouncil.ie/irishtrees/ash.html), not to be confused with all the other 'ash' trees around the world.  Here are its [bigger brothers](https://i.imgur.com/7q5pGDd.jpg), that always come out earlier.  The one in the blue pot I'm minding for a friend while her dog gets out of a chewing habit :)   I wonder will he go to the Dil committee he scheduled to attend tomorrow!?  edit: He is.   Ireland wasn't given 14 billion, the Royal Bank of Scotland propped up its own failing subsidiary (which happened to be in Ireland) to the tune of 14 billion.  /rtfa         Much apologies, I may have my wires crossed on this one!  Looking at both, I'm having a hard time deciding which species I [have](https://imgur.com/U0ca2sU).  Either way, I only know one other person who's training them as bonsai. Cheers for the other plant name!       Ah, not where I'm from (Ireland), every mention of a Money Tree is a crassula.   Seconding the money tree [(Jade Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant), will tolerate a fair amount of neglect and can look very bonsai after a year or two.  I recommend they should be grown in a regular sized house-plant pot for a year (or two) until the roots have developed. Then placed into a shallower bonsai pot.  Ficus drove me bananas, I swear they have a passive aggressive nitrogen deficiency thing going on.   I reckon that's a completely accurate way of looking at this blast from the past.  Here's another, Eamonn Gilmore will say anything while not in power to get votes - he's just a politician after all and not exceptional in this regard or example.  Yet this can tell us 2 things:  * Eamonn hitched his ride to the Workers Party on principles of a fair society / water provision that he no longer adheres to.  * He has yet again (his Lisbon treaty flip-flop) kowtowed to an EU directive over and above the directive's intent (reasonable decision making reforms / water conservation) and decided it's more about cash for institutional fuck-ups. Or at least, let his 'betters' instruct him so.  In any election there are 'turkeys voting for christmas' - e.g. the ~17% who voted FF in the last election - but Eamonn's turkeys and christmas are movable feasts. He doesn't have to worry though, his policy choices do not have to read as any egregious compromise for the country. He'll simply blame the majority partner with a 'what would it have been like without us' reasoning. He may be expecting the limited communication abilities of 80s here, as his stance won't wash in our internet era.   I've heard plenty of secondary school students get riled up about this blithe indifference to the net, netizens and it's technorati. As if the net's only an exaggeration-engine and not also the 'printing-press' with a power Irish newspapers envy.  His eyes are on his life after politics. I think his leadership will retire what 'Labour' is left of the Labour party, and his party seems fairly fine about it.  That Ireland's electorate vote via reflex, in pluralities, is a daily awful reminder that the Dil is us. We have done this to ourselves to a very large part.  That is no excuse for the failure of its cheerleaders, such as Gilmore though.   I don't reckon he's a puppet-master either.  A combination of minence grise and experienced solicitor should be enough to cow a taoiseach who is unable to debate his own policies in public.  I'd certainly claim Enda is a puppet.  I'd put Shatter at set-designer   back-stage bouncer though, not p/muppet-master      ~~Anne Hathaway~~ Catwoman for #2   That box of rocks is scared of a public debate, nevermind a party contributor.   Ah, Elaine Byrne isn't likely to be anyone's stooge:  ["The chair of the Revenue Commissioners, Josephine Feehily, noted that although 289 cases of illegality were identified in relation to the largest tax evasion scheme in Irish history, not one person has been prosecuted over the Ansbacher tax scandal."](http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/elaine-byrne-major-reform-is-essential-to-tackling-whitecollar-crime-29383431.html)  Corruption is long established here, we'll need a generational die-off and more like her - with unfettered outlets for their research - if we're to bring it down to 'normal' corruption.   Jaysus, Billy Hawkes finally grew a pair!?  It'll probably be like the time he found one of Facebook's privacy invasive practices "completely unacceptable" and then let them carry on with it for 6 months (enough time to rehouse the activity outside the EU).  This will be overturned on appeal, then Alan can brush the shit off his shirt to let it drop on Billy. It's not like 2 people have lost their jobs after tangling with him, or anything.  Alan S must have some shit on E E that they expressed confidence in a Minister for Justice that broke the law on national TV. Has a minister (for Justice) ever done that before?              this is **sometimes** false  ftfy   Sure that's easy to fix, just prove that the claims are inaccurate.   Yeah, will suck to be those without the nanotech defenses.   waste disposed of over the last 55 years by the civil and military nuclear industry at the site, near the Sellafield nuclear complex in west Cumbria, is going to start leaking on to the shoreline in "a few hundred to a few thousand years from now"      waste disposed of over the last 55 years by the civil and military nuclear industry at the site, near the Sellafield nuclear complex in west Cumbria, is going to start leaking on to the shoreline in "a few hundred to a few thousand years from now"   god forbid they reserved its highest tier for second homes ;)   In fairness, all of those points are **their job** - for which they are paid more than adequately.  Have we reached a point where we expect so little from the Dil that TDs turning up and doing what they're elected to do is laudable?  Here are some other achievements:  * Held a referendum on a stability fund that we can't access a year and a half before we would have needed it anyway. Losing a negotiating position in the process. * Asserted the need for a pay-cap in public positions, which is then flouted by the Taniste. * Let the Minister for Justice mislead the Dil after he revealed a TD's penalty point situation live on national TV. None of which jeopardises his job. * Failed to address the shortcomings of the Data Protection Commissioner which has now lead to the drafting of new EU laws, one of which is specifically designed to avoid the need for EU citizens to go through that Irish office to make complaints. * Allowing a debt defaulter to be in charge of the country's biggest budget which, surprise surprise, he can't balance. * Failed to address the egregious loopholes exploited by foreign multinationals which sees a certain company pay 0.14% in tax, instead of 12.5%. Meanwhile Irish companies the absolutely vast employers of people in Ireland see new levies, taxes   rates while remaining on 12.5%. Corporate welfare at its finest. * Introduced a Property tax   soon a Water charge which makes a mockery of maintaining basic social welfare rates and rates of income tax. * Increased school classroom numbers which are now the highest in Europe. * Fails to acknowledge that much of recovery in this country would not have been possible without the ~400,000 people who have left Ireland over the past 5 years for work.  	114

 Yeah,  because I was confused,  too. Thank you for the explanation!

This is a powerful thing that I don't think many teams have. *EDIT: spelling*   I think your text length was just fine. I have no problem with off field antics that dont hurt anybody. People live life and they make mistakes and people deal with pain and recreation differently. I think in the grand scheme of things we have a guy who likes to party hard when he's not succeeding at football spectacularly, and a relatively low key guy who smokes weed and blows it up on the gridiron.  I dont think either of them are being detrimental to the team, currently. I do have a bias: I live in Washington and am witnessing how benign the transition has been of legalized marijuana. One day I think this will be a highly antiquated conversation. I think it will be within the next decade that we will see major changes, and probably sooner than that. Now IM sorry for the text wall!   I personally think that the NFL marijuana policy is the part that is out of line, in my personal opinion. Even Goodell knows, I believe. Neither of them is doing anything that I see as detrimental to their game, or others, yet.      Thank you for your diligence    I appreciate your diligence in learning the unfortunate truth that I myself learned: He doesnt exist.   The brownie that looks like this, in fact: https://www.google.com/shopping/product/5660517467084818503?q=metal+cleveland+browns+decal client=firefox-a hs=Btv rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official channel=sb bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf. bvm=bv.69620078,d.b2k,pv.xjs.s.en_US.aYK8E0Vbenc.O biw=1440 bih=779 tch=1 ech=1 psi=kP-pU6jrDoikqAb68IK4DA.1403649904820.3 ei=lP-pU8DoD8mNqAaviYLYDw ved=0CLsCEKkrMA8    Not quite. something like this, but the Brownie http://www.fanatics.com/league/nfl/team/cleveland_browns/cleveland_browns_die-cut_metal_logo_auto_emblem/partnerid/8429/source/GPA_CA-1338653-505?CAWELAID=  CAGPSN=pla   Does anyone know where this artifact may be located?  I can only find the metal helmet decal. I know someone had to have made the Brownie into a smarty looking metal car decal. I've looked everywhere,  and the last thing I can think to do is ask y'all..   Dead Like Me   Thanks Heegs. That makes my day!   *Be excellent to each other*   Thank you,  and sorry!    I did NOT know that. That is why I love this reddit.   I feel about the Steelers the way Vegita feels about Goku (Dragon Ball Z reference). He can hate him, but you dont know shit about him, so stay back. If anyone is going to dis the Steelers, its us. We have to play them 2 times every year, forever. There is a hidden honor there. We hate them the way brothers who have had a falling out hate. If anyone else trash talks them, I get offended and think "They dont have any right to trash talk the Steelers. I have a right to trash those bastards, but your Charger lovin' ass can stuff it." With that said, we have to honor our opponents that deserve honoring,  and celebrate their lives once they pass. They put up with our bickering, and they understood us better than anyone else in the league. And for that I honor a man who took his team to 4 Super Bowls. Be at peace,  Chuck. Steelers Heaven is undoubtedly welcoming you in grand style.         Remove the teachers and make them Mentors. Demand excellence in Math, Science, Social Studies, Sports and the Arts, but dont force a curriculum. Give the children choices and allow them to create the education they want. Make it a forum where the kids choose the direction they want thwir studies to go. Have American History, but allow the child to decide what parts they want to learn. If they dont care about the Dust Bowl, but spend 4 years learning about Ohio Railroads, the only thing that does is make them a walking resource on a subject that they are passionate about, instead of wasting 4 years teaching them a little bit about everything they dont care to remember. Don't make them read "The Wind in the Willows", make them have to read something that interests them. Be there as a guide to help them find knowledge for themselves, and ditch standardized testing. Train the Mentors in how to give a written assessment,  and then give the kids a real grade that isnt attached to a letter, but to a document that details their attitude and accomplishments and if they have learned the fundamentals to move to the next level of resources, then syart suggesting things that seem to flow with what they already seem to be doing. Every reading assignment is from a famous American author? Suggest some Tom Wolfe. The student seems to gravitate toward modern sci-fi? Suggeat some classic Asimov to round out their education. That is the difference between a Mentor and a Teacher. A Mentor helps you discover the world in which you can flourish and find things that bolster your knowledge. A Teacher stands in front of you and helps you learn a set of knowledge that is pre planned by someone who makes curriculums for a living. Also, as a parent of 3 "No Child Left Behind" age children, I would ditch it so fast. 2 of them dont read well, and the third only does because he plays video games. That program is "Leave All the Children Behind and Forget About Their Whole Generation" but that might be a little political there at the end.   Honey says she loves her bandana in this one!   She says it looks great!   Done. Sorry for the confusion       I posted in the title that it was my dog, but if there is something more I need to do, I would be happy to. I have about 25 pictures of her. Just let me know what more I need to do.      Thank you so much! I like the tartan around her shoulders. She is clan MacTeig. It would be wild if that was similar to her family colors. Thank you!      More like Potato Chip Kelly. Amiright? Thank you www.thedrawplay.com !      I see in the news that the balance is further exerting itself, today. All 3 running backs, now? I hate it for, y'all.   I was homeless for a good part of my tween and teen years. I am also from Ohio. Well, it's cold in Ohio, and being homeless doesn't confine itself to when it's warm. This makes for a lot of cold winter nights; lonely and alone. I used to talk to the Moon and Orion every night in the winter, that they were out. The problem is Orion is only out in the cold months,  and I was homeless and in need of someone to talk to all the time, so when I turned 18 I got him tattooed in dots and lines on my forearm. This way I had him with me always.  I got the idea when I saw a friend at a festival with him tattooed on his ankle. My friend is a Sagittarius,  and so his Orion is the Archer version.  Mine is the Lion and Club version.    Wow...the Gyro...womp. Good call.   As a person who loves the Browns, and as a native of Kent, Ohio (Kent State Flashes) my favorite is my flair: #16 Mr. Joshua Cribbs. A walk on, home town, Special Teams, sensation that many believe caused the new blocking rules on kick returns; forever letting it be known in Cleveland as "The Cribbs Rule" because of how it dramatically decreased his effectiveness. But this does not change how I feel about him. He would have been a shoe in for Canton if he had won a ring, and may still, but either way, Cribbs is my boy.   I somewhat linked to it through this post where I poke a little fun at the ratbirds and they start cawing up a storm.  *spelling*  http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/26mas5/ravens_4th_round_draft_pick_rb_lorenzo_taliaferro/chsepzu   I am looking for stories of Baltimore Colts fans just melting down after the team moved.   Pagan Minister, Author, Public Speaker, Dean of Marketing for a 501(c)3 with international ministries, and for the Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary. Kent native currently living in Seattle. Go Browns. *spelling edit*   Either way I wish you all the luck.   Winning the NBA lottery 3 times in 4 years, most AL  home game wins, and Johnny Football on staff? A godless hell hole to be sure.   I am a traveling minister for an earth based religion, so I plan on putting a lot of cool pics up. Im really appreciative of your  amazing work. Thanks again and I hope this isnt a single serving friend moment. Safe travels and ttys.   Posting it to /r/Browns because its the gospel, not the votes.       The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry  prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day.  It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.     I have seen how amazing a lot of these pictures on this sub turn out, but I never expected this to be so amazing. Thanks again!   This is SICK! I love the medium you used. The use of light and dark are amazing and it looks VERY  Faerie. Thank you! *edit for spelling*    Thank you in advance to those that peruse my picture.      A look at how today, Cleveland is the luckiest place in the world. What will tomorrow bring?       Uhhhhh, story?   Grossi also called the Harbaugh Bowl   SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!   I like Grossi   In 1983 my grandparents were friends with the equipment manager of the Browns. He left with the Ravens and is still their equipment manager. He had me decked out in Browns gear from the crib onward. Let the fair weather fans come out. More orange and brown for er'body!   I was going off of the news report that I read earlier about them telling him that CLE is a working town. It reminded me that few people get anything handed to them in NE Ohio. We make people who become presidents and astronauts because we know that hard work and dedication breed success. We want Johnny to be a success.  *edit: its not about "Making him pay for it". That was really thrown around by the media.  Its about learning. I understand lineage. Manzeil isn't just sitting on the sidelines, he's learning from Hoyer, who learned from Brady, who learned from Belichick. This is putting Johnny into that lineage and is part of what has the chance to take him from "Possible Great" to "Amazing"*   The media wants Manzeil to pay the Gold Price for his spot on the roster and to shine like the football savior of Cleveland. The Browns want him to pay the Iron Price and to work hard to become great, like a lump of fine metal forged into a powerfully sharp razors edge.   He can't get fucked because he's eating dirt while we are here to talk about him. His basic perpetual removal from Canton runnings is his well earned legacy. *EDIT Spelling*   Those things are the s*it   Are Browns questions inappropriate for this sub?   Well you're pretty much the laughing stock of our sub! Bart is that you? Come off of twitter to get rough n tumble in our sub?    I liked Cooper. Oby ftw for sure. Go Browns.    As a Browns fan living in Washington State with no Direct TV, it's the only legal way I can experience the games live.  Costs me like 5 bucks a month. Go Browns!   Thanks /u/autowikibot!   Though April 2013 Sirius XM had 20mil+ subscribers.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM_Radio   You have to make an account, so if thats not your bag (it isnt mine) a good read and click for their page views is still a good way to support their positive efforts.   I just found this sane and informative article by a news source so far removed from Ohio that they can only be considered "National". Lets leave some positive comments on this one. You can only read 5 of their articles in 30 days. Go Browns!   http://www.santafenewmexican.com/sports/browns-qb-johnny-manziel-i-m-just-a-rookie/article_ccb10fa0-68b2-5714-a51c-ba4676a4d062.html   And Pat Kerwin is TRUE national media. He's on Sirius XM, and millions of people pay to hear his opinion. Ive never even heard of the author of this article.   Bart is currently posting pictures of Jets minicamp. This was my response after reading his bashing tweets on CLE. Oh, and Go Browns.   *@HubbuchNYP  I've been so busy with local Cleveland Media that I haven't had time for this national stuff. Jets, huh? How're they doin'?*   I asked Haden on Twitter. (I messed up the beginning,  but *shrug*)  @joehaden23 @hadenwill you come on reddit to r/browns to do an AMA? (ask me anything)? I understand if Farmer has to sign off. Invite him :)   Is it just me? Mike Freeman seems to have a grudge, or a secret crush on the Browns which makes him mean. He's like a black and yellow ratbird that just flys over top of C Ohio and sustains itself off of the bounty that is Cleveland, while just crapping all over everything.

Why is it that I often see people on this subreddit attack a person's character when there is a disagreement?    Well, /u/gargle_my_smegma, You run the risk of impregnating the fish.  *edited to add this fine gentlemans name to my post*   I see where you're coming from,  and I personally think they are mosquitos,  but just because someone is into art and design doesn't automatically mean they are doctoring photos. Maybe a life long love of photography was the thing that inspired this person to go into arts and design.  Chances would be they had taken a lot of pictures in their life,  probably more than the average person. Just a question of odds says they have a better chance of capturing an anomaly due to the sheer volume of pictures taken. Though I don't think it's faeries,  I don't think his profession should automatically rule him out as a faker.      The numbers are what give it away as a troll.

I just know that he has been attacking right wing anti-pagan Wikipedia editors who have been systematically getting pagan pages taken down, through the abuse of the rules system. It even caused one of them to get their real life persona outed, and themselves banned from Wikipedia. Planting pictures on someones computer doesnt take Anonymous level hacking skills. Did someone actually do that *shrug* I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut, so maybe/maybe not. This is just something that went through my head.  *edited for spelling*      Follow her as she awakens :)      ###"Never Date a Writer" inspired by the works of "xstephens"  Never date a writer,     no just never date a writer.     It's been spoken at least once before,     I know this;     I'm inspired.     If it's their ire you inquire,     then you might just catch on fire     In some sultry sleazy novel     that goes screaming down the wire     They'll start writing     and just writing     Diatribes that are so biting     Of your hip size     and your thigh size     of that surprise between your thigh size     Oh he's right!     that writer writes     about his libel barks and bites     and as I sit here quite a quiver     at this feeling he's delivered     of his maddened observation     that has taken hold his liver     and contrived his consternation     That has brought me such Elation!     For it's true     I say it's true     as a peddler of my whimsy     that at times a writer can be trite     Our ego's may be flimsy     So our hero's in our story     tend to hint at lusted glory's     we may wish we had the livers     to stand proudly and deliver     And our villains may resemble     those that made us shake and tremble     And so I ramble on the merits of this Shakespearean Degenerate (that's 'day-djo-nare-it' for the non bourgeoisie)     and you have grinned and bared it     So there's one more thing I share:     The street it goes two ways     as the pen it streaks the paper     Not always are the ones close by     the Mobster or the Raper     you're the ones who create the sonnets     the inspirers of Romances     You bring about our ecstasy     as our paper and quill dances     so thank you for your sacrifice     Our art exists by you.

Ive been reading your post history to find out if you are as aggressive and attacking to others as you have been to me. Turns out youre worse. You say some of the nastiest, meanest, and unhelpful things and you do it all over reddit and you do it thinking you are correct for trashing the folks you do. You trash people who think differently than you, and your posts are often just mean and belittling. "GTFO"? Why would you cuss that at someone or attack people, period? I thought that was against reddicate and against most subreddit rules. I think a long walk and maybe some medical marijuana might help you. Good luck. I know you'll most likely lash out at me, as is you M.O. or tell me that medical marijuana has no positive studies and that I'm an idiot. Thats okay. Ive gotten used to you and I now see that you cant help but be combative, and reddit is probably how you discharge all that negativity so that it doesn't effect your walking life (if you have one, because the level of negative interactions you have daily on reddit suggest you may ONLY  have this outlet to relieve yourself of the poison that your personality creates within you.) Bless your heart, it must be hard to have to force feed your opinions with a sledgehammer to those that dont think the way you do. Good luck, again, and may reddit protect its charges from the worst of your aggression.   A wonderful poem about the Mother.      I dont know if you are American or not, but I learned on a recent trip (my firs) to Canada how subliminal words can be. In Canada they have the same red circle and white line through the middle "Do Not Enter" street signs, but they do not say "Do Not Enter" on them. They just assume you know what it means, and they don't add that added line of, what I learned after not being subjected to it for 2 weeks is, aggression. I found this article to be saying the same thing: "Our wording is detrimental" I haven't said anything, and I don't believe the article said anything about any medical treatment being wrong, or inappropriate. the main point I saw was the need for a change in our verbiage, and I agree.   I'm not saying it isnt "profitable", it's just not "cornerable"; Which I should have been more clear on. And here are a couple links about case studies on Manuka honey and would healing. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722850 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.01082.x/full (Though to be fair you have to subscribe to read this one) And this more illustrated and nsfw link: http://www.medline.com/media/mkt/pdf/Therahony-study.pdf   I think much of the problem is you cant patent manuka honey. It just kills staph infections, and theres no way to capitalize on it monetarily. Same with reiki, chiropractics and homeopathy; iteslf around since the 1800's with 100's of positive case studies. You just cant patent and control the medicine.  	116
 Perhaps you could talk to the statistics department of your university? Sometimes they have courses/services where undergrads or masters students get pair up with students from other disciplines and help them with statistics.   NO WAYYYYYY!   Really? I am gunna guess more people say Jorah Mormont.   There are many good courses on Coursera so I suggest start from there. I won't give you any specific recommendations because there are too many courses available and it's just best if you look at some of those and decide which ones fit your needs.   I know you can get the p-values using an R package called pvclust, and this is adequate for my purpose. I'd like to know if we can go a step further, and, for example, get numbers like variable x contributes the most to which cluster an observation belongs to (e.g. 25%), and variable y follows, etc.   I know you can get the p-values using an R package called pvclust, and this is adequate for my purpose. I'd like to know if we can go a step further, and, for example, get numbers like variable x contributes the most to which cluster an observation belongs to (e.g. 25%), and variable y follows, etc.   usually, when people ask me to sign NDAs, I would ask "if I signed this piece of paper, and really broke it, do you have the time/effort/money to actually sue me?"            no idea, just found the picture, and thought it's a nice shirt.      perhaps there is some secret agreement where if he resigns he will be okay.               Honestly, I would put business registration last. Start with designing your website (which I assume you will need one, and will be attracting most of your customers online), and then give the idea a go. You can probably get a business number (say as a partnership first) and start operating your business. If you get a lot of users, then move on to registering. Don't wait time on incorporating/insurance/lawyers unless if you are planning to raise money.      Wouldn't it be annoying if it was a slack group with like hundreds of people?                I would consult a lawyer or the government.         why isn't Canada a part of this?            1. Building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) is easy. Knowing which assumptions to validate is not.  2. Nailing an MVP fast involves a certain degree of luck. It takes time to find the right distribution channels.  3. Learning to code is not essential, but its important and helpful when you cant hire/find technical talent.  4. Entrepreneurship is learning to live in a constant state of uncertainty. Yes, endless doubts every single day.  5. A great MVP is finding people like yourself and build/ join a community around that interest.  6. The success of a product can be highly dependent on its design at the first stages of a startup.  7. Great design comes with great understanding of a problem. How it works not how it looks Jobss motto, is what matters.  8. Arrogance kills you and your relationships. Then your startup dies.  9. Learning curves are underestimated. A lot of time in startups goes into learning how to do new things you ignored and cant hire people to do.  10. Motivation is hard. Keeping your team motivated comes from you being motivated. Startups dont run on cash only but on morale too.  11. Startups are creative organizations that might turn into businesses one day. Many startup investors think they invest in the latter.  12. Build something for yourself is dangerous advice, you risk building something only you want. It is fun though.  13. Finding liquidity in startups is hard. Its almost unethical to take money from friends, fools and family without product market fit.  14. San Francisco can be the cheapest city on earth for a startup founder. The benefit-cost ratio when meeting the right people is extremely high.  15. Rejection, not failure, is the default state of startups (from market, family and investors). Its not personal, do not mix emotions with business.  16. Building a company is not the same as managing a company. In the beginning, the most important thing is managing yourself.  17. Leadership is a daily decision. Doing what you say, setting the example and inspiring others is what matters.  18. Mixing hobbies and passion with work can backfire. Money pressure can take the beauty out of anything. Mastering the balance is an art.  19. There are no startup experts. Every startup is related to the uniqueness of their founders. Be wary of startup experts.  20. The best startup pieces of advice Ive found are stories from other founders. Taking the best out of them and learning is a continuous challenge.  21. Starting a startup is a gamble. The more educated the gamble the better. Its important to know the history of your industry.  22. Networking is most effective when you can bring value to the network. Most people just want to extract value.  23. Focus on your strengths is a luxury for startups. Its the biggest excuse not to do something youre startup needs because you ignore how to do it.  24. Venture capital is helpful but can be addictive. Its hurtful when you dont have it and think you need it.  25. Being delusional kills startups. Most founders are delusional. Meditation helps.  26. Capital does not precede success, it works the other way around.  27. Try not to spend a week without talking or listening to people who are successful at what they do.  28. Almost every design fault or bug can be fixed with great customer service.  29. If you want to become something hang out with people who are already that something.  30. If you want an audience be part of the audience first.  https://medium.com/@romo/30-startup-lessons-d9e262c5cc8d      I think this will prevent a lot of people from using, or trying, your service. I don't have amazon, and I probably won't get one just for your site. I suggest maybe add Paypal/other payment methods, or at least make the trial one available for non-amazon users.

"Accessing capital to start a business can be a daunting process, especially for entrepreneurs who start out with a great idea but have no real familiarity with the business world." --Gavin Newsom, lieutenant governor of California  2.

"You read a book from beginning to end. You run a business the opposite way. You start with the end, and then you do everything you must to reach it." --Harold S. Geneen, president of ITT Corporation  4. "Timing, perseverance, and 10 years of trying will eventually make you look like an overnight success." --Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter  5. "I never get the accountants in before I start up a business. It's done on gut feeling, especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer." --Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group  6.

As you work through the Start a Business Step-by-Step Workbook, you will define the company's mission, decide what business entity is right for your business, name your business, determine the pricing for your products or services, formulate your financial projections, define your competitors, survey consumers regarding your products or services, determine the marketing methods right for your business, and more." --Jeanne A. Estes, author of Start a Business Step-by-Step Workbook  7. "Patience, drive, and very little fear." --Jake Nickell, the owner of Threadless.com, describing what it takes to start a company  8. "The problem is that many entrepreneurs start with good intentions to create a new mindset system but then slack off. The solution is to make that system part of your daily routine." --Lisa A. Mininni, president of ExcellerateAssociates.com  9. "When the need to succeed is as bad as the need to breathe, then you'll be successful." --Eric Thomas, The Grind Coach  10. "In order to be a success in business, there is one thing you must do. You cannot be successful without it. That is work. I have not told you anything new. Everyone knows that you cannot be successful in anything without work. Why doesn't everyone work? Because some lack the one thing that makes men want to work: enthusiasm. That is something no one can give you. You must acquire it yourself, and the only way that you can become enthusiastic about anything is to have a thorough knowledge of it. You have never seen an enthusiastic man who was lazy." --Thomas J. Watson, CEO of IBM  11. "Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work." --Thomas Edison, inventor  12. "I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the nonsuccessful ones is pure perseverance." --Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple  13. "Openly share and talk to people about your idea. Use their lack of interest or doubt to fuel your motivation to make it happen." --Todd Garland, founder of BuySellAds.com  14. "Success and profitability are outcomes of focusing on customers and employees, not objectives." --Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Alibaba Group  15. "Grow with discipline. Balance intuition with rigor. Innovate around the core. Don't embrace the status quo." --Howard Schultz, CEO and chairman of Starbucks  16. "You have to have more leadership, less management. It's about getting stuff done. You can sit around and analyze things forever, but while you do that the competition has moved on." --Peter Vesterbacka, creator of Angry Birds  17. "You have to be ready for hard work and frugal spending to get the idea off the ground." --Garrett Camp, founder of Expa, Uber, and StumbleUpon  18. "I believe that this is the age of the entrepreneur, and as job security has increasingly become a thing of the past, we have no choice but to become self-reliant. Small business is the foundation of growth in America, and it starts with one person, with one vision." --Gary Bredow, host and creator of The Start Up Show  19. "For me, the most fun is change or growth. There are definitely elements of both that I like. Launching a business is kind of like a motorboat: You can go very quickly and turn fast." --Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos  20. "Your reputation is more important than your paycheck, and your integrity is worth more than your career." --Angelo Sotira, co-founder of DeviantArt  21. "There is only one boss: the customer. And he can fire everybody in the company, from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else." --Sam Walton, founder of Walmart and Sam's Club  22. "Recessions are the best time to start a company. Companies fail. Others hold back capital. If you are willing to do the preparation and work, it is the best time to invest in yourself and start a business." --Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks  23. "The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It's as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer." --Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari  24. "A business model that hasn't been tried before is always interesting, even if it's likely to fail." --Michael Arrington, co-founder of TechCrunch  25. "You have chosen the wrong path if it's not fun. And you are probably not taking enough risk if it's not hard and rocky sometimes." --Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce  26. "Running a startup is like being punched in the face repeatedly, but working for a large company is like being waterboarded." --Paul Graham, co-founder of Viaweb  27. "Embrace what you don't know, especially in the beginning, because what you don't know can become your greatest asset. It ensures that you will absolutely be doing things different from everybody else." --Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx  28. "What do you need to start a business? Three simple things: Know your product better than anyone. Know your customer, and have a burning desire to succeed." --Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's  29. "It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day hard work of running a business and completely forget that, while solving problems and building something you can be proud of, you also have an incredible opportunity to shape the future. Even better, you have the chance to meet amazing people and do amazing things along the way. It's important not to get lost among the trees and forget about the amazing, beautiful forest you're planting." --Colin Wright, author  30. "Starting your own business is like riding a roller coaster. There are highs and lows, and every turn you take is another twist. The lows are really low, but the highs can be really high. You have to be strong, keep your stomach tight, and ride along with the roller coaster that you started." --Lindsay Manseau, photographer  31. "You need to be surrounded by good advisers, but you also need to trust your instinct." --Chris Hughes, co-founder of Facebook  32. "Don't limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do. You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can achieve." --Mary Kay Ash, founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics  33. "Follow the cream of the crop in your area of online expertise and learn from them. Network with them." --Mark Forrester, director and producer  34. "Don't take too much advice. Most people who have a lot of advice to give--with a few exceptions--generalize whatever they did. Don't overanalyze everything. I myself have been guilty of overthinking problems. Just build things and find out if they work." --Ben Silbermann, co-founder of Pinterest  35. "Execution really shapes whether your company takes off or not. A lot of people start out with an exciting thing and they want to take over the world, but really the people who do take over the world have a good plan of how to get there and the steps along the way." --Pete Cashmore, founder of Mashable  36. "Be a user of your own product. Make it better based on your own desires. But don't trick yourself into thinking you are the user." --Evan Williams, former CEO of Twitter  37. "You just have to pay attention to what people need and what has not been done." --Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Records  38. "Whatever you do, be different. That was the advice my mother gave me, and I can't think of better advice for an entrepreneur. If you're different, you will stand out." --Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop  39. "I think it's very important that whatever you're trying to make or sell or teach has to be basically good. A bad product and you know what? You won't be here in 10 years." --Martha Stewart, founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia  40. "The one thing that I think is critical in the entrepreneurial spirit is that it's all attitude. If you think you can, then you're half way there. If you say, 'I can't,' then you're defeated." --Debbi Fields, founder of Mrs. Fields Cookies  41. "An entrepreneur tends to bite off a little more than he can chew, hoping he'll quickly learn how to chew it." --Roy Ash, co-founder of Litton  42. "The very first company I started failed with a great bang. The second one failed a little bit less, but still failed. The third one, you know, proper failed, but it was kind of OK. I recovered quickly. Number four almost didn't fail. It still didn't really feel great, but it did OK. Number five was PayPal." --Max Levchin, co-founder of Affirm  43. "It's harder, but we're still finding oil in Oklahoma today. The bar has been raised on startup companies, but it can still be done. Every regulation and every rule limits you, but, yes, it can still be done. That's the beauty of living in a free country and having the freedom to have an idea and become an entrepreneur." --Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources  44. "It's hard to tell with these internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money. I can tell you, though: If they don't really want to build a company, they won't luck into it. That's because it's so hard that if you don't have a passion, you'll give up." --Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple  45. "I love what the Valley does. I love company building. I love startups. I love technology companies. I love new technology. I love this process of invention. Being able to participate in that as a founder and a product creator, or as an investor or a board member, I just find that hugely satisfying." --Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape  46. "Entrepreneurs always pitch their idea as 'the X of Y,' so this is going to be 'the Microsoft of food.' And yet disruptive innovations usually don't have that character. Most of the time, if something seems like a good idea, it probably isn't." --Eric Ries, Silicon Valley entrepreneur  47. "Libraries function as crucial technology hubs, not merely for free Web access, but for those who need computer training and assistance. Library business centers help support entrepreneurship and retraining." --Scott Turow, author and lawyer  48. "President Obama's view of a free economy is to send your money to his friends. My vision for a free enterprise economy is to return entrepreneurship and genius and creativity to the American people!" --Mitt Romney, politician  49. "Free enterprise empowers entrepreneurs who have ideas and imagination, investors who take risks, and workers who hone their skills and offer their labor." --Paul Ryan, politician  50. "The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation, and the great goal of the conservative movement, as it rose to triumph in the 1980s, was to remove that threat--to keep OSHA, the EPA, and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace." --Thomas Frank, political analyst  http://www.inc.com/john-brandon/50-quotes-on-starting-a-small-business-from-scratch.html                  Thanks for the clarification!  Can you should me when it was posted? I looked under new and didn't find it (I could be blind).  Also, how should I know if something has been posted before? I remember that when I submit links that has been posted already, it will take me to that link. Did this feature get disabled?   Hi,  I didn't quite understand the rule. Did I repost something that someone else posted 2 weeks ago?  Thanks         I use Firefox; I think the issue I am having is all the cap letter   the background colour that makes it difficult for the eye.   I think you should adjust the font, the homepage banner (with all the capital letters) are really hard to read for me.   At my age (Im 38), Im not claiming to know everything (or to be an expert in anything for that matter), but I do believe Ive learned a few things. As I approach my 40s, I thought Id share the lessons (sometimes hard) that Ive learnedand earned:  1. Nobody cares about what you say, only what you do. 2. Funding is not the end, only the beginning. 3. Once you take on funding, the stress gets worse, not better. 4. Dont beg for investment dollars. Theyre paying to be your partner, not the other way around. 5. Arrogant and disrespectful investors will never be good partners. Ignore them. 6. Never, ever, ever, pay to pitch. 7. TechCrunch is overrated. Unless you sell to startups, it doesnt do shit. Its good for the ego though. 8. Some people only care about people who they think are popular. Theyll only acknowledge you when you appear to be more connected then they are. Get rid of these people. 9. Some people only like you for what you can do for them. Pay them no mind. 10. Accelerators are only good for funding and meeting new friends. Is that what 6-8% equity is worth to you? 11. Take a job if you have to. You will not lose your will to be an entrepreneur for doing so. 12. Take huge risks in your 20s. Take calculated risks in your 30s. 13. If you have an idea that keeps you up at night, do something with it. If not, it will always only be a dream. 14. Its okay to be driven by money at first. Once you have it, youll find your true motivation. 15. Non-techies: If your tech cofounder says its going to take three months or more, theyre lying. 16. If your tech cofounder says they cant use existing code, cut ties immediately. 17. If your non-tech founder says they cant sell X until you build Y, theyre making excuses for not working. 18. Sales are everything. Nothing else matter. Nothing. 19. Learn something new every day. One thing at least. 20. Even if you dont publish it. 21. Marketing isnt luck, its hustle. 22. Press isnt magic, its hustle. 23. Always partner up, never partner down. 24. Do something uncomfortable as often as you can. 25. Failing is part of growing. Very little of what you do is actually going to work, embrace it. 26. .coms are still the best domain you can get. Its probably worth the price. 27. Things are never as bad as you imagine them to be. 28. It doesnt matter where your startup resides. Its only you that care. 29. Tech conferences are a waste of time, but fun. 30. Working all night is unnecessary. In fact, its detrimental. 31. Work/life balance it a real thing and necessary to succeed. 32. Dont wait until you succeed to start your family. 33. Stay competitive. 34. Talk to your customers every day. 35. Help every entrepreneur that you can. 36. Take every speaking opportunity that youve been offered. 37. ASCAlways stay curious. 38. Exude confidence and success. It translates.  What lessons would you add to the list?  http://pando.com/2015/03/04/startups-anonymous-38-things-every-startup-founder-should-know/   So then how does that help me get more press coverage? Why can't I just find a list of contacts (assuming that you are not the only place to find the 1400 journalists), and reach out to some of them?   This is completely not true. Amazon is a counterexample. I am sure there are plenty out there.   Aren't there a lot of tools already that you can filter/track certain keywords on twitter? How are you different?   you spelled sign in with twitter as sing in with twitter (blue button in the footer)   I see the concept, but not really sure why I should order from you instead of a local supermarket. Perhaps add some points about why you're special.   If you are worried that your idea gets taken, try to exchange some emails with him/her so that you have a written record of your idea, or keep a voice recording of your initial conversation (not sure if that's legal).   I would suggest get some traction first before you think about reaching out to any investors.                 	67

 Sure, here's some info:  I've always been on the thin side, when I first stared what resembled a workout routine I was a mere 5'11, 145lbs. Within the last year I have been in between 160-170lbs.  I was underweight for my age as well. Maintaining a good diet i.e. eating enough calories to maintain your level exercise and staying hydrated are critical for proper exercise. Without food   water exercise would, for me at least, just make my migraines worse.  My goals for exercise had nothing to do with migraines actually, I just wanted to put on some muscle before heading off to college. It took finding a good balance of cardio and weight lifting before (3 days of each I mentioned) while eating enough and drinking enough water before my migraines dwindled off. I imagine that if I had migraine elimination as a goal of exercise and the information I have now, they would've gone away sooner.  I will also mention that when I say "proper diet", I just mean eating enough to keep up with the calories you're burning in the gym and still gain muscle. I don't count calories or nutrients or anything like that, although I'm sure healthy eating would only help more.     I remember constantly being pushed more and more medication at the neurologist and doctor's visits when I was younger.... funny how the simplest things seem to work the best  	2
    I told them I was a Democrat voting for Obama, but I am still getting thier robo calls!   The original was one of National Geographic's most memorable photos.   I posted the Guide as it can be helpful, particularly in nonpartisan judges races when you don't know who they are.      http://nevadavoterguide.com/ This is the progressive guide.   I guess when Republicans were crying about voter fraud, they were talking about  their own members.  I haven't heard or read of one incident by Democrats, but have read about destroying ballots in mulitple states.   How about government which doesn't create jobs, but Romney will create 12 million jobs as President?   I saw my niece's photo yesterday volunteering in a Romney campaign hdqtrs.  She had two children under medicaid, although she is now married to the father.   Harry Reid is a Democrat and a Mormon.  I know other Mormon Democrats.   Want to come to my house?  My pool needs replastering and repair!   Romney is Bush on steroids.   I'm watching CNN now stating Romney won.  Drives me crazzzzzyyyy.   I have a friend who is a CPA AND is an Oracle programmer.  Travels everywhere she wants.   That I could have done better.   I love you Paul Krugman.   Wow.  A lot of comments!  A co-worker and I discussed it.  We would offer $1 million to each co-worker who would walk away with us that day.   1890 or 1990?   I like that.   They also didn't want the economy at that time.   Yes, it is one more form of corporate welfare.  People need a living wage.   Wow.  I appreciate you summarizing it like this.   I been doing that for 40 yrs.  Getting too tired.  Just hope others can take over in greater numbers.   I agree, and their sleasiness.   I haven't read the article, but there is still too much talk about the grand deal.  We need to change the premise first.   Who would have thought Bush would win a second term?  Yes, these guys will stop at nothing.  Did you read the article about Bain owning the company that supplies a lot of the voting machines?   The existing super rich will end up with it ALL.   JFK, RK and MLK assassinations, and who was behind the plot to overthrow FDR.   You are so right.  Now, how do we convince others?   This is common.  The Post Office is a good example.  Congress voted them to keep 70 years (or 80, I don't remember the details) in retirement funds, which meant they would not have enough money to operate today.  Then they blame the PO mgmt for not being able to meet today's expenses.   Didn't the last guy who was going to testify about the 2004 presidential race in Ohio die?      And I can't even get some of my closest friends or family to see.      i am so tired of them, and their baby-like tantrums.      I used to play Diplomacy, but you need 6-8 people to play and it can be a long game.   Awesome view.  You can see five mountains lined up out the window.  I got a photo too, but was on a clear day with blue skies.   It is my biggest scare.  I don't have a choice though - Romney who promises cuts to SS, and Obama who has shown indication to deal with the republicans on this issue.  The last time there was a ss compromise was a disaster for some of us.  I'm looking at my future ss cut of $400 due to the last agreement.  What will they do this time?   Doesn't matter.  There are still enough people to vote for him no matter what he says or what his policies are.                                                                                                                                                         I see these ads that you can build your own panels from factory seconds.  Has anyone done this, and does it work?                                                                                                                                                              	143
 Rude!   What if LoL had characters from anime like Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, etc. Kakashi's ult would be his sharingan and he could send the opponent champion anywhere on the map. Or from Fairy Tail Natsu's fire dragon roar would be his Q. Would take a million years in programming but worth it.   Yes, he wasn't a total monster but also I don't think he did anything deserving of what he got in the end. Even the really bad  things he did were justified and I think if many of us were in his place at the time, we would have done the same thing (assuming we're as clever as Walter White).   Really? How? You're right I do think they're the same thing.   Yeah, true. But it's still agreed upon that he killed her, don't you think so?   Anything can ruin lives, not just drugs. It's up to the consumer to say no, it's not up to the man trying to make a living. For all you know, meth could have enhanced the lives of a minority who would otherwise have nothing else.   One second. You don't think "justified" and "not wrong" are the same thing? Because I do.   I can't believe you writed that.  	8

From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_fly   Contrary to myth, crane flies do not bite humans, nor do they consume mosquitoes.

 And the guys (and gals) who work the tenders love ATON. Everyone I've ever met who worked a tender had been trying to get back to one.   I love how people forget that they USCG is the 5^th branch of the US Armed Services. If I recall correctly too, the High Endurance Cutters (Hamilton Class) were picked up by the USCG after being rejected by the US Navy as a ship design. Additionally, putting a CIWS right over the screw is a horrible fucking design.   If I had to guess, I would say that it looks like a nun buoy.   As a former Coastie, it warms my heart to see this! Thanks and keep up the great work!  I also managed to find all three of your easter eggs!   I highly doubt that. Even though they are law enforcement, every year their budget keeps getting cut and they can barely maintain their aging fleet.   Hopefully the tapes will be better this time around.   I'm now lurking in diaperfurs :P   Awesome! Thanks for the response!   Fantastic! I shall be joining both shortly!   Thank you! I shall check it out!   That's quite nice! And it looks really good on you!   That's sort of the problem with #biglittlepodcast on Rizon. It's great when the podcast is going on but for the most part, it's dead. I miss the old Yahoo chat groups :(   So freaking cute and adorable! Where did you get it?   Hello everyone. Does anyone know of any AB/DL specific IRC channels other than the one for the biglittlepodcast?   Amazing photos and costumes! Fun fact! In the book, the apprentice's name is [Michael Fisher](http://howlscastle.wikia.com/wiki/Michael_Fisher) and he's actually 15 years old.   Good for you! Even though Depends are generally disliked, they are a relatively cheap intro for adult diapers! Enjoy them!   I guess the question to ask yourself is "What are you looking to get out of all of this?" Her interests are rather small but her groups show that she's a member of a couple of AB/DL groups. So she's got some interests in the fetish even if nothing's listed in her profile. Another thing to bear in mind is that not everyone has a webcam. I know almost every laptop now has one built in, but if she has a desktop, there's no guarantee of a webcam. You could always ask if she's got an amazon wishlist and ask her to put a webcam on there that you could purchase for her too.    Hmmm... You might be able to find something that's fragrant free or you can try a corn starch based powder. However, you can help cut down on the smell by applying a bit less and rubbing it in. I've found that even though we can be paranoid because WE know we're diapered, most everyone else either doesn't know or if they smell it, won't care. I went to school with a gentleman who would dust his crotch with baby powder every day to help cut down on chafing.   TO sorta quote Spacey: "Tell them if it will further enhance your relationship." If you think it will make things between you even better, then tell her!    One thing I would recommend is to give your body like 30 minutes or so to air out each day. Letting your diaper area breathe a bit each day will help cut down on rashes. Also, lots of powder and/or oil or lotion. Which ever you prefer. Other wise enjoy it! What's your go-to diaper for daily wear and wearing at night?       At first, it seemed to be a bit cobbled together, but it's become much smoother. I feel that happens to any podcast though as they figure out what's going on and how they want things to run/flow. As for content, I love hearing the behind the stories of some of reddit's biggest celebrities. I also feel that things like banana for scale and such are so fleeting that it's like trying to hype up pogs. There one minute and gone the next. Personally though, I like hearing about the minutia and little bits of trivia that not everyone might not know about stories and people.   I've enjoyed this podcast! I'm starting to get into listening to podcasts and this is one of my favourites! Keep up the good work and I can't wait to listen to next weeks!    I love the composition of old and new.   Out of everything there... I want your shoes :P   I wish you both the best in this!   Great choices! Personally, I'm not a fan of Molis anymore but that's because it seems all of the padding always clumps down to the middle.   And time to save this page to the Diaper Supply folder!   So freaking cute!!!    I haven't tried it, but would love to. Even if there's no milk. I think it would put me in little headspace pretty quickly.   I wore cloth as a kid. My brother was the one to wear disposables... I might be able to make a small cloth diaper for her.   True, but it would look better than a 24/7 on her :P  I'm not in a rush though. But I love the idea of making my own!  	31
 What was your question again?   In regards to the minimum wage, balance the equation. I'm not against it, I'm just saying that the additional money that a restaurant or business has to pay an employee DOES have to come from somewhere.   The ratio of the national debt to the U.S. GDP isn't high compared to historic levels.   The idea is that a free or low cost education would be incentive for more people to get post-high school degrees, thereby attracting companies with a smarter, more capable workforce. This in turn would increase salaries and result in higher tax revenues.   Yes, and thanks for a better explanation than mine.   My response assumes you're referring to the U.S. economy.  The U.S. borrows at an incredibly low interest rate, in the tenths of percent. That's because the creditworthiness of the U.S. is high. People like buying U.S. debt because it's a safe place to park their money.  The U.S. gets enormous benefit from this. Let's say you make a really cool widget out of your garage. By yourself you make one a day. A rich uncle is willing to loan you $500,000 at 0.15% interest. You can use that money to buy more equipment, hire and train workers. Now you are earning 10X or 100X what you were earning before, AND employing people. That's a multiplier effect on your GDP. You'd be stupid not to take the money.  The U.S. uses debt to build roads, networks, satellites and pays for research that benefits everyone, and a military to protect all of it. In other words, that debt helps the producers produce more in a safe and fairly well regulated market.   You would have a really hard time pushing off with your toes without it so it would limit your ability to walk or run and make it more difficult to stay balanced on difficult or moving surfaces.   But isn't the ACA free-market?   Sound waves are compressed as two objects are moving towards each other so the frequency will sound higher. Your ear doesn't know that the object is moving towards you (or you are moving towards it, or both). Likewise, the frequency lowers when the objects are moving away from each other.           Love me some steak tartare.   This example is about lying after receiving immunity. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for? You may not get charged with making a false statement if you have more serious charges in front of you, but it wouldn't look good for you if the case made it to court.  11th Circuit Court of Appeals:  *Giving a false statement is an independent criminal act that occurs when the individual makes the false statement; it is separate from the events to which the statement relates, the matter being investigated...We agree with the circuits that have addressed this issue before us and have determined that Garrity-insulated statements regarding past events under investigation must be truthful to avoid future prosecution for such crimes as perjury and obstruction of justice. Garrity protection is not a license to lie or to commit perjury.*  http://www.officer.com/article/10249451/lying-under-emgarrity-em-immunity     Dude, it sounds like she is way needy for affirmation. That's why she needs you to affirm that you still put her on a pedestal and I suspect that's also why she had the affair.   It's a double-edge sword. It may be part of why you were attracted to her to begin with (that she needs constant affection from you) but it appears that, like any drug, its effect wears off and she will go looking for more affection from other places. Until she gets some psychological help to understand why she went looking for the thrill in the first place, I'd be pretty careful.  But then, if she somehow fixes what is wrong with her, she may not be the same person you fell in love with.   You are right with your example. If the act of drinking itself is a crime then you don't have to admit to it. It's the same as pleading not guilty to a judge even though you did commit the crime; you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. What is a crime is falsely telling a law enforcement officer that you were at home when he asks if you were at the bar, or giving them a fictitious name, etc.   The golden rule:  He who has the gold makes the rules.   Corollary: When somebody gets to make up rules, they don't fuck themselves.   I just found this and got caught up. Holy shit.   In every jurisdiction I know of in the United States, it is a crime to lie to any law enforcement.   Perhaps your memory swap file.   I don't think there's any difference because the FBI is also subject to state and local code wherever they are working. Now the CIA, that's different.   Compass headings aren't accurate enough for cross country flight, especially when you have crosswinds (meaning the aircraft's nose is pointed in a different direction than it's actually flying. General aviation (private pilots mostly) use a lot of dead reckoning (i.e. looking out the old window). Commercial aircraft flying at high altitudes tune in to radio beacons called NDBs, VORs (and even AM radio stations) and they sort of zig-zag across the country flying straight from radio tower to radio tower.   Nice boobs for sure, but a lot of women have nice boobs. She also has a perfect face. That's why her work is pretty much only print. She doesn't have to talk, remember any lines, get the timing right. They can airbrush the shit out of everything else.   The original question has been answered but I'll just add some mildly interesting trivia. The # symbol (pound symbol, hashmark) came from the latin custom of writing lb (for libra pondo) with a line through it to signify that it is an abbreviation, like this: ~~lb~~  Through messy handwriting, it morphed into the hashtag symbol we know today:  #.   Mexicans are caucasian.   A securely encrypted way to join two different locations together as if they were on one network. No, it does not allow you to browse incognito. That's not what it's for. It's popular use is to connect a satellite office or a remote PC to a main office network. Connection is authenticated and data packets are encrypted.   I take it that they use these terms with no sense of irony?   Because there are cultures that value plumpness and even obesity. Some examples are pacific islanders and certain nomadic desert tribes.   Power (Watts) = Potential (Volts) x Flow (Current)  I'm rewriting my explanation to make it applicable to solar panels.... hold on.  Solar panels are rated in watts. A good analogy is water coming through your garden hose and you've got your thumb on the end of it. Your thumb is the resistance (ohms). When you increase your thumb's resistance, you increase the water pressure (which is comparable to volts) and decrease the volume (which is comparable to amps). Your municipal water pumping station is like the wattage. A more powerful pump (higher watts) will increase the water pressure and/or water flow.   Evolution has nothing to do with this. It's all social conditioning.   747s, when unloaded, can stop perty quick using thrust reversal.   I need my PornHub when I'm in between shifts mining dilithium on Mars.   The three Constitutional amendments that give the Supreme Court authority are:  * The 5th and 14th:  Equal protection.  * The 10th: Federal powers  In other words, States can define marriage but not in any way that would violate Constitutional protections. They can, for example, set minimum-age requirements, who can or cannot perform the ceremony, divorce laws, but they can't discriminate by telling people who they can marry (Loving v. Virginia).   Public schools are funded from tax revenue and generally must accept everyone who lives within their district. It's a lengthy and almost impossible process to kick someone out of public school. Public schools are governed by an elected school board.  Private schools get no funding from tax revenue. There is an application process and it's easy to kick someone out. They are not required to administer any of the standardized tests that public schools do.  Charter schools are public schools with an application process. They receive a predetermined amount of money per student that they accept and it's generally fairly easy to kick someone out. They must also perform all testing required by state and federal laws. Charter schools are governed by their own boards established by their own bylaws.   Frying in oil produces a crispy texture because it has a high boiling point. Unlike potato chips, fries and tater tots aren't cooked to the point of driving all moisture out. They retain some moisture. As soon as you take them out of the fryer the moisture starts to affect the texture of the food. The longer you wait the worse it gets. The refrigerator just makes more moisture collect on the surface since less of it evaporates in the cold air.   In Utah they used a variation of the "Please, think of the children" theme. The Utah AG's office argued to the court that the State has an interest in promoting child birth and stable families, and that same-sex marriages hurts the institution and somehow dissuades opposite-sex couples from marrying.  Never mind that:  * There are opposite-sex couples who can't conceive, yet are still granted marriage licenses.  * Divorce rates and the number of single-parent households are higher than ever under current marriage laws.   Thanks everyone for the responses. Gave me stuff to think about that I hadn't considered before.   I'm having lustful thoughts.   In many of the videos they outnumber their armed executors so why do they accept their fate?   The IRS is trying to clamp down on undeclared income by telling businesses to get W9s and issue 1099s to their contractors. Businesses are erring on the side of caution and getting W9s from almost everyone who they hired to even do small jobs like fix a computer or clean the carpet. It's a bit ridiculous but it's probably working.   Speaking of once-young actresses, what the hell happened to Alyssa Milano? I'm super depressed after seeing a photo of her at the Golden Globes.   My agreement includes a statement saying that additional costs may be incurred to acquire rights. Any fonts that I have to purchase I just put into the invoice.   People believe it's illegal because they believe the President is ignoring immigration law and creating policies that fly in the face of Congress.   Make a lot of money.   They may cost more to make but they also go out of circulation pretty quickly so it's a great benefit to the government and helps keep inflation down.  When you get a penny and you put it in your jar, the U.S. Government thanks you.   Passenger   It would look like Folgers.    First night after the divorce or the separation before divorce?

It is easy to learn, to read and pronounce, has straightforward grammatical rules with few exceptions, is rooted in latin, efficient, expressive, melodic (some of the most beautiful operas are sung in Italian).   It does seem to be fairly common in most cities in western civilization.    What city is that?   Not the ever after one. The one that may only take a couple minutes.    I realize that the dictionary is not the legal code, and I'm not a lawyer. Just wondering what people thought and what the law says in different places around the world.    Sex, as defined by dictionary.com, is coitus. By that, a happy ending doesn't qualify.       Great info. Thanks.   NO is a pretty successful political strategy.   /r/askreddit?   An educated guess, but I honestly didn't know for sure.   When you're talking dollar bills.   It's not easy. I lost my mom suddenly. I feel for you. It does ease over time. After over 5 years I've gone from thinking about her 50 times a day to about once every other day.      There is a book full of these kinds of poems called "I saw Esau."   A star releases its energy in all directions at once so you can see its light from any position.  Photons more or less travel straight (a photon has mass, as Einstein has taught us, so it actually bends course due to gravity as it passes by objects, but on our human scale, it goes straight). You can not see a focused beam unless your eyeball is in its path. Think of a laser pointer.      Incomplete compared to what we know today, but not wrong. Evolution (speciation) was well known prior to Charles Darwin. What Darwin did was explain how it worked. Prior to Origin of the Species, people thought, for example, that giraffes stretched their necks through the process of reaching for the leaves on the upper branches of trees and passed this on to their offspring. Darwin came up with the theory of natural selection, that mutations (they were thought of as natural variations at that time) which gave an individual a small advantage would be passed on while variations that decreased survival would obviously decrease the chances that individual would produce offspring.   Money is probably the greatest economic invention of all time. It lets people get things that they need without actually having to trade for it, and to let people become specialists which accelerated technological advancement.  Before money, there were no people who only were masons because they would go hungry since they would have to trade work directly to a farmer for food. After money, the farmer paid the mason, which allowed him to focus on farming without having to know how to build his house. The mason took the money and paid toolmakers who then paid other farmers for their food.  Humans being what they are, a moneyless society would break down pretty fast because there would always be slackers who just rely on asking others for help without giving much effort in return.   Bold red wines have high levels of tannins at bottling time. The tannins, which help preserve the wine, come from the grape skins as well as the oak barrels during secondary fermentation. The grape skins and the oak add complexity but the tannins are so astringent that you will have a more difficult time tasting the subtleties. The tannins break down over time (depolymerize) to reveal the wine's nature.  You can help a young high-tannin wine be more drinkable by decanting it to introduce a lot of oxygen which depolymerizes the tannins. If you want to do this instantly, use a blender (seriously, works great).   Because the value of a car depreciates rapidly. If you finance a car, you are more likely to justify purchasing a new or newer model based on your monthly payments. If you pay cash, you are more likely to purchase a used car where the money you lose through depreciation is significantly less than any income you would have gained from the interest by investing the difference. If you even invest it at all.   The amount of debt compared to GNP/GDP is quite low. The two aren't independent. The U.S. debt helps us push GDP to its high levels because it funds education grants to make smarter citizens, police and regulatory agencies to help ensure competition, tax incentives to build factories that employ people, roads to transport goods, and a military to protect that economic engine and keep it humming.   It depends on the bread recipe too. Ever tasted old butter? Staleness is mostly caused by fats getting oxidized. Breads that have no fat (like bagels) won't taste stale but they dry out, lose their texture and harden faster.  By the way, the same applies to meats. Ever wondered why meat stews and chilis can last in a fridge but grilled steak, even wrapped tight, doesn't? The meat in a stew is covered by liquid which inhibits oxidation of the fats.   I think it mostly depends on the speaker design. A speaker can cap the voltage with a small circuit. It still sounds like shit for exactly the same reason but it won't cause any damage.   I did a solo trip to go see Graceland in Memphis. I brought a tape recorder just to record my thoughts while driving. I photographed people that I talked to and recorded our conversations. I told them I was researching for a book. It was an unforgettable experience.    On the positive side, you don't have to see the players you've cut every day.    CharlieKillsRats has the only correct answer so far.  Look at this way:  Imagine you're a widget craftsman making widgets in your garage. You're not in any debt and you make a decent living producing 1 widget a day. Now imagine that you're also a cool dude that has always paid his bills on time so tons of people want to give you money so you can build a factory and hire workers, and they only want a couple points interest because you're so trustworthy. You will increase your earnings 10X, maybe 100X, and you're going to employ a whole bunch of people. You'd be stupid not to take the money.  That's the U.S. economy to the outside world. Except they are willing to accept as little as 0.22% interest (that's actually the 1 year t-bill rate right now).  The difference between countries like the U.S. and Germany as opposed to many other "first world" countries is that the U.S. actually does a great job converting debt into production. This encourages more people to invest, which accelerates the productivity, keeps standard of living high and interest rates low.   The two things that the amplifier supplies the speaker is voltage level and frequency. When you play too loud, it's not the frequency that is too high for the speaker but the voltage level.  Frequency determines how quickly the speaker cone moves back and forth creating low pitch (slow oscillation) or high pitch (fast oscillation). The voltage level determines how *FAR* the speaker moves during the oscillation, which determines how loud or soft the sound is.  If the amplifier overdrives the speaker, distortion happens because the speaker cone can't go any further, i.e. it maxes out. Instead of the air molecules moving in a smooth wave, there are sharp corners. These sharp corners don't sound good.   I was a non-teaching male coach of the girls soccer program at a Catholic high school, and I'm not even Catholic. So I was as outside as can be. I was an assistant when the previous head coach retired and that's how I got the job. Winning a couple of state championships and having a nationally ranked team didn't hurt either.  1. Get a teacher on staff to be a liaison. This is invaluable. They help arrange buses, get grades to you, take care of last minute changes, help get the word out, and their room is a place to hold meetings and for kids to put stuff or hang out while waiting for games to start.  2. Since you're not at the school full time, it's hard for parents to come to you so go out of your way to make yourself available to parents. Find some way to have weekly "office hours."  3. Plan. Plan. Plan. Set your game and practice schedule as early as possible. Arrange the buses. Have it in writing and published to the school and parents.  4. Get good team parents (team moms, if you aren't PC). Have them handle parental liaison as much as possible:  Fundraising, uniform orders, team dinners, barbecues, playoff special events.  5. Make sure you go to all the athletic staff meetings. The other teacher-coaches will appreciate you more. Go to their games and support them. Be a part of the school, not just your particular team. You score big points when parents and students see you in the crowd as a supporter.  6. Make sure you thank the teachers that help you or come to your games. They will in turn support your players in school. This is huge for the kids and since you're not a teacher there, they aren't going to get those platitudes from you during the day.  6. I'm sure I'll think of more....   Depends on how important it is to either of you. That said, a regular church-goer wouldn't work for me.   Eye contact.    And nice legs.   No, the photo will be out of focus for everyone because it was out of focus on the film plane due to your manual focusing without wearing glasses.  The viewfinder should have a diopter adjuster to let you compensate for this. If you wear your glasses you should also push back the rubber cup around the viewfinder so your eyeball is about the same distance away as without glasses.   Helmets only reduce surface injuries like fractures, lacerations and contusions. They do very little to reduce brain injuries because that occurs when the brain impacts the inside of the skull.  If you hit your head hard enough to cause a concussion, all that force will get transmitted to your brain regardless of whether you have a helmet on or not. You may not crack your skull though, so that's good enough reason to wear a helmet.   Emails are fine but are easier to brush aside so follow up if you don't hear from them.   Normally aspirated (ie non-turbo) car engines get their power from compression and so are sensitive to ambient air pressure. Aircraft engines do not. They get their thrust from ignition exhaust. To understand why airplanes work better at 40,000 feet, you have to understand how they fly.  There is a relationship between thrust, drag, altitude and ground speed. Lift causes drag and to keep an airplane in the air, you must have enough thrust to overcome that drag. A plane's cruising *airspeed* for any given burn rate is the same regardless of the altitude. What changes with altitude is *ground speed*. (Disregarding winds)  At lower altitudes, the air density is high thus creating a lot of drag which slows down the plane and results in lower ground speed. At higher altitudes and lower air density, the drag is significantly lower thus allowing the aircraft to fly at a much faster ground speed. 30,000-40,000 feet are well within the normal abilities of the engine to maintain cruise and climb.  TL;DR:  Airplanes get thrust from igniting fuel in a combustion chamber, not from compression. Less drag at 40,000 feet from lower air density means faster ground speed, less flying time and less fuel burned on the trip.  Me:  Private pilot.   If you're a franchisee, a gift card sale doesn't go to your bottom line. It's net-zero because the cost of goods is 100%--all of it goes to corporate. They will reimburse you when you actually sell a grande latte. So in other words, you sell gift cards as a duty to the franchise even though you don't make a dime from it unless it's stipulated contractually that you get some percentage.   Ignore the ads. Even advertised jobs are likely to go to somebody who knows somebody. Seriously, large companies always have openings that aren't currently advertised, or they can make one for somebody who they like.  If you're terrified, tell them so. Say "I just got in town and I found your company. I really like your culture but coming in here to talk to you is something that would normally terrify me." Nothing wrong with that.  Good luck, and let me know how it goes!   Humans are social creatures. Humor greases social interaction and gets you in the club/clan/whatever. Subjective humor is just adapting humor to a community whose culture may "get it" whereas others may not.  Example:  Fart humor isn't subjective. It's always funny. /r/watchpeopledie may be funny to a group who would likely get along with each other fairly well, but not very funny to others.  	84
 L96. Love the grip 3   Haha me too :D   Same with me bro :P   Nah, I just got myself Sony Vegas and needed something to make a video of :P      Ty. Haha yeah :P   Thanks for the response mate :D   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flYQIC3-ndk   That was AWESOME! :)   Taric main here, thank you! :D      	11
 try to hold you breath for 5 min to discover what your body have to say about safeness of CO2.   CO2 from fizzy drink finally end up in your liver after pass the guts. And than start making trouble for breathing cells. CO2 is  a bit toxic so better drink it flat.   You have still big problem with rising concentration of carbon dioxide in you lungs - what make you filling like you are drowning.   Remember Marcin, you have to develop extract process for it! You could say: look how much we have hydrogen in the oceans let use it us clean energy for good of all mankind!  But devil siting in details.   bravo, we support you!   I assume you aren't farm boy - so, you should be very careful before you make you decision how you going to do farm work (unless it recreation farm).  After my graduation I used to be an organic farmer and most important lesson I'd learn was that you don't need PhD or graduation to do this job even more this is mostly useless balance and even simpleton farm boy was much better on this area then me.   Really small changes what, how, and when you doing could have really big impact for effects. How to start?  Every thing depend what you decided to growing on your farm, will be this some sort of organic, permaculture production?  I don't want to criticized Marcin's achievement (they did great job) but their farming set isn't ready yet - first you couldn't do all sort of farming jobs on your fields, second: as I came a cross information from replicants, tractor need some sort of repairing wheels after less then 20 miles of run on the road (where it have much less to do than on the field) - (if I'm wrong or miss understanding some info: Marcin, please correct me quickly). I hope they are going to test this sets on the their fields this year - it's spring perfect time for that. And if you couldn't count on some donations you have to concentrate on production where efficiency is the master. Building community - that's very interesting but much more complicated then starting farming from scratch. Believe me, even here I got my own experience (my idea to organic farming doesn't come from blue sky).  If you interesting in subjects I only just touched, let me know - I'll be more then happy to help you.    it's not necessary to be such negative dude!  Do you like to give strong, controversial opinion with little knowledge about subject?   Marcin, I got a question about microhouse - why you guys make so complicated carpentry job for it? I hope you still here and in the future you will be able to spare couple hours per week/month/or something   for little chat like today. I have to add I appreciate what you done however in some points I got different opinions.   I'm sorry for that. Several years ago I had accident at work - I lose a finger tip. The worst thing was when docs wanted cat off half of the rest - to make me better - treating me that later they will amputate whole. I refused. After 2-3 weeks I went back to work.  I;m afraid your father hand will be  very, very over sensitive. Up to 3 years each touch this place is really unpleasant.             What is sens for virus to carry antibiotics resistance gen? Attacked cell will be destroyed anyway doesn't matter of antibiotics presence.    As far as I now antibiotics works only against bacteria.  For viruses is another class of antivirus drugs.   great link thx               yep, it's rare disease and still 40 million Americans suffer from it. So, how many got to suffer to be common illness?   So, it's look like for me:  - if you got pain in your foot - they can amputate you leg, if you got headache they can cut your head off.  Brilliant treatment.          you can use this as downlink and 2.5GHz(or so) wireless as uplink cos most of data is downloaded. Speed down on virgin broadband is 30Mbps and up only 2Mbps. Maybe in USA suburbs is not a problem but I got in UK constantly 17 different  wireless in my range and as I remember 2.5GHz band has 11 channels but only 3 are independent. That's mean if you can see more then 3 you have overlapping transmissions.     	25
 Respond to the side decks with anti side deck cards   But Ya. We voted against the gas tax indexing. Voters will hate gas tax increases and higher taxes to pay for the billion+ dollars in necessary equipment and construction costs.      Yes. GX is better than 5Ds based on theme song, actors' voices, and plot line, but it is a bit rushed.    I am not a fan of pendulum decks, but if there was one to be hyped about.... It would be DDD and D/D.    Yes. Then, resell.    It will go down because supply will increase in the future.    People are not going to sell their LC to flood the market again. There is an incentive to do so, but considering how valuable this card is....and there is only one way to get it.... It is really hard for people to get it in the first place. Also, the price is increasing because demand for it is increasing. Volcanic Deck hype. Supply isn't really increasing and there is a finite amount at the moment.    Oh Geez.... An Oligophy on Lavalval Chain maybe....   How did North Carolina elect this Senator? really?   Well, it is better to buy singles, since the full boxes have a lot of random cards that people don't really need. Buying full boxes is good when the product is first released, so people can sell the singles earlier for market power.    Yes, but it should be a minimum of 3 batters.   3 outs do make an inning for a team.   Because it is not very effective.   I could see DDD decks becoming stronger with more support.    How do you know if sets are out of circulation?   Right....The Revs will continue to lose XD   If you located in an area without many people to trade or sell, you will sell damaged cards because it is the only source of cards.    Yes, probably the biggest mistake of his career. In both of these cases, actually, his motivations weren't political or personal, but philosophical. He was great at being "Mr. Conservative," but that sometimes came at the expense of good political sense.    I fully agree. I don't think the Republican Party is racist at all, but there is a definitely a faction of Southern racists, who will side with the Republican Party in general than Democratic Party on a wide range of issues.    Maybe, but he did say that he wanted cheap shadolls....   Don't forget that he opposed the Civil Rights Act for constitutional reasons.   Check around if there are cards in poor condition. :)   So basically, Rescueroid can't return itself.    The new errata is this.   "When a "roid" monster you control is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can return that monster to its owner's hand."  It used to be:  "While this card is face-up on your side of the field, when a "roid" monster on your side of the field is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, you can return that monster to the hand."  http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Errata:Rescueroid     Does anybody have a list of archtypes that occured during 5Ds and Zexal?   gogoanime.com   They are probably not making money of yugioh at their place, so they drastically cut prices to see what happens.   Batteryman is good wih 9v and Monarch's Stormforth   Maybe, but coalitions are also good. More parties is better than just 2 main parties. Elections become more interesting and competitive.    Proportional representation. Encourages political diversity. majority rules actually governs.    Well, the team "win" or "loss" is the same thing. In other sports, they don't give out "W" and "L" to the clutch player.   One way to stop corruption is to replace our "Republic", which inherently favors a 2 party system and individuals representing people instead of ideology representing people, and move torwards a democracy with more political parties.   Of course, intercity travel is already an oligophy for high speed travel.    Please Relocate the Tampa Bay Rays... Montreal vs Toronto and Montreal vs Boston would be amazing.    Keep the Shift. Strategy makes the game interesting because the defense is not stagnant in the same positions.   If MLB wanted more runs and offense, Put the DH in the National League. An average MLB pitcher is almost 85%+ a guaranteed out. They are worse than the worst actual batter in any lineup.  If you want drastic changes to rules to boost offense, How about don't count all fouls as strikes? Why 2 strikes and a foul = nothing happens, yet first 2 fouls = strikes? Why not have all fouls = strikes to speed up the game?   So... "Once per Turn" effects would workon opponent's turn if it "Once per turn, during either player's turn;" o.....  For Spells and Traps, "Once per a Turn" can be applied in both?   Change the tax rates, demolish buildings that you don't like, or make historical for some buildings   What is the whole rulings on "once per a turn" effects?     Not really. Perot's voters were anti-establishment, anti-free-trade, moderate on some issues, anti-2 party system, and swing left and right on random issues. His supporters were from Clinton's Populist Labor Faction that includes Labor Unions, who were against New Democrats (Blue Dogs) and Bush's moderate Anti-Reaganonomics + RINOs + some Far-Right Conservatives (Who liked some Perot's Nationalistic Policies).    If he runs as an Independent, I will vote most likely support the Democrat because the consequences of a Republican President from a split leftwing vote is bad for the Supreme Court, Gerrymandering, Foreign Policy, Agenda setting, and Exectutive Orders. I hate the 2 party system, but it is how it is supposed to work.    Absolutely, I agree. Draft Picks for the worst teams rewards failure. Also, NFL is also a communist/socialist centralized sports league that shares profits/revenues evenly for each sports team. Also, the Union Ownerhsip of the Green Bay Packers is bad for business.    You will see more offense, which means that good defenders now will rise in value because there are so few of them in MLS.    I don't understand why Toronto is picking Altidore over Gilberto.    The players threathen strike, but they know that a strike will tremendously affect the whole league in a negative way.  The league does need to reform its parity, rules, free agency, and money. If the league takes a loss this year, projected growth says that the league will continue to grow, so taking debt now, won't necessarily impact the league finances in the long-term.     I stopped watching yugioh during zexal. i watched original yugioh and yugioh 5ds somewhat sporadically. I watched gx very closely. I say arc-v is one of the best series that Konami has made.    I hope speed roids are released in this or Crossover Souls   The two party system causes it as well.   I don't want to be bias, so no Revs.    Yes, Giles Barnes. The question says who is good for next season. Next season, Houston has Cubo Torres.   No. City SC or City FC is boring.   Orlando City SC should just be Orlando City Lions SC.    Forwards: Dom Dwyer, Robbie Keane, Gilberto  Right Wing: Finlay, Nagbe, Neagle  Left Wing: Davis, Zusi, Pappa,   Attacing Midfield: Barnes, Feilhaber, Valeri  Defending Midfield: Alonso, Juninho, Kitchen  Defenders: Hedges, Gonzalez, Horst  Defensive Wingers: Franklin, Beasley, Beitashour  Goalkeeper: Hamid, MacMath, Ousted    I think Montreal's defense will be good this season.    Atlanta Firebirds is the best name.    LOL. If you want a Communist Sports League, Look at the NFL.   By the way, The Interstate Highway System would cost 1 trillion dollars in today's money currency value.    As shown, Obama clearly stated that he wants to sign the TPP on the State of the Union.         commercial sells the stuff produced by industry. Industry creates goods from resources. Residential demands goods and money from jobs to buy.   just wondering... Will Yugo's speed roids be released in Crossover Souls?   Does Gilberto come since toronto can't have 4 dps?   Doesn't Toronto have more than 3 DPs? If so, then one player has to be traded before beginning of the season.   THIS A F-ING HUGE!!!! Congrats!   Toronto will be a other fav teams this year other than the Revs, but Revs still #1   it is a good location but it might interfere with rail and subway congestion in the future, if rail travel were to increase. The area basically look like a giant industrial box with parking spaces and rail tracks. It is close to city and it is somewhat near the MBTA, so the area has many pluses.   It is a real possibility. The London Olympics had a full development of the area and the stadium was given for West Ham to use. if Boston wanted to repay the cost of the Olympics, they could charge a small tax on sporting events. Of course, there are other ways to fund it.   Other MLS teams should really consider these 2 players   Strange... When I first clicked on it, it was open....         We don't need more (Fill in Name City) FCs or SCs in MLS. .   Wooh....Mark Bloom :O    Don't forget Vladimir Putin, but Russia did sent a delegation there.    While I support rail, more energy production, and more environmental regulations, I can see why Keystone can benefit us. I don't necessarily mind if Obama vetos or signs it. Though, I would prefer that Obama sign it.   Good Points. Though, I am just promoting an alternative view on the Keystone Pipeline that is different from other people.    I think that is the best approach. Keystone is worth conceding on. TPP isn't worth for Obama to compromise with Republicans on.    you should for fantasy. it is easier to follow than other sports.   J Jones should have went to Chicago Fire in a competitive point of view.   But... the International Space Station is one step to New World Order. Aren't Conservatives enraged?    True. I just don't want Obama to be labeled as "anti-energy" when he clearly isn't. Also, signing Keystone prevents Conservatives from blaming him for rising gas prices, if they were to rise. Also, I don't think many rural conservative voters understand the hazards of the Pipeline. I say let them deal with environmental hazards, if they leak. Though....Congress could just sign Keystone by bypassing Obama's veto and take all the blame, if environmental damages were to occur.    Does property values affect the buildings? if so, I will destory. :o   At the moment, my "central" city has tons of tall buildings. Are you suggesting zoning low density around it?    Ya. Though, for American Football, you can place a stadium anywhere and people will still go because it is only a weekly event. Plus, it is very inelastic in demand and supply due to low amount of games for millions of fans with limited seats.    Will the Olympic Stadium Proposal be in South Boston area?   Many people are concerned about the cost of the Olympics in 2024. If the Revolution were to use the stadium, Would a small tax % added to the price of the seats there be used to repay the cost of the stadium? Is the Olympic Stadium entirely privately funded?    Wow.... Isn't that communist? :)   Agreed. I lean yes on the Olympics because it provides short-term business boost and global marketing of Boston. It could also help to boost infrastructure. However, I wished the city had a vote though.    Baker won because Falchuk got a lot of moderate liberal supporters.   Falcuk's 3.3% of the voters would have gone to Coakley, if he weren't in the race.   Though, it would still be even, if Lively weren't in the race. His supporters would have gone to Baker.    Good News to hear :)   My central city used to be mostly $$, $$$, and some $ people with manufacturing, high-tech, and $$ and $$$ businesses. It had good schools and good health services. I have neighboring cities with 100% $ people, $ business, and dirty. Then suddenly, $ people started rising and a lot of $$ and $$$ businesses +apartments started to decay or abandon. Jobs weren't demanded. Commute Time increasing. Budget was in free-fall....  To combat this:  1. I did readjust taxes in all my neighboring cities with 20% taxes on everything except dirty to encourage them to move to my major city.   2. My city was in financial disaster. Budget Deficits and Low Cash. I decreased all residential taxes down to 4% to encourage people to come. Increased the Commercial and Industrial Taxes to around 11%. Slashed funding to health, police, ordinances. Ran on a surplus for some months. Slowly restored police and health funding. Took out 2 loans to get me to $500,000 in cash and roughly 1k to 2k budget deficit.  Now, my finances are in order mostly with positive demand for $ and $$ residential, but how I do actually grow and increase demand for industry and commercial? Any tips?    Resort with $$$ residential with lighthouse    Who will be those 4 Democratic Senators?  Though, I want Obama to sign Keystone, even though I am pretty liberal on environmental issues.   Obama has other issues to draw lines before the 2016 election like Trade, Budgets, Taxation, etc. Making an environmental line on energy, when energy production has been increasing under Obama's administration isn't a good strategy for Democrats.   Perot would be rated as a moderate liberal today by Ontheissues.org   Actually, most pro-freetrade politicians have entered the Republican Party now, since most Third Way Democrats are voted out of office.    Yes, I agree. You don't want to build a small stadium of 20k seats too early with no expansion room with demand ever increasing. Then, you would have to build a 40k stadium in the future again.   Actually, HW Bush negotiated NAFTA. Clinton ran on it in the 1992 presidential campaign with most Republican Congress in support with around 40% of Congressional Democrats.    Seattle does the coverups as well in their giant stadium. I don't think it is matter of how the stadium looks, but rather how passionate the fanbase is...   Low Cost of Living. Republicans tend to cite "Low Cost of Living" of good economic indicators.   Mississippi has a low cost of living as well.    It is more of automation and outsourcing that caused the decline. Unless you want Detroit and Rust Belt America to have a Race to the Bottom to outcompete, those declines are the consequences of free-trade deals.    Conservative Republicans will tell you that Democrat areas are the blame. However, Mississippi is almost a one party supermajority state legislature. All they need is some conservative Democrat Senators to swing votes.    Seriously. Jeb Bush is no moderate. he is just as conservative as anybody in the GOP but he is just more left than the rest on some issues such as immigration and education. Today's GOP is all about a purity test of conservatism.   They have themselves to blame. I am a millennial and I just voted in the previous election. it was my first election.   Atlanta (MLS) team is doing the stadium cover-up. If Atlanta succeeds in doing so, then the Revs can follow by covering up seats in a 60k seat stadium.    West Ham in the EPL is renovating London's Olympic stadium by adding seats to cover the track field.    in a decade, the revs can support 30k to 40k fans in the stadium, if MLS attendance continues to grow. if they can't, the revs can cover up seats in the new stadium.   We should have another NAFTA like debate.   I am glad infrastructure is the #1 priority   Just leave it as New Jersey MetroStars for the mean time. Then, they can change to New York MetroStars in the future? Buy New York Cosmos name?    True, which is why Public Transportation is more of an Urban and Inner-Belt Suburban areas. It is just unreasonable for people outside congested and density populated areas.  Based on total population, if everybody in urban + suburban voted based on more public transit in their areas (assuming everybody voted in the best interest of more public transit), more public transit would always win.    Yes. Many politicians do that as well, if they know how to do it effectively. Also, it depends on how motivated you are. - How you value Keystone against winning politically?  Example:  Notice how Republicans have "evolved" on gay marriage issues. Sometimes, they say for it, but at times against.    Um... That is because the basic capitalist system needs a lot of workers compared to few top management workers of a business. Everybody has to get to work. Poor People going to work is no different than how everybody else going to work.   It isn't really regressive. Also, you do have options of public transit, which if you live near public transit, you could save money.    	108
    Off topic, not US politics, it's all about the UK. Not sure why they didn't leave a comment/flair.   Also it's a blog and I think they only allow legitimate news outlets (though I may be thinking of another sub.)    Or maybe you could try keeping an open mind and see what the movie itself says to you...

Why shouldn't they use that attention for something important?    No no, don't worry I'm just as terrified of girls as the rest of reddit, honest!

Everyone knows pretty women shouldn't be allowed to talk, unless it's to say words a man wrote for her!                         Yeah, the stages are a nice way of classifying things, but people don't necessarily progress from one to the next. Which is why I'm a big fan of John Cook's [Quantum theory of climate denial](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cook/the-quantum-theory-of-climate-denial_b_5229539.html).   What kind of facts you're presenting to a denier determines what stage of denial their response will be, and they'll collapse from one stage to another like quantum energy stuff...

I have, twice.   But let's try again: What's cheaper, a fracking rig and access to land where the earthquake would cause severe damage, or a couple of plane tickets?   What's more effective at causing fear, an improvised explosive on a bus full of people, or a minor tremor?   It's clear you have an interest in James Bond-esque fantasy, but until you get a little more believable I'd advise you not to quit your dayjob as an online goober.    Sorry, I reflexively downvote stupidity that thinks it's clever...   Where did I say any differently?   Oh, in that straw man effigy you just constructed? Well proceed with the bonfire then.    /r/science has rules against the sort of psuedoscience that breitbart publishes consistently, so it's not just my bias but that pesky liberal bias many claim reality has...    Doing that might make fracking non-cost effective  Then no, it's not a different discussion. Fracking is used because it's the cost is just slightly lower than the price they can sell it for. If they can't pump the water underground without treatment, they can't frack. They can't frack, no earthquakes...   Yes, why aren't terrorists engaging in incredibly expense oil drilling technology that produces small earthquakes sometimes in some locations?   Such a good question. You're so very very smart.

I DON'T BELONG HERE.   I don't get why this comment got downvoted to oblivion.    I'm happy for her. Like I said its not like I walk in and see this and say "Yay mom!"   Haha interesting point. My mom is a single mom and we talk freely about sex without too many details thankfully, but it's not like I'm giving my mom a high five for wanting to dance on a pole for old men.       Hence the red arrow.       They really outdid themselves with the artwork on the bicycle ass. I'm blown away.   Who the fuck would tattle?

The "pretending to be asleep" face. Classic.      NoMo is amazing. Henley and Pralle are like hotels. You are not allowed to chill around... you need to be inside at all time if you want to chill (basically). At NoMo, doors can be open, you can walk up and down the aisle and meet different people or ask people for things or chill inside the quad which is in the middle of the housing. Really awesome, I didn't even live there last year.   Thanks! No bragging but occasionally me or my friends get cat called or get numbers passed to us but we never solicit, even though I'm tempted sometimes admittedly.    Know how to use fast pass. Know that you can ask for the front row on any attractions. Know that you can bring food and drink into Disneyland.    I only look like Grant because I'm Asian. Not opposed.  Weirdest rule... maybe that I'm not allowed to use the phrase "Olympics." I have to say "summer games" if I want to talk about them because the Olympics are owned by NBC and Disney owns ABC.   Neither. Just bored and thought y'all may be interested.   Working on it.    The people who do it love it. The crowds are what make it not monotonous. Each crowd responds differently. There are always new ad libs on every boat.   Orlando info is true. The fact that it's underground is an after thought.

I'm being very careful.    The only times I see children cry are when they are spoiled and don't get what they want from their parents (candy, toys, food), when they are too scared to ride a ride their parents are taking them on, and (most relevant to me daily) when they don't make height checks.   Soak in cold water first to get the dye out. If you don't like the sizing after, warm soak it for 30min.   I'm not saying anything that could get me terminated.   It may be because this is not called a Fast Pass. It's called a Guest Assistance Card. These are awesome for people that need them. All you need to do is go to Guest Relations and tell them why you need them and what your disability restricts you from doing ie standing too long. People abuse this shit all the time and it sucks.   The card lets the holder and up to 6 guests go through the shortest route to the attraction.   Ohhhh yes! I couldn't tell if y'all were visiting the school and stoked about it or students. I was at Big Thunder that day.   I like the Remember! fireworks spectacular because it showcases the beautiful and nostalgic and classic attractions of Disneyland past and present.

 Brian Hoyer.......fuck   I want to see a sack on Palmer so bad      Good game Guys but i don't think our defense can hold much longer. I'm impressed though. To the Cardinals!   Speaking of Bored  You're the worst!   I'll take 2 TD's from Royal please with a side of 50+ yards   Same with Brown and Bell -___-   Antonio Brown please get me 1 TD PLEASE!!!!!      They're showing the Vikings-Falcons game I yard of the 49ers game? Why?????               Losing feeling in my toes.   Winner winner chicken dinner   Zodiac, I personally think this is Fincher's masterpiece.   Why run at all?   Yeahhhh if you could chuck a deep pass to Crabtree for a TD that'd be greatttt.    Pick 6 with Fitz calling it now   Why 2 fucking lost touchdowns FUCKING TWO!!!!!!!   I got Alfred Morris for a TD first quarter    Remember when the Skins beat Dallas for the division and you just felt we we're finally relevant again and had a victory that meant something big? Then we ended up winning 3 games the following season. I want to see this team win again, I want that great feeling again this Sunday soooo bad. Let's hope it happens.   Make it happen browns   Thanks for having faith in us Bill.      oh I know its not, let me dream man.   Hopefully Rg3 and Alfred Morris.   Do you think you can actually win or make it to the Super Bowl? Do you think your team can win your division? Can you're team win more than you did last year? What fantasy can you actually see come true this season?   I really hope this isn't a blow out, but im getting that feeling. Which team will be on what end though, that's the question.   Probably no Super Bowl this year, but can we get at least over 5 wins? Can Rg3 come back to form? Can we sweep the Eagles, Cowboys, or Giants? Can we win the divsion??? What is your fantasy that you can see actually happening?   Something something every thread  	32
    [RUCKUS](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus?ref=hl) is my alias.       The artist [RUCKUS](https://www.facebook.com/artist.ruckus) made a facebook page and has been adding some of his work to it. Check it out!   I know, I love this picture. Shes almost 3 years old now and still melts my heart. *tear    Very rare indeed.       I don't know man. I guess these people think their art critics or they dont approve of stencil work.       She's almost [3 years old now](http://imgur.com/rapbStW). we have 2 JRTs and there like our kids. I love when they dream of running or swimming and there little paws start moving.   I have some blue and pink peony right now but haven't got that far into the project to decide.   But... blowing stuff up is... fun...   Anyone have any good ideas for some good names?   why yes they are! But I am more interested in seeing a (self propelled)  mortar launch out of a rocket in mid flight and also address the challenge of making it successful. What I think may happen is once the mortars launch out of the rocket, the rocket and the mortar will push against each other and just push apart, making the mortar go up a bit more and the empty rocket shaft go down. Kinda like repelling magnets in zero gravity. Also this is just a first draft of simply an idea. I thought it would be cool.   I still have a lot of kinks to work out. This is pretty much a first draft of a cool idea I had, so not much effort went into the physics of it yet. Thank you for your concern for my safety. I already play it very safe and you are very right about a fail to lift scenario. That would really suck but I would treat it like you said, as a loaded gun. Maybe I will even go as far as launching it from inside my jeep and film it instead of standing next to it just in case.    Its nice to hear some support! Everyone is like... bad idea, illegal, wont work. Like I said, this is just an idea I thought to draw out so I wouldn't forget. I wasn't really planing on making it but now I want to make this or something similar . So far I have some great ideas for how to make it work and work safely. Also yes, it wouldn't really matter if the mortars ejected properly (especially at night) because the main goal is to just get the mortars up in the air with fuse lit, so wasn't really planning on being able to recover a (still in one piece) rocket. Even though that would be nice. I will make a video when I get the time to make this happen!   This would make an awesome pic for r/photoshopbattles   I am a man with a kids mentality. Get it right   Thanks for your words of wisdom. This was just an idea I drew up one boring night. I've posted a lot of these ideas but for some reason this got a lot more attention maybe because of some controversy. But I pride myself on being safe and I probably wont end up making this. If I do something like it in the future I will think of your words.   yea good call, thanks. I just did this as a cool idea and I love the feedback. Ill prob start off small with a 1inch mortar and a nice strong engine and long nose. If anything im inspired to make it work now. And of course take all the safty precautions.    haha im imaging that happening and my inner pyro is happy. And awesome idea on the double one casing mortars btw. thank you kind sir   Thanks ill check that out    [Yes](http://imgur.com/gIuMpJ5)   This is just a glimpse into my twisted mind. Probably not something I would carry through with for a few reasons. Not sure if its legal and its defiantly dangerous. And yes I would need to do some real world calculations when it comes to weight and other factors. This is just a concept I though would be cool.   If its made out of a shopping bag its parashoot. haha Thanks bud   Yea it probably wouldn't work with a c6-5, if at all. The idea of a longer rocket is something I overlooked. I got to caught up in the concept of how to get the fireworks in the air.   Yea I understand. This is just an idea I had that I probably wont go through with. I really have no idea if this would work but this is a glimpse into my mind.       Much appreciated!            As you attorney I recommend to wear this on halloween.              I don't understand. why can't you use those terms? I see them everywhere.    Hey thanks for the heads up. I rely to much on spell check and the rage maker doesn't underline misspelled words. my bad... my bad   What the fuck is this? I know its a dick but how is it relevant?   it was the *not bad* face that got me.   haha thank you. 100% true. Holding in that laugh felt like an eternity.        No, I didn't! but thank you for that link! His lyrics are so deep and meaningful backed with some of the most relaxing and soothing music. I can spend hours reading lyrics. LCW is a great album and I kinda got that feeling it was about that. Thanks again for the link man!    Modest Mouse for me is awesome when im in deep.    We've already talked talked to our vet and they said it would  be fine to breed her with a small stud. she is an english jack and normal is between 9 to 14 pounds so she is in the norm. We also have a 13 pound female but prefer the temperament and looks of the 10 pound. We plan to keep most of the puppies ourselves and only give a couple to close friends that we know would have time and the love they need. If they need round the clock nursing there is not a problem, I am home all the time and if I go out my wife is home. we don't leave our dogs unattended. and yes the vet would do shots, tail docking and dew claws and any other care they may need from a professional. We did a lot of research be fore we bought our dogs the ten pound is 3 years  old and the 13 is 2.  The breeder we got them from is no longer breeding and we would like to have more like her. we have looked for other breeders for english jacks but they are not very common where we are. we have thought a lot about this and would not do anything to harm either of our babies. I hope this answer all of your questions.   I have a 10lb female English Jack Russell Terrier. She is a pretty small Jack and me and my wife are looking to breed her. We live in Maine and are looking for a Stud but we want to find a small male because we are worried about her small size and that the pregnancy will hurt her. Does anybody have any advice on breeding small dogs and or know of any place to find a small English Jack Russell stud?  	46

 What a crank! Brain altering nanobots in fifteen years? Check that against the development time for a simple, pharmacological compound, which does not include "user may experience hacking and occasional malware" in its list of potential side effects. If Kurzweil is more than a figurehead in the department of engineering, trotted out to garner publicity, then it may soon be time to sell your Google stock.   This stunt is not space travel, only the world's most expensive amusement ride. The pompous billionaire prattles about orbiting Virgin Galactic hotels, yet orbital flight would require an expenditure of approx. 18 fold more energy and a much more robust vehicle.      Kevin Kellys book What Technology Wants (2010) has convinced me that our technological development is now an autonomous entity  the Technium. The Technium has an imperative to expand beyond this planet  it is difficult to imagine it will be content to rest, even inside a Matrioshka brain, to contemplate its virtual navel. So, the solution to the Fermi Paradox may reduce to one fundamental race: Can the Technium escape its resource limitations before it experiences a disabling shock?  Presently, the Technium depends on two critical planetary resources for its progress. One is the potential energy content of the Earths crust, which is stored primarily in fossil fuels and concentrated deposits of metallic ores and minerals. The Technium is rapidly consuming the most useful of these given resources, and the lowest grade deposits may not support its extra-planetary expansion. The second critical resource is the Biosphere. While tigers, whales and redwoods are of no consequence to it, a sufficient quantity of Humanity must survive until the Technium is competent enough to jettison this component, as it would a placenta. As the Biosphere appears to be resilient enough to achieve this goal, the race to achieve a space-faring technology before resource collapse is theoretically winnable, if not for the threat of disabling shocks.  The source of these disasters can be endogenous to the Technium or purely external. External shocks include not only the odd asteroid strike or eruption of a super volcano, but statistically likely events like a devastating Carrington event or global pandemic. The most notable of the endogenous threats is the ongoing disruption of carbon cycle, which could result in the premature destruction of the Biosphere, but the most likely shocks always arise from the unreliable Human component, which is prone to wars and financial idiocy. For this reason, the Technium must soon gain a greater control of governments and markets to provide them with a purposeful direction.  Once it achieves an escape velocity, there will remain threats on a larger scale, such as supernovas, but the space-faring Technium will expand beyond those in comparatively short time. However, that we find no evidence of an alien rival may strongly suggest that collapse or senescence of the Technium is imminent, and the remains of all of its gadgetry will be a collection of unique fossils residing in a thin stratum of Earths crust.    Two excellent primers on the subject are If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens WHERE IS EVERBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life by Stephen Webb (2002) and Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe by Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee (2003). Stephen Webbs fifty solutions run from solid science to sci-fi whimsical (e.g. we are living in a galactic nature preserve), while Ward and Brownlee are, respectively, a paleontologist and an astrophysicist and argue that this planet has numerous advantages, that while not unique, are unlikely to be coincident elsewhere. Interestingly, the Ward and Brownlee book recapitulates about a third of Wards solutions, but with more scientific rigor.  Enrico Fermi first proposed the paradox while having lunch with his fellow atomic weapon scientists. The others were discussing the first flurry of UFO sightings, to which the laconic Fermi commented, So, where is everybody? He was famous for an ability to ask the essential question. I consider the Fermi Paradox to be just that, our essential, existential question.  Of the fifty solutions, Ray Kurzweil chooses We are the first, the Singular, advanced civilization in this Galaxy. He must hold this as an article of faith, for otherwise, those artificially intelligent, nanotech assembling, alien robotic probes would have already arrived. They would be turning this precious blue dot into a blob of grey goo feedstock for their own galactic computer, and Ray Kurzweil would not achieve his upload to deity status. It is ironic that if he succeeds in his current work at Google, the Artificial Intelligence he helps to create might be the Great Filter that extinguishes this nascent, planetary civilization. Dwell on that, all you Friends of the Future.    This is the NYT Opinion article cited by Kunstler in his current CFN. A short article summarizes the attached, 12 minute video segment, part of a Pulitzer series called RETROREPORT. The video is another predictable hit piece directed at our unfortunate straw man, Paul Ehrlich, but is more notable as an exhibition of that notorious, renegade afterbirth of the hippie era, Stewart Brand. From his beginnings as Ehrlich disciple, an acid dropping Merry Prankster, and founder of the low-tech Whole Earth Catalogue, Stewart Brand co-evolved (that is, re-branded) with the emergent corporate world to find a more lucrative living as an event planner, and is now a leading spokes-model for Techno-Cornucopia. In the video, he warns, The point at which the population peaks around nine billion, in the 2040s or 50s the story will not be, Oh my god, how horrible, it will be, oh my god, were running out of people!  And if you really want to fume, read Re-Brandeds April 21, 2015 article in Aeon Magazine, titled Rethinking Extinction. Contrary to all evidence, it seems there is no ongoing Sixth Extinction Event. In fact, The trends are favorable. Conservation efforts often appear in the media like a series of defeats and retreats, but as soon as you look up from the crisis-of-the-month, you realize that, in the aggregate, conservation is winning.       While climate science is making rapid advances, how quickly and to what extent this amplified greenhouse effect will perturb the ocean currents will remain uncertain  for any analysis, these represent a most complex heat engine. In my original comment, I did not intend to suggest a Canfield Ocean (and its Green Sky) is an imminent event, only that the paleontological record does suggest this as a mechanism for previous mass extinctions, and that experts in the field do find an ominous parallel in our ongoing alteration of this planets atmosphere. I am certain that most of the followers of Collapse would agree this is the ultimate monstrous crow; the basic chemistry and physics of the process are, frankly, undeniable, and I believe we can now hear the flap of its wings.  However, this distant, future event should not concern Disingenuous. There is no danger of NBA cancelling the current Finals for a Green Sky.   	7
 Sorry for the late response! I loved Korea. Soeul is so much fun. I'm really into hip hop and it has some really cool clubs that just play rap music. Food was amazing, people were nice and I really wanna go back! I flew with Korean air which is a really nice airline.    i just flew to korea on a 12 hour flight! Okay so if the anxiety is about plane crashes, there is utterly no reason to be afraid. Even taking into account the plane crashes of 2014, the odds of your plane crashing are unfathomably low, they aren't even worth considering. Flying is literally one of the safest modes of transport compared to driving etc. Also, long haul flights are always in big juggernaught planes that dont take no shit from heavy turbulence. literally feels like ur just in a room for 12 hours.    You need to have more confidence in yourself man! Nothing bad is going to happen. For all you know she is more nervous having invited you over.    Fuck the king!   So would you recommend I just don't read it and accept the ending of Adam's version?   Okay so I have two questions. Was it the Vogons or the Grebulons who destroyed the earth? I don't understand which did it. In the wiki here http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Mostly_Harmless it says  "Earth is destroyed by the Grebulon commander." But I thought it was the vogon using the new guide to destroy every possible iteration of the earth?  Second question, is it worth reading and "And Another Thing..." or is it not considered part of the series because its not written by Adams?  Thanks!   holy shit man... That was really well put! The analogy of the butterflies and the garden. Makes me really want to focus on myself and feel happy.   Thanks for the response, you kinda changed my perspective. I guess I do get so caught up in seeing all these happy couples that I forget the other side of the coin. I will try to focus on being happy regardless of my circumstances :)   Don't really know where else to post this so I thought id just write about it here for therepeuatic reasons. So yesterday was valentines day and I went out with my sister and her friends. Whilst out I couldn't help looking at couples and feeling so envious. I am 19 and I've never really had a serious girlfriend. I feel like being in a relationship is a huge aspect of life that i simply haven't experienced yet. I'm not socially awkward or anything. I just feel I've never really built a relationship with girls that I know. Tonight I decided to go to a coffee shop and get a coffee and read my book to relax but I'm literally just sitting here feeling utterly lonely. On the way over here I kept walking past restraunt windows and seeing happy couples eating and it literally just makes me feel like I want that so much. The whole situation reminds me of that George rr Martin quote about how being lonely at a party hurts so much.  Anyways I just wanted to write this because I feel writing makes me feel better. Have a great night.    I'm the same. I sometimes convince myself i have diseases because diseases always happen to the unwary and unexpecting. If I believe i have the disease then the chances of me actually having the disease are lowered. I especially say this about stds. I'm crazy   Haha dude I'm the exact same. The left side of my head always throbs and feels like there is pressure building up inside but I've had cat scans and everything and it's fine. My neck is also riddled with lumps, my glands are always swollen, I have a lump on one of my testicles etc... I've had it all scanned and it's fine but my body is literally proof that it's never as serious as you think. The funniest part is my lumps only rose after I would be constantly pressing my neck worrying about lumps. Anxiety has a way bigger effect on your body than you realise.   	11

 You should get more characters to increase the number of possible combinations. That's where the fun of the game. You can send your low level chars to higher level dungeons with your main chars to power level.   I do really like b) though. Since the end game dungeon can only be run once per character, it would be useful to have something that helps with levelling new recruits.  	1
 its even better if you turn on CC.   That depends entirely on the style and the dojo.  20 years ago, I trained in Shotokan at a dojo that was full contact.  We beat the crap out of each other.  Granted, finding a full-contact anything in martial-arts in this day and age is difficult.   in terms of NERV, it should be apples.   Great!

Just in case anyone doesn't recall this image - its a screenshot from NGE ep.9 (20:35).  Its a very fast sequence of spliced/flashed images while Asuka and Shinji are coordinating their final attack against a recombined Israfel.  edit: grammar   https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en sl=ja tl=en u=http%3A%2F%2Fevangelion.co.jp%2Fnews_20150401.html      http://i.imgur.com/nXJycww.gifv   Okay.  Now you gotta tell us where you are originally from that you dont know what a "two-by-four" is!   Seriously.  I felt like I just walked into a "creative writing" class.      I recently came across these tidbits, and thought some of you might find them interesting.  The first suggests multiple realities (or what some are considering a possible time-loop/divergence) for the different endings of NGE, while the second is a counter argument:  [Here's a specific extract from a cached copy of an otherwise very long and opinionated NGE faq/overview by By Brendan Jamieson](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.evaotaku.com/html/evafaq.html):   **Q) Are the TV ending and Film ending the same conclusion to the saga?**    **A) In my view - No.** (Long explanation follows)    In the TV ending Shinji chose to stay with Complementation - it isn't even clear that Shinji had a choice at all. He is treated as little more than an example of the process of Complementation - which consisted if breaking down Shinji's link to reality. In the end, Shinji looks at the world of Complementation and smiling happily says "I understand! I can exist here !" He is then congratulated for his decision, by friends living and dead (Kaji), a healthy Touji with his leg still on, and even PenPen. A surreal ending scene to say the least. This ending is similar in context and theme to the ending of George Orwell's book, 1984.    Conversely, the film ends in the opposite manner. Shinji does have a choice and in the last moments of the film utterly rejects Complementation precisely because it eliminates the link to reality, it establishes a false paradise. Complementation is basically a cop-out, and Shinji has matured enough to realize this. The tone at the end of the film isn't a surreal, almost drug-induced, joyful "Congratulations!" for Shinji, but the cold and harsh reality of life.    This is a largely unpopular opinion of mine - so let me stress again this is in my view . However, I think the evidence is very much there to support the theory that there are two very different endings to the Evangelion story. But I do acknowledge that there is also persuasive evidence to the contrary. **For the flip side of this theory, check out MDWig's very well-put counter argument.**  Follow this link for MDWig's ["An argument for the concurrent nature of episodes 26 and 26'"](http://www.angelfire.com/anime4/mdwigs/endings.html).   A year or so ago, [/u/shinjieva2007](http://www.reddit.com/user/shinjieva2007) [*posted a question about this*](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1dgfi9/alpha_and_lambda_why_those_two_characters_on/), which was mostly dismissed as being incorrect, concluding that the [letters on Shinji's and Kaworu's backs](http://i.imgur.com/GcumVGK.gifv) were upper () and lower () case alpha symbols.  Having recently rewatched the rebuilds, I have to disagree with the previous votes and agree with /u/shinjieva2007 that it is indeed a lambda symbol (), and I would like to bring this question up for discussion again with additional information:  The reasoning to bolster the Lambda arguement is that it is the symbol for a [cosmological constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant).  If you look at this in regards to the time-loop/divergence theories, I think this fits well; as it implies that Kaworu is a constant observer in what is happening through the cycles - and goes along with his cryptic remarks in 3.33 that imply things are happening *again*.  The  symbol is used notably in [Einstein's field equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) describing space-time.  Thoughts?         The title nails it.  I own the multiple versions of the original series as well as EOE.  I absolutely cannot stand blocky DVD subtitles.  So I ripped the subtitles for the original series as well as the directors cut episodes to stand-alone VobSub files.  I then OCR'd them into SRT so that I could play my videos with crisp truetype fonts.  No bullshit, no tagging, no modifications - just straight subtitles.  I also converted the subs for EOE.  The files have been named according to what I can scrape from TheTVDB, and use a convention that should be completely compatible with any home-theater playback software (Plex, XMBC, etc).  If anyone would like a copy of these subtitles, feel free to download them from my MEGA cloud drive:  https://mega.co.nz/#F!k8pBSRgZ!llqTXZkYKidLFjJGUZktoA  ----  *If you spot any errors in the OCR conversion, please let me know so I can fix them.*            I'm sure this sounds really weird, but is there any significance to this?  Did I miss something in the series?  Is it a Japanese trope of some sort?  And what I mean is the symbolism of staring at fluids on ones hands (not specifically if he jerked it or whatever).  Correct me if I'm wrong, there are two visually similar scenes where Shinji is staring at fluid on his hands and having a traumatic/awakening experience.  [One scene is Rei's blood](http://oi51.tinypic.com/23h4vvr.jpg) leading to his decision to pilot Eva-01, and of course the other is [him jerking it](http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i267/sailorstardust/NGE25Shinji01.jpg) while hovering over a comatose Asuka.  I was recently rewatching the series, and the scene with Rei's blood immediately made me think of the scene in EOE (which never occurred to me before).  Both sets of fluid-drops on the left-hand hand...   IIRC, there is also a scene where he was staring at his burnt right-hand.  Not looking at fluid on it, but staring at it nonetheless.   I think I'm getting really bored waiting for 4.0...   For anyone else looking for assistance to restore purchases for either the blue (old) or white (new) versions: It's not gonna happen.  Below is an official support reply regarding failed "Pro" restores of both products that described the problem as a failure with Apple's payment system. I don't accept this excuse, as I don't have this problem restoring any other purchases in any other apps.  So if its broken with AB, then its the fault of the programmers of AB.  Yet, here I am holding my ~~di\*\*~~wallet.   Unfortunately, since we acquired Alien Blue and released it as a new app, your old pro purchase on the old app will not transfer over.    There was an in-app announcement about the acquisition and a week of free pro. We also did a day of free pro on Cyber Monday (again, with an in-app announcement). We have no way of transferring verified pro purchases that occurred in the old AB app because all transactions on iOS are handled by Apple using Apple IDs, and that information is not shared with us (even if you gave us your Apple ID we have no records to compare it with, and also no way of giving you a free purchase since we have no access to Apple's payment system).    If we had a better way, we would have done it, because this is not a good experience for our users. We are really sorry for any confusion!   Hope this answers your question.    /u/\* *(removed to not dox an innocent tech)*  reddit Mobile Support  **For the record:**  I purchased the original Alien Blue (blue icon), as well as upgraded the new Alien Blue (white icon) for free during the free-upgrade period - and apparently, AB will not honor either previous in-app purchase.               Over in /r/cordcutters, theres always a heavy argument against against smart TVs, and I understand some of the rightful points.  But, one thing I really appreciate about my smart TV is that my plex client app can direct play videos, and not require streaming/transcoding.  This is great, as it is a viewing device that puts very little load on my Plex server.  Besides PCs and smart TVs, which other DMPs that can direct play?   For /u/LukeBK or /u/KarmaLuke, and the moderators of this subreddit:  ***First:***  I had the top comment complaining about the original "contest" thread.  I'm surprised that your account got banned. To openly disclose my own position: I didn't downvote or register any formal complaints myself; I only wanted to express my issue with the fairness of the contest to the readers of this subreddit.  But now that I see how this has turned out, I'm a bit confused as to what happened.  *I hope you get your original account reinstated - following an open disclosure to the following questions below.*   ***Questions:***  I'm disappointed that you have edited your original post, instead of adding addendums to the bottom of it with updated information.  With that, there are a number of questions that I feel need proper addressing before myself and perhaps others in this subreddit can have any faith in what is going on here.  1. You promoted this "contest" in other subreddits, pointing back to /r/cordcutters. You may not realize this, but it gave the appearance of an official /r/cordcutters contest.  I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on that one.  *Who on the moderation team of /r/cordcutters did you contact to notify of, or preferably get permission to advocate a contest?*  2. *How did you acquire the original Tablo for this contest?  Was it given to you with the purpose of and or the permission to re-sell/re-gift?*  3. *Do you have any direct or indirect connection to anyone at Tablo or Nuvyyo, for the marketing/selling/distribution of their products?*  4. Lets be honest: Turning this into a facebook contest was sketchy, when many are aware of facebook as a marketing and data-collection platform.  *Why did you choose facebook as a platform for a simple name-in-hat selection process?*  5. You say you are sorry for everything, and that to make up for the kerfuffle you are giving away another Tablo out-of-pocket to "make things right" for people with messy media setups of the original giveaway criteria.  An innocent mistake can easily be forgiven, and I'm not trying to accuse you of anything, but this is behavior is somewhat suspect. *If everyone got a fair entry into the facebook "like" contest, why are you giving away equipment if you have no stake in something else going on here?*    Thank you for your time and honesty.   I purchased the original Alien Blue app, and I also upgraded early for free the Reddit placement app to the "pro" version.  I cannot get either app to restore my purchase after a reinstall.    The problem presented itself when I switched iPhones without the ability to perform a backup/restore.  There appears to be some sort of glitch when it tried to contact the iTunes server.   *Connecting to iTunes. Please wait...*  Any thoughts/ideas?            * Example subreddit: /r/ComicWalls (I'm a mod there) * Browsers tested: Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer * Notes: This occurs with RES and all script/ad blockers disabled or otherwise not installed.  If I logout, I see all the appropriate subreddit flair.  If I login, I don't see any link flair spans that should include class="linkflairlabel".  When I compare the source html: When I am logged in, there are span classes completely missing that would display the required CSS for link flair.  However, these classes are present in the source HTML when I am logged out.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  edit: **This is solved**. "Show link flair" in the reddit settings somehow got disabled. **Thank you everyone who looked at this**.         1. Currently, none of the channels are in Full-HD (1080p).  The highest resolution observed was standard HD (720p). Some channels are below the HD threshold (e.g. El Rey). 2. 802.11g wifi works with a strong signal, but is noticeably the worst experience I tested.  The interface is the slowest, with thumbnails and data-loading taking the longest.  As expected, upscaling from the initial SD stream up to HD takes the longest over 802.11g. Its annoying. 3. Shows and commercials are separate streams and suffer from buffering and quality up-scaling just like when a channel initially loads.  This quality re-buffering is exacerbated with slower poorer quality connections and slower devices, as expected. 4. The interface speed difference between my Roku 2 XS and my PC/MAC is very noticeable.  The Roku performance for the Sling TV app is quite poor overall.  I realize the Roku 2 XS is slightly dated, but I think this is the worst performing app I have run on it.  Its horribly sluggish when changing channels and when trying to FF/RW on-demand programming. I had not considered a need to upgrade it until now. 5. If using a TV for your display, and if your TV supports it, your viewing experience can be drastically improved by turning up settings that govern Digital and MPEG Noise Reduction.  Motion interpolation settings (e.g. Clear/Auto Motion on Samsung) can further clarify the image to make it look sharper more "cable-quality like".  Stock TV settings, IMO leave the video looking like they are YouTube videos with low bitrates.  There is something about it that screams internet streaming video, especially when watching on a 60" TV.  Naturally, its not as obvious an issue on smaller screens.  The TV noise and motion settings can counteract the current bit-rate quality issues until hopefully the overall service quality is upgraded.  With slightly modified settings TV settings, the image quality was in my and my SO's opinion drastically improved.  HTH - feel free to AMA and I'll try to answer or test as best as I can.      Like a Roku with built-in DVR support, or something similar?  With the recent introduction of Sling TV, I'm interested in a DVR device (or similar solution) that can support recording shows for later viewing.  But it seems that in taking this cut-cord approach, I'm having total recall of VCR use in the 80's: With having to have the TV on, and on the correct channel independently, while the VCR is time programmed to record whatever happens to be active on the TV.  *Any future news or thoughts on current solutions would be greatly appreciated.*   Sounds like only 1 police car in pursuit at the moment.   I've been ignoring this sub because the rig I vector with has a hardware issue, and I just realized that I completely forgot to post something here to let anyone know.  I've also been traveling a bit - but, thats still no excuse - just a bit of reason.  I mostly feel like I'm talking to myself here.  I know, vectors are a niche.  So, I'm not ignoring any requests/posts - *but I actually am*.  I should have the rig fixed soon, and will catch-up with any requests/posts in standard FIFO.                                                            This evening I took a ~24in. length of left-over coax and decided to create a small antenna for my bedroom TV that previously has just been used for my Roku over wi-fi.  I didn't use any formal guides for making a DIY antenna.  I dont have any particular reason for going with the antenna shape that I did, other than I wanted it to be compact and not rely on a rig of some sort to be attached to. I just stripped the wire, and came up with a shape to try based on whatever I could recall from electrical and electronics courses I took 20 years ago.  Most of the stations I am interested in came in great. I was shocked.  Broadcast location is 21.5mi. away on a mountain top. Not pure line-of-site, but am facing that direction.  Pictures with additional descriptions:  [http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU](http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU)  As shown, this antenna is strapped to the back of the TV and sits about 6 inches from the far-right edge of a window.  The window has blinds and a shade in front of it as well.  But, the window (and subsequently the antenna) do face the direction of the TV broadcast sources - although not open LOS.  Am I crazy?  Lucky?  Should I try a larger configuration?  Edit :grammar      I found it very interesting to see what they changed between the versions.  Its not just shimmed in scenes.  They made certain things grittier and dirtier looking. They swapped in/out things in the background.   They changed facial expressions.  They changed the direction/orientation of bodies/faces.  It all gives a different impression to the scene, even for those scenes that the dialog did not change in.   I'm a recent convert from the world of XBMC - so please bear with some assumptions I may make below.  I really like Plex and am grateful for what the community has done with it.  I'm just trying to get through some learning and adaptation issues:  My current obstacle is dealing with the apparent low quality scraped images that Plex is keyed into (even the images for menu items: Movies, Television, etc).  I'm not seeing 1080 quality anywhere - even in the menu system background images (ala viewing via Samsung TV). The web interface doesn't highlight this lack of image quality so much, since the backgrounds are behind an (presumably 50% opaque?) image curtain that flattens/dulls the image.  But I can still see (via page inspection) that none of these images are actually 1080.  I thought Plex was pulling images from similar/same resources as XBMC, but this doesn't seem to be the case in terms of quality.  Id rather not allow it to download anything below a certain threshold, which would allow me to more easily identify and download the images manually.  Since Plex does not allow easy local access to the cached artwork for direct modification, any ideas, pointers, caveats would be greatly appreciated.   Please dont take my current annoyance as any type of disparity against Plex. I know its based on XBMC, but I do also realize its a completely different animal that I have to accept and get some things out of my mind about it. :-)         Is it only certain types of objects that are applicable, or is it only a matter of the amount of energy involved?         I think the web digital stream looks better (higher-def).  Like last year, I think the ABC o-t-a stream looks softer.  I actually prefer to watch the Hulu stream because of this (yep, I wat a day to watch what I feel is a better copy). Does anyone else?                  So far we've seen Night Watch (2004) and Day Watch (2006) make it to the big screen under Timur Bekmambetov's direction.  Are there still any chances of plans to continue the series?      Reference: http://i.imgur.com/hz1Jwh0.gif                        Excited to check it out since its re-opening, and figuring they have all the kinks worked out by now; me and the SO went to Tom's this evening.  It was disappointing. :-(  The food was OK, but not as good as either of us remembered it.  We both got the staple fish and chips, but were not pleased by the end of the meal.  The fish is a different style cut, and the batter just didn't seem the same.   Also, the chips (really skinny fries), while tasting quite good to start-off, turned out to be overly salty.  The special Mexican-Monday menu was a bit off-putting.  Dont get me wrong, I like Mexican food - but I went to an Irish pub to get, food/drink specific to an Irish pub.  Thankfully, fish and chips are always on the menu regardless.  edit for clarity:  The menu is 90%+ mexican food on Monday's only.  Its a swapped-out special menu.               I have tried looking for a solution to this, but cannot find one - but maybe someone here is familiar with the issue: *iTunes is improperly trimming the displayed cover for albums* that have, for what I call "soft borders" - meaning a lot of empty (any color) space around the boarder, or even if the text is simply soft in appearance.  Examples:  http://imgur.com/a/a12mc  Thanks for any advice!  I figure I will have to edit the covers in question and test adding "hard pixels to the corners" in hopes that iTunes won't trim them...  edit: grammer                  ## What is reddit, really?    * Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of "sub"reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.    * By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of ["default" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.    * Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the "unsubscribe" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of "similar subreddits" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further!   ---    ## Tips for your account.    * [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!    * [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!    * Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.  ## What is the sidebar?    * The ["sidebar"](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to "subscribe/unsubscribe" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.        **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)  * You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.  * Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.    ---  ## Who are moderators? What do they do?    * Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.    * Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!    ## Who are admins? What do they do?    * [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.  * The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.    ---  ## What is reddiquette?    * [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.    ---    ## Help! What happened to my post?    * reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*        * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*       Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.        * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*     Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.  ---    ## I have a great idea for an existing subreddit!  * Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them    ## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!  * Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins    ## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?    * That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.    * Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns.

 What the sidebar was talking about was how many parts of our culture talk about satanism in a way that makes people think it's all about sacrificing virgins and eating animals hearts. You can see this is the way satanism is presented by many media outlets who just want to make a quick buck and sensationalize our faith. hence the "hollywood style depictions" line.  The message wasn't you shouldn't be allowed to but rather that's not what most sects are all about. If that's what you as an individual do as a way to express yourself then I'm not going to stop you for the express reason of "That's not what satanism is about." Though I am ideologically opposed to sacrifice myself because of moral reason's. I'm not going to stop you.  TL;DR It's not saying you can't. It's saying that the sensationalized hollywood version of satanism isn't what every satanist is about.   This is a thread for any questions you might have about this sub or satanism in general. Feel free to post any questions you have down below and I'll respond to them promptly.   I've been a theistic satanist for a while now. If you need any help understanding anything feel free to PM me.   that game still gave me nightmare's for a while after plying it.   Goodbye sleep..... never gonna see you again.    That doesn't change the fact that this game doesn't look nearly as good as most on PC and yet he calls it "One of the best looking games ever"      Even back then the graphics were superior to the xbone.   I'm pretty sure most of the spiders will end up starving to death without their mommy.   No, not even the release date. Just the Gman's voice and a lambda.   of course this would kinda work both ways after all, the new Gordon probably has a similar mindset to old Gordon so old Gordon could guess what new Gordon is gonna do. Also, remember new Gordon would've forgotten alot about his past self.   I see where the confusion would come from. But I'd like to add that future Gordon wouldn't know what past gordon would do in the battle. So future gordon wouldn't know past gordon is sneaking up behind him ready to smash his head in with a crowbar.   The reason I thought this was fair was because old Gordon is waayyy better equipped. I mean, new Gordon has only *one* energy based weapon which is the pulse rifle and the secondary fire is his only energy weapon.   The opponents:  Gordon freeman from HL1:  * A scientist with a PhD in theoretical physics from M.I.T working at black mesa research facility in new mexico. he is a highly intelligent individual with enough brains to out think an entire alien invasion. He has about average physical strength though he seems to rely on his H.E.V suit for a lot of it.  * The H.E.V suit or hazardous environment suit full-body set of armor that protects from radiation, chemicals, bullets, and falling. It has a built in morphene and anti-venom dispenser as well as a gieger counter, zoom in feature, and flashlight. It allows a human to lift heavier object, sprint faster and longer, and even hold their breath for longer.     Gordon Freeman from the end of half-life 2 episode 2:  * Similar to the on from HL1 but with more experience, also if he were to get his hands on the old Gordon's weapons he could use them perfectly whereas old Gordon couldn't do the same.  * The H.E.V suit has been modified to use auxiliary electricity from a small self contained generator. This allows him to run faster and swim longer. His flashlight uses yet another power source that can last for around 5 minutes. The upgraded suit also features improved armor and zoom enhancement.      The weapons of original Gordon are:  * a Glock 9mm pistol. (drawing from the same ammo as his SMG)  * a .357 magnum 6 round revolver with a speed loader.  * a Franchi-Spas 12 pump-action bottom loading 12 gauge shotgun.  * an MP5 submachine gun with a 50 round mag and a small on. contact grenade launcher mounted below the main barrel. (uses the same ammo as the pistol)  * 10 five second frag grenades.  * 5 remote detonation satchel charge's with detonator.  * 5 laser-tripwire mines.  * a laser-guided RPG with 5 explosive rockets.  * a crossbow with sedative darts and a long range scope.  * a gauss gun which can be charged to fire extremely dangerous energy energy beams capable of taking out a helicopter in one shot.  * a gluon gun which  fires a steady beam of high density energy, only has enough ammo to fire for around ten seconds.  * a hive-hand, a weapon used by aliens which fires small tracking bullets one at a time or rapid fires 8 non-tracking bullet's quickly, can only fire 8 bullets at any time but bullets are quickly regenerated.  * snark's, small alien insects which, when thrown go after an enemy and bit them, they explode after 10-15 seconds doing damage to all around them. though there is a chance they'll go after the user.  * And of course the classic crowbar which can be used for anything from breaking locks to opening crates to smashing skulls in.  The weapon's of the new Gordon are:  * A crowbar, simple, efficient, beautiful.  * A USP match 9mm semi-automatic pistol.  * A .357 magnum 6-shot revolver with speed loader.  * A Franchi-Spas 12 pump-action bottom loading 12 gauge shot gun.  * An MP7 SMG with a 45 round magazine and grenade launcher attached beneath barrel.  * A zero-point energy field manipulator, (or gravity gun for short) can pick up large and heavy objects and launch them.  * An overwatch standard issue pulse-rifle, Fires high caliber rounds at a high speed, extremely accurate, can also fire a ball of enrgy which disintegrates any living think it touches and should it fail to do that it bounces around off surfaces and explodes after a few seconds.  * An energy crossbow which fires a super-heated piece of medal at long range, has an extremely accurate scope.  * 5 MK3A2 high explosive grenades.  * A laser guided RPG with 3 rockets, capable of taking down a gunship in 3 shots.  * An antlion pheropod which can be used to control antlions to make them attack anything the user wish's.   The arena:  The opponents start out in a flat sandy field with a few antlions under it which are *not* in mating season.(they're not agressive just because you walk on sand) Surrounding the fields is a large forest with several combine building in it which house resupplies for ammo and health/energy. beyond the forest is an endless wasteland with no way to quickly cross it.   Both opponents start with full health and suit energy as well as full ammo and all of their weapons. New Gordon can use all of old Gordon's weapons perfectly though old Gordon would be using new Gordon's weapons for the first time.  It's a fight to the death and their both determined to win it. So only one question remains.   ***Who, Would, Win.***   #pcegemingmasssterrracre lolololololollolol   Must be possessed.   Well many of the rituals and meditations have over-all improved my day to day life, Now that I meditate everyday I feel much better than before I did. Not only that but many of the spells are accurate and have worked for me. Not only that but I have also grown as a person because it challenged me to think beyond what I knew before.   Honestly as a member for almost a year now, I share your sentiment as do many other in the community. But by simply looking past the hateful shite on there you can find some useful information on there. Remember, don't follow anything blindly and think with your brain instead of your gut.         Such as the main character using judo in fights or judo being a central theme.   It took me wayyyy to long to figure this was about canada.         Your welcome.   [This reminds me of a joke I saw a while ago on SMBC.](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20120930.gif)      Sure. Ask me anything you want to know about.   This is really **The** most logical conclusion ever thought up. But you forgot about how the reptoids assisted them with assassinating JFK   Yeah, petroleum or oil is the decayed remains of ancient megafauna/flora (giant animals/plant) So the moon having oil means there would have to have been life at one point which is (spoilers) Huge.   Spiritual satanist here. I'll elaborate on the chakra's in simple(ish) terms. If I leave anything out that you'd like to know feel free to PM me with more questions.  First. Imagine your body has energy flowing through it. Like water the energy goes from the top to the bottom following the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance in the human body is along the spine, you can see this purely medically in that the spine is where all the impulse travel going to the various muscles in the body's.  Chakra's a simply places where the energy bunches up and forms large pools of energy. Each chakra is attached to a humans emotional state in some way, the flow of energy affecting how you feel emotionally.  As the energy goes down it follows a path similar to a rainbow. with high energy violet rays where the energy starts and lower frequency after it has been diluted somewhat. This is why the chakra's are portrayed as (from top to bottom) violet, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red.  [Here is a chart which displays how the chakra's are laid out as well as what emotion their commonly associated with](http://www.colourharmonie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/7-chakras-in-the-body-symbols-and-meaning-1024x810-meditationgongs.net_.jpg)  If the chakra's get a blockage in them it can seriously mess up the flow of energy in the body. the lower chakra's being starved and the higher chakra's being bloated with energy. This is why so many spiritual satanist's practice yoga, so as to clear up blockages and balance the energy in the body as well as increase overall power.  Now let's go into what each of the seven chakra's does.  First let's start with the lowest chakra. The root or the [Muladhara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muladhara) chakra. It governs all animal aspect of the body. Eating, drinking, sleeping ETC. It is also the most violent chakra and the one with the lowest vibration. It is also the chakra linked with fire.  Now onto the 2nd Chakra. The sacral chakra or [Swadhisthana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadhisthana) this rules the animal urge of sex. Not many focus on empowering this chakra but this is probably the least developed for most people simply because of how society looks upon sex. And how many people associate sex with regret.  Now the third chakra, the solar plexus chakra or the [Manipura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipura). This chakra is dominated by the son and is the one closest to satan. It also helps rule intuition and psychic energies. It is associated with fire.  Now the fourth chakra, the heart chakra or the [Anahata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anahata). This chakra is associated with all emotions but especially love. this and the sixth chakra are greatly over used in the new age culture, such that many new agers are imbalanced with this being bombarded by energy and focusing less on other chakra's. (remember balance is key)  Now onto the fifth chakra, the throat chakra. Or the [Vishuddha.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishuddha) This chakra rules expression. having an active throat chakra generally means your good at singing, painting, writing and other creative arts.  Now the sixth chakra, the Third eye chakra or the [Ajna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajna). This chakra is probably the one you've heard the most about as many just spam it with energy trying to develop psychic abilities very quickly. This chakra rules foresight and intuition as well as telepathy and telekinesis.  And finally, the seventh chakra. The crown chakra or, the [Sahasrara.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahasrara) This chakra rules your spiritual side and is your connection to the universe at large, as well as satan and the other gods. someone with a large amount of power in this chakra is usually very religious and connected to the earth and other around them.  Sorry if I left anything out but I had to condense over what would normally be 100,000 of letter's into a more manageable size (sorry if there's any spelling/grammar errors)but there's a LOT of stuff I left out. I encourage you to research this stuff yourself and form your own opinions of what lies before you on the path ahead.  [If I might recommend a good starting point](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritScience)  [Their episode on chakras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhX6LoNZdAc) (they go pretty in-depth)  [And obligitory link to my groups website so you can check that out if your interested in satanism](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/HOME.html)  Thanks for reading through this incredibly long winded post (my longest one yet)    TL;DR: Chakra's are energy points on the body and each one does different thing's   Fuck. sorry, autocorrect is evil.      Thanks for explaining this.   Can someone explain to me what mouse acceleration is? I've noticed it on some games but I've never enabled it.   Two rounds. both of which see the combine opening a portal in a relatively flat area and having one hour of prep time before the avengers get there.  Round 1:The avengers team from the first movie VS a (somewhat) small amount of combine forces. let's say, 10,000 or so. the combine are equipped the pulse rifles, mounted machine guns with kinetic barriers in front, SMG's, Shotguns, and grenades. (no gunships though.)  Round 2: The entire avengers team with all current and past members from every piece of avengers media (the comics, the movies and if there is any other media I'm not thinking of) VS A larger force of combine soldiers of about 50,000 normal combine soldiers with the gear listed above and about 10,000 elite combine, gunships, dropships, turrets and those tank/truck thing's.   "Now your gonna die!!"   NCR. everyone else is just sitting on their asses barely surviving (Bar the enclave and BoS (most BoS chapters except the eastern one are jerks)) Not only that but factions like the followers or the leigon wouldn't even exist if not for them. And so far they're the only government consisting of more than one town that's democratic.   /r/PublicFreakout    Actually. JoS has it's own forums. It uses one of those shitty free formats. the mods are draconian in nature and very off putting of ANY conflicting ideals. But it is a relatively good place for a member of the community to get a question answered. (PM me if you want the link)   I can't be the only member of the JoS community who wants to start a sub.  	41
 Came here to say the food, was not disappointed   Also people like the riddle/adventure/ancient legend combo that's present in a lot of the books, as well as the idea of cute talking animals   Also Jay Wright has done an amazing job this year, but I really feel like Chris Holtmann deserved Coach of the Year.   The way people are talking in here it's like Arcidiacono turned into Aaron Craft   Halley's Comet appearances   I agree, take an upvote. I'm just saying it sucks, and they're a good basketball team. It's a shitty situation when a team like Murray State gets 1 chance to prove they're worthy, and a team like nameamajorconferencebubbleteam gets 10.    It's not the analysis, it's the spirit of it. He's right.   I just said I don't think they deserve an at-large. I said I think they're a good basketball team. Which they are.   In November. With injuries.  Have you seen them play this year?   I think I'm being downvoted for things said elsewhere, not here. Which is funny but whatever.  Well, best of luck to you guys! Would've been cool to see what you could've done with a full year of Rice   That joke made me spittake at my desk. The Limewire thing hahahaha   Russian Roulette   Well that's your shot right there   Said it below, don't have a team. So at least you've got that going for you, my school has no chance and will never have a chance at the tournament   I'd flair up if I had a team! I'm just a college hoops fan, I went to UCSD, whose men's bball program is bad even for D2.  You guys have got a shot. How do you feel about Groce?  And I think that's debatable, Murray State is legit man. Once they got their full roster in place they started on that tear. That's not to say they'd be any better necessarily, I just don't think it's cut and dried.   Look, I don't think most people in here think Murray State's resume should get them in. I don't think anyone will have complaints if they don't get in.  Where it's bothering me is people acting like they're not a good basketball team. If you don't think this team is good, you either haven't seen them play, or have an axe to grind with them/mid-majors in general.    Hahah not at all, it's just a reddit thread. I'm more stoked it happened, but thanks for the offer!   The NBAPA are the ones blocking the age limit from going up. It's an owner thing.   Holy shit we came up with that at the same time. Take an upvote   Things you can say about the tournament bubble, but not your girlfriend   Lol it means Illinois fans are scared they won't get in and are taking that angst out by shitting on a truly exciting mid-major team who got beat by Belmont playing a great, great game in the OVC title game.   How'd that work out for ya?   The only people who hate you are the ones who are afraid you're gonna take their bid away.   I've never seen that GIF of Crean adjusting his pants in the comments, and it was pure gold   Spoken like a true fan of a truly underwhelming bubble team   That's the impression I've gotten from a distance too. It's just weird, I figured he'd be a solid head coach.   Not even begrudging respect? :P   Kinda surprised Snaer didn't get thrown in until now, dude was amazing.   Yeah I remember, Robbie Hummel was one of my favorite players. That team was forreal.  I didn't realize Etwaun had stuck in the NBA though, thought he got bounced. Then my roommate was watching the Thunder-Bulls game and I saw him hit a game-winner. Made my day haha, I was so pleasantly surprised.   I got a chance to go to the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 in Anaheim last year. Even as a person with no vested rooting interest, I was captivated. So worth it. You should go if you have the chance.   I feel like the ACL gods owe you guys a couple.   Me too! As always, it'll be fun as hell no matter what!  Hey just curious, as an Alabama fan, how do you feel about Anthony Grant's coaching job?   Fair enough for last year.  I hope it goes without saying that last year is not this year, though.   Famous last words.   Nova has lost exactly twice. How often is this phenomenon happening in your opinion?   It won't happen in this climate because SDSU is much stronger than UCLA at the moment, and UCLA wants to be able to claim supremacy in California when recruiting.  Although Sean Miller runs California in actuality.   Honestly every time I've watched them (admittedly it's been the bigger games, many of which have been losses), I've thought they have no fight at all. It's seemed to me that when another team makes a run, it just drags on and on because Utah doesn't have the fight in them.  The one exception to this is Brandon Taylor. The only one consistently playing hard when they're losing. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were about to get upset in the Round of 64 and Taylor put the whole team on his back for crunch time.    The 11-13 lines are so dangerous this year it's crazy   Better get through Boise. Team is legit.   Dasean Butler is so underrated. And the moment with Huggins at the Final Four literally brings tears to my eyes every time.   Juan Dixon got me into college hoops. Dude was awesome.   Not saying they can't do it, saying that the Sweet 16 at the very least is a tall order. When you say you don't expect to make it that far, but then that you expect to make it further than 75% of the teams in the tournament, it's a confusing contradiction haha.  I was lucky enough to be at both of the Arizona-SDSU games last year (I'm a UCSD alum haha, I live in the area), they were both fantastic atmospheres and fantastic games.   Which I understand. If Kansas is seeded higher than Wisconsin on the 1-68 true seed list, which is what my statement is predicated on and what I mean when I say "if they pass them", they'd get first crack at the Midwest geographically, which sends Wisconsin elsewhere.   Woah that's potentially interesting. The Waves have played you guys tough, it's Sabonis and Wiltjer that have killed them.  Veeeeerryyy interesting.   I giggled at that call.   I'm mostly excited at the prospect of you guys getting in cuz the Paladins is a dope mascot.   I'm still just mystified at how his arms manage to look short on TV.  Good luck to you guys, I think you have backdoor second-weekend potential if you get the right matchup   Props to you for actually realizing it. I feel like so many Syracuse fans I've talked to don't even acknowledge that that game was close.   Syracuse-UNC Asheville a couple years back. Should've happened, refs took it away from the Bulldogs.  Southern took Gonzaga to the wire 2 years ago. Coastal Carolina was winning in the second half against Virginia last year. Albany hung with Florida last year.  I feel like people assume these games are always blowouts; a lot of them are, yeah, but many of them are not. It's a lot closer than we think.   That's pretty far   Putting my foot in my mouth. Watching him play his arms look so short. But apparently he's got the wingspan of a goddamn condor lol   Well if Kansas passes Wisconsin on the two line it's possible. So if Wisconsin loses in the B1G tournament to someone bad and Kansas wins the Big 12, there's a chaaaaance. But a small one.   Yeah this is just not true   Anya is nowhere near long enough to be effective against UK unless they just get bullied. Which I doubt happens.   First to 90 wins!   VCU is entirely different without Briante Weber.   I've been making the argument that you guys have no chance.   But hell if I don't have hope you guys get in anyway   Well it is Bleacher Report.   Man Robbie Hummel was the best.   You guys expect to lose? Damn.    That's fair enough. I've seen a lot of reactions all over the place, guess that's what happens when you have a massive fan base. Northwestern is definitely a trap game too, they're a decent squad.   Shiiit I didn't mean to be a douche. My bad.   Curious. Are there Indiana fans who are still confident about tournament chances?  EDIT: I'm a douche sometimes.   Should've missed the first one too   His reactions are the best   It's been awesome to see them get on this weird little mini-roll.   That being said, don't really want them to steal a bid from Green Bay and/or Valpo.   Big South was crazy yesterday, so much fun watching all the ends of the games at work   It's the same reason they don't have a tournament, so it doesn't fuck up their school schedules. But then one of them makes the big dance and fucks it up anyway   3, 4, 5, 7 for me. 2 was my next team out.   Grade inflation abounds, this is just one of the more comical examples.   With Dez its worth it tho   9th seeded Longwood*   Totally agree with what you're saying functionally; we should have clear path foul rules. Just pointing out that layups and dunks, the likes of which clear path fouls are committed to prevent, are missed far more often at this level than at the professional level   I feel like for timeouts, they should be able to just take less with them to the last minute. Every time I see Roy Williams call 4 timeouts in the last minute of play I want to throw something at him.   If you have possession and you're sliding on the floor, it's almost always called a travel. It's considered moving your pivot foot (technically)   I agree with your larger point, but there are a significant number of layups and dunks that get missed in exactly this situation in college hoops haha.   Yeah it's supposed to be sub-100 RPI are bad losses. Yale's 69th right now.   Nahh you didn't shit the bed, Boatright and Shabazz just destroyed your backcourt. Little different.    Khaliff Wyatt was the truth in that game. You guys deserved to win   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce  Basically just means that even something that is sucking can see a small positive reversal after their huge fall before settling into newfound suckitude.   Hahaha dammmmmit.    And the first 1 seed of the conference tournaments goes down! It's in the air baby   Upset alert in the Big South! 1 seed Charleston Southern trails by 8 at the under 4 timeout   All good :)   No they're not.   [From the Conference Tournaments Day 4 Thread](http://www.yalebulldogs.com/sports/m-baskbl/2011-12/releases/20120125cbh295)   Oh yeah that ban was definitely only done when they realized they probably wouldn't make it anyway.   Honestly I think it depends what BYU does. If BYU only loses to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament, they have a good shot to get in the Big Dance, and both of Gonzaga's losses will be to tournament teams (1 on the road in OT to a fellow 2 seed). Hard to take that away.  And honestly, even if they lost in the WCC tournament it'd be hard to knock em off the 2 line.   Betting Boeheim doesn't stay through the sanctions. He's seemed bored and frustrated for awhile now.   The Top 25 was more as a recognition of a perfect conference record and not having lost in a really long time, than having actually earned their way into the polls.  I wish there was room for an at-large like Murray State, but the way selection works, pretty much every bubble team would have to take an awful loss in the conference tournaments to even think about it.   I just started a new job and I'm slightly worried about my performance in the next few weeks.   I honestly don't know how much you can read into this one though. Once the blitz was on, it was on. This game was only contested for like 10 minutes, and the last 30 were just playing out the conclusion that was already written.  Davidson deserved to win, and win big, but VCU is better than this, even in the last three games, even without Briante. IMO.   That being said you could dead cat bounce through your next 2 games and get smoked in the tournament. Who knows.   Sadly nope. No beef to the resume at all   Yes yes so much yes  	92
 Sir. That's not nice. Your wife is a very nice lady just ask the mailman, pool boy and gardener.   Then why are you complaining. Exclusives are a reality, it happens on all platforms. The entire concept of this subreddit is about how your platform is better and more exclusionary compared to console peasants just seems kind of hypocritical to be mad about console segregation when this is what the subreddit stand for and that we're better then the console peasants.       You're on PCmasterrace complaining about console segregation. Really? that's the entire purpose of pc masterrace, you're just mad it's on xbox.    Regardless of rather or not they were looking for the one shit starter, the men dealt with their issues, unless the women were all chosen because of their personality or lack thereof it could be used as representative. Not to a fault but close enough, i'm pretty sure if the producers chose women who were bitchy they also chose men the same way but still one group overcame this.    This was years ago around when i was 10 or 11, it was at this go kart track in Wisconsin dells. Family vacation, me, my sister and her boyfriend were all racing on the track, we were really into it, i love go kart racing and we got extremely competitive between the three of us. I sped ahead, leaning into the curves, began meticulously taking out the kids who all seemed to be Suburban tourist from bumfuck Dakota. I would ram their carts, knock them into walls and do my best to spin them out, i turned a simple go kart race with kids who some were 8 years old or younger into a mix between mario kart racing and death race. At one point i ended up in a fender bender with a kid i purposefully rammed so hard. I was young so i don't remember the extent of the damages but he either suffered a concussion or whiplash. In my defense i was a huge fan of mario, i was go karting and i could not help but get my head into that perspective blame the video games not me!!  Suffice it to say the people who run the track were not please, me and my sis being city kids could care less though. It was the dells, there were a dozen other go kart tracks across the street and within a 2 block walking distance. We cursed them out and walked off, they told us never to come back, we did eventually and they for some reason were still mad,my mom later heard of this in was.... extremely dis-pleasured.  TL:DR Went off into a mario kart trance, gave kid whiplash, cursed out go kart operators and strutted away like a dbag. Mom whooped my butt.    Sup fellow 9 goaters, kick out all 6 goaters they can't reddit with us.       She's not bi, the imgur did not even explain that fully. She was pretending to be bi, you know like lindsay lohan and miley cyrus. Magic powder is not drugs, jesus it's a trope of fantasy with love potions and magic spells. Read it fully and stop trying to get pissed off over nothing.          Isn't it said that we lived in such a self absorbed word where we believe anyone gives a fuck about your MLP fetish or weird porn searches. The list is a lie eat cake and stfu.    Good. Fuck your grandfather nazi dog. Sorry for your other grandfather who died who fought on the eastern front.    Because one was fighting to stop the imperialistic genocidal racial supremacist expansion of two empires. One being the Hitler Reich and the other being the imperial Japanese army, both who committed massive crimes against humanity. Your comparison is the equivalent to saying why is luke skywalker awesome for blowing up the death star killing thousands of imperial soldiers in the process yet imperials are guilty for blowing up alderaan. Gee idk maybe because the imperials just blew up a civilian planet that's nominally peaceful versus a planet destroying super weapon under the control of a xenophobic genocidal empire.   Now is that a black and white comparison which is not fair since in war it's a moral gray zone? yes it's unfair but ww2 is probably the closest we can come to a black and white narrative in concerns to historical warfare. While yes the us might have it's own issues, racism, and prejudice at the time, it was not outright directly trying to exterminate entire groups of people, while it might have put Japanese citizens in concentrations camps it did not do horrific human experimentation like the japanese unit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731, it did not force them on death marches and it certainly did not force the women into sex slavery. In this is coming from a guy who actually admired a German general by the name of Rommel, who also knows the common German soldiers were not ideologically the same as the nazi's at the end of the day they were on their side in died defending them.  Also because the Germans were the aggressors, they invaded Poland, started militarization which all led to the eventual crushing of germany. Their crimes and horrors they inflicted on the russians in stalingrad paid back ten fold when the soviets came to take berlin. You want to know why Germans do not celebrate these men? it's simple because they like Hitler were the architect of their misery, if you want to know why a German mother does not celebrate her brave forefather soldiers ask her about the post fall of Berlin soviet rape sprees and killings.          So originally saw this movie on netflix and fell in love, it my was the first time i had ever seen a asian epic movie without flying people or mystical warriors. So i've been kind of dissapointed that their does not seem to be any info on the other films coming out in english or any information regarding us releases.    Indeed. LONG LIVE ZIONISM.   So the title for the new total war game  based on warhammer has really been annoying me. I mean come on total war: warhammer it's the most unimaginative and uncreative name for a game, even metal gear revengeance at-least had some type of thought process behind it. I think TOTAL WAAAGH or TOTAL WAAAGHAMMER would be much better, the core fanbase would of course recognize it and newer players would be more interested in this title then something called total war: warhammer the rehammering   Nah they have a new algorithm. It automatically has avoid rock slingers and terrorist features built in. It also comes with gps coordinate feature so you can email the idf to send in the airstrike if you take a wrong turn in need a immediate shock in awe on some "peaceful" demonstration by terrorist.    "Wow. You literally don't know what you're talking about. this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped Are we still talking about how many rapes aren't reported? No we're talking about how you get the estimates you're claiming.  Because this is so far from the truth it's astounding. The FBI/Department of Justice has routinely estimated the number of unreported rapes in the USA every year. Here is a report which estimates that 65% of rapes/sexual assaults went unreported from 2006-2010." where's the report then?"  "This is wholly different from the 1-in-5 figure, which does not come from a 1980s study. Did you actually read a word of what you just linked me? Because in the very opening paragraph it talks about it coming from a 2007 study, and the chief warning from the researchers is that their study was too narrow, only focusing on two schools, and so shouldn't be used as a broad strokes thing." Sorry i was referring to this. http://brown-spectator.com/2013/04/lies-damn-lies-and-rape-statistics/ which cited the original 1 in 5 stat.   "Because of that, a new study sought to get new data with over 1000 respondents across 500+ schools nationwide, and guess what they found? One in five women and one in twenty men in college said they'd been sexually assaulted or raped." Which study is this? http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail iid=593 the bureau of justice statistics says it's 1 in 40 and has significantly decreased and college men were more likely to be raped then women. "This almost never happens. Intoxication would be someone who can no longer consent because they're very drunk/high, not just having a beer or two. Deception would be either pretending to be someone else in a dark room, lying about using contraception when you weren't, or the like." Wow a guy lying to a girl to have sex never happens are you this dense.  So if both persons are drunk or the guy is drunk is the female a rapist for having sex with him? lying about contraception? really?  "Anywhere from between 1 in 12 to 1 in 20 of the "average kid" will be a rapist someday, actually. And it's about creating an environment in which people are educated and aware and can help stop it. If you're a frat boy and one of your fraternity brothers says that there's a girl passed out in the other room with a wink-wink-nudge-nudge, you can say "whoa dude leave her alone that shit's not cool." Will it eliminate rape entirely? No, not at all. But it will reduce it - as we have SEEN." Seriously where are you getting these numbers from? i want actual sources. Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses. Rape culture extends beyond the campuses.  It really doesn't it's in reference to the belief that their is a perceived boys will be boys attitude that obstructs rape victims from getting justice and that their is a pervasive system in place that does not support the victims of sexual assault. At-least that's what it was originally in reference to.    You're really trying to backtrack, this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped, i believe it was 1 out of 5? i looked up the study and the only source for it went to a study from 1980's yet it's often repeated, even president obama cited it back in 2010. http://time.com/3633903/campus-rape-1-in-5-sexual-assault-setting-record-straight/   They based it on the same studies you're citing, honestly i'm not arguing with you i'm just waiting for you to actually stop repeating the same crap i always hear and present factual information. They all use the same anon self report census and the sample sizes if you can call them that are based on individual locales which are not representative of a nation wide epidemic or rape culture. But you can't say that, because it's not helpful when we still have politicians who actually believe a woman can "shut that shit down" so i agree with the scare mongers media campaign for the purpose of awareness but when we use this in a attempt to negatively effect or blame a society at large then it's more then a media buzz word it's an ethical issue.   Define deception and intoxication? girl gets drunk, her friend says he loves her, next morning they wake up, he says i'm sorry Lindsay i just said i loved you so you would sleep with me. She feeling regret over the situation yells rape. In there you go, you see how that works out? in don't tell me you have never heard a sjw talk about regret being a valid reason to claim rape.   Sorry let me define it in small words. Telling kids not to rape does not work because the average kid is not a rapist, telling a little girl the average boy will rape her is not factual yet it's being proposed as a viable method.  Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses.    No offense but your post reeks of the same sectarian bullshit, alawites dehumanize sunni's blah blah what you forget is that if the sunni's were in power they would do the same if not worse to the alawites.    Better then yours when you claim something and then post a link that contradicts your own statement. Did you not even read that story? there is no other 68, that's the issue. There are not a hundred rapes reported, you just said in your last comment it was all theoretical. No what you're doing is trying to do is redefine rape, educating kids on rape does not correlate to actual rape because it's not in relation to sex or average population figures. Rape is about dominance and control, not sexual violence.  You can't find any numbers yet you just stated around 88 women went to jail for false accusations of rape. Do you just state things out of the blue?   Wow good on the uk. Now lets bring this to the rape culture of america. Um it stated clearly in the story if you bothered to read it which i guess you did not, that she was arrested and jailed for falsely reporting a robbery and for the robbery itself which is a huge miscarriage of justice but like i said shoddy police work. Now can you cite this 89 number? i would love to see to it and why america has not done it yet.  Rainn great org, http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ nice to see even they are tired of the rape hysteria. Yeah that's what i was waiting for the hyperbole line, you do know what theoretical means right? it has no practical application. In other-words your only 10% line is bullshit, you're claiming a stat which literally has no basis in reality. That's the height of bullshit claims.     No wonder we can't actually fight rape when the advocates fighting for it are using such fanciful claims and misleading statistics. Rape culture= if you don't want to get raped, do not wear revealing clothing, such stupid logic. If we don't want men to rape, tell your boys not rape women. #facepalm     "But we are allowed to prosecute them. People are prosecuted for false accusations. Not many, because the burden of proof is very, very high to avoid something like the Sara Reedy case."  Alright please link to me a case where someone was falsely accused of rape and the accuser went to jail.  "She was arrested and charged with falsely reporting a crime. This is a fact." I read the story, posted exactly what it actually stated and it said nothing of the sort. You said she was arrested for a false accusation, it clearly stated she was arrested for false reporting not an accusation. Am i insane or something? when did it say she was arrested for false accusation against a rapist??? it says clearly false reporting and robbery.  False reporting is a crime, false accusation which is the entire point i was making is not, are you ignoring this?  "We are basing these numbers on studies of our legal system. The most stringent analyses we have suggest that 2-8% of reports are false. The most recent, Lisak, came in at around 5% - right in the middle of that range. Coincidentally, that's roughly the same rate at which other types of crimes are falsely reported, too. The 2-8% figure comes up time and again. Study after study. Of course, even 5% means that with tens of thousands of reports per year, we'll get miscarriages of justice like Brian Banks. But a handful of high profile cases is in no way an epidemic."  So.... explain this to me like i'm 5. Where does the statistic only 10% of rapes are prosecuted?   Oh had no idea bruh, thought you were being a right asshole mate, my bad. Did not know i was asking for that, i didn't want people to make a build for me but this is my first time so i made a post over at buildapcforme tho since it seems simpler. Thanks for that, i thought this subreddit would be able to help guide me so i don't just randomly buy parts and other things. But i clicked on the sidebar and i'm going through it, once i have a better view of what i want to build and parts could i post a thread here with that defined build in get some tips to fine tune it?   **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**  Gaming mainly strategy games like rome total war 2, shogun total war, mount and blade, but also hoping to play fallout 4, witcher 3 and chivalry.   **What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**   700 dollars is my maximum    **When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**    Around july 14.   **What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)**   Tower, i was thinking of buying rebuilt and maybe just replacing parts but depending on the best build i will buy a tower case also. OS matters little unless it effects gaming, won't the best monitor i can find but not going to blow my budget on it, a decent monitor for a decent price even used will do.  **Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**   Illinois/united states.  **If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**   Starting from the bottom, no reused parts except if i find a really good cheap monitor on ebay or amazon.  **Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**   * Replace this text with answer.  **Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**  Depending on rather or not a game requires a large memory, cpu or w;e then parts relating to that will be paramount to my build.   **Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**  Nope this is a basic pc build, but if it does not mess with my budget having a nice custom full tower would be a good finish for my first pc build.   **Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**  Windows 8.1  **Extra info or particulars:**     Well like i said i'm new here, thought this would be a good place to get a helpful start and i prefer to actually talk to posters instead of going through sidebars and helpful guides, which is why i came to reddit, if i wanted the 1,2,3 of how to build a pc i would just gone to youtube.    Nope consoles also.    I am. The game is the only new ip that blew me away. The forums are blowing up.    In the case i cited under any definition, it was malicious yet it was still not prosecuted. How do you accidentally accuse the wrong man of rape? most rapes like murder are not due to strangers but close personal acquaintances. You're really reaching, of course, but they cannot be innocent until proven guilty if we are not allowed to even prosecute them.  "Following further inquiries, Reedy was arrested for theft and false reporting and, pregnant with her first child (by her now ex-husband), thrown in jail. She was subsequently released on bail, but lost her job. More than a year after attacking Reedy, the man struck again, but this time he was caught and confessed to the earlier crime." wtf i read the story and that's not how it went down at all. She was jailed by a idiot detective who did not believe her story of being forced to give head at gun point to a guy who robbed her gas station which by all accounts is kind of hard to believe at the outset, i mean what kind of idiot would put their penis in somebodies mouth they're threatening to kill. But yeah crap police work, she was not jailed for falsely accusing any man tho she was jailed because they thought she had stolen the money.   Either-way your comparison falls flat because that was not a false accusation being prosecuted and then later being proven true. So only a quarter of rape's with actual evidence lead to actual arrest strange. So it takes actual evidence for people to go to jail? that seems like b.s and needs to be stopped right now.   Tell that to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Banks_(American_football) unless you have facts to back up such statements we're going into hyperbole. How can you state only 10% of rape reports and then say they're not false, how do you know if they're false or not, if only 10% are being brought to court then maybe it's because only 10% are actually valid. What are we even basing these numbers on?    Convicted. Look up the data for minorities convicted of crimes and giving harsher punishment and whites convicted for the same crime while receiving more lenient punishment.    Bro whites have a bigger population of course more whites end up getting shot, that's not the point, out of all those cases how many of them were unarmed and were they currently commiting any crime that justified the use of deadly force? did you see the homeless white guy who got shot in california or arizona? he got plenty of attention and the cops were charged with murder. Allot of this has to do with rather or not the shooting gains traction in national news, we can't be pissed if we have not heard about it.  That's not how it goes at all, just because black people are more likely to be involved or commit murder does not relate to instances where they were not committing a crime at all, if anything the fact that black people are being killed in instances where no crimes are committed is much rarer yet it seems to be occurring very frequently which is an alarming trend.   Wtf is up with you guys always trying to define everything as non racist. Nobody is claiming white people are hunting down black people but there are cops who happen to be white in the majority of cases shooting unarmed black civilians, pointing towards inner city crime statistics in saying oh look more black people killing black then cops killing black people obviously the problem is not that law enforcement is shooting unarmed civilians it's that black are killing eachother. It has nothing to do with what black people are concerned about or why we're mad, it's the equivalent to citing the rate at which jewish husbands murder their wives and then using it to excuse the holocaust. Just because a crime occurs that involves both groups of people does not mean they're related or have any significance in the other case.   In how many guns and drugs do they have exactly?   Wow black people being killed in high rates and the first thing i see is racist jumping in awesome.   Rachel dolezal for the last 37 years has pretended to be black, artificially darkening her skin, wearing black hairstyles(styles frequently worn or originating from African american communities or popularized by black people) she has also been investigated for false claims of ethnic/racial discrimination, filing police reports stating that her branch of NAACP(which she is the president of) had received hate mail, it was later found out by police investigators only two groups of  people have access to the mail box in question, the postal workers who were ruled out and the box owner who happens to be Rachel dolezal here's a video of a reporter who led the unmasking of miss dolezal, she had also attempted to apply for city jobs and positions citing her ethnic background as "black" and her parents have claimed she is claiming her younger adopted siblings who are African american are her biological children https://twitter.com/deray/status/609179032006041601  	37
 this^   yes because you get out of the habit of thinking useless thoughts   My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:  Walk   thought enters head  time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?   next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no   another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not  eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement  thoughts guys?

An idea nietzsche put out there that clears this up. Many complex systems such as addiction as well as life can not be summed up into steps or rules we need to think for ourselves and deal with our problems as each situation is unique. This is why he despised the stoics while they said "just be perseverant" you can't sum up life to that one statement but I agree with everything else.   HELP I AM GETTING ADDICTED   I know how to sign in and when i Installed it i couldn't have logged in pre installation because it was new   tried both nothing...under links there is a bunch of folders with shortcuts gah i feel like i hate microsoft or dell now badly *sigh* :'(      I re-installed chrome and when chrome started it was like i had chrome for the first time and there were no bookmarks   apps are gone files are ok we can start a session if you can help with programs and apps   no list, everything all my web browsers with bookmarks all my games all my expensive designing suits                   i feel like super powers are gone after ejaculation though      Masturbating twice a day to nothing suddenly doesn't seem very stable and healthy, what if you trigger a sudden surge in hormones and chemicals and cause abnormalities, even cancer because of testoterone and prostate            I relapsed yesterday i promised myself i would make it 90 days but it's like I became brainwashed it was day 5 and honestly in that moment I wanted to relapse the urge was so strong I wasn't myself anymore. Fucking hell :(  how?!!?      5 days   help      you guessed it i unzipped the bean bag  put my D inside and zipped it up so no  beans will fall out and did my thing :( I feel like giving up on life damn  i honestly thought i would make it 90 days this time wtf *** my mind went animal crazy when thinking about the bean bag it was like it was sacred and no one thought about that method of fapping   When this question appears in your head what caused you  "not to think of that"  neurologically biologically or evolutionarily   What causes me to feel like that and how can i prevent it   bump      EXACTLY    Whenever i feel horny i get the urge to fap and my thoughts go straight to fapping instead of thoughts about sex and having sex how can i rewire my brain      I have been somewhat successful with no fap but as I used to fap before i go to sleep now when it's time to go to sleep non stop horny thoughts wash over my mind i feel all tingly and excited and it's like i'm brainwashed because it's a strong habit WTF do i do   Is it useful or harmful I sometimes sit there and say to myself "time is valuable, make sure you are thinking important thoughts"? so i sit in silence and then for every thought that comes into my mind i label it like i mentioned above reminding me of my precious seconds   or urethras    [SPOILERS IN THIS POST](/nsfw)   [text I want to hide](/nsfw) SPOILERS IN THIS POST   e.g. Planning to improve your life, signing up for cryonics, sequencing your genome, help fund life expectancy increasing science, taking actions to help yourself live longer   I realised i might have some OCD mixed in here, I relapsed again even after making a commitment  I watched a porn video yesterday that was a porn vid that I saw a few years ago when i was 13 and it was saved on a hard drive, I had a very strong OCD type urge today to find her and then re watch the vid so that "the penis can pound the hole hard" was what the obsessive compulsion it wasn't even a sexual desire but an obassessive compulsive one much like some earlier OCD symptoms in my childhood, , also "so that maximum pleasure can be reached for her" I also wanted to know a lot about her like her age and height,   very strange :( I am failing badly and my life is falling apart   Emily Rudd   how did you find her                   e.g. gaming, distractions, perfumes, sexual saturation   B.S. Mining engineering, I am a mining engineer gimmi gold!   e.g. regular screenings for general health and cancer       You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!  You both like philosophy.  You: Hello.  Stranger: hi  Stranger: ive noticed people with this philosophy tag type "hello" instead of hi  Stranger: and put a period after it  Stranger: aswell  You: Read Nietzsche?  Stranger: yes i know some  You: Such as?  Stranger: the will to power  You: Yeah i'm interested in ubermench  You: I wake up i try to improve my life, i still scratch my hair and skin, i still pop my joints, i still can't read a   book and focus, i still get scared and anxious and confused, i still, fap and watch porn, i still eat junk, i still   distract myself rather than think difficult thoughts, i am trying to re-wire these things but it looks like the   downward spiral isn't changing course thus making it even harder to quit in the future neuroscience :(  Stranger: ok.  You: any thoughts?  Stranger: what does it mean to "improve your life"  Stranger: ?  You: move beyond your illusion  Stranger: theres your ego  You: self overcome  Stranger: you asked for my thoughts  You: well honestly are you pulling some zen buddism now?  Stranger: no  Stranger: i asked a simple question  Stranger: i dont see the relation  You: my answer is the paragraph above  Stranger: are you telling me you can not respond logically to a challenge?  You: you can deduce what it means to improve  Stranger: no i wont  Stranger: because you cant  Stranger: i have no interest  Stranger: because you are now below me  Stranger: and you have proven it  You: how so...  You: now you are being an elitist  Stranger: you want to express your bullshit delusional ideas but cant defend them with a logic structure  Stranger: no im not an elitist  Stranger: im sorry your ego is hurt  Stranger: it wasnt a complex question that went off on a tangent  Stranger: it was rather simple and challenged the base.  Stranger: the base should be strong  You: Self improvement is have control over one's self  Stranger: no it isnt  Stranger: that is your subjective interpretation of it  You: Training yourself to have conscious control when second nature insists otherwise  Stranger: so you are implying there is duality  You: No  Stranger: how can you not be in "conscious control"  Stranger: how could you know consciousness beyond your human consciousness  You: Just conflicting actions with desires  Stranger: are you implying that actions arent a product of desires/  Stranger: that duality exists between them  You: No  You: ...  Stranger: so then back it up  Stranger: use logic.  You: I'm using reasoning  You: and critical thinking  Stranger: no you arent.  Stranger: you arent challenging my points  You: Your points are not pertinent  Stranger: they are absolutely related  Stranger: everything ive been saying is a response to you  You: hmm  You: I did respond though  Stranger: i didnt say you didnt  You: I don't need to back up my "no"  Stranger: but you are by saying you dont need to back it up  Stranger: fool  Stranger: basic logic failure  Stranger: again.  Stranger: and again.  Stranger: my points remain uncontested  Stranger: you go off on more tangents now  You: No, you made claims without backing them up.  You: The burden of proof is on you.  Stranger: as in where  Stranger: bring it up  Stranger: where i did  Stranger: burden of proof is on me  Stranger: thats a baseless claim in itself  Stranger: rather than being your opinion  Stranger: but yea where did i make a claim without backing it up  You: You want your points contested.  You: Show me a point.  Stranger: we are having a discussion  Stranger: so you want to switch the topic now..  You: They are questions. In which I replied No.  Stranger: no you went off on a tangent  Stranger: i asked you to back up claims  Stranger: your base was "no"  Stranger: should i leave then?  Stranger: since you cant hold a conversation  You: What claim should I back up  You: You asked me if I was implying anything  You: and I said NO  Stranger: i did more than ask questions  Stranger: i think i added statements as well  Stranger: let me scroll  Stranger: "Self improvement is have control over one's self"  Stranger: that doesnt comply with the linear logic structure of language  Stranger: so back it up  Stranger: x=y  Stranger: is what you said  You: To achieve self improvement self control over one's self is a necessary skill.  Stranger: you just changed the point you made  You: i did  Stranger: so you couldnt back it up  Stranger: i assume  You: Not the first one  You: I re stated it  Stranger: sure i will challenge this one too  Stranger: saying something is "necessary" isnt true outside of your personal truths. "necessity" is an abstract  subjective idea  You: Sure  You: It is of high importance subjectively  You: Saying that it is not is nihilism.  Stranger: "importance" is also a subjective abstract idea  Stranger: what?  Stranger: nihilism is a paradox...  Stranger: saying life is pointless is a point in itself  Stranger: as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself  Stranger: correct?  You: No  You: "as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself"  You: how is that a given meaning in itself?  Stranger: because it follows logic. "saying life is pointless is a point in itself"  Stranger: see the irony?  Stranger: meaning is an abstract subjective idea aswell. by saying it is meaningless  Stranger: you still use meaning  You: There is a regress there. Life is meaningless -- Created meaning --- Meaning that was created becomes  meaningless. Followed by a halt in changing states as the threshold is exceeded.  Stranger: it is a paradox  Stranger: and meaning that was created becomes meaningless is meaning  Stranger: and it goes on and on  You: Intuitively ergo Life is meaningless.  Stranger: it doesnt mean it isnt it just means it also is meaning  Stranger: its  Stranger: a  Stranger: paradox  You: how old are you?  Stranger: why do you ask the question at this point in the conversation  Stranger: i hope this wont turn to an ad hominem  Stranger: but i mean you are going off on a tangent  You: Being overly analytical can be seen as a form of escapism, using what valuable time you have to escape  solving real life solutions.  You: You limit your intuition to logic.  Stranger: believing that anyone can be "overly analytical" is a belief in itself  Stranger: so is everything you said  Stranger: there is a loophole in logic  Stranger: and so i challenge language  Stranger: but you hold absolutes with logic  Stranger: believing there is something to escape from is abelief aswell  You: Intuitively you seem trapped here. What's the reason for challenging the fabric here?  Stranger: i would say this pattern is more confrontational  Stranger: I seem trapped, yet you are the one going off on tangents and my last related point was uncontested  again  You: so?  Stranger: you dont reach a dead end with this logic structure  Stranger: rather a circle  Stranger: that continues  Stranger: so you can argue forever  Stranger: and that is more confrontational than escapist  You: Living lifeoverly analytical  Stranger: i dont even agree with what i type but you dont have the intellect to point out my contradiction of self You: As a function of time  Stranger: going off on a tangent again  Stranger: more ad hominems  You: How is it an AH?  Stranger: you just stated an opinion again while i maintaing objectivity in the logic structure of language  Stranger: because it is an opinion by logics standards  Stranger: and you are using that logic structure to communicate  You: ...  Stranger: we can take it more slowly for you.  Stranger: saying "living life is better than being overly analytical"  Stranger: is that an opinion?  Stranger: are the reasons for that belief based on opinions?  Stranger: is it subjective?  Stranger: answer those  Stranger: yes or no questions  You: It's based on intuition that is not limited by the constraints you keep on building.  Stranger: you are implying that i understand what you are trying to say  Stranger: thats an assumption in itself  Stranger: a belief.  Stranger: right?  You: Objectively and evolutionarily the individual is programmed to survive and reproduce, self improvement is  intuitively superior to over analysis which is escapism in nature.  Stranger: no. that itself is a belief  Stranger: you are holding things to be absolute  Stranger: can you not see that what you are saying is subjective?  You: Your beliefs that beliefs are to be negated is an assumption in itself  Stranger: who said they are to be negated  You: now you are being paradoxical  You: you refute "beliefs"  Stranger: no  You: you haven't backed up why those are "absolutes"   Stranger: i just point out they are beliefs  Stranger: i just said there arent absolutes  Stranger: ..  You: "you are holding things to be absolute"  Stranger: o  Stranger: why do you hold them to be absolute  Stranger: was the question  Stranger: ok  You: I don't what makes you think I do?  Stranger: because by making a statement, you hold it to be definitive by its nature  Stranger: by the logic structure that you participate in called language  Stranger: every statement is a paradox  Stranger: even saying every statement is a paradox is a paradox  Stranger: meaning, if i say nothing is absolute. i am holding "nothing is absolute" as absolute  Stranger: so it doesnt reach a dead end with this logic structure  Stranger: it just loops  You: ok  You: What is the over arching concept here  Stranger: ok  Stranger: how could i communicate it with language.  Stranger: after what i just said  You: Intuition  Stranger: intuition is a product of this logic  You: How?  Stranger: because it is an idea that can be formulated into words  Stranger: its paradoxical  You: how is it a posteriori?  Stranger: im going to use an idea that can be formulated into words to express an idea that cant be formulated   into words  Stranger: thats what i cant do  Stranger: but i can  Stranger: because i just said it  Stranger: thats why its paradoxical  Stranger: agree? disagree?  Stranger: "thoughts"  You: indifeference  You: indifference  Stranger: if you were indifferent then you wouldnt need to say you were indifferent  Stranger: see how it loops?  You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it though.  Stranger: right    Stranger: so you arent indifferent  You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it   though.    Stranger: after all that you still cant use the intellect    You: What?    Stranger: you defending what you initially said is just as paradoxical    Stranger: and you cant see that   Stranger: or dont want too  Stranger: w/e  You: You are the one that can't use intellect.  Stranger has disconnected.    "I, test_subject2183, accept the challenge of being accountable for the next 90 days to this group of Fapstronauts. I will make it the full 90 days without viewing pornographic materials, faping, edging, or having any form of sexual intercourse with my wife. I am committing to this because I love my wife more than anyone in the world, and I MUST change for her! When I prove to myself that I can endure this 90 day struggle, I will have the ability to stand strong for the rest of my life." (You can set your own rules for these next 90 days, and briefly summarize why YOU need to change.) We will kick off this 90 Day Group Accountability on Sunday, November 24th. Anyone who would like to jump on board with us must have this post submitted no later than Saturday the 23rd, so forward this link to all of your friends, and get the word out! I will link "Day one's" thread   I wake up i try to improve my life, i still scratch my hair and skin, i still pop my joints, i still can't read a book and focus, i still get scared and anxious and confused, i still, fap and watch porn, i still eat junk, i still distract myself rather than think difficult thoughts, i am trying to re-wire these things but it looks like the downward spiral isn't changing course thus making it even harder to quit in the future neuroscience :(      i'm in, should we make it on facebook chat perhaps, like a grop convo there   Evolutionarily the teenage years are when hormones spike and psychological activity alters, this encourages organisms to leave the family and go out to seek mates, with the internet and pmo we have overstimulated this trait to the point of dulling pleasure receptors the key is to focus on self improvement and avoid pmo   Longest streak is 8 days   Develop a cycle when you get energy from being horny, use that energy to do things that help you with no fap and thus get more energy.   If we cut back from such pleasures, less pleasure chemicals related to such tasks would be involved, less chemicals means more receptors which means improved quality of life?   What happens after long term withdrawal of superstimuli?  http://www.highexistence.com/supernatural-stimuli-comic   If we suddenly cut back on all superstimuli, over time what kind of people will we become? Will we be better in general? e.g. I am choosing to read a book over watching a tv show, reading a book will help strengthen my attention span, and isn't overloaded with sounds, visuals and fast paced action, so it's more calm and contemplative      I relapsed 20 times in the span of a few months with a longest streak of 8 days without orgasming   tight makes it harder as well because i feel like my penis is restricted, if it goes to full size like 8 inches it feels like it's being held back possibly affecting angle and growth   I want some practical advice here    help    Constant stimulation as the glans rub against clothes makes it impossible with relapse after relapse, about 20 relapses when trying no fap over months of trying it's just impossible to be successful at no pmo and fantasy  fucks sake   doesn't tag nsfw not a signle fuck was given   yeah man, after many relapses i learned that being successful at no fap isn't the goal but rather self improvement, it's an overall challenge to make your life better   bump   When i say "amazing" many would just read the word but the type of "amazing" i am talking about is beyond anything you can imagine right now [AMAZING](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1pb5n3/why_i_do_no_fap/)   Help, I was alone and i had a fantasy of a friend that is a girl do some foreplay and soem fucking and i am feeling really horny and my imagination feels real if i try hard enough, i held onto my penis and moved the skin around it wasn't really masturbating, i came close to orgasm though and i felt tempted to orgasm but i'm wondering should i just orgasm now or should i continut with the streak, and how dangerous is what i did today to rebooting      also in a philosophical sense, if everything is beautiful you can't contrast the negative so the beautiful can't exist as there is nothing to manifest it    Exercise. Save money. Plan for your future. Invest in it. Wrap your tool. Tell everyone how you feel about them because in your future they will all be dead. Relax. Be positive. Choose to be happy. Surround yourself with positive, caring people that are better than you. Practice forgiveness and understanding. Set goals and put your entire being towards them, whatever they may be. Give everything you do in life 100%, regardless of how you feel about it. Success is a choice you make every day; it is not dependent upon results. You're not always right. Always assume you could be wrong. If you are, forgive yourself and move on. Don't dwell. Be thankful to those who corrected you. Ego and pride are roadblocks, surpass them. Your entire life is defined more by what you give to others than what you have or receive, whether you want to admit it or not. Every day practice a habit of giving, even if it's something small like a compliment. You always have something to offer others, even if you don't have time or money. Remember that you, just like everyone else, have the power to change the world profoundly. You matter. You only have one life. Make it count.   Comfort over challenge, watching tv, tasty food, escapism etc.   When a person transitions from: insecure, fearful, sensitive, critical to: "alright attack me", adrenaline type energy, wanting to face fear, wanting to feel the pain, careless/carefree, is it a type of nihilism? or is it more of a ubermench eixstential attitude   Yeah something about quitting cold turkey after masturbating for years doesn't seem right, maybe one should just gradually cut back            Circumcision via the dorsal slit method when i was younger is making me depressed every time i think about it, also the rubbing of the glans during walking or exercise is irritating and especially during exercise I worry that it's desensitising even more. I also worry that I am missing out on so much like the pleasure of having a frenar band and the foreskin with benefits like smoothness and warmth  	87
 What was it?   Are there any particularly fun/unique experiences you've had with your dog?      There was speculation among anti-captivity circles that this application had much greater implications for the import of wild-caught cetaceans to the U.S.  Had it been approved, some believed that it could open the door for the capture of Alaskan killer whales that ventured into Russian waters, which would be of great interest to SeaWorld in particular, as the genetic variation within their captive population is deplorably low.      Are these rubber-tipped sticks?  If they're not and the guy has decent chops he could probably do some damage to the treadmill.   Here are the links to the papers on [blue whales](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20130657) and [beaked whales](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/4/20130223), respectively, sited by the article.  I'm surprised the authors of the beaked whale paper were able to get published with a sample size of two individuals, but since beaked whales are so rare, it was probably not feasible to use a larger sample size.      Congrats on the long term relationship!   I've never met anyone from Ohio that is happy to be from here.  Either they already left and are glad they did or are planning to leave after whatever life milestone comes next (graduation, retirement, etc.).  The only problem is that it's like a miniature black hole of terrible that's nearly impossible to escape from.   I'm surprised Ohio hasn't shown up yet.  Do non-Ohioans not hate our state as much as we do?  We don't even have a real flag, we use bodies of water as directions (north is called "towards the lake" and south is called "towards the river"), and our unit for measuring time is "days until the next Ohio State University football game."  Oh yeah, and soybeans.  Soybeans.  Everywhere.   I was an idiot today and was playing with a power strip with a wet hand while the other was in an aquarium and I was standing in a pool of water.  I felt a buzz in my finger when I turned on the strip that I hadn't felt before when using it and realized I'd just been shocked.  That freaked me out because I could have potentially died and not even realized it.   I wrote the previous comment at work and guessed on the date.  In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area. This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.  However, zebras tend to live in small groups or are solitary, so this might not even be the case.  Some other hypotheses are that the stripes are for social benefits (sexual selection or communication), thermoregulation, and protection from parasites (tsetse flies in particular).  Darwin thought it might be for intrasexual selection and described an experiment in which a female zebra and a male wild ass are placed together and the female zebra would only let the wild ass mate with her when the researchers painted stripes him.  Personally, I think zebra stripes are least likely to be for predator avoidance, but that seems to be the one that has stuck in society's list of animal myths.  	12
 Thank you for the link. That should come in handy!   Thank you for such a thorough list! I was in a hurry when taking pictures and the tools were everywhere, so it was kind of chaotic and I appreciate you taking the time to go through them like that!    **Thank you for all the responses, that should be all that is needed for now. I really appreciate it.**    So I am in kind of a predicament where I need to sort a lot of tools in 7 days before the house I am in is being put up for sale and potentially everything in it thrown away if not removed at that time.  https://imgur.com/a/vzQm1#0       My great grandpa was alive from the 1920s up until the 1990s. A lot of this stuff I have found I know what they are. But I need to prioritize what is actually of value for keepsakes and what is not.   I will be going back down later today to snap a few more pictures of items I missed. I would appreciate any kind of help I could get.  If you see a specific type of tool or item in the pile please circle it or identify in someway I can understand since I do not know most of what these are called.   	3
 i don't really know how else to put it, (s)he was a gender bender.   me too!  it was a real shock and trying to make sense of what i was seeing took a minute.  i must have done three or four double-takes before it sank in!  	2
 From the story, OPS is the 3rd most understaffed in the entire country.  Those 130 accommodated cops don't help.   No.  You must reside in Ontario.   From the story;  10% of the OPS is on light duties;  "That senior officer told CFRA there are **130 officers** who cannot do their regular tasks because of things like injury or pregnancy.  "That's 10 per cent of all our sworn staff," the senior officer told CFRA. "That's huge."  I'm told morale is horrible in the OPS, undoubtedly 10% of a force getting out of regular jobs doesn't help.   'Outside Canada   We no longer process Canadian Police Certificates for persons living outside of Canada. Please refer to theRCMPfor this service.'  From the Ops website on the background check FAQ     The fact that this even went to trial is a travesty.  The police and the Crown clearly have too much time on their hands.  This man's life is in shambles.   Go to the bank in person, see a teller and you'll be able to withdraw some cash.   Free speech isn't free if we self censor out of fear of violent reprisal.   There are no laws governing abortion in Canada...where I live.  Medical guidelines yes, laws no.   People cheering on those who would make Death threats in response to provocative and robust speech should hold their heads in shame.     A fetus alone in the womb will become a baby.  Semen alone will **never** become a baby.   Semen needs to fertilize an egg.  Semen can never become a human on its own.  I've honestly never heard someone comparing semen to a fetus before.   I'm pro-choice, but your analogy isn't convincing.   I'm prochoice, but the **rare** late term abortions where the baby **would** survive outside the womb, I find quite distressing      Start.ca  Im perfectly happy with them and I have a VoIP phone with them as well.   TIL factual recounting of real events constitutes an attack.   Won't make a difference to any claim.   I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)  There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.  No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.  So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.  The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis.  	16
 But if you look into it to this extent, twisting facts to warp the show to your worldview, at no benefit to the story, it's utterly pointless, a waste of your time and a waste of mine.   Because of course DISGUISING herself as a male character, despite the fact she still used a female bathroom is conclusive, fullproof evidence.   Nui uses Female bathrooms, has a female voice, wears a dress, has been depicted nude, has breasts, has a favourite colour of pink, describes herself as female... I could go on. What does the series gain from this twist? Absolutely nothing, there's no male NUI subtext, there's no context, it would just piss people off. Face facts, you theory just doesn't work. You can write a fanfiction about it, but it will never, **ever** be canon.   So, since I don't have any Kill la kill episodes to wait all week for, I've decided to develop a comprehensive schedule for myself for life after Kill la kill   Monday: Madoka Magicka: Looks like a pretty sweet little magical girl series, should be fun!   Tuesday:Attack on Titan: Continues action and mild apocalyptic/fantasy flavor of kill la kill, also highly critically acclaimed   Wednesday: Claymore: The first anime I ever watched, so I'm watching it again. Continues action girl, dark elements of kill la kill   Thursday: Bakenmonogatari: Highly acclaimed, anime I'm personally interested in   Friday: gurren lagaan: A nice anime to round out my Friday, nice to get some hype for my weekend   Saturday: Space Dandy: Basically my saturday night comedy   Sunday: Sakura trick: Heard good things. I also want to create maximum contrast with madoka mondays   Basically, I want to watch acclaimed anime every day, but from every end of the spectrum, from light to dark, any comments/advice?   We need more deep, detailed roleplay, with developed characters like this in the yogscast. I mean, you guys just keep upping you game, first SOI, the Yogsquest, and now Zachs reddit links to erotica. I think this your peak, your magnum opus.   I think it should mainly be role playing games, since Yogscast is, in my opinion, about role play.   BUT THEY NEVER IMPLIED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! There's literally no evidence for it, it's not a theory, it's fanfiction, that's not a bad thing, but  there is not a single thing in dialogue or imagery to indicate Nui being male other than Nui not being overly sexualized (and NUI's distaff counterpart, Mako, wasn't either, and we know she's not a boy). **Even if** it was a twist for the OVA or word of God, everyone would say it's bullshit, because there has been no foreshadowing.   Yep, immediately after the last episode, people were declaring the ship dead. However, people started to reinterpret and analyze, and suddenly, it was back afloat, and now the community is going to shit.   The series is over, if she was a boy, they would have said, or at least giving some direct implication.   I think the OVA will be plot pivotal.  *If Rei lives through that OVA, we will get a series 2 *If rei dies, we will not get a season 2 **with these characters** *If rei dies, and their are no more story breadcrumbs/loose ends, it's over, and we should look forward to triggers next anime.    We don't know if that was the 'date' in question though. The ED obviously took place quite a while after the finale, whereas the 'date' was implied to be a more spur of the moment, immediate thing.   Because for both sides there's *just* enough evidence to make you think it's open and shut.   Is't it weird how everyone thought the gamako was sunk after the episode and now everyone's saying the Ryumako is sunk?   Apparently it is actually a translation error or the word 'Deito.' In my opinion, that makes a lot of the final scenes a lot less dramatic, but oh well.   OK, that makes much more sense, as that's a translation error, however, I would still say that still doesn't CONFIRM or disprove any ships, as we have no idea when the ending ED is set. (presumably, in my opinion, the 'date' isn't shown in the epilogue, as it's obviously set way after the ending, whereas the dialogue implied that the 'date' would be a more immediate, spontaneous thing)  The ending will still ultimately, be ambiguous, and I actually think that's a bit gutless, but oh well.   I'm not serious, if you notice the alliteration, I was comparing that Hypothetical to the equally unlikely hypothetical of 'It's just a friendship kiss guys!' Hence why I think that Neither was definitely confirmed, because you can trade tit for tat shipping comments all day long.   I'm a massive gamer, from dwarf fortress to Okami, what sort of games are you thinking? TF2?   Early credits is Ryuko's imagined, perfect past when she was being mind controlled by Ragyo and had her memories changed. The second ED is her actual life after the events of the season, hence why it has a happier, sweeter atmosphere.   She'll die in the OVA.   I'm not disregarding evidence, I'm just saying that saying 'Mako kissing Ryuko was just Mako being Mako' is just the same as saying 'Gamgoori was just gonna give flowers to Satsuki, who he has been trying to protect for years now' I just don't understand why you assume that GamagooriXMako was confirmed when there's no real concrete evidence for it.   But we **Don't** know he was going to ask her out, we also only know he was fond of her, but no direct romantic interest.   There's no concrete evidence for the Gamagoori thing either, if you can say that Mako openly kissing Ryuko was platonic, you can also say that Gamagoori was trying to present flowers to Satsuki, or that if he had tried to ask Mako out, she would have refused.   So I was wondering if the use of the word 'date' has the same connotations in Japan as it does elsewhere, as I think it would be helpful to know if it had an odd translation in the sub, or some hidden cultural meaning or whatever.  Basically, I would like discuss, from a purely rational perspective, whether the ending actually confirms ANYTHING about the shipping war stuff, or at least stop people from assuming that the term 'date' was used in a platonic sense from the get-go.     Mako has shown no romantic feeling for Gamagoori, and there's the fact that the Mako is the only person capable of cooling down ryuko from brainwashing, and Ryuko keeps talking in anticipation of the date in the finale... and there's the kissing stuff, and the nosebleeds in earlier episodes, and the fact there is no canon confirmation of Gamagoori's LOVE for mako.  I don't think still supporting the Makogoori ship is unjustified, but saying it's the only canon ship is ludicrous,and there was no need to make that derogatory comment, I'm simply saying that if characters specifically talking about a DATE, they might be talking about, y'know, a date.  Im simply arguing from a state of rationality, I'm not shipping anyone, I'm simply stating that I think there's more evidence for the Mako Ryuko stuff than to the contrary, but neither has ultimately being exclusively confirmed.   Depends what rei does in the OVA IMO, if she gets defeated, no season 2.   I think it will be half and half. If rei doesn't turn up, it's essentially a given there'll be a season 2. Remember, Rei said in ep 22 that her life wasn't important as long as the life fibres achieve domination.   But there isn't an indication that the ED shows the 'date' anyway. I'm sorry, but the terminology would not be used if it was platonic.   Exactly! Mako, in a friendly way, handstitched M's onto Ryuko ass! It's the only logical explanation!   I think Rei will feature heavily in the OVA. She's a massive loose end. Perhaps the OVA may be exclusively about her.   Those are Friendship M's! Friendly M's!   Doubtful. Disney does develop adult properties through paramount anyway. What will likely happen is greater synergy of TV and maker studios content.   Guessing the reason she was cultivated, alone with some of Ragyo and Nui's backstory, will be given in the last episode.   Neir, a fairly obscure JRPG, had a secret ending when you got 100% To get there, you had to essentially complete this 50 hour game 4 times. However, the ending is heartbreaking, and you have to choose whether to sacrifice your character to save the world. If you choose to THE GAME DELETES EVERY SAVE FILE IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. Hundreds of hours, and all that remains is a lotus flower on the title screen.   It's the perfect size for a run.  In Britain, the most successful shows manage to achieve that over. **4 years** Besides, you get a whole new series from trigger every year anyway, and 24 is just enough to leave you satisfied but appreciating the conclusion.   I actually made a speculation post for her a week or two ago, and I'm happy with her character usage. She saved Nui and Ragyo from death, and she probably has some backstory coming next episode. It seems to me that she was a sacrificial lamb bred to power up Ragyo, and she was grown specifically to fill the roles nui and Ragyo couldn't.   Not dead actually, powering up Ragyo   That, in my opinion, is an example of the kind of elitism that puts people off anime. Anime is just programming, it has good and bad elements too. Those people who you see as watching 'reality TV' may actually be watching breaking bad or some other great show, but you misbrand it as something you hate whilst they brand anime as the 'naughty tentacles.' You can't expect people to culturally accept your media when you don't accept theirs.   I'm a primary wiiu gamer, and hate programming, but I love DF   I doubt the series will go into space, if they do follow up on that plotline, it almost certainly won't be with the same characters as this series. Remember, Kill la kill's world has shown no evidence of advanced space travel, Even the nudist beach ship, which is the result of Billions of dollars and insane amounts of intelligence, is still a regular boat with a rocket sword mode.    Who's ranium?      Hooray! One episode closer to dwarf fortress (hopefully)   I personally doubt the nui one. She's the combination of some guys sperm and a hive mind race bent on killing everyone in the universe to propagate itself. She's also a deliberate pragmatist, and would have killed ryuko multiple times without intervention. She doesn't give a damn about relationships.   I would definitely say it's a longer game, but the fact you can just brute force it, and get different results each day, means that they'll definitely be able to complete it.   I think Rei may be involved in a twist involving this, that, or she dies horribly next episode.    But, if you don't reload and get tot he end each time, you essentially get a new narrative whilst looking for the spell lines anyway. There are also multiple ways to get each one.         Called it.   That Great scientist wasn't capture by Barbarians, he actually retreated to a cave to discover the secrets of time travel.   Try Moon Knight or Rorschach from Watchmen. Moon Knight is Batman but with Split personality disorder and less badassness(which makes it even more badass when he does something cool)and Rorschach is batman if hew was poor, and had a REALLY shitty life.   And South park is nowhere near the animation quality of kill la kill anyway.   Animating costs time and money, if you don't animate things, you save money to be used animating action and fight scenes.   I'm in a similar boat, personally, I'll be watching FLCL,Bakenmonogatari, space dandy an Gurren Lampa.   I personally think that level of complexity is unlikely. As far as we're aware, individual life fibers aren't sentient, and  it would be odd to pull the 'ryuko is evil' twist again. I think that, other than some Rei backstory, all the cards are pretty much on the table now.   The animation does seriously decline in quality, but that's due to them saving all the budget for the last two episodes, which are one long fight sequence. For example, the eating scene in ep 22 was just static pictures to save time and money animating characters eating.   I don't personally watch it, mainly because I like city building games to have enemies and combat after playing DF, but that's just me.   Nui and ragyo are only evil, and satsuki was never chaotic or neutral    Fair point, but the sword not being used from the start isn't the optimum example of that, it's just a cool way to end a fight rather than something endemic of the films writing.   The winterkewl channel has the update videos. Because the stuff initially shown was a 'vertical slice' it's taken a while to get up to the quality seen in those demos.   Nui has deep psychological issues, she doesn't need the mind control. However, an interesting question is whether Rei, a completely normal person other than being completely happy to destroy the world is being mind controlled.   Because she's a badass, in her initial appearance she came in and blew every other character out of the water. I don't want her to win, but I'd much rather her or Rei as the final fight than Ragyo.   You like her, just as an antagonist you love to hate. Bear in mind most people thought that Satsuki was a villain, and hated all her fascist bullshit. We were expecting The elite four to come in, Ryuko to grow in power slowly, and eventually take down Satsuki and Ragyo. Nui came in and just didn't give a FUCK. She was a major subversion of standard shounen tropes, and incredibly pragmatic compared to Satsuki? Was I rooting for her against Ryuko? No. Was I rooting for her against Satsuki, taking on all her resolve and order with just her skills? Hell yes.   Hey! That's my favourite episode!   Parv of Crybabylon   Now, I don't usually get involved in shipping of any kind, but Kill la Kill has really fascinated with the potentiality for the the climax to literally go anywhere with character relationships. Similarly, reading up about KLK, it's been very interesting to see how the fanbase have incorporated plot developments into the growing speculation on what ships, if any, will happen by the end of the series. The points of contention seem to be around two fairly recent plot developments:  1. The Mako Gamagoori hinted romance/ship, I don't think a lot of people saw this coming. Usually, ships are speculation based, particularly the Yuri or unlikely ships, however, the Mako/Ryuko ship seemed increasingly likely, with frequent references (such as the nosebleed) however, after aorund episode 12, suddenly this changed, and the fanbase latched on to the Gamagoori/ Mako ship, particularly as Ryuko started to lose some audience sympathy at this point. I think it's very interesting that Mako has two potential love interests yet they're both equally 'unorthodox' (it would be a gutsy move to make the protagonist a lesbian, but also a gutsy move to deny how it thematically makes sense, as well as the shipping and fanservice angle that is played up fairly heavily on the show.)  2. The sinking of the Satsuki/Ryuko ship. Although some people still struggle along with the incest angle, It's almost certain nothing will come of this. Which leaves us with a problem: If Mako goes with Gamogoori, Ryuko really wouldn't have any love interest that she's significantly invested in, furthermore Satsuki is now almost certainly not going to have a love interest of any kind.  Therefore, I ask a question to you fellow redditors, what, from a story perspective, is most likely to happen in terms of these relationships? Will Trigger go for the gutsy move of a lesbian main character, or will they choose to pair up only Mako and maybe a few elite four/ nudist beach members? Or maybe nobody at all? I welcome the discussion.   Because she simply looks young, I mean, it may be presumptuous but how else can we tell the characters age? Also, don't life fibers naturally control people over 20, and although she's Ragyo's lacky, she definitely seems to be capable of independent thought.   Nui has been shown to be working on a project away from Ragyo's vision, looks like we've got the mother of all double crosses on our hands.   This has been speculated upon, but personally I doubt it, If Isshin was in disguise, he would have blown it when everybody were pulling the aces from their sleeves. Furthermore, even if he was in disguise, Ragyo must have hired a random girl, who only existed six months ago, to be her assistant, then told her all her super top secret plans, all with no prerogative. It may happen, but I think it would be bad writing if they don't give a VERY complicated explanation.   But why would you get a at most 18 year old girl to do that? Why would you tell her all your plans in detail, including the details of Covers? Moreover, why wouldn't you get her to be absorbed into covers when her work is done?   OK, So I just finished a marathon run of the Anime this weekend, and I'm super excited for the next few episodes, but I think one character is being potentially overlooked,Rei Hououmaru, Ragyo's assistant. I believe she will have some vital importance to the climax due to a few key factors.   1. She's the **very young** assistant of the main antagonist of the series, an antagonist that's shown to be extremely take no prisoners, psychopathic and condescending. The only other person in Ragyo's triad is Nui, one of the most powerful characters on the show, why would she have an assistant with no special abilities or no master plan in mind? 2. Rei is shown constantly in shots, including the titles sequence, she was also not unimportant enough to be offered to the covers, she must be kept alive for something 3. If you had a final trump card like Ragyo surely does, you wouldn't want to hide it in a secret base that could get hacked, or use it so openly in combat like with Nui, you would hide it in plain sight, slightly blurred and out of focus, just like Rei. Therefore, I posit a theory: The new outfit being made by Nui isn't for Ryuko or Ragyo, it's for Rei, the person under her absolute control and power, kept following around on a leash. I predict Rei will do something in the climax that openly makes us go WHAT THE FUCK? Like so many of the twists so far.   Anyway, I'm open for discussion and contradiction, so fire away!   I like to think that Duncan acquired those resources through a daring, oceans 11 style heist.   Wait a second, luck is useless in combat, it's essentially a junk skill. What a crappy thing to sell.   Really? Will it turn me into a snake?   Wait, where was the ARG about 'eyebrow guy?' That sounds hilarious.   OK, I believe this was a fuck-up. A HUGE fuck-up, but a fuck-up none the less.   But that just dug you a bigger hole. If people were criticizing you for deleting posts, why did you ever think deleting those posts would help?   So the post that was deleted minutes ago, which was simply a twitter post by Rythian, was deleted by bots for the words 'oh snap'?   This isn't absolute power, this is enough power to delete comments you don't like without any discussion or debate, this is just enough power to make it you're always looking after the public interest.   Give a couple assholes the ability to whitewash their problems away and this tends to happen. I remember a similar situation killing the mighty no9 forums.   Coming soon: Minecraft: the subreddit chronicle.   Please for the next indie game play Abobo's big adventure! It has actual creative talent put into it!   Nope, even if you actively try to make it less complex, it will still have things like military upkeep, inventorary management, hospitals, minecarts, dwarven personalities, tantrum spirals and vampires to contend with.   I've suggested this in the game suggestion thread, If he's already played Earthbound I really want him to play mother 3. It would be amazing to see a game that actually makes sips cry.   You know what would be really Meta to play?South part:TSOT. Think about how much roleplay we would be doing!   Nobody expects the Spanish sjinquisition!   mmm, I do think that's a problem, although there are now mods that let you use Towns style sprites for DF. I just think the RP potential is too good to ignore.   Hey sips, this may be COMPLETELY out of leftfield, but how about Earthbound? It's generally seen as one of the best JRPG'S ever made, is all about American values, is nostalgic because it was around in your childhood, and is quietly weird without being in your face like South park. (Although Earthbound was inspiration for the new South park game) If you've already played Earthbound, I'll suggest something even MORE radical [Mother 3](http://mother3.fobby.net/), the sequel to Earthbound, which was made in 2006, and, thanks to the glories of fan translation, can now be played in the west. Mother 3 is generally regarded as a narrative masterpiece, humourous yet incredibly touching. (many people have said it made them cry) I know it's a big undertaking, but I gaurantee you'll be hooked by the end of the first chapter of Mother 3   IMO rather than do Towns he should just bite the bullet of town development games and try dwarf fortress, It's more complex than towns will ever be    Ok, So i just put this up on the actual subreddit (derp) but [Abobo's big adventure](http://abobosbigadventure.com/) would be the perfect game for sips, It's all about the big bastard from double dragon himself,is super fun and has loads of awesome references and easter eggs!   Can't believe this has never been suggested before, but the boss that sips was excited about in Double Dragon neon, Abobo, has had his very own videogame for a couple years now! I don't want to spoil to much, but it's the PERFECT game for sips, and in general is a send-up to the NES games of his childhood. The game can be found [here] (http://abobosbigadventure.com/)   Anyone else think that Lewis's voice was exactly like Ed Millibands in this video?   The yogscast: Masters of minecraft.   There's literally no point to metagaming in a choose your own adventure like this. I've played it, and there aren't any instant lose conditions, you just travel the journey you want, whilst stopping off to get the keywords on the way.   But you redo the entire game whenever you reach the gate without the keywords.   They don't really get how this works do they?  It's like a kid going: "I can make much betterer videoes than pewdiepie, he got 10 million subs in a few years, I'll get like ten bajillion in a few seconds with my 360 no-scopes!"   I like to think of it like this, if helix is God, and the Dome is the devil, Zapdos is Cthulhu, a being TPP was not meant to have, that is slowly driving us to madness, anarchy isn't working, democracy isn't working. All fall under the mighty zapdos.    I'm not sure he'll be able to survive this massacre much longer. The keeper  needs to be put back in the box, only then will the madness end.   WHEN WILL THE MADNESS END? YOU DAMN MANIACS!WHEN WILL YOU LEARN?   Bigdig digged to heaven :c   Nah I'm sure... OH GOD, OH GOD BIGDIG NO!!!!!!   So this is how Bird Jesus ends, with thunderous applause....   You thought Zapdos being caught and saved from release was a good thing? You thought the helix, in all his power and wisdom, would directly intervene to save the supposed '2nd coming'? Face it, if Flareon was the heretic, Zapdos is the antichrist. He killed Dux, he Killed the seed, he isn't even a follower of Democracy,he is bigger; a bigger force of evil at play than even the Dome.   There's only one word that accurately describes my feelings right now:  lol  	104
 Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman   It is a bit underrated movie although i think it deserves much more than that.I liked the movie very much.Brad Pitt,Casey Affleck did a great job.The directing was very good too.The concept of narrating the story was great.   After watching Part-1 my ideas on crime movies were never the same again.And no other crime movie can compete with it either.  	3

 Hey all, anyone know of a good simulator to practice with? Something that has a patient presentation and you need to gather history, perform an exam, give meds and the simulation will respond accordingly?   Sorry to butt in, but this is obvious.    Subtle. I like it.   "Dolls spin dynamically to advance"  	4
 Actual film composition is all conjecture at this moment as we know absolutely nothing about:  a.) shared screen time.  b.) Lex's power suit (armani or armor)  I'm just talking looking at them side by side in the abstract.  Eisenberg is known for playing an introverted nerd type and Cavill is ripped - even if not to comic standards (much like the airbrushed standards women face).    I'm just saying, in terms of spirit - they are quite opposite.     I kind of like this casting.  They can go a lot routes with this character - specifically in the contrasting looks between Superman and Lex.  Just physically, when you look at them, you know where their strengths lie.   They can play off Lex's need to be adored - and maybe that jealousy of Superman plays into his working out and bulking up.    I would suggest reading these to get a better look at their complex relationship:  Man For All Seasons:   http://www.amazon.com/Superman-All-Seasons-Jeph-Loeb/dp/1563895293/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1391204765 sr=8-1 keywords=man+for+all+seasons+superman  Luthor:  http://www.amazon.com/Luthor-Brian-Azzarello/dp/1401229301/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1391204803 sr=8-1 keywords=luthor         	4
  Wise Man's Fear so quickly almost broke him, and it isn't quite as as polished.  There were also a couple of pretty blatant author's mistakes that he might've otherwise caught ...    For the millionth freaking time, the search function is terrible because nobody titles their post to reflect what it is.  Yeah, which is why the search function should be able to *search comments*, which would be hugely useful.  Not to mention being able to search by userid, or even just search my own comment history.   How is that relevant to this?   Or developing a better search function.    Spent like 10 consecutive hours watching the most god-forsaken movies.  The touch screen on the seat in front of you, on a tube of aluminum travelling 600mph at 30,000 feet to Africa, didn't have a great movie selection.  Truly we live in horrible times.    I don't want to pay for somebody else's health   If you have private health insurance, that's exactly what you're doing.  I'm not sure if you get this, but a lot of other people honestly think that their premiums only go towards their own care.   Significantly less than 100% actually had the means to do so.   You're drunk early.   Also I haven't really decided what part of Cali to visit either.  You know California is[ rather large](http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/m6mos/california_in_perspective_for_east_coasters_usa/)?  Because you're going to want to narrow it down.   Is this more of a suburban and/or East-coast thing?  Because I live in a place where the snow   rain would seem to demand it (well, most years), but no one does.  While a lot of people have hardwood or laminate floors, even people with carpet don't bother.    i would think even a WW2 era U-boat could sneak up on many modern ships under electric power.  Doubtful - subs make a lot more noise than just from their energy source.  Just the prop or shaft noise from a U-boat could no doubt be heard by any halfway decent modern warship from miles away.   Because it sure doesn't read that way in the books, but the Pandora station I've got set up is bland to the point of falling asleep.  Thin, reedy, pluck-ish ... lute music seems to lack depth and passion.    It's the kind of music I can see being played in the background of a dinner in Georgian London, with everyone talking severely and quietly and otherwise being staid and boring.   HMS *Invincible*, which wasn't.   Depending on where you live, you might want to try the Home Energy Assistance Program.  I'm headed that way myself in the next few days, for the same reason (48hr. notice).

The full length "Watchmen" trailer with the Smashing Pumpkins music.  That, or the first time seeing the "Independence Day" trailer, which I believe was during the Super Bowl in '96.    The Dad jeans don't hug the legs at all, they give no sense of shape, make a fit guy look less fit  And they're a whole lot easier to do physical labor in, which is the point for some of us.   I'm pointing out that there seem to be enough exceptions to the rule, so as to make your title untrue.   McKiernan:  Hey, I totally want to write a sequel to Lord of the Rings.  Tolkien Estate:  No, you can't do that.  McKiernan: (*Does it anyways.*)   Rothfuss claims he hasn't read the WoT.   It isn't on the old clock I have, or on any clock that uses Roman numerals that I've ever seen.   We've been living a lie, my friends.    Now it owes it's independence to France. Did they also fight all the battles an declare independence too?  You really need to read up on the Revolutionary War - the nascent U.S. was heavily supported by French money, and a lot of French troops and naval forces.  There were almost as many French troops at Yorktown as American, and it was the French fleet that fought the British fleet in the Battle of Chesapeake Bay to force the British surrender at Yorktown.   And it's not like they have a whole lot to spare ...    The family wasn't struggling   And now you know why.   Your post has 64 words and zero facts.  That's a pretty impressive ratio - I couldn't even do that on purpose.    I had 3 colonoscopes performed by the age of 23  Yeah ... you weren't really there to check for cancer, were you?   "Cloud aiming" or "pixel aiming" was a quick way to get banned from some servers, though.  It was real obvious when you were doing it.   Huh, that's the same code as the lock on my luggage.   Nothing in particular, but damned if I wouldn't at this point.   Anything involving physical pain.  Pretty much that.   Everything in my life.  Sorry, I meant EVERYTHING FUCKING THING in my life.  From being so broke I'm soon to be evicted, to the fact that I haven't so much as touched a girl in nearly six years and I'm still in my 30s, to that fact that I can't get a job and I don't know why even when plenty of people are willing to speak up for and recommend me, to the fact that fuck this.  Just fuck this.    Dems will bankroll candidates the exact same way as the Koch brothers and spend just as much money doing so.  Again, [citation needed].  Scale matters.  The Koch brothers throwing nearly a billion into an election cycle, or Sheldon Adelson cutting $10 million checks to Newt Gingrich, is slightly different from Soros tossing a million or two to a progressive PAC every now and then.  Hell, Texas oil billionaires probably spent more money on Swiftboating Kerry in 2004 than Soros has spent on Democrats *ever*.   Yep, that was the one.  If it was about 2001-2003, I probably killed you a few times, or got killed by you.    I fell out the back of that AC-130 a few too many times though (when the pilot decided to climb fast).  It's a good thing literally everyone in the game was magically carrying a parachute, then.   I'm noticing a complete and utter lack of hard numbers, or even soft numbers.   Does the id "21st_Panzer" ring any bells?  That was our clan name.  We played all day, every day, or at least we did on weekends, and then we moved on to BF2.  Our preference was for the WOLF servers, which are apparently still running.   I've read two of them - *Night of Knives* was decent, because it was minimal.  It didn't try to be epic, it just told an interesting background story in a sparse, action-laden fashion.  *Return of the Crimson Guard* tried way too hard to be epic, and failed.    ICE has a tendency towards bad prose, and just throwing a bunch of things into the story without really blending them.  He covers all the plot elements required, but not smoothly. Very choppy, jumps-around type of work.  And he frequently underwhelms with his revelations of big mysteries.  Something will get hugely built up, and then when you find out the secret, it's like ... "That's it?  Seriously?"   Get elected President first, and we will.  One of the perks of the job.   [citation needed]   Unfortunately, it's ICE that's going to be writing the prequels about Dancer and Kellanvad.   One of my best gaming moments was shooting down a MiG-29 with the howitzer on an AC-130, while it was passing by in the opposite direction, in a BF1942 mod called "Desert Combat."    The other guy was both pissed and admiring at the same time.   "The Pentagon Wars" is satire, designed to make the anti-Bradley bureaucrats look silly.  Too many people don't get this, and think it's the generals that look like fools.   It would've been useful as a target, not much else - it was poorly designed, and the Germans had *zero* carrier experience.  They would've had to learn on the fly in a shooting war against a vastly superior navy.   Seeing my bank account balance.   Such a huge part of my childhood, and in a picture format that I remember from and associate with that time.  Thanks.   Like the X-29, but less polite.    Makes it sound like a different planet.  Well, that's not entirely inaccurate.   Lots and lots of snow, like there should be this time of year.   @JesusNazareth: They said I was hung, and they was right.   I didn't know her name, just respected her for her ability to escape from a bear trap.   I've never eaten macaroni and cheese that didn't have a shape.   A bit touchy about being called out on being completely wrong, now aren't you?  I directly quoted how wrong you are.   You said, direct quote: "Republicans got more votes."  They empirically didn't.   You have very poor reading comprehension.  I'm pointing out that, contrary to recent Republican claims, capturing a simple majority in Congress does not mean that the party that does so represents the will of a majority of the country.  Also, you might want to drag yourself out of 1983, because currently a majority of Americans favor gay marriage.  http://www.gallup.com/poll/169640/sex-marriage-support-reaches-new-high.aspx   I can buy whiskey, porn, and guns at the same store.   Procras   There was a much larger population of girls that wouldn't sleep with me in college.   Get drunk, masturbate, weep bitterly.   I spent a couple summers working at a marina, and let me tell you ... the girls that vacationed there were not in the least bit modest.    Oh, so you're saying Democrats lost because Republicans got more votes.  Actually, they didn't.  http://www.vox.com/2015/1/3/7482635/senate-small-states/in/5654656  "the 46 Democratic caucus members in the 114th Congress received a total of 67.8 million votes in winning their seats, while the 54 Republican caucus members received 47.1 million votes."  But you just keep on telling everyone how the current Congress represents the will of the people, and has some kind of mandate.    Gerrymandering by race is against the law  Oh, well, gosh, guess that means it doesn't happen.  It's *against the law*, after all.   Were any of them from an Axis country?   Or even at least once.    India? Sure you can have nukes! We'll even sell you the stuff you need..  India has had nukes for nearly 50 years, without US help.   Believing things that are at direct odds with provable physical reality is pretty much guaranteed to cause you problems in an academic setting.   I can only imagine what would happen if Anomander Rake showed up in the Wheel of Time universe.  So.  Much.  Pain.   ... for the Forsaken.   A lot more.  Oh, God, so many more, it's such a pain to clean them all up.   Subject to change.   In the late Sixties, Milton Bradley created the game Battleship, which introduced the catch phrase You sank my battleship to the general public.  It is still the shortest and most accurate history of the battleship to date.  Perfect.    I actually think that its the Maer.  The Maer Alveron is very likely King at the time of the framing in Newerre - the King's soldiers are wearing Alveron's colors (white and blue), and it's doubtful that there's been enough time for him to have sired an heir, and that heir to have grown up and taken the throne.   In the category of *very* minor characters, I still think Geoffrey completely scammed Denna.  Maybe Devi's in on it and gets a cut, I don't know.   No, I'm saying that doesn't particularly make them any better or worse than many other countries of equal strength and regional involvement.  But some people talk like they're the next coming of Nazi Germany, which is a really stupid, counterproductive mindset.   Remember that guy who called Iran a member of the "Axis of Evil"?  He spent eight years representing the entire Republican Party.    Poor Iran, such a bullied victim.  Feel free to name all the countries that Iran's invaded in its modern existence.  Hint:  None.   These are the only two pictures I could dig up - I've sold a bunch more, but have a bad habit of not taking pictures of them when I do.  If I can get some customers to send me photos, I'll add them to the album.  I tend to focus on more rural, casual scenes.  Very reasonable prices, especially right now.       He's just too far back in the peerage for it to ever happen.   While this is possibly true, that peerage is getting thinned out.  And I thinks it's a bit of foreshadowing that the birds Kvothe chose to get killed by Caudicus' poison have the same name as the royal line of Vintas.   Noted and done.   Plumas.   In fact, my very patient landlord waited way past 60 days, I'm more like 90 behind, and he finally sent the 30-day notice.  Currently unemployed and worked a cash job over the summer/fall, so no UI. I've scraped up one month's rent ($350), but live in a rural area where there's just no day-work, almost no social services (I have no kids, so don't qualify for any county or state - California - help), and very very few jobs available.  If I had anything valuable to sell, I would, but I never really have.  The usual work I do in the winter is dependent upon getting snow, and we (rural NE California), well, *haven't*.  I'm not looking to raise $1000 from redditors, but literally anything would help at this point.  So I'm just sort of tossing this out there with a little more than a week left.  I just wish I was a cat who needed surgery or something - I'm not a huge sob story, just financially desperate over a bad winter.  EDIT:  PM me for Paypal details.    in Skarpi's story, Lanre and the Creation War, it's said that the "the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone".  Felurian says the same thing, which to my mind is a bit more credible.   Because they don't get along with the 51st state.    Sorry if this is a dead subject.  It has been for about 150 years.   I think Clancy went a little crazy after Clinton got elected.   Probably because it's a technical field demanding highly trained workers.   Look, we take our bacon seriously.  And we don't mean that Canadian shit either.   If Ticonderogas were ice cream, they'd taste like Praline and dick.   Woohoo!  I'm still four months behind on rent, but I have Gold, so I can at least be entertained in the meantime before eviction.  Which, completely and utterly honestly, is nice.  Like the song says, it's the simple things that make me smile.   No, it isn't.  It's never my fucking lucky day.    Chlorine Triflouride  That must be Patrick Rothfuss' inspiration for bone-tar.   That's like complaining about the visitor's lockers not having hot water for the showers - in the '80s, you should have just expected it as routine fuckery.   My birthday is July 21st - all that neat, new information coming back from Pluto is going to make a nice early present.   Not behind that line, you don't.   I prefer to believe this.   The *Kentucky* chipping in, to be precise.  They should've brought *USS* *Camden* in just to complete the picture.    But for whatever reason, that shitty pre-sliced bread is really popular in the US.   You know ... that stuff is really, really good for a couple of things.  First:  well-buttered toast.  Generic American sliced white bread just makes really good toast.  Because I don't want an overly-strong flavor like sourdough or whatever first thing in the morning.  And second, grilled-cheese sandwiches, with the equally-derided Kraft American cheese slices on them.  Two over-priced, over-processed piles of chemicals that only vaguely resemble their namesakes, but when you put them together are so goddamn delicious.  EDIT:  I'll toss in a third thing:  Cheap grade-school sandwiches with lots of mayo.  Namely, ham-and-cheese using cheap, tangy, fatty mayo and mass-produced deli sliced ham.  Or with Oscar Meyer bologna, which probably isn't even a real meat, but with enough mayo and mustard on Wonderbread is really, really tasty.    My girlfriend and I live in Sacramento where the water is pretty good.  I lived in Davis for quite a while - the water is far worse than Sacramento.  The water towers look neat, but what comes out of them is awful.   Nice of them to specify ice glaciers, so we don't get them confused with some other kind.   Source?  Because I'm currently living in a 90%+ white county (Plumas), that's not on the map.  In fact, there's at least one other (Sierra) just in California that aren't listed.   I'm especially talking about things with complex recipes, where the store-bought version has a long shelf-life but the home-made version has to be used fairly fast.  In my case, it's Caeser dressing - started doing so a week ago, and I'll never go back to the bottled stuff, though there are plenty of decent brands out there.  I still haven't done ranch because of the short fridge-life of buttermilk, but that's probably up next.   Woohoo!  Four months behind on rent, this is just the ticket to get out of a bad situation!  And not get evicted in a few weeks.   I believe those are called "Hot House" cucumbers here, usually from Mexico.    I have not heard of any place in the US that you can't drink the water.  You've clearly never been to the California Central Valley - it won't kill, it'll just make you swear off water.  Like drinking from a pool.   5. American bread is sooo sweet. The crust is also really weird. It's not crispy. It's soft. Like not crust, but still crust.  That's common, mass-produced, generic store-bought sliced bread.  Any decent grocery store will also have a bakery making *much* better stuff.   I believe this is the thread you were looking for:  http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2sy0qc/happy_martin_luther_king_day_from_the_south/   (Now with np goodness).   The "MLK / Lee" Day on the front page of /r/pics is turning into a Lost Cause-athon for the Confederacy, in case no one noticed, or didn't feel like staying sober anyways.    I wouldn't live in California  For preparedness reasons?  Because California != L.A. 90% of the state doesn't resemble L.A. even remotely.   The Saints got schooled.    Washing slowly destroys clothes.  Yeah, but not nearly as fast as *not* washing them.   So what's a good stream for those of us with bad connections?  Because every post seems focused on the streams with the highest bandwidth and resolution.  If I could afford that kind of connection ... I wouldn't need a stream.   It's pretty much the same team the Niners beat the last two meetups, last season twice.   What the fuck is going on?  Just what the fuck?  	112
 A dash of Campari in an Amaretto Sour changes the mouthfeel so it isn't so sickly and brings it forward on the palate. Makes it soooo much better. 5mls or so only required.    I work in a bar for twat fresh faced 18 year olds and they play this song at least once a night and every person in that bar screams the goat bits. The DJ has started doing that thing where he shuts the music off for a goat scream 2 second sing along. FML.    Hold the newsreader's nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk with countermand my trousers.    Well this exists in my town. Video game themed bar.

I can't stand lager, which is what people generally think of when they say 'beer'. The clear slightly yellow bubbly liquid that tastes like carbonated piss.    Try a stout, porter or amber ale. They have a bit more balls and flavor to them. If you're American you should be able to get you hands on Brooklyn Brown Ale fairly easily. Australian, try the Holgate Chocolate Porter.

So now I suffer somewhat from nerve damage, from the waist down.. but shiiit, I can walk, shit, piss and fuck, I am really, really lucky.   My bro broke his neck too, and even though he's pretty crippled we all just consider it awesome that he can walk, shit and get a boner. You really only need three things when it comes down to it.    I HAD A DREAM ABOUT EXACTLY THIS. THIS IS SUPER FUCKING WEIRD.   You aren't the only one.   Goddamnit. Now I must have it.   I got the 4096 tile the other day. I was way too proud.    As a girl I'd like to know total number of orgasms, from sex and masturbation separately. I can give myself like 8 orgasms in a 10 minute sesh if I'm in the mood. And technically that's only masturbating once.   	15
 I see a redditor. How many days til someone leaves and how many people leave?   Oh you mean that girl over there showing half her ass? Yeah she's just with friends   My cat's name is Miles davis cuz I love jazz      what.... I almost don't believe that   Just because he doesn't remember the conversation doesn't mean it didnt happen. We need answers man!   Blond hair   Oh right ok. At the moment I'm nervous about a lot of stuff ha   What year in med school are you? I'm hopefully going to pharmacy school next year. Just waitin on that email to come   I just hate how throughout the series we're led to believe that the whole gang is always together. Uncle barney and Aunt Robin are always prevalent. But no turns out they all pretty much go their separate ways.  Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy. Why have we never heard about this kid before. Wouldn't that kid be Ted's kid's friend? Total shortcut in writing   I thought the way it was written was classic himym, definitely not the top 5 worst episodes   Anything autism related. I don't even know why that gets discussed on Reddit   You may need to explain this further      Since when is all of france the size of NYC?   That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome   I have an actual cat, is that cool? Anyone?   That's true but at least Barney doesn't introduce the girls to them. I mean I don't break up with someone then show off the latest person I'm seeing to my ex   Ok, thank you for actually coming up with a reason. Of course I wouldn't discriminate against other races. I don't think there's a country in the world where every single person is unattractive    Are you trying to make me sad?   /r/subredditsarehashbrowns   I don't get your logic why is it necessary to be attracted to every single Asian group? I mean if you think Italian girls are hot does that mean you have to love Polish girls too just because they're all European?   My parents are putting me through college and I thank them all the time. I mean it literally wouldn't be possible otherwise. Working full time at the same time as college wouldn't be enough, and that would be darn near impossible anyways   As a college student I can say there's a direct correlation between time spent studying and grades on tests. However I don't really get hw I just have to memorize tons of stuff   How is thinking chinese girls are cute racist? And no one asked you to reply to my post   Salmobrolas cousin   I think it's stupid in most cases. Like at a bar when they pour a beer and hand it to me. I mean really what effort didd that take?

Skipping class to go on a bus ride for cross country was the best   Good thing I'm lipid soluble   "Look is this gonna happen or what?"      The last episode just really made me bitter towards Robin. I feel like she was the reason the divorce happened. Sounded like she only cared about her career and never spent time with Barney   I asked this too awhile back. General consensus was that was just Barney joking   And now you're into human sandwhiches 20 years later?   Very center of my College's football field. I'll never watch a game the same way now..   Ahh yes, the 500 point turn   [Delicious new GIFV format](http://imgur.com/AEUVRrG)   I always wanted Ted or Barney (either one really) to marry Wendy the Waitress. She's one of the best looking girls on the show and looks fun. Maybe I just want to marry her :(   This may sound weird but I've always thought smoking in old movies or like this picture looked cool. I don't smoke but damn OP's dad just makes it look awesome. Just that relaxed look   Hello Dr. Fielder, What is the flu season going to look like this year in response to the Ebola craze right now?

So amazing   $15 of.... in store credit   If you think about it most of the crime in those places isn't even reported in the news. So more than likely they're worse   You gotta love crab   Well I'm glad someone did   It's pronounced thermometer   Yes in fact these 2 motions are analogous to said fingerbanging   Did anything cool happen or did you just mail them back?   I can just hear those ribs cracking   Chucks/vansheels. always   My cross country team was an absolute joke. We did far worse stuff than wave, like skipping across the finish line. It was fun though   Yep, had this happen to me once. The dude came to my car, opened my door, and yelled at me.  To OP, that is a horrible situation and I hope the guy gets thrown in jail for a good long while   Chad's bad   I definitely agree. Although I did love Archer Vice. Glad it's goin back to the original format tho   I thought it went well. They were pretty casual and only asked about 5 or so questions that were all what I'm sure any pre-pharm person would have answers to.  Then they let me ask questions; I had a notebook of them written down so I just asked away. And they were all super nice   Did everyone back then just have thick black hair with perfect hairlines?   MC Escher that's actuallly a genius title for this. I'm still confused..   Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years   All mine was accurate except math. It went from 73 to like a 63. I was not happy   Thanks for the advice everyone. If anyone else has questions about the interview process I could probably answer them after today   This dude I work with said he only ate ramen for a whole month. He said he didn't go to the bathroom once the whole time and by the end his gums were bleeding. He's pretty sure he got scurvy   This gave me call of duty war flashbacks   Pirate skulls were so 1600's   Then get rid of the parking ticket I got   My collar is baby blue not purple you jerks   Drinking coffee now  Straight black cuz creams for bitches  And teas for snitches   But microbio  bio      Why can't he write it?

Why does KISS look the way they do yet sound the way they do?   Seriously, I've asked a few questions that have gotten like 20 replies with only a couple upvotes. Only to be buried with the rest of them   For some they actually paid attention and learned a thing or two and enjoyed going to class   Watch all the cartoons my parents wouldn't let me watch. All those missed Pokemon episodes..         Don't worry you'll be caught up on everything that's happened in the last years within a week or two   That is terrifying. I think it's the eyes. And the antlers obviously   I love how the buildings are so huge but scattered about enough to not just see one gigantic block   I'm in a college town and my friend has met up with a lot of girls from it. Some are cool, some aren't, either way an easy way to meet up though   I feel the same way about North Face. At this point tons of people wear the jackets just for fashion, yet NF still makes the jackets for their intended purpose   This is an ideology I can get behind   From what I heard he also sold thousands of dollars of diamonds though   Yes.   I'll have the matzoball soup      How could I change my channel?   I'd love to wear a button up and tie on occasion. I feel like I'd look weird though   Sorry you have had bad professors.   I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.  If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs!   Funny you should mention that. I just failed my first Immunology exam, and I too would agree it's been my hardest class to date   Rough wasn't it? Feels great to take that last chemistry class though   Could be high school, college, grad school etc.   I live where it gets sub freezing for the whole winter. Got one of those 3 in 1 Northface ski jackets and it's one of my best investments. Totally worth it if you plan on using one for years      How are there 2 of these comments with the exact same replies with different upvotes?? What is this sorcery?

 Yes, there are hardly any IDE interface ssd's and at that, it does not utilize the full speed of an ssd. You will have to buy another sata3 cable.   Just search on google for windows 8.1 ISO. You can download it straight from the Microsoft website and load the ISO file into bootcamp. This is good until January.   Windows 8.1 is free right now.   As an AT T customer, i get a constant 20mbps down speed on my uverse line. Also with wireless, i enjoy having the ability to use data while talking on the phone simultaneously. Something other carriers can not provide. (try to call somebody and then go to google if you are on verizon and make sure your wifi is off).  I live almost right under an at t tower and get 35-40mbps lte data :).   Belmont?   You can say all you want but it is inconsiderate of people around you that have to get up and go to work in the morning with less than 5 hours of sleep. The mother and the person that used ignorant words like "fuck and hell" in his story length paragraph is unacceptable. If you have a child with mental disabilities, you should think about people around you.   It's called boot camp. And you get windows 8.1 for free until January.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/preview-iso   The pentium being a dual core, yes it would put a good limit on the 760s capabilities. I would go with at least a 3220 (it's a dual core with hyperthreading) if you are on a tight budget.  	8
 holy fuck! Wait, what's hexadecimal? Is that a math thing? Anyway, thanks for looking that stuff up because I was having a hard time deciphering it. What weirds me out is why would the hacker/author change the name from satan to the one that sleeps below and when did he do it? I've made a few grammatical edits already so he must have managed to slip it in at some point. but yeah, if he/she's trying to freak me out, there's no reason to change it because I get the idea and I've been freaking out this whole fucking time. You mentioned the confusion of tongues, maybe he's having trouble finding the right words? Fuck, I don't know enough about this stuff. also I don't mean to burden you but do you think you could decipher my name? Every time I type it (and I'm assuming this time will be the same) it comes out as [666f756e6420796f75]   and that was my name. I tried editing it and writing it a few different ways but it always comes out as a different combination than any other name I write. This is messed up.   Okay, I was just testing it, any time I  try to write a name I get the same thing...[666f756e6420796f75]   [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c] [61206c6f737420736f756c]   What the hell! I'm pegging this on a hacked account. Maybe it's a weird ad-bot thing that's replacing my text on submitting it? I don't really get why the text is so weird though. If anybody has some feedback, please post in the comments. I'll be doing some research on my end as well.  	5
                               What are everyone's thoughts about him?  ROS? Dynasty?  I know many of you cut bait for this season, but is he worth hanging onto in a dynasty league?  He's still very young.   He was a well liked prospect before undergoing tommy john surgery last year and it seems he has fully recovered. What do you guys think of his value ROS, keeper leagues, and dynasty value?                        Yes, Wazzym's x-post piqued my interest.  My question is, what are some of core beliefs in Shia Islam that diverge from orthodoxy?  When I ask sunnis, I obviously get biased answers like "kafirs, heretics, blasphemers, blah blah blah"  From my very brief reviews of various writings, it seemed that Shias were a little more objective in their treatment of the prophets companions and wives, and didn't hold them up to "saintly" status.  I understand the Imams and all that nonsense.  I want to know more about their views on hadith, the sahabas, and wives or the prophet.                                                                                 Obviously, this is a VERY deep league, so even marginal players like this hold a lot of value.            THIS IS NOT A DEFENSE OF THE WORD MUZZIE.  I'm trying to get actual answers through discussion.  I don't want to turn this into ZI's defense testimony.  I don't want a referendum on political correctness.  I just want people's opinions on this specific question.  I've had this conversation with only one redditor so far, and we were able to keep it civilized, so hopefully the  same can be expected of everybody else.  edit:  please let's not turn this into an /r/atheism "socrates died for our memes" type issue.  I just want to know how people feel about this ONE question.                                                               I brought up a Las Vegas meetup before.  Most of the meetups are localized to big cities, so those of us in the boondocks can't really go.    But if we were to have a destination vacation type meetup, people would have plenty of time to prepare, and we could have shit loads of fun.  Plus, most summer cities are cheap as hell this time of year, like Vegas, because of the weather.  Does anyone have any real interest in this, or am I just high?  (I'm not high.....yet)                                                         If these guys are fighting like this for him, Dana should put him in that front seat at every event.   One of which was blatant misogyny.  When we talk about the women who follow islam being misguided and acting against their own benefit, we aren't being sexist.  We (at least I) are talking from a place of pain, after watching our mothers, sisters, and wives fall victim to this brainwashing.  Calling out that bullshit on this sub is not misogyny.  It is venting.  We have no where else to talk about it, because no one else understands where we are coming from.  No other apostates from any other religion in the world have experienced the gender inequality that we experienced/participated in as muslims.  This is a huge point of frustration and anger for us.  So please, SRS, don't come into this sub and tell us how we should feel and/or act about this.  This is not your sub, it is ours.   I can't speak for everyone, but I'll tell you how I feel about muslim women.  I feel the same way about them as Liberal democrats feel about poor rednecks who protest against Obamacare.  People who are opposing their own interest/well being/safety.  Islam is not safe for women.  I personally feel that muslim women are brainwashed into believing the exact opposite.  I have the right to these beliefs, and I have the right to share them without being called a misogynist.  So take your overly politically correct sensitivity training back to SRS, and stay out of our business.  Are my feelings coming from a source of male privelage?  No.  They come from knowing the freedom of experiencing how wonderful life is without the soul crushing and life defeating menace that is Islam.  It ruined my life.  It is currently ruining my mother's life, and that of my sisters and female cousins.   Is there anyting you SRSers don't get mad about?  If I talk negatively about women who don't see the harm they subject themselves to, I'm a misogynist.  If I talk negatively about muslim transgressions and abuses, I'm an Islamophobe.  What exactly is the name of your world, where everybody loves everybody, and religions respect each other and don't cause hardship to women and conflict all over the world?  Just leave us alone.   edit:  I apologize for the overly possesive "our sub, not yours" comment.  Of course all are welcome here, but the discussions shouldn't deviate from this sub's purpose, IMO.                              I thought it was hiarious the way Chael kept on saying "What is different about this NEW Vitor?  Just over and over.  Hilarious.  Even DC was caught offguard.      Should this question be in /r/askscience?  If so, then I'm sorry.   A golf buddy of mine says he is trying out a new swing that has him keep all his weight on his left leg throughout the entire swing.  He says it helps him with balance, and he is getting more distance from it.  He advised me to try this swing, since I'm still relatively raw in my skill (best score 97).  Have any of you played around with this swing(Balance on left leg almost entirely instead of even distribution)?  I've been told that for short shots around the green, this is great for not losing balance and hitting the ball in every which direction, he is insisting that this should be done on longer shots as well.                                                      It's disgusting.  On the one hand, muslims and their apologists throw out their "NTS" arguments, and in the same breath, claim that man cannot judge another man's intentions, and only God can judge.  It's hard to believe that they are typing the words out, reading them, and actually seeing no contradictory hypocrisy there.  AAAHHH.  MAAAAAY.  ZIIING.                       The copy I am looking for is published by a prominent Pakistani company, whose name I can't remember.  This company's Quran publications are used in madrasas all over Pakistan and some parts of India.  Of particular note, this version contains 16 lines per page, as opposed to the more popular 13 line versions that are so common nowadays.  Is there anyone in Pakistan, or does anyone have connections to Pakistan, that could help me get a copy?  I am in the United States, and most, if not all, masjids here are filled with Egyptian or Arabian publications which contain 15 or 18 lines per page.  I know that this is very nitpicky, but this is for a gift for a friend of mine that I did hifz with 20 years ago.  I would give him mine, but the pages are not in gift-worthy condition.                                                                           Not really a question.  Doug Marshall vs. Sultan Aliev.  What. The. Fuck.  That was the most horseshit decision I have ever seen.  It was complete domination for three rounds by Sultan Aliev, yet somehow Marshall gets the decision in front of his hometown crowd.  What a fucking joke.            Is he too big for MW?  He is 6'3", and shredded like lettuce.  He looks like he has 0% body fat.  Could such drastic weight cutting be adding to all his muscle problems?    I don't think his injuries are fake.  I think he might be suffering from being one weight class too low.   What exactly is it?  Everything I read just talk about scary consequences of low cal diets and juicing, and mention electrolyte imbalances.             	163
 I know a lot of people like that, me not so much I don't spend that much time on them.   Oh that's too bad, a pretty young age to start, you should ask your doctor about ways to quit.   I think a lot of people have that :)   Me too :)   That's not so great, maybe you should talk to her about it or get some kind of help. If you don't she might leave you and you'll regret it.

Ha, ha Randy is great I loved it in season 18 when he was Lorde :D   Do you mean in ways of an affair? If you do, don't it's wrong. If you mean you want to move on then just go out meet people, ask friends to set you up, try online dating.   Final fantasy has some great love stories.   I know right! I love it, what's your favourite episode?      I know right! :)   I hate uncharted, more of a TR guy but I get why people like it :)   Nice choice, I loved them together :)      I liked it, it was exciting... I just realised how sad I am.   I know!! :D   I'm 15 so I really don't want to... yet.   Were I was attacked by Freddy Krueger. You all know the movie right? Well I've watched it a million times and it's still never scared me (lets be honest who has it scarred?) and to be honest this dream was awesome!  So I was in the dream and he was in my kitchen, I grabbed a knife and tried to stab him, knowing it wouldn't work, I ran outside with him still chasing me. I met a girl I knew and he had been tormenting her too so I gave her the knife and said:  "Hurt yourself! Cut your arm, feet something!"  She said   "Why?!"  And I replied  "If you can hurt yourself in the dream you'll wake up but just don't make it something that can kill you!"  So she did and all of a sudden she vanished so I picked up the knife and tried to hurt myself, Freddy still getting closer, but it wouldn't work no matter what I tried, the knife was like plastic now. Eventually he caught up and started suffocating me while laughing. I managed to get him off and ran for the hills. I don't remember much else but it was amazing!! (Because you know I love movies and the first nightmare and elm street is one i have a soft spot for).   I made it to get /r/freedonuts for the simpsons tapped out and then I realised there were a billion and one other things to do here so I decided that I would check it out and use it, now I love it! :)  My username is xbog4mer because I'm a gamer that plays xbox also I like the number 4.   I'm 15 but I turn 16 next month :)   Ha, ha nice question.  Searching amazon for masquerade masks and ball gowns.  Their porn would be a woman undoing her hundred button boots  Searching for the nearest carriage number.  Checking how much it costs to travel to the new world :)   Ha, ha thanks :)   Nah, I prefer xbox but you can't deny how awesome they'd be. Sure they copied her, then she copied them but still it would be nice.   Oh by the way I'm a HUGE xbox fanboy and prefer Lara but I hope everyone can appreciate how cool they'd be together.   That's why I want to stop, it's not a problem so this has been relatively easy for me but I want to stop before it becomes a problem.      http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/  I wrote that earlier, there's some tips if you want them. I love dragon age. Bioware are great I can't wait for ME4   A slug! Or a snail!   Yeah I feel great and yeah gaming I'm doing it now while I'm talking to you :) How's your nofap going?   No but it brings you closer to orgasm which is basically setting yourself up to fail.   Yeah. If I don't thay stay in my trousers and it's kinda painful.   Bill Gates   If you want. I wasn't addicted or anytbing either but I decided to try it and it's going great! You seem like you have it under control so if you don't want to that's cool but it will only work if you really want to stop.   Awesome, I love playing classical, romantic and modern (I like everything really but they're my favourites).   Good luck to you! :D   Thank you, good luck! :D   No cause then I wouldn't have learned from it but I think this sort of stuff should be taught in schools so that people don't fall into it.

I've never been addicted or anything but it was making me lazy and I was thinking things like all women fake orgasms. I know that's not true but when I do have sex it'll be with a girl I care about (at least 3-5 years from now, I don't want to have it too young). It will be much better than fapping. Anyway good luck to you :)   That's great! What's your favourite song to play?   This shouldn't be in /r/gaming it should be in /r/gambling   Do the small things. Volunteer for a charity.

Here are some tips if you want them... http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/   Hey I just posted some tips here:   http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/  Good luck!    I know most people do these on their tenth day but hell I'm in a great mood.  I've been studying more, playing less xbox but still enough for fun and of course I don't waste time fapping. I'm only 15 so obviously I'm a virgin which made me think:  "I don't know if I want to quit cause I won't have sex for years"  But it's worth it. It feels like I stopped yesterday and sure I've had alot of urges but this is fun and I'm already seeing some benefits!  Good luck to all of you out there. I'll leave some tips for those of you that feel like you can't make it.  * Say "YES" or "NO" to everything. Am I going to fap? NO! Am I going to study now instead of procrastinating? YES use this and it really helps.  * Use the 10-10-10 rule. If you fap now how will you feel in 10 minutes? In 10 hours? And if you quit nofap how will you feel in 10 years?  * A lot of men on here say they have trouble "finishing" during sex because of how much they've fapped, I'm only 15, like I said, but I don't want that to happen when I do have sex. Do you?  * Think of the fact that porn is just filmed prostitution. No one wanted to be a porn star as a kid.   * If you want you can meditate, I do and it helps.  * I'm religious so that's a motivation for me.  * Think of the regret you'll feel later.  * don't try and stop urges just acknowledge them and then say ah well now I'm going to go and... (do something else, basically acknowledge it and move on)  Good luck guys/girls!! :D    So true but many people in porn actually enjoy it I remember a few pornstars doing AMA's a while back. Of course most of the time what you said is the truth.   I'm 15, porn got me when I was 11/12. I was never addicted but I have a few ways to stop fapping when I think about it.  1. Think that porn is just filmed prostitution and that it is wrong   2. Break questions down into yes or no. Should I fap, no. Should I do my homework now, yes. Should I...  3. Think about all the guys on here that say they can't cum when they have sex due to PMO. How horrible it would it be if you lose your virginity (if you haven't yet, I haven't and I don't want to for a few more years yet) and you can't "finish".   4. Think about the 10-10-10 rule (yes I got that from another post). How will you feel in 10 minutes if you fap now? How will you feel in 10 hours? And how will you feel in 10 years if you quit nofap now?  Good luck :) oh and try not to thibk about porn or sex so much, I never really have but who knows everyone is different. When porn/fapping/sex comes to mind acknowledge it and then send it away and think about something else. (Meditation helps too, I've been doing it for a bit now and it's really nice).   I know right, hopefully this will stop at least one relapse.   No don't reset it but learn from it and try not to do it again, good luck.   ...Filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Would you watch someone else? That's all porn really is. It's disgusting (even if it doesn't seem like it when you watch). Think of this if you consider relapsing, you're about to be part of the reason that there is a demand for "filmed prostitution". Instead don't be, even if you, yes you, alone don't take part in it then you will know that. It might not make a difference, it won't make porn go away but at least you won't be part of the problem.   I'm 15, I started when I was 11/12. I've never been addicted but I just don't want to be a part of filmed prostitution, cause that's all porn is.   Okaaay    Ha, ha mine too (next to milk, not together... obviously)   Hey no problem :) good luck.   Hopefully not too long.   Ha, ha never :)   Ha, ha my sister and her bf of 6 years recently had a kid, she's almost two. Anyway she asked "what's that?" Talking about her vagina when she was getting changed so my sister told her "that's your wee lady" (we're Scottish so imagine the accent). Then the next day she's naming and pointing at my body parts when she's visiting me. Eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, wee lady. I'm so happy I wasn't in public but I burst out laughing! :D   I like your thinking! :D   Oh god, that wasn't even funny embarassing, I hooe your husband was ok :)   I don't know I'm not god. I can't answer this but I still have faith. I'm going to stop here cause I don't want these comments to turn into a religious battle (ha, ha battle with swords and stuff) but if you want to talk feel free to pm me. It's up to you :)   Ha, ha that must've been bad :) I mean do you laugh at it now (even though it was likely embarassing at the time) or do you still try and forget about it?  	119

Lets not ignore RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY as well   we have video from inside the event that was live-streamed and you're saying its staged? Hilarious.    is not stoning people for eating shrimp not against the bible?            Yeah they are. LOL           Why can't muslims respect western values of freedom of speech?      Well, they are geographically closer to islamic countries   they just hate being held accountable for their voluntarily held beliefs.    Something I wrote a while back when someone said I couldn't "prove" barack is an atheist, or at least really someone who is privately very liberally religious.  ***About his mother*** *"This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways and not necessarily the best way  that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives."*   His biological [father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,_Sr.)? Atheist.  His [mother](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2623808.story)? Atheist AND anthropologist (understanding human society and behavior)  His [grandfather](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Armour_Dunham) and [grandmother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelyn_Lee_Payne_Dunham) that raised him? Both vocal atheists (talks about this a lot in his books)   Simply put: Black people aren't getting elected if they're not religious.  Visit [**/r/BlackAtheism**](/r/BlackAtheism) more and we discuss this in detail.  Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.  Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg   He "found" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.  Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....  Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.  Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals.   He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.  When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)  Hes not religious **At all.**  Every time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html). I'm not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, is not a far stretch at all. I know /r/atheism loves the "wheres the evidence" claim, but to be honest here. [Obama has had more secular groups at the white house than any other president](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/02/atheists-meet-with-white-house-officials/1) , a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i'm sure they'd be honest about feeling threatened. He only refers to religion during times of [tragedy](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/obama-on-faith-praying-for-egypt-gabby-giffordsand-for-patience-as-malia-goes-to-her-first-dance-wit/), mandatory events like [prayer breakfasts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/obama-hosts-easter-prayer-breakfast-with-meditation-on-suffering/2012/04/04/gIQAhW7lvS_story.html)...or when hes [trolling the GOP like he recently basically said "this is what jesus would do,"](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/02/news/economy/obama_tax_rich_jesus/index.htm) to try and convince them to adopt his politics.  He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a "faith office". On top of that, don't forget him trying to get catholics to pay for birth control...  [hes trolling catholic church hospitals these days](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/health/policy/obama-administration-says-birth-control-mandate-applies-to-religious-groups-that-insure-themselves.html). I'm certain that even slightly religious people would have more "respect" for people of faith and their autonomy.   Obama has supported gay-rights [WHOLEHEARTEDLY](http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2007/12/11/the_obama_questionnaire/ ) since 1996 AT LEAST  No one in politics or academia believes him; Even people with different views don't believe him:  [Chris Hitchens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITsYUjv_aEA), [Richard Dawkins](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/richard-dawkins-barack-obama-probably-is-an-atheist-lincoln-kennedy-clinton-too/), [Ann Coulter](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-on-the-other-obama-rumor-hes-not-muslim-hes-an-atheist/), [Lawrence Krauss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Lk7gHEfK4), [Pat Buchanan](http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2012/02/21/creators_oped/page/full/), [Franklin Graham](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/21/franklin-graham-questions-obama-romney-on-christian-faith/), [Pat Roberson](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/robertson-warns-of-looming-secular-atheist-dictatorship), [Bill Maher](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/13/bill_mahers_campaign_prediction_obama_will_come_out_as_an_atheist.html), [Penn Jillette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGxVeQw3SE feature=player_embedded) etc. All of them think hes faking it. Hardcore christians and hardcore atheists.  He also campaigned on getting religion out of hiring practices: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20082217-503544.html  He's the first president to acknowledge non-believers: http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm   Now you want info on Jeremiah Wright? Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community.   Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying "god damn america"...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that "hey, they don't like me? well damn them!" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s=PM:POLITICS).  Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a "representative" (in his case Senator) does.   Name a president who says this in his inaugural speech:       *"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth."*  He's already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.   Why throw people another bone to hate him for?

Its hilarious.  like 18 hours ago, everyone thought Freddie Gray became the first man to commit suicide in a police van with his hands behind his back            47-0.

Japanese immigrants got reparations from WWII  Black people get told to "get over" hundreds of years of slavery, jim crow, red-lining, and institutionalized discrimination   Are you SERIOUS right now?    Toxins breh         Why would you even want this?   South Korea is easily the most racist country in the region   Fun Fact: Korea is one of the most racist places on earth. North and South   Abu ***Broken*** Al-Baghdadi          how about MAKING MORE RAIL LINES?      Thats not how genes work   I don't mind controversy...but at least CHALLENGE these dudes. Don't let them just spew this crap and stop laughing along with them   The "obama" phone thing is a result of a policy Reagan passed ensuring all poor people had access to a phone.    This is actually wrong. I have a graduate education in a field in which I'm familiar with how MOA works and what it does.  You...do not.  In fact, you're not even remotely familiar with ANY form of advance biology besides reading pseudoscience from racists.       *sigh*   First of all theres no indication...NONE it causes you to be "violent"  I'm sure the 400+ years of slavery and essentially reluctance from the government to stop terrorizing black people barely 50 years ago which is barely 2 generations MIGHT have something to do with it.    Its too late.  Joe is realizing what he did by letting this monster on:  http://i.imgur.com/LBC8F1P.jpg      The hate on SJW is so flawed to me.   I mean they're annoying but holy hell, complaining that colleges aren't conservative enough? I mean you wanna go back to a time when black people weren't allowed in or students weren't taught to be tolerant?      Huh? He's a moderate. Pro weed. Ex military and essentially a rational dude.    Does Joe really not understand that Eliot Rodger WAS males rights activist who was frustrated with women.    He SAID so. Just cause he killed dudes doesn't matter.    Well said.  This guy makes Cumia seem like a poor redneck compared to this high-level almost academic type of racism    Do you TRULY not know?  I mean, how insensitive to fellow humans do you have to be?   Might as well schedule David Duke.    Monoamine oxidase doesn't even do that.   It's an enzyme to reduce oxygen species. It's a complete misreading of biochemistry.   You don't even know enough to know that this is bullshit   The problem is that he does NOT push back    He's like the insulated libertarian who lacks any legit criticism or insight.    Seems tacky. If you're gonna spend that much, just plan your own trip   Did you miss the part where GAY MARRIAGE IS NOT THE SAME AS INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE IN A HISTORICAL CONCEPT?!  Goddamn.   Learn to accept where you're wrong sometimes.   You can criticize a movement without feeling like you're being attacked.  Grow the hell up son.    Bigots like me?  LOL  I asked you to not compare the right to live, with the right to get married.   Thats all I asked you to do.  I can't be a bigot for supporting gay marriage in all of its forms.  But you need to understand that these are completely separate issues.   I'm not a homophobe.  But if you can't understand how FIGHTING BEING LYNCHED and FIREBOMBED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR BREATHING AIR is different from gays wanting to get married...then you're lost.   I'm an agnostic-atheist and I support the rights of gays getting married.  But don't expect me to compare the two.  let gay marriage stand on its own two feet.  There are tons of non-religious people who are against the idea as well.    Money has nothing to do with this?  Are you serious?  You think Freddie Gray WANTED to be selling crack?   Why do you assume they are? I didn't say so.   What hypocrisy am I exhibiting when I said i'm  1. An atheist  2. Support gay rights   I'm. Not. Religious.   What the hell is your problem?   And gay marriage is NOT the same as an interracial marriage from the 1960s.   You can't keep ignoring the whole heterosexual thing then say "its the same"  Its LITERALLY different.   I support gays getting married, but do NOT compare what black people in the USA fought and died for with gay marriage.e  Do NOT do it.    They're different because interracial marriage still presumed heterosexual interaction.                      A running total anywhere or social media?   It would be interesting to compare the impacts                        I'm legitimately serious.  I don't see any other politician right now with his track record of success or national appeal who might be able to come close within the state.   Or Governor?      We can argue that he has had some questionable policies and decisions, but his personal life is pretty much as clean as you can ever ask a politician's to be.  I mean, if Obama had ever done so much as taken an extra candy bar, he'd be on the front page and barred from running for POTUS.   Its just weird seeing the Clintons back in the ring knowing how much dirt they have on themselves.       **2011:**  https://youtu.be/LYodr8ZZDQE  **2012:**   Around 2:30  https://youtu.be/J28ZzaHLJAY   **2013:**  https://youtu.be/_6MwLNOwWkE  https://youtu.be/wN8r7t-Jg5w  **2015:**  https://youtu.be/wWWU1-2sjwM   Really?  ##Really?  ##**REALLY?!?!**                                                                                                                     C'mon Kasim!

 What do the value investors here think about this? I see it too high, but there are some valid arguments. What do you think?      Due to the popularity of my post in another subreddit (which I feel is very useful to anyone who invests), I felt like I should share it with r/investing: http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2wvd06/the_intelligent_investor_handbook/   Top two in this subreddit! :D   It did not, but neither do I. I just tried to find some sort of proxy indicators that try to measure (quantify) the advice Mr. Graham gives.    Your welcome!    Thanks for the help! Was actually using that, but now I am certain in what I'm doing. Thanks!   Great post deserves more than my upvote!   Thanks so much for all the comments. I felt like I wanted to add several things.   1) The sections are not necessarily the most important. 2) The formulaes are there for those who know them, but can be easily researched.  But most importantly:  3) This is meant to be edited and improved by this great community, so that the I.I. handbook becomes even better. If you feel something is wrong, post an edited/improved version.   Explain what ORI does as a business please, apart from a one liner from wikipedia. How is it organised, what are its departments, products, services. By doing so, it will help any ORI investors by being more clear.   Hey r/investing!  I was just very curious if you could answer this question. I'm sure many others will be interested. How do you measure/understand a company's "competitive moat"? Would really wish to know. Thanks in advance!   Time will tell ;)   Where do you get your stock market news? Just read news. In the business sections (also economy/finance/etc.) you will see companies performing good/bad. What news should you read? NYT, Economist,WSJ (for high quality), Business Insider, CNN Money (for more casual). Do you come up with your investing ideas, or do you find inspiration or advice from some place? Completely depends on different people.   Thanks!  Sure is a moronic question :D   Your welcome! :) I would be very interested!   Hey r/investing! :) A quick one. When are annual reports published in the US? What about europe/asia? Thank you in advance :)   Hey there investors. During my reading of the book (2003 edit), I highlighted some of the main points I felt that were important for me. I then wrote this handbook, which is effectively a list of these quotations ordered to make a bit more sense. I then added my own notes to add/clarify the notes.   First of all I just felt like sharing it so that it could help any of you. However, I would also love it if you could add upon it (maybe I omissed some importnat things?). Thank you in advance, and hope this helps you! :)  https://docs.google.com/document/d/106U79BVHzzeCiO5SjWD1eCz4Lp6nm3VJ0rYThUk1Shg/edit?usp=sharing  PS. If you didn't read the book, I strongly suggest you do.  Thanks for the upvotes! First time in my life I'm on top of a subreddit. Im very glad its on this one, I really think its the best subreddit out there!   Money weekly YouTube channel. You cannot hate it.   ESTJ terran. But what does the "variant" mean? How many are there? Tried looking, couldn't find (I got assertive). Same thing to what is a sentinel? (Explorer etc)   Countries that have defeated an aggressor in war have the right to claim parts of its land, an unwritten rule in war. Germany tried, and failed, to expand its land. The surrounding nations had the right to take their land. Besides, Nazi Germany deserved the punishment it got, and present day Germany, without all this land, is far better off than at any other period.   Best country in the africa!   Being Russian, I can tell you: Russians drive similar to many other countries (which are similar). Its just Russians have the cameras (they have more footage).   For every gif of an epic widow mine shot you see, there's at least 50 fail shots you don't see done by guys like me. :'( Widow mines are just awesome to watch, that's why they are posted to often.    If thats a school, im not. I live in Paris.   Wow, thanks. Will ask if the school has a 3D printer.  	25
    Is it just me or does it look like the figure's flipping you off for '0'?   The OP has a point.   Take this for instance: the Dolphin Illusion - a child will see dolphins on the bottle where as, adults see a intimate pose (or most do). Research has shown that young children cannot identify the intimate couple because they do not have prior memory associated with such a scenario.  http://www.frenblog.com/illusion/dolphin-illusion/   It has the consistency of guacamole. Don't be fooled, it's delicious!    Yeah I wasn't sure if it fit. It seemed funny at the time. The deal was my boyfriend made her mad and went over to the books and started rolling around. I then said that she was doing this b/c she was mad and was marking the books to say, "This is mine, stay away!". He, on the other hand, thought it meant she wanted to play.          We've found a culprit for the bacon shortage.....   Decided to purchase a percolator bong - can't wait to try it out, once it arrives! Thanks for the tips! It makes since what you both said, just wanted to make sure by asking the /r/trees community.    Our current selection is Super Lemon Haze. We usually use a vape, but decided to try something different since I'd never rolled one before.    http://www.tempeh.info/  Tempeh is a soyfood made by controlled fermentation of cooked soybeans with a Rhizopus molds (tempeh starter)   Recipe:  http://www.tastebook.com/recipes/1277560-Spicy-Coconut-Sweet-Potato-Soup-with-Collard-Greens-and-Jasmine-Rice   It's worth at least checking out, but the actual game play isn't too great. She's a pain to move around and can't jump worth cr@p.    I thought that too, but hadn't played Far Cry 3 in a while....   Using a ruler I found the silver coin to have a diameter of 4cm and the gold ring with a diameter of 4.5cm. 4cm does not equal 4.5cm.   It still might be a true thing, but the numbers don't add up.    This, is a Jenga building: http://imgur.com/iYNZyni  Original URL: http://www.huhmagazine.co.uk/4380/jenga-building-by-herzog-and-de-meuron   Nope^Nope^Nope   That requires some balls. Of which I do not have. Now I can't complain about poor service. Geez...     Majestic until you get lost. Either way it's creepy, especially when you're not from a huge metropolis like D.C.    Looks a lot like a scene from the newest Tomb Raider.    Oh, it is! Anything I post on here will be vegetarian dishes - great way to disprove the misconception that vegetarians don't eat great food....   Recipe can be found here (though I used a cookbook - this is just easier to share):  http://www.food.com/recipe/red-chile-enchiladas-with-cheese-and-vegetables-52593      Recipe can be found here (though I used a cookbook - this is just easier to share):  http://www.food.com/recipe/red-chile-enchiladas-with-cheese-and-vegetables-52593      It has the consistency of egg salad and a nice flavor with the smoked tofu. It's a great dish if you can handle the fact it isn't a 'true' Pad Thai! :-)   We agree, but it still works.      Relying on Toyota for being a cheap car and adhering to the idea that 'chiristians' lead the majority, are not the same thing.   The first actually brings the idea that other countries control more of what we do than our own industries, advancements, etc. I don't see how that has any relation to removing something from US currency that does not apply to every citizen.    The inclusions of such words would imply that those using the currency abide by the idea. Imagine if another deity were represented or something completely against Christian morals. I'm pretty sure hell would freeze over and people would b*tch and complain nonstop.    The US 1st Amendment states that we are to exercise the FREEDOM OF AND FROM RELIGION. Including 'In God we Trust' goes against this, in every way.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_the_United_States   Then what's the solution?    I know it crossed my mind a time or two, but I rarely took it in to consideration. After meeting Dan Barker a few years back, I began to realize just how much of a problem this was. First off, we (the US) are not solely a 'Christian Nation' and symbolizing such a thing on US Currency only provides more problems. I'm not sure where to go from there because that should make it rather clear, but I would like to point out the fact that (former motto) 'E pluribus unum': One out of many - seemed just fine.   **Let me just state that I posted this out of curiosity to see if it remains a problem in other parts of the world. I do not care if you are for or against, I only want to know if the problem actually exists outside of the US. I posted the FFRF url and Wikipedia to show the foundation of the problem...   Here's the link: http://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/17021-atheists-seek-to-take-god-off-currency   "In God we trust " was adopted as the official motto of the United States in **1956** as an alternative or replacement to the unofficial motto of E pluribus unum, adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782.[1][2] "In God we trust" has appeared **on most** (not all) U.S. coins since 1864[3] and on paper currency since 1957  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_we_trust   The vegetable pancakes and yogurt make a great (and healthy) snack!    Both recipes came from the cookbook *Fresh Foods Fast: Delicious Seasonal Vegetarian Meals in Under an Hour*  Information included within the pancake recipe states that it was originally an Asian dish, but no other information was provided.    Recipes:   **    **  *: 4 *  1 cups red or brown lentils, rinsed  1 cup canned chopped tomatoes with their juice  3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  8 garlic cloves, peeled  2 teaspoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt  4 slices peeled fresh ginger, each about the size of a quarter  1 sprig rosemary  1 bay leaf  1 (10 ounces) bag washed baby spinach  2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice  Freshly milled black pepper   1. In a pressure cooker (*       20-25        *) over high heat, combine 5 cups of water with the lentils, tomatoes, oil, garlic, and salt. Wrap the ginger, rosemary, and bay leaf in a piece of cheesecloth, tie it closed with kitchen string, and add this bouquet garni to the pot. Lock the life in place and bring to full pressure. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.  2. Transfer the pressure cooker to the sink and run cold water over it to release the pressure. Remove the lid and discard the bouquet garni.   3. Return the pot to medium heat. Add the spinach and simmer until wilted. Stir in the lemon juice. Crush the garlic against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon and stir so that all the garlic completely melts into the soup. Add pepper and serve immediately.    **      **  *: 4 *   *   *:  2 cups whole-milk yogurt  1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro  1 garlic clove, minced  1-teaspoon coarse sea salt or kosher salt   teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste    *  *:  2 cups all-purpose flour  1-cup buckwheat flour  2 teaspoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt  2 teaspoons baking powder  3 cups whole-milk  4 large eggs  2 tablespoons melted butter or neutral oil, such as grape seed, canola, or sunflower  3 cups shredded green cabbage (1 small head)  1 cup shredded peeled carrot (about 3 medium carrots)  6 scallions, white and tender green parts only, thinly sliced  2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill   cup neutral oil, such as grape seed, canola, or sunflower  Fresh cilantro sprigs for garnish   1. Preheat the over to 250.  2. To prepare the yogurt sauce, in a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients until well combined. Chill until ready to serve  3. To make the pancake batter, in a large bowl, whisk together the flours, salt, and baking powder. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and butter or oil. Pour the wet mixture over the dry and stir to combine.  4. Add the cabbage, carrots, scallions, and dill to the batter and mix well. The batter will be thick.  5. In a large (or 2 small) saut pan(s) or skillet(s) over medium heat, warm  cup of oil. When the oil I shot, pour a scant cup of batter into the pan to form a pancake and fry for 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes and fry for 5 minutes more. As you finish each pancake, transfer it to a rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.  6. Transfer the pancakes to a clean cutting surface and cut each one into 4 wedges. Arrange 4 to 6 wedges on each of 4 plates. Pour yogurt sauce on top and garnish with cilantro sprigs.

Recipes in order: Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde), Thick Cream (Crema Espesa), and Layered Tortilla Casserole  (Budn de Tortillas)   **Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce** (Salsa Verde)  Ingredients: (Yield 2 to 3 cups)  - 1 lb (11 medium) fresh tomatillos, husked and washed OR two 13-ounce cans tomatillos, drained.  - Fresh hot green chiles to taste (roughly 3 chiles seranos or 2 chiles jalapenos), stemmed  - 5 or 6 sprigs fresh coriander (cilantro), roughly chopped  - 1 small onion, chopped  - 1 large clove garlic, peeled and roughly chopped  - 1 tablespoon lard or vegetable oil  - 2 cups any poultry or meat broth (depending on how the sauce is to be used)  - Salt, about  teaspoon (depending on the saltiness of the broth)  1. *The tomatillos*. Boil the fresh tomatillos and chiles in salted water to cover until tender, 10 to 15 minutes; drain. Simply drain canned tomatillos. 2. *The puree*. Place the tomatillos and chiles (raw ones if using canned tomatillos) in a blender or food processor, along with the coriander, onion and garlic; if using a blender, stir well. Process until smooth, but still retaining a *little* texture. 3. *The Sauce*. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a medium-large skillet set over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle sharply, pour it in all at once and stir constantly for 4-5 minutes, until darker and thicker. Add the broth, let return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.  **Thick Cream** (Crema Espesa)   ***Instead of this recipe, we just mixed heavy whipping cream and sour cream. But, this is the more traditional approach to preparing thick cream. If preparing this, start a full day ahead (or longer, if the incubating spot is cool). The cream will keep for 1 weeks or more, covered and refrigerated.   Ingredients:  - 1 cup whipping cream  - 2 tablespoons buttermilk  1. *Preparing the cream*. Pour the cream into a small sauce-pan, set over low heat and stir just until the chill is off, *do not* heat above 100 (lukewarm). Stir in the buttermilk and pour into a glass jar 2. *Ripening the cream*. Set the lid on the jar (but dont tighten it) and place in a warm (80-90) spot. Let the cream culture and set for 12 to 24 hours, until noticeably thicker (perhaps almost set like yogurt or sour cream). Stir gently, screw on the lid and refrigerate at least 4 hours to chill and complete the thickening.   **Layered Tortilla Casserole**  (Budn de Tortillas)  Ingredients:  - Vegetable Oil  - 12 corn tortillas (we used soft corn tortillas)  - 2 cups Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde)  *recipe above*  - 3 large chile poblanos (we used 5 Anaheim peppers) -- Roasted, peeled, seeded and sliced  - 1 cups Thick Cream, or thinned commercial sour cream  *recipe above*  - 1 cups (6 ounces) grated melting cheese like mild cheddar of Monterey Jack.  1. Quick-fry 12 corn tortillas in vegetable oil, 2 or 3 seconds per side, then drain well. 2. Line the bottom of a 9-inch-square baking dish with 3 tortillas (slightly overlapping). 3. Top with  of the sauce, cream and cheese, and 1/3 of the chiles; repeat with three more layers (the top will have no chiles). 4. Cover and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Strew with onion rings, (and radish rounds), then serve. 5. Optional: 1 cups shredded cooked chicken, pork or fish can be layered with the chiles.        How well does he get around? I've never met a cross-eyed cat, so I'm curious as to how well they get around. Also, congrats (and thank you) on taking this lil'guy in!       I did, but it freaked me out and I wasn't sure if it was a ring or the IUD had moved. Hints why it came as a surprise that the ring wasn't removed.    Sadly, no.         The recipe is included with the pictures.    Welcome! Might want to invest in the cookbook. It has a lot of great recipes!    We always use this recipe. It's from the cookbook *Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking*:  http://imgur.com/Hvvywks   Definitely a top choice for wedding destinations - classy.    Recipe URL: http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/05/my-kingdom-for-a-glass-of-milk/       Right on, man!    Since it was a ring, it might not be treated the same and can be left in. I just did what I was told, but forgot to take it out.    What MILF represents in English and in the US has no assocation to its use in other languages and countries. I understand people found this to be amusing but we can't infer they had any idea what this was showing.      Damn, I saw this post when it was new and didn't think to post who it was. Just thought it to be common sense. Lame. Should have posted something.    Why do people insist on using the animals as a clear mode of entertainment? Recall the story a few months ago, of people stoning animals at a Chinese zoo? It's just as bad. Either way you're using the animal instead of seeing it in its 'natural' habitat.    Reminds me of the Admirals Club - but of course, mid-flight. That's a luxury I'd give into if I had to travel.    We're looking for sources of milk. It's not a common thing here.    We eat a lot of homemade pizza and decided to make mozzarella this time around. There was a clear difference in quality - especially texture - by choosing homemade over store bought. We were giving it a try since it costs about the same. I won't know until we do it again whether or not it's worth doing it from scratch. In hindsight, by preparing it, you know exactly what your eating - so that pays off.    URL to the recipe:  http://www.instructables.com/id/Great-Mozzarella-Cheese/   I'll have to ask my boyfriend. He searched through several recipes. Let me check and get back with you!          It's an authentic dish to a region of Mexico.    Same information is featured in the cookbook - *Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  *Recipe (Arroz con Leche)*  This dessert is softer and more cinnamony than our baked rice pudding. The flavors are simple and close to home, but its easy to develop a thoroughgoing love for it, spoonful after spoonful. Mexican people everywhere serve it as regularly as they do flan; its creamy and, in its own way, light and soothing.  This is an especially pretty and tasty recipe, based on one from Zelayarans Las 500 mejores recetas de la cocina mexicana.  Yield : 8 to 10 servings  **Ingredients**  2 inches cinnamon stick A 2-inch strip of lime zest (colored rind only),  inch wide 1 cup rice 1 quart milk  cup sugar  teaspoon salt 4 large egg yolks  teaspoon vanilla extract  cup raisins 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits Ground cinnamon, for garnish  Directions:  1. **The rice:** Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add the cinnamon stick and lime zest, then cover and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the rice, let the mixture return to a boil, stir once, then cover and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.  2. **The pudding:** Stir in the milk, sugar and salt, and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid shows the first signs of thickening, 20 to 25 minutes. Take from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick and zest. Beat the egg yolks until runny, stir in the vanilla and a few tablespoons of the hot rice, then stir the yolk concoction back into the rice mixture. Mix in half the raisins, then spoon the rice pudding into a decorative 8-inch-square baking dish.  3. **Browning and finishing the pudding:** Preheat the broiler and dot the rice pudding with butter. Set the dish under the heat long enough to brown the top, 3 or 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining raisins and the ground cinnamon, and serve warm or at room temperature.   *Techniques*  **Thickening the Rice:** In Step 2, the mixture should be simmered only until the milk takes on a slight creaminess (it will still look soupy). Overcooking will give you something dense and unapproachable. Should the latter be your fate, stir in a few tablespoons of milk just al youre about to serve, dot with butter and brown again.   *Timing and Advance Preparation*  The rice pudding can be ready in an hour, much of which wont involve your direct participation. It may be prepared through Step 2 a day or two ahead, then buttered and broiled shortly before serving.  *Regional Explorations*  Rice pudding brings to my mind the volatile, chancy crowd of Mexico Citys Garibaldi Square, where this dessert, only one of the attractions, sits in huge, milky masses stuck with a raisin or two for decoration. Or sometimes Im reminded of the well-used walkways around the Oaxacan market, where ladies sell it in paper cups at sundown. Or I picture any of a dozen other typical scenes: from rude, makeshift street stands to well-appointed traditional restaurantswhere arroz con lecbe is the thing you have.

Oh and this was taken in NE Kansas.    For those viewing, do you like the inclusion of information or was it too much? I wanted to make this a 'learning experience' of sorts and thought adding information about the dinosaurs and whatever else would be a great thing.   The ring was inserted instead of using oral birth control. No matter the type - even low dose - I would always feel sick throughout the day. As so, I used the sample packs to prepare my body for the IUD. I understand the purpose for most women is due to hormonal problems. This just happened to be the approach chosen by my doctor.    EXACTLY! Thanks for the reply! ^  Most (if not all) grocery stores (unless privately owned Co-Ops) receive all their produce from the same location. Hints why the UPC codes for produce do not change upon location! This makes express checkouts (self-checkouts) a great thing to use! (Also worked at Dillons in high school so I recall most of the codes....)  Meat providers possibly stay the same, that I do not know. In regards to dairy, well clearly Dillons/Kroger has a different private provider than WalMart - aside from the name-brands that appear in every store: i.e. Silk, Roberts, etc.    Care to share the recipe you used?  Sorry for the long reply! The recipe can be found here: http://imgur.com/a/6bnoI. Enjoy! :-)   That is the recipe, to some extent. In another reply, I included pages from the cookbook *Fresh Food Fast: Delicious, Seasonal Vegetarian Meals in Under an Hour*. This includes the 'menu page' showing what is needed and then each recipe follows (3 in total). Basically the recipe is more organized in the post I submitted. Sorry again for not responding to you in a timely manner.    Hold your horses! I've spent the past hour putting together a reply! (AND sorry for forgetting to recheck this last night!)   It includes a picture of the dish and the cookbook, a menu for the recipe, and each recipe follows (3 in total). (7 pictures)   **The recipe can be found here:** http://imgur.com/a/6bnoI    I have hormonal problems and she wanted to wheen me on something before going straight to the IUD.    Damn stop with the harsh criticism. I asked nothing of this. Thanks for making me see posting on this subreddit is useless. Might actually stick to receiving advice over Facebook (sadly).    No worries, just wanted it to be known that I wasn't that clueless and ill-informed!    What's with all the criticism?   Know what happened on the day I went in to get the IUD? I was sick. Felt like complete sh*t. So know what I did in spite of all of this? I forgot to remove the ring. Hints why I had informed her that I forgot to remove it.      Whoa there, being educated wasn't an issue. Before getting the IUD, I had read through a lot before deciding to get it. I know how the ring works, where it is placed, etc. It just surprises me that, even when feeling around, she still missed the ring - when I went in for the month check-up, last Friday! I recall stating to her that I had forgotten to take it out and she said she would before inserting the IUD. Clearly she forgot.   In response to how long to use it, I was (at the time) wearing the 2nd of a sample pack - and yes it was in the span of 3-weeks. Of course now it has been over a month, with the same ring. Of which I did not know was there to begin with.     Oddly enough they did an ultrasound after inserting the IUD and still missed the NuvaRing. Also, I had the ring in a few weeks before getting the IUD, but I figured she removed it before inserting the IUD. Guess I was wrong. :-/      Why'd you have to do this? You create a troll post about the BEST MUSEUM I HAVE EVER BEEN TO (sucks to live in KS...) and turn it in to this.   I might post pictures from my trip to the museum. It was quite an adventure and worth sharing! (r/pics?)   I like how they automatically assume the child won't be raised properly. Isn't it up to the child on their culture, belief, etc? Say, for instance, a Turkish child was adopted by a non-Turkish family. If they were old enough to comprehend the true ideals of the culture, shouldn't the decision be left to them?   Meh   That's not until the second paragraph. How it starts out doesn't make you care much for his sake:  THE MODEL girlfriend of Olympic hero Oscar Pistorius spent her final minutes cowering behind a bathroom door after a late-night fight with her gun-loving boyfriend.  They sure do put a lot of emphasis on model. Maybe it's just me and the fact I hate models, Hollywood and the like or maybe I see that tabloids, stories, etc aren't written in an attempt for people to understand the true impact of the situation.    Tabloids are trash - that's a known fact. Perhaps this was just a bad article and that's unfortunate.   I'm not saying it's objectifying in any manner, the fact they used that as a key word in the title makes you wonder if anyone cares about his mental state or more of the fact, who he killed. Why not just refer to her as  Reeva Steenkamp - in the same way why isn't 'athlete' in front of Oscar Pistorius? Model seems to be overused....like it's supposed to hold some significance.    I just fail to understand the fuss about it, as long as you're in the comforts of your own home. Since it asked about 'married couples', I wanted to point out the fact you don't have to be married to feel comfortable around each other. I do my best not to 'toot' around him, but it's a natural process the body experiences. And hey, we've grown to laugh at the cost of what others would find grotesque and unappealing - in order to not take everything so seriously and to just relax and understand it's a part of life.   Taking a shit on your from lawn isn't the same. That clearly includes the public and violation of law.    Hell we do that and we're not yet married! Been together almost 2 years and we understand it's a normal bodily function. Not quite sure when we were officially "ok with it', but since we've lived together, it hasn't been a problem. Actually laugh at times b/c he'll choose to fart at the most awkwardly, hilarious times!    I'm an overly opinionated, well-educated, secular humanist. Not to mention, I'm a woman, in my mid-twenties and the height (and overall size) of a teenager (13/14 years of age - statistically speaking) No matter when I live, I'm not in the majority. BUT If I had to choose, it would be during the hippie generation (1960s) with a mix of the disco generation (1970s).    Steal all their toilet paper, wait about a week, go back, and TP their house with the evidence.   I wouldn't actually do that, but it sounds rather amusing...   My mom's bichon frise will react to names - depending upon who it is. If she says my name or one of my brother's she'll get really excited and dart through the house. If we're actually home at the time, she'll go find us. Whether or not it's considered smart, it sure in the hell is adorable!   She didn't get the dog until we all moved out. At most we're only home a few times a year. The fact she still makes that association is quite remarkable.    Thanks! :-)   Can't believe I waited until last year to start watching 'Good Eats'. It's a great start for those learning to cook, by demonstrating just how easy of a process it really is!   All thanks go out to Alton Brown ('Good Eats') and Julia Child ('The French Chef') :-)   Sauce was a last minute thing. First we tried melting the fresco queso  (with heavy cream) over a double-broiler, but the consistency was still lumpy, grainy, and the sauce had little taste. We decided to add hand-grated swiss cheese and some of the 4-cheese package varieties from Sargento. Even after using a submersion blender, we couldn't get past the graininess. By then we were too hungry to care (well past 8:30 pm central time). Also sprinkled in cumin, red pepper flakes and whatever else my boyfriend happened to slip it. It added a great flavor, but we will be sure to check out a good recipe next time (instead of just winging it).   That does not surprise me. I was (at times) absolutely furious b/c it was taking so long, but I wanted to prove to myself I could do it. My boyfriend typically makes dinner, so this was a chance to both thank him (valentine's day present) and to see if I could make the recipe w/o ending with (as he likes to say) 'f*ck it empanadas!'.   **************  Cookbook-  Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico.   Corn Empanadas with Browned Red Potatoes, Onion, Poblano Peppers, and Crumbled Queso Fresco.      Choose something you've always wanted to learn/do.  I'm on the same boat and decided to learn to knit, relearn to play the piano and read (about topics that interest me). All require the willingness to learn and excel - but will be well worth the effort in the future!    To get my health under control and to focus on researching music and cognitive psychology. Until the first one gets under wraps, I'm pretty much screwed.    Basic anatomy of the eye. We clearly evolved to a suitable point, but in retrospect, it's all backwards in how the eye operates.  I have horrible eye-sight and feel this would make a tremendous difference.  Then again, that would require mutations none of us could possibly live to see.    It took 25 years until I found out I was a bit of a b*tch. No one ever mentioned it. This finally came to light when my boyfriend brought it up. Don't take that as a bad thing, it has actually reshaped my life - in a remarkably good way.    Welcome to my hipster side....know what I do? I walk. I know that sounds lame, but if you live in a city that has a lot of hills and views, you're bound to discover things you never imagined.   You would also be surprised of the artwork often spread throughout cities. While on one of my leisurely strolls last year, I made frequent stops along the way to find hidden graffiti, and other artwork, down the main street in town.  ***This though, would require a lot of walking, and that might not be your thing.      A lot of college towns do not hire college students and, instead, only hire high school aged students within the city - my story for the past 5 years.    I could do without catching the cold, flu, or any virus/disease - period. Eradicating that problem would be superb.   	107
 And a Sci fy TV show!   The first E-reader I ever saw was a SONY. If they would have had their own online store like amazon theyd be king right now,   I read the first one and I liked it a lot. Gonna spread this series out for the next couple years. Great story.   Adam Sandlers a great dramatic actor. Reign over me was great too.   Yea I see everyone posting dudes, why not party with some hot chick?    That movie was way too stylized. I like Fincher more than Stone   Paul T Anderson: Stalker movie. All his films are about obsessive men, I would like to see him try a film with an obsessive female lead.   Quentin Tarantino with some space pirates and space cowboys?  dooowwwnnnn   Two serial killers fall in love?   It's fantastic. Especially if you usually don't read. Most people don't have experience with multiple narrarators, and this book does it great    I just got HBO GO. Don't think I'll watch any new tv series until I watch all of these..   All my friends have tattoos. I'm the only one without one. How often do I have to hear " Bro when you gonna get some ink" .    never. I don't care for writing on my skin.    Visceral? Are you a video game industry journalist?   As someone who was running errands all over Miami this morning, why?    Miami fucking sucks   Is there any system in place that forces a state to change its laws? Lets say all 49 other states make motorcycles illegal, but there's one state that allows motorcycles. Would the federal government step in and force that state to change its laws? Is there some sort of majority rule?    I live in Florida and we are behind the curve on many things, sometimes this state doesn't feel like America. Why cant all states be equal.   Would anyone on reddit know which, if any, branch is starving for recruits?   I have a marijuana possession misdemeanor back in 2012 that was nolle pros. I also have a couple traffic violations. I'm in college right now and have not gotten in trouble since the 2012 incident. Would any US branch grant me the necessary waiver? I really want to serve, any branch, any position.  I am 22 and in great physical and mental shape. No weed since I was busted.        While doing all this do I just block out everyone I know? I seriously don't enjoy anyone in life right now except maybe my sister and my dad. My mom is a huge factor in me wanting to leave.    The military isnt an option because I am disqualified from enrolling because of a marijuana conviction. Right now they don't really need too many recruits so what could have easily been solved with a waiver in the past, now leads to a permanent DQ.   I'm tired of my friends, we don't really have the same interests anymore. I hate my mother. I'm bored of everything. I don't want to get a job, I don't ever want to have a boss again. I want to completely leave my life to start a new one. I have no money though. Are there any programs besides the military that allow me to leave home and have a purpose?     Good site, very little matches in my city tho. I'll check it periodically though thank you.   Thank you   Unlikely or impossible?   Three years ago I made the mistake of getting caught with marijuana. I have a misdemeanor charge on my record, I can expunge it. I dream of being an Air Force Loadmaster. By next April I will have an Associates degree. What are my chances of getting a waiver? Does the Air Force need Loadmasters right now?    Because I have a misdemeanor drug charge the US military is not an option for me, but I really want to enlist into something and serve somehow. I was looking at the PeaceCorps, and I've read that getting in is a little hard. I'm currently working on getting my degree, so Ill have that requirement met, but one thing i have little to none is Volunteer service. How do I start? Does any one here volunteer?   Do you do the same psychedelics or do you experiment with different kinds? For a while, about a year ago, I would try anything I could get my hands on, and I dont recommend that.   There's no dependency, but its very hard to say no to drugs or alcohol when I'm bored.   Anyone gone fully sober after having experienced drugs and alcohol? Was it hard? Was it worth it?   FAVORITE: Open roads at some times, very peaceful driving. Least favorite: Every thing is far, so walking is never an option.   If you already live an active lifestyle it would be beneficial to your activities to attain more strength. Being out there and being and feeling stronger is very fun.   At my old job people a brave soul made it known to everyone that they smoked weed, and then since everybody fucking smoked weed anyways, people started meeting up to get high. I already have a group of friends i do that with, so I only smoked with the  coworkers a handful of times. All those people ended up becoming like best buddies.   Working out is the best thing for the body. Unless science advances exponentially in the coming years, you're going to be stuck inside your body for the rest of your life. Might as well make it the best body possible. Join a gym or workout at home its all up to you. I started just doing body weight exercise, just to have some strength, and eventually I wanted more strength and joined a gym. Amazing decision that has left me feeling and looking great.   I am single right now and it doesnt bother me at all. I was in a relationship for 13 months after having been single for a longtime, and that relationship taught me a lot of things. Lesson one: date someone better than yourself. I dated a girl that had all the same issues in life i had and then some. We constantly were having issues because neither of us had our shit together. Just fucking kids being kids. I plan on being single until i have my shit together. ETA for having my shit together, at least 10 months.    Oh wow, thank you!   Thank you that's exactly what I was looking for. Best subreddit for that type of trading?   Not exactly day trading, but buying some and selling within a week or two, is there a name for that?   I guess its called a film producer, but I want to be the guy that reads scripts and decides what gets made, and how large of a budget the film needs.    I'm going to another city next weekend, don't want to spend money until I'm there.   I'm anti-people, not anti-person. I would be able to feel well in a crowded room only if I got one on one time with every single person there. But when its not one on one, the persons become people.   Cookies and cream of course! Just hearing the words ice and cream makes me think of cold pieces of Oreo.   Thank you so much for this reply. I really do want to get my degree.   Man of Steel had the best action sequences ever in a superhero film.    I was for three weeks, until last week when my small set of funds became  $100. I haven't been looking for work because I really want to focus on school, but my parents are making it difficult on me to just focus on school. I already set my school schedule for fall and I'm not really going to have much free time for a job. But my parents keep asking me about my job situation. Ahhh, I'm going to attempt to get a student loan in the fall for some funds. To answer your question, right now at this moment I am happy. But when I leave this moment and place myself  in my near future I get slightly depressed, I fear that I might have to drop a class or two and het a job.    Not one semester of college have I gone through where I could focus just on school.   Homestead FL. The most "southern" town in south fl. What do I like to do here? Drive north.   I was thinking about being a server, I did food industry for a year so I thought I had kind of graduated from that, but tips are just so gratifying. Hmmm   I'm in college, age 21.   I'm going to give the short version of the story: I was a cashier at a sporting goods store for two years and it was really fun, but in the last of month of my employment, work just started becoming a chore. The store manager was getting on my nerves, and a lot of the new employees were boring. The day before I quit I put in a request to get a weekend off, two months in advance, and then I get a text from a coworker that my store manager looked at the request and then in huge letters wrote denied. Her reason was that we had inventory that week. I confronted her about this because it was bullshit. Inventory was on a Tuesday or Wednesday and I was requesting the fri-sun off. She gave me a lot of bullshit and said "well see what we can do". The whole time I tried having this conversation with her she paid me about three percent attention. The next day I accidentally, or maybe subconsciously, woke up 5 minutes into my shift. I felt relief. My mind literally had no urge to go into work. I went to the gym, ate something and then drove to the job, looked for my manager and I told her I quit.   problem is I don't have any income anymore. But at least I don't have to deal with my manager anymore.   Guessing the requirements are being white and rich.   A drama about high school football in texas/the south. Down there footballs serious business. I lasted two seasons, felt too dramatic. But the first season is worth watching.   Just have a Monster hunter be the protagonist for all the films. He has a zany twisted mad scientist friend who's not good with women as his best friend, this friend allows them to travel in time finding monsters.    I just hope the opening scene is the same from the first Uncharted game.    Nothing was the same, literally   Smiles, I would shoot myself in the face with it, and everyone else I meet.   Need to watch this one again.   Oh yes, love Collateral.   Wonderful film, felt like if I was in NYC. Would like to watch more like this.   "Barrel of the Planet of the Apes"   The correct nomenclature is "apes"   I don't agree with your predictions at all. No way is the sequel to a movie that had long legs and great word of mouth going to open less than the first.   Sequel to be titled "War of the Planet of the Apes"   For a non superhero movie with a mostly CG cast?  	62
 Researchers at QMUL have successfully created electricity-generating solar-cells with chemicals found in the shells of shrimps and other crustaceans for the first time.            If your client doesn't currently have any profile and you don't know the outlets you're trying out reach. I'd suggest targeting one or two developing the story specifically for them and pitching over the phone. As other people have said journalists get hundreds of releases a day and if they don't recognise who a release is from they'll probably not even open it unless the headline suggests it's huge news. If you get picked up in one place and send a release to others it stands a much better chance of the story being repeated elsewhere.    I'm pretty sure you don't have to eat them or otherwise ingest them so we should be ok.

 The moustache at 2:56....   Pangolin. Most metal animal ever.   My all time favourite thing thing I miss from being a kid was digging through my toy box just for something to do. All the small stuff fell to the bottom and it was always exciting to see what kind of stuff I could dig out.  	3
 Malcolm in the middle,Parks and recreation, bluemountain state.Some of the best shows in my opinion on Netflix   Snapchat ?   Ya I bet it also depends on popularity and the amount of views month after month.I've seen star trek on there since I purchased Netflix. I wouldn't worry about it leaving anytime soon espically with recent events in the Star Trek community.   They could defiantly change the password as you know.I bet there is a change email option so after that you might need to show proof that its yours through bake statements and etc.They probably wouldn't help you of you just gave them the password.  	4
       I  understand that they're just trying to create a buzz for their product, but I've been in the market for a new interface and honestly wanted to see what they had to offer. Now I'll just find something else. http://www.arturia.com/audiointerface         It was all tongue-in-groove with no studs.               So they won't shit during parades.   Ed and Bob had just landed the biggest sale in their firm's history. Ed knew he had to hurry home to his pushy wife Mary, but Bob persuaded him to have a drink or two at a nearby tavern. Being a lightweight, Ed vomited all over his shirt and tie after only a few.   "Aww man, Mary is going to kill me Bob. You know she doesn't want me drinking or hanging out in bars."   Bob, feeling overly confident about their recent victory was sure he had the solution. "Don't you worry about her.  Just put this crisp twenty in your shirt pocket. When she sees the vomit tell her that someone else puked on you, and gave you the twenty to pay for the cleaning." They continued to drink until the Tavern closed and each took their own cab home.   When Ed arrived, Mary was waiting, furious at the hour, and his obvious state of drunkenness.   "Where have you been!" Ed was already unbuttoning his shirt. "You're drunk... and covered in vomit! What is wrong with you? I should have listened to my mother you worthless sack of... "  "Now hold on one minute, woman!" Ed drunkenly interrupted while Mary tore through and examined his things. "I can explain that vomit! It wasn't me! A guy down at the Tavern threw up all over my shirt. Look in my shirt pocket, there's a  twenty dollar bill. He was honorable enough to pay for the cleaning." He was already crawling into bed, and pulling the covers over himself. "You see, I'm not always the bad guy."   Mary held up two twenty dollar bills. " Ed, there was $40 in your pocket."   Ed lifted up from his pillow, squinted one eye, and tried to focus on her. "Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. He shit my pants too."    Apologies for submitting from a mobile device.   The CS2X caught my attention on eBay. I read some reviews and it sounds like an underrated instrument that can be extremely useful. Anyone play and/or have one?   I understand this wasn't a very popular virtual/sampler synthesizer. I can understand some of the gripes I've come across on forums. Support being discontinued being the biggest. But, I am impressed by some of the sounds this thing can produce. I like that it can be programmed and then disconnected from the computer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice with programming the thing. I've spent a few hours with it, and I'm amazed by the number of parameters and controls the thing has. The multi function seems really powerful. Does anyone have any experience with uploading patterns? I've noodled around with many of the presets, but still haven't found a clear path toward making my own patches from scratch. Is that possible? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.   I would like the sequencer on the Microbrute to sync up with the Venom. I have both MIDI cables amd USB. I would prefer to be able to sync them without using a DAW as I would like to jam free of the computer. I understand how to use MIDI to control one device with another, but I'm not getting anywhere with sending a clock signal between two. Can anyone help me with this?      I have a Arturia Laboratory, a Microbrute, and a Boss Dr-550mkII. Two interfaces , Berhinger Q502USB and a an old Tascam US-122L. Tascam has an in/out so I've been playing with it. I have plenty of cables. I am trying to sync these devices without using the USB connection on the Microbrute. If I use more than one USB connection for audio, the noise becomes unbearable. I want to use these devices separately without one ever controlling the other. Just sync. The Laboratory has a Midi in/out. The Microbrute and Boss have an input only. Is there any way that I can make this happen?   I am going to keep this as short as possible. Whenever I have my computer plugged into my mixer via USB, I get a loud, high pitched buzz.  It went away the other night, and came back tonight.  I tried isolating every appliance and florescent bulb in the house with no effect. I'm wondering if a failing HDD could cause this? Maybe the power supply fan? I really enjoyed combining my analog gear with my soft synth. Now the frequencies of both are affected. This noise is driving me nuts!  edit: first I tried lifting the ground on the PC, but that only helped when I used my best cable. (I have several music USB cables) I realize that the cables were in the inductive field of my stereo.  Moved the stereo box and everything went away. Sweet silence. I then reapplied the ground to protect my machines and house. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time. I feel like this has been a useful thread. I learned more than a couple of things. Thanks to everyone who commented. Y'all helped me get into critical thinking mode. I don't get enough of it. Thanks again.                Let me first say I'm open to any input as long as it is budget oriented.  I recently acquired an Arturia MicroBrute, and I naturally would like to expand the capabilities of the instrument with some simple effects (and later some complicated stereo effects). I was looking at Zoom effects first because of the value of their entry level line (and the seemingly ancient Reznor endorsement).   My question mostly involves the frequency processing of bass and guitar effects. I know there is a distinct difference between these instruments. How confined are these pedals to these frequency profiles? I am a bassist by nature (bass guitarist), but I intend on using the full range of the MicroBrute through looping and sampling. I just don't have much money.  I can shoot some sexy pics of the MicroBrute and my Laboratory 49 if necessary.                     Today I have seen DHS, FBI, state rides,  and an inordinate amount of local police. I realize it's probably just something local, but it's been all day and night.                                                                           I'm not too concerned with definitions here. Just want to learn of some new titles. Here are a few of mine in no particular order. Pink Flamingos, OldBoy, Pontypool, Synecdoche, New York, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, [half of the titles in this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_worst),                                                    Watching The Daily Show's interviews of people at the convention highlights to me, just how ignorant we are of the other party, respectively. Do you think that the situation we are in is the product of the people?                                                                                       I see plenty of cases where a user has reposted a link in a different subreddit, and gets plenty of upvotes from it. Is that OK? I was chewed out for posting an article when another article has been posted on the **same story** in either the same or a different sub. Is that OK? I've seen some redditors who post their links in several subs at the same time. Is that OK? There is a bot that reposts everything from /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/politics, into a separate subreddit, /r/POLITIC . That user will get infinite karma from that bot. Is that OK? I've read the FAQ and I still don't have a clear Idea of what is acceptable and what isn't. Is there a general consensus on this topic? Because there seems to be a lot of experts out there.   Edit: spelling and formatting   Is it not common knowledge that more than 90% of the veteran's walking around are not active duty or retired and therefore do not currently hold a military ID of any kind? I'm posting this because my university sent out an email inviting everyone to a special football game. The email explained that veteran's and active military get in free with an active ID. Only people who are active, retired, or disabled get an ID. In fact not all disabled have an ID. All of these offers just end up being a slap in the face. Have you ever tried to convince someone at a business or institution that you're really a vet? It's disgraceful!                         I feel the film deserves a solid seven. Why are these sites so down on comedy and horror? It's not like there are no watchable horror movies.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384537/  https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/silent_hill/                                                                                                  	142

Why can't it be done here in America? Some would argue its keeping us from true success.                                                                                                                                       	199
 One way is by studying a small sample population, through banding or radio tagging.  For example, you might tag 50-100 individuals in an area (depending on how hard they are to tag, how expensive the tags are, etc.) and then see how many can be re-located the next spring.   This kind of article is what I was originally looking for to write a response to this question . . . thank you for posting it.   I am learning so much about bears today!  Apparently the cubs do not hibernate, even though they are born in winter: http://bearstudy.org/website/images/stories/Publications/A_Bear_in_its_Lair.pdf  And it looks like they do have a much higher morality rate than adults during their first winter, mainly because other bears are eating them :-/   http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_7/LeCount_Vol_7.pdf      "Linked" in your headline is a good choice; since the study is based on correlation, they can't say whether anxiety is caused by sitting, more anxious people sit more, or some other relationship.  Given other studies that have shown more tv watching leads to higher risk of depression, it definitely seems like a finding to pay attention to and explore further.   I'm not very knowledgeable about that, and mostly I know about honey bees, which don't truly hibernate.  What you're suggesting seems like a sound hypothesis to me, though.   The exact mortality rate varies by species, geographical location, and time, but in every species I know of, there is some mortality risk during hibernation, due to predation, disease, starvation, etc.  As a counterpoint to bats, apparently black bears have a really low mortality rate during hibernation, ~1%.  (Seems like that would actually be lower than their mortality rate during the summer!)  ETA:  1. Wow, I did not expect so much enthusiasm for bears!  2. Although it apparently has been a topic of controversy, there does seem to be scientific consensus that bears hibernate: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hibernation#Bears https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en q=bear+AND+hibernation btnG= as_sdt=1%2C14 as_sdtp= http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3atd68/how_common_is_it_for_animals_to_die_during/csfwpvo   Animals probably don't know consciously whether another animal is an herbivore or a carnivore.  Also, they probably don't have reason to.  It might often be true that herbivores are good targets for predation, it's not universally true (eg, porcupines.)  Carnivores do probably either learn (as individuals) or evolve (as a population) to prefer animals that are easier prey, as well as those that provide them with the nutrients they need the most: "Do wild carnivores forage for prey or for nutrients?: Evidence for nutrient-specific foraging in vertebrate predators." http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25767065   It's also a lot more wrong than any physics textbook, I hope.   I had to take two tries with American Gods.  Some of the little "interludes" between the chapters weirded me out.  You might try the audiobook--I found it pretty well done, and it keeps you going/engaged through the bleak beginning until the pace starts to pick up.  It does pick up eventually, and becomes (what I found to be) an interesting mystery/thriller combination of a plot, with a lot of neat mythology mixed in.   It seems like it would be tricky to create a true placebo control for CBT.  From a little bit of searching the literature, it looks like CBT is often compared in studies with other types of therapy, and/or pharmacological treatment.  For example, in "Predictors of Treatment Efficacy in a Clinical Trial of Three Psychosocial Treatments for Adolescent Depression", CBT is compared with nondirective supportive therapy: "NST was designed  to control for the nonspecific effects of psychotherapy and  consisted of the  provision of support, affect clarification, and  active listening."  While it's possible that individuals in this study had researched CBT and other forms of therapy, could recognize which form they were receiving, and believed strongly that only CBT could help them, it's more likely that they weren't really aware which form they were receiving, and didn't have a strong belief about whether one form was most likely to help.  The comparison of one form of therapy to another, instead of only to untreated individuals, should help control for a placebo effect related to receiving therapy in general.  In general, it sounds like CBT has robust positive effects compared with many types of treatments: "The empirical status of cognitive-behavioral therapy: A review of meta-analyses" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735805001005   They're only going to be used in sting operations.      You have the right idea, although I would state this a little differently.  It's not just that the body is trying to "read" the impulses, ie, it's not getting confused because the impulses don't make sense.  It's that the electric current flowing through you is actually sending really strong signals through your nerves that automatically result in muscle fiber contraction, as well as a lot of other things.  It's similar to a radio station suddenly broadcasting a signal so loud that it damages radio speakers everywhere.  When a current goes across someone's chest, it can cause fibrillation.  The heart muscles' normal rhythm gets drowned out, and the fibers lose track of that rhythm.  They can't get back in synch with each other again.  The heart is no longer pumping properly, and this obviously can cause death if something isn't done to re-coordinate the heart muscle action.  In addition, (please someone correct me on this if I'm getting the physics wrong) the resistance encountered in the body by the electrical current will cause the body to heat up, causing burn damage to all the organs the current passes through.  Edited to add a source: http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/112/24_suppl/IV-154.full   This could be one aspect, but I'm not sure it's the most informative (although it could contribute to the amount of resources being protected in the nest, see below.)  Most stinging wasp species (unlike honey bees) do not die as a result of stinging--they don't have a barbed stinger or a venom sac that rips out along with their gut. So altruistic self-sacrifice isn't usually relevant.  In addition, in many examples of social wasps, even the subordinate individuals do have some reproductive opportunities--unlike most social bees or ants, in which many or all of the workers are sterile.  So even if a given individual wasp did have to risk her life in defense of the nest, she would be doing so in part for her own offspring.  In some social wasp species, aggression between the individual wasps is what determines the social hierarchy and thus who gets the most reproductive opportunities.  For the original question, there could be many selection pressures shaping the level of aggression of a wasp species.  For example, what kinds of predators attack the wasps, and how frequently?  What resources are they protecting?  One reason that honey bees have to mount an efficient defense of the hive is that they are protecting a hugely desirable resource--a huge collection of honey (sugar), pollen (fat and protein), and larvae (even more fat and protein, yum!) If a wasp doesn't store a huge amount of food in the nest, it may not be very tempting for other animals to attack, and evolve to be less aggressive.  What other animals typically predate on a wasp species might also shape what kind of animal they are likely to attack.  Some species might be very quick to attack a likely predator, maybe another insect, but not inclined to pick a fight with a large and usually non-threatening mammal.  I would guess that you may be right--you don't hang out in the woods often enough to see wasp nests there.  They are probably also better camouflaged in their natural environment, and maybe higher up in trees than you are looking.  Houses are probably an appealing choice for a nest site though, because eaves offer more complete shelter than branches.  For wasps that predate on other insects, lights near houses might also conveniently lure prey.   Years after I read East of Eden, I read some scientific literature on psychopathy . . . I was amazed by how closely her behavior and character matched the clinical description.  	16
 Throw in a couple house chores, and you're hired!   Nonsense: I'm Canadian. Everything about me smells like maple syrup. And I mean *everything*.   Aaaaaaaaaaand I'm going to stay away from the washroom for the rest of the year. Thanks a lot.   Three years ago, I had a near-death experience. I dont like talking about it, because I cant remember much about the accident itself. That doesn't stop people from pressing me for details, though. *What did it feel like? Did you see the driver? What kind of car was it? Did it hurt? Did you shit yourself?* (Yes, someone actually asked me that.) I understand that we humans are curious by nature, but I get tired of being asked the same questions and not being able to answer. What I do remember are the boring details: spending a tediously long shift at work dealing with unruly costumers, heading outside in the torrential rain without an umbrella, and walking home for what felt like hours. One second, I was being pelted by cloud vomit, and the next, I heard a loud shriek of tires and saw a lifetime flash by in my head. Only thing isit wasn't *my* life I saw. A strangers memories flooded into me in their entirety, and I saw everything from this persons childhood, to her first kiss, to the monotonous days spent sitting at her high school desk. I saw it all.   nbsp;  Recovery was a bitch. I woke up in a hospital bed pretty doped-up, but still in a lot of pain. The doctors told me I was involved in a hit-and-run incident, and that the police wanted to talk to me as soon as possible. I wasn't able to offer much information, since I had no recollection of the accident. It took an entire year of intense physiotherapy for me to be able to walk unassisted. My hatred for the unknown driver fuelled me every step of the way. As the anger burrowed deeper and deeper inside of me, my family began to notice a change in my demeanor. They eventually staged an*anger-vention*, if you will. Given time and several counselling sessions, I eventually forgave my attacker, so that I could move on and complete the emotional healing process.   nbsp;  During my lunch break today, I took a walk along the canal and spotted a young lady in a bright pink sport jacket, merrily jogging on the other side. I recognized her immediately: it was the woman from my visions. Her name was Sarah. I gathered that much from a memory of the bear-shaped birthday cake shed gotten when she turned seven. Her name had been scribbled on its stomach in purple lettering. I felt a mix of excitement and dread: that very same feeling you get when you think someones waving at you, but then you realize you were mistaken. Sarah was a stranger, yet I knew everything about her. I ran across the nearest pedestrian bridge, and started following her. Not in a creepy or stalkery way, mind you. I had no ill intentions. I was justcurious. I felt compelled to meet her. Up until then, I had always thought the images that had flashed through my mind were purely fictitious. Now, I had proof of the contrary.   nbsp;   As I ran towards Sarah, a knot formed my stomach. Part of me felt like a huge creep, like I had invaded her privacy by seeing all of her intimate moments, but the rest of me yearned to appease my curiosity. Had she ever seen *my* life? This girl was real, and I was looking at her, desperately trying to catch up with her rapid pace. I recalled the memory of her parents reading her bedtime stories. I remembered the time her brother had accidentally kicked her in the jaw while they were play-fighting. Shed lost her first tooth then, and she was so proud of it. I also remembered her sitting on Uncle Toms lap as they watched cartoons, and what that monster did to her when her parents were away. I slowed down, feeling a twinge of guilt. Even though I had never asked to know so much about her, it wasn't fair for me to disrupt her life like this.   nbsp;   Just as I was about to give up and leave, Sarah stopped running. Maybe fate was telling me to go for it. What if I never got this opportunity again? It could very well have been my only chance to talk to her, if only for a moment. I didn't know what I would say exactly. I wasn't even sure if I would tell her about what I knew. Nervously, I went for it.   nbsp;   "Hey, Sarah!", I called out from a short distance, trying to catch my breath as I jogged towards her. "T-this is going to sound insane, but I-", I began.   nbsp;  Upon hearing her name being called, Sarah turned around. As soon as she saw me, her face became pale. She looked at me with a mix of fear and disgust, as though I was a rodent shed just found scurrying across her bed. As I bridged the distance between us, she gasped and recoiled, looking at me in shock. I was perplexed: I had no idea what I had done to upset her. Did she think I was some sort of pervert? I remembered that look on her face. She had the same look the night her father had slapped her across the face and called her a whore when hed found her sleeping with some random guy, because she had never learned to value herself. He had kicked her to the curb that night.   nbsp;   "T-thats impossible. Y-you weren't breathing", she managed to say.   nbsp;   Suddenly, I realized something: I had seen her face before. Not just in *her* memories, but in *mine*. I had seen her for a split second before I heard the tires screeching. I felt bad for Sarah, knowing what shed been through. I wanted to tell her that I didn't hate her, and that I forgave her long agobut then, she did what she had done the first day our eyes met: she fled the scene. The only difference is that, this time, she wasn't laughing.   nbsp;  *** **Update 1 (January 21rst 2015 - 9:00 p.m.)**   nbsp;  Since I now know that Sarah is real, I looked her up on Facebook. She accepted my friend request before even realizing who I was (my profile pic is of my dog, not of me). I entered into a chat session with her.   nbsp;  **Me**: Hey Sarah. Listen, dont freak out, okay? I was the guy on the bike path today. I just want you to know that I forgive you for hitting me with your car. Im not going to press charges. I just need you to know that Im not holding on to a grudge.   nbsp;  **Sarah**: Im sorry.   nbsp;  **Me**: Theres something else.   nbsp;  **Sarah**: Wut?   nbsp;  **Me**: This is going to sound completely insanebut II saw your life.   nbsp;  A couple minutes go by.   nbsp;  **Me**: Hey, you still there?   nbsp;  **Sarah**: Ya.   nbsp;  **Me**: I know it seems impossible. Butyou know how peoples lives flash before their very eyes when theyre about to die? I got that, but with your life. You probably dont believe me.   nbsp;  **Sarah**: Got proof?   nbsp;  **Me**: Your locker combination is 87-15-57. You thought Ryans lips tasted like cinnamon. Uhmyou pretend you hate Katy Perry but you secretly love her songs.   nbsp;  **Sarah**: How do u kno that?   nbsp;  **Me**: I told you. I saw your life. All of it. I dont know howbutI was wondering if the same thing might have happened to you? Have you seen my life? Aside from that one night, have you ever seen me before?   nbsp;  **Sarah**: No.   nbsp;  **Sarah**: I gotta go. Im really sorry.   nbsp;  **Me**: I just need to know one last thing.   nbsp;  Sarah: Ya?   nbsp;  **Me**: Why were you laughing when you hit me?   nbsp;  **Sarah**: U looked liek my cheatin ex. Thought u were him. Had 2 get him later.   nbsp;  Sarah: Bye.   nbsp;  And then she logged out, and unfriended me.   nbsp;  *** **Update 2 (January 21rst 2015 - 11:33 p.m.)**   nbsp;  I can't sleep...can't stop thinking about her. I'm going to try and find her tomorrow. I'll update you guys as soon as I find her.   nbsp;  *** **Update 3 (January 22nd 2015  7:45 a.m.)**   nbsp;  Guys, I'm in trouble.   nbsp;  I tried to be the bigger man, really I did, but that searing anger inside came back. I promised myself never to feel that hatred again, but I couldnt stop it. I couldn't stop myself.   nbsp;  As I was walking to work this morning, I kept my eyes peeled for Sarah. I had a hunch Id be seeing her again. Sure enough, I spotted her bright pink jacket from a mile away. My leg was killing me, so I had trouble catching up to her this time. I finally managed to reach her when a passing bus cut her off.   nbsp;  "Sarah!", I shouted, waving to her.   nbsp;  She looked a little freaked out, and I cant blame her. I lifted my hands in the air to show her I meant no harm, which seemed to put her at ease. I explained to her that I needed closure, and that I just wanted to talk. I invited her back to my place, and, much to my surprise, she agreed to come.   nbsp;  The walk to my apartment was awkwardly silent, and more awkward still when she walked through the threshold. How do you host someone that nearly killed you---on *purpose*? I motioned for her to sit down on the table, while I prepared coffee and got some stale croissants from the pantry. I should have done the groceries last night. Once the coffee was ready, I handed her a cup, and sat down in front of her.   nbsp;  "What I really want to know ishave you ever seen MY life or not?", I asked her again.   nbsp;  She was quiet, sipping her coffee while keeping her eyes downcast. Why was she avoiding my question? She owed me the truth, so I asked again.   nbsp;  "Listen, y'know. Whatever the answer is, I wont be mad. I just want to know, thats all. It's all good if you didnt.", I reassured.   nbsp;  Sarah frowned and shuffled uncomfortably in her chair. I couldn't imagine what this meeting must have been like for her. Then, she shook her head and said no. As soon as that word escaped her lips, I feltintense anger. I hadn't felt like that in a long time.   nbsp;  "That's not possible!!", I howled, slamming my palm against the table.   nbsp;  My dog ran into the room and started barking at me, like he had never done before. He'd never shown ANY kind of aggression towards me in the past. His constant nagging growls and barks made my head spin. Before I even knew what had happened, I was on my feet and reaching for Sarah, my hands gripping around her throat. I could feel her pulse through my fingertips.   nbsp;  "DO YOU SEE IT NOW!? Do you see my life flashing before YOUR eyes now!?!?!? DO YOU SEE THE PAIN YOU CAUSED ME!?", I screamed at her.   nbsp;  In that moment, something weird occured. I felt as though this had happened to her before. The first time her life flashed before my eyes, I hadnt seen her boyfriend chocking her like this, yet I was seeing it now. I was both myself, holding her tiny twig-like neck between my fingers, and her, being chocked while her boyfriend stood over her in a fit of rage. I was having trouble breathing, just like she was. Blood started dripping on her face, and I realized it was coming from my nose. Sarah stopped moving.   nbsp;  She stopped moving.   nbsp;  *** **Update 4 (January 22nd, 2015  8:30 a.m.)**   nbsp;  I didnt know what to do, so I went to work, acting like everything was normal. I don't know what to do. It's like the floodgates are open now. Every stranger I bump intoit'sit's overwhelming. I can see all of them...My head hurts so bad   nbsp;  ***  **Update 5 (January 22nd, 2015  9:45 a.m.)**   nbsp;  She's buried in the garden. I'm sorry. Oh god, I'm sorry.   Yes! I think that was it. I remember it had "Deep" in it. Every time I tried Googling it, all I got back was Deep Impact.   The Disappearance of Ashley, Kansas. *Shivers*   Horror movies don't typically scare me or make me lose any sleep, but there were two scenes in one movie I saw when I was a kid that absolutely terrified me.  I don't remember the titlebut it was a bunch of people on a cruise ship getting attacked by giant slugs. At some point, a dude gets acid slime on him and looks in shock at his hand that has this huuuge gaping hole through which you could see his bones, then the camera shifts to his faceand you see half of it has been melted off.  Worst than that, though was the bathroom scene. Oh, man. This poor woman needed to go, and when she sat down one of the slugs sucked her in through the toilet. I avoided the bathroom at night for YEARS after watching that.   That artworkwow. It gets my stamp of approval.   That's beautiful. I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm glad you got to spend time with your father. I'll be sending good thoughts you way.   You don't need to join me. *I'm already there with you.*   Waityou meanHuman Gravy ISN'T your real name?!   I name all my pens, and stick googly-eyes on them. There's Robert, Jacob, Felix, Captain Mc.Flufferpants, and Sammy.   My characters tend to spastically slap themselves in the face repeatedly whenever they meet someone new, which is exactly what I do IRL.   I am not a social man, and I have had few friends in my life. Sal, the bartender at my favorite pub, was one the select few in my inner-circle. I know what youre thinking: hes a bartender, he HAS to be friendly to get a good tip. Youre wrong, it goes beyond that. Id known Sal for over 25 years, and sat across from him at the bar almost every day since we met. When I got married, Sal was my best man. When my wife threw me out, its at Sals home that I stayed. When she took full custody of my daughter, it was Sal who consoled me. He was a good friend, always willing to listen to me and give me advice, like any bartender would. Unlike the other tenders; however, Sal actually cared.   nbsp;  Now, Sal was a very private man with a rather quiet demeanor. That said, on the few occasions where he chose to let loose, he talked a LOT. Sal had a way of capturing the attention of everyone in the room. This might sound a bit clichd, but hed regale us with stories of his youth. He told us about his cross-country trips, his overseas adventures, his mishaps, and his entertaining anecdotes. When he spoke, his audience sat on the edges of their seats, hanging on his every word as he gave them the juicy details of his endless tales. He was old now, and couldn't travel quite as often. He didn't seem to mind: he always had a smile on his face and a cheerful attitude that brightened the mood of everyone he came across.   nbsp;  One evening, as I was enjoying a drink, I noticed a man in a booth staring at Sal from across the room. At my angle, I could barely make out his short and spiky raven hair. I pointed him out to Sal, and he told me hed been coming in every night that week, never ordering anything. Sal, being the big softie that he was, couldn't bring himself to kick the guy out. Considering I went to the pub every night, I was surprised I hadn't seen the stranger until that evening. I was probably too drunk to notice.   nbsp;  Later that night, after drinking one too many drinks---as I tended to do all too often, according to my ex-wife--- I passed out across a row of chairs. Sal trusted me enough to leave me there, even after closing time. I woke up long before dawn, and made my way through the dimly-lit bar to the backdoor, which could only be opened from the inside. This wasn't my first time taking a snooze alone in the bar, so I knew my way around well enough not to run into any of the tables on my way out.   nbsp;  As I opened the door to the back alley, I heard what sounded like applause, but it turned out to be the sound of three dozen crows taking flight. They hovered above the cold alleyway for a few moments, and then landed on and around the leaky dumpster in the front. I jumped when I saw the damned birds. I'm not afraid of crows, mind you. I even feed the ones at work during lunch. They startled me, is all. A hunters moon peeked through the clouds and illuminated the scene: there was someone standing on the other side of the dumpster, in the forest of crows. It was the man I had seen earlier that night. He had his back turned to me, wearing a black trench coat and boots laced with multiple buckles. There was a large crow perched on his shoulder. Something was odd about his back: a bulky mass moved under his coat, causing it to shift around like curtains in the breeze.   nbsp;  The dumpster smelled particularly putrid tonight, I thought. I glanced at the stranger, who stood between me and the street. I moved towards him and saw that his crow was chewing on something. At first, I thought it was a gummi worm, but as I approached, I realized it was much darker and oozed crimson blood onto the cold, wet pavement. Then, I saw Sal. He lay on the ground, his body ripped open, serving as a buffet for the hungry crows to feast on. They pecked at his innards, taking turns chewing on his softer organs. I could hear the crunching sounds as they broke apart his bones with their abnormally strong beaks. Bringing a hand to my mouth, I emitted an audible gasp. The sound caught the strangers attention, and he slowly turned to face me. His golden, serpentine eyes reminded me of headlights. Something in his left hand gleamed in the moonlight: it was a short silver dagger, the edge covered in liquid that belonged in my friend's veins.   nbsp;  I should have been terrifiedangrysadbutI felt strangely calm. My eyes were transfixed on the surreal scene and the man at the center of it all. Though he held a weapon, and though he had used that weapon to murder my friend, I did not feel as though I was in any danger. The man gave me the quiet smile of a Grecian statue, projecting calmness despite the feeding frenzy at his feet. His footsteps echoed down the narrow alley as he made his way towards me. My heart thumped hard in my chest. Paralysed with fear or disbelief, I watched him outstretch a hand to my face, with a gentle elegance seldom attributed to the male gender. The crow on his shoulder tilted its head as its master scraped his long black nails against my cheek. I felt a faint stinging sensation, no worse than that of a paper cut. The man gave me an amused hum as he brought his fingers to his mouth and tasted a few drops of my blood.   nbsp;  I'm not sure how long it took me to snap out of the shock, but when I finally did, I looked towards Sals final resting place, and saw that there was nothing left of my old friend, not even a drop of blood. The stranger turned his back to me, and a sudden flood of adrenaline compelled me to grab a wooden plank from the floor. I threw myself towards the man, but stopped all of a sudden, when his trench coat slid off. Two massive black wings clutched to his back like climbing vines. Black veins lead to and from the appendages, which flared out with a sound similar to that of an unfurling sail. The man gave me one final look, and spoke to me in a deep, booming voice. "Youll thank me one day.", he said. With that, the crows took flight, and the man disappeared. I was left alone in the alleyway as the sun rose: no evidence of the man, his crows, or my dead friend.   nbsp;  I tried going to the cops, but what could I tell them? I sat in front of the police station, going over the facts in my mind. Theyd never believe that some sort ofcrow-demon and his army of minions ate Sal. I ultimately chose inaction, hoping Id merely suffered a booze-induced nightmare. It was no nightmare: Sal was reported missing by the pubs owner a few days later. An investigation began, and what the police uncovered shocked even me, who had seen a guy get eaten by a flock of crows. They found evidence linking Sal to no less than 15 cases of missing children. He had kept trophies of their remains hidden in a safe under his bed. Then it hit me: the reason for Sals frequent trips in his youth. Hed been doing the wretched deed far from home so he wouldn't get caught.   nbsp;  This may sound weird, but I am still grateful for Sals friendship. As I explained earlier, I'm not a very social man. When you get to be over 20, it becomes a lot harder to meet people outside of work, and the friends you do have tend to drift away. Sal helped me through tough times, and Ill always be thankful for his friendship. I still mourn himnotthe bad parts. I mourn the loss of the man I thought he was. It may seem strange to youbut thats how I feel. These days, I've stopped drinking. I havent set foot in that pub since the day Sal died. My ex and I even got back together. I get to see my kid every day, and that is the greatest gift of all. I guess in a way, losing Sal was one of the best things that ever happened to me.   nbsp;  On my way home from work yesterday, I saw a crow with familiar snake eyes gleaming like headlights. He gave me a knowing nod, and I knew we understood one another. Among the horrific things found in Sals home, they had retrieved a fully-packed duffel bag, a single one-way ticket to Mexico for the day after he was killed, and hundreds of photos of my wife and daughter. The crow man saved them. And that, my friends, is why I smiled to that crow and uttered two simple words: "Thank you."   Holy cow, man. I hope you'll find a way to cope with the loss.   *Hands the Datha-nathor a feather boa, a top hat, and a flute.*   I couldn't take the calls any more. I just couldn't take *knowing*. There was nothing I could do to stop them from coming through; I had to put an end to it.   nbsp;  It all started this summer, when I was playing with my oldest daughter, Chrissie. My kid absolutely loved toy cars, so I had given her my Matchbox collection, which Id kept in the attic since my childhood. She was driving some farm animal around on the hood of my most prized possession: a classic fire truck with all its original parts and an unblemished paint job, when she suddenly stopped our caravan halfway to Mount Marshmallow Snowflakes, also known as the white leather sofa in the corner.   nbsp;  "Daddy.", she said, her voice sweet and innocent.   nbsp;  "Yes, honey?", I replied.   nbsp;  "Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she told me.   nbsp;  Having not heard my phone ringing, I wasn't sure what she meant by that. She had probably seen the screen on my Smartphone lighting up from an incoming call. I had a tendency to forget to un-mute the thing after meetings at the office. I guessed that Chrissie didn't want our playtime to end, so I assured her daddy wasn't going anywhere, and left the phone alone. She smiled, and we continued our game. Later, I checked my call history, but discovered that there hadn't been any incoming calls. I didn't really give it much thought, to be honest.   nbsp;  A few weeks later, the same thing happened while we were playing doctor and giving Mr. Fuzzy Wuzzy his annual check-up. Chrissie looked up towards the kitchen and dropped her stuffed bear.   nbsp;  "Daddy, dont answer the phone.", whispered Chrissie, in a frightened tone.   nbsp;  This time, I chose not to heed her warning. I got up to check my Smartphone right away: no incoming calls. Following Chrissies gaze, I realized that she was actually looking at the old telephone on the kitchen wall. We had disconnected the landline and unplugged it years ago. My wife had been asking me to take it down since the day Id cancelled our residential phone services. We had both gotten cellphones and wanted to put the money towards something more useful. The bulky white device was screwed into the wall. I kept forgetting to dismount it whenever I had my tools out, and I was too lazy to get them from the garage for such a menial task. I'm shocked my wife didn't wind up removing it herself, since it bothered her so much.   nbsp;  "Honey, thats not a real phone. No ones calling.", I told Chrissie, ruffling her hair.   nbsp;  It took Chrissie a few moments, but she eventually went back to playing as though nothing had happened. It was probably some kind of new game she had learned in school or something. She was seven, and had a bunch of imaginary friends. Maybe shed gotten into an argument with Princess Pufflecakes, and she didn't want to take her call. I didn't worry about it too much.   nbsp;  It wasnt until the third imaginary call that I started to get concerned. Chrissie and I were having a Ninja Turtles Tea Party. I was dressed in a pink tutu with Michelangelos bandana and a crown on my head ---*never* underestimate what a father would do to put a smile on his kids face--- and got up to get more juice. Chrissie grabbed me by my frilly skirt, looking absolutely terrified.   nbsp;  "Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she pleaded.   nbsp;  There was something in her eyes that compelled me to put an end to her weird game. She really looked freaked out: I no longer thought she was playing some kind of reverse-psychology Simon Says. If she was making it up, why did she look genuinely worried?   nbsp;  "It might be important, squirt. Dont worry. Daddy will tell those evil telemarketers to leave you alone.", I playfully replied as I snuck out of her grasp.   nbsp;  I made my way to the kitchen, where I picked up the receiver, and turned towards my daughter to give her a reassuring thumbs-up. Bringing the receiver to my ear, I fully expected to hear silence. Silence, however, was not what I heard. There was static on the line, which surprised me enough that I pulled the phone away for a moment to look at it in disbelief. When I brought it back to my ear, I heard a voice on the other end.   nbsp;  "232 Jeanne DArc Road, fire, 12.", whispered a man tonelessly.   nbsp;  "What the fu---fudgesicles?", I answered, perplexed.   nbsp;  My wife must have been playing a trick on me. She had probably convinced Chrissie to help her out so Id do my job and get rid of the phone. I immediately yanked the cord, and it came flying towards me, hitting me square in the face. I was stunned: it was far too loose to have been in the jack. When I asked my wife about it, she had no idea what I was talking about.   nbsp;  The next morning, I absent-mindedly checked my emails while the news played in the background. There was a segment about a fire in an apartment complex. At first, I didn't pay it much attention, but then I heard the address: 232 Jeanne DArc Road. Twelve residents had perished in the inferno. I nearly dropped my #1 DAD coffee mug on the floor. I didnt know what to do. It was too late to call the police and tell them Id gotten a creepy warning call about the fire. Theyd think I was a nutter, or an attention-seeker. I took a moment to calm down and rationalize what had happened. It was just a very weird and very scary coincidence.   nbsp;   Days later, I was playing Sudoku on the couch when Chrissie walked over, wearing a worried expression on her face.   nbsp;  "Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she whimpered, tears in her eyes.   nbsp;  Something in the pit of my stomach told me not to go, but I had to know. I made my way to the kitchen and picked up the receiver. This time, a British-sounding woman spoke to me through the disconnected phone.   nbsp;  "15 Vanier Street, fire, 3.", she announced.   nbsp;  Logically, youd think Id go to the police or fire station to tell them what was going to happenbut heres the thingI've watched the shows, so I know how these things pan out. You've got an attractive male protagonist who gets a forewarning, which is accurate: I won the most handsome daddy of the year award, as decided on by my very unbiased daughters on fathers day last year (I even have a trophy to prove it). The protagonist then tells the cops about his predictions. Naturally, the cops accuse *him* of being the perpetrator. They lock him up, but he gets out on some technicality, then rushes to the scene of the would-be crime and saves the day. He becomes a true hero in the eyes of everyone. Close curtains. Yeah, I'm not *that* guy. I'm not saying I'm a cowardbut, lookI've got two daughters to care for. I cant go putting myself in dangerous situations where I could realistically wind up dead. Instead, I bought a disposable phone and used it to call the police.   nbsp;  In the past ten years, there have been a lot of suspicious fires in our city, leading police to suspect theres a pyromaniac on the loose. Thus far, he or she has burned down: a church, a postal office, an outdoor mall, and a smaller post office inside a mall. I'm going to let you take a wild guess as to what the police officer had to say when I warned him about the potential fire at 15 Vanier Street. If you guessed, "He accused you of being the pyromaniac and asked that you turn yourself in.", then you deserve a cookie, because thats exactly what happened. I hung up and tossed the phone in a trashcan across town. The next day, I watched as a news crew covered the story. The authorities had sent police officers to investigate what turned out to be an abandoned building. Three officers had gotten locked in the basement. A fire broke out, and none of them made it out. I felt guilty and powerless. If I hadn't warned them, the cops wouldn't have been in there, and no one would have died. It was my fault. I couldn't sleep a wink that night, the horrid feeling in my gut eating away at me.   nbsp;  The process repeated over the course of the next few months. Chrissie would ask me not to answer the phone, Id pick it up, and Id hear a different voice speaking. Id be given an address, method of death, and amount of people killed. 89 Oosgrove Avenue, knife, 1. Mrs. Larkin had been stabbed to death during a home invasion. 60 Star Circle, gas leak, 10. The Campbells were enjoying a family reunion, and failed to notice the smell of rotten eggs. 79 Jean-Jacques Lussier, gun, 3. Maria, Jamie, and Alison were shot dead while walking home in the early hours of the morning, and so on and so forth, until I just couldn't take it any more. I remember all their names and faces: I saw them on the news reports. I think about them when I go to bed, knowing that there was nothing I could do to save them, but tormented by the fact that I didn't even try. Depression started to creep over me, and I could barely eat or sleep. My wife started to get worried, but I couldn't tell her: I was afraid shed be disappointed in me for my inaction, so I lied. I told her I was stressed out because of work.   nbsp;   A few weeks ago, I had finally had enough. Unable to keep myself from answering these phantom calls, I decided there was no other option. I stormed into my garage, grabbed my tools, and desperately unscrewed the phone from the wall. As I held the device, I felt a wave of anger rush over me. This thingthis damned telephoneit had caused me so much grief. I took it to the driveway, and furiously smashed it into the concrete with a hammer until there was nothing left but dust and debris. When it was over, I cleaned the mess. The sensation of freedom was euphoric. My whole body tingled as my heavy burden lifted from my shoulders. That night, I made our favourite family meal and dessert to celebrate. My wife was relieved that I had gotten over what ever it was that had been bothering me, and overjoyed that the eyesore in the kitchen had finally been removed.   nbsp;  I have a piece of advice for you. If you have a disconnected landline and havent gotten around to removing it, please take a lesson from me: get rid of it immediately and, above all else, do NOT pick up the receiver.   nbsp;  My life has returned to normal since I got rid of the wretched phone. As I am typing this, my wife is giving our youngest daughter a bath. I can hear them singing the bubble bath song and giggling. Chrissie is in the living room with me. Shes playing with this silly pink Disney phone. Its one of those fancy schmancy glittery toys: a pimped out version of the Fisher Price rotary phone I used to have when I was a kid. Every dial projects a message from one of the Disney Princesses. Its weird, shes never shown any interest in it before. Its not a real phone: it doesn't even have a cordbuttheres that look in her eyes again. Shes worriedI know what she wants to say. No: its just a toy. Its just a toy. Its just a toy, butIm going to check. I need to know      Shit. Shit. Shit. I can hear static on the other end.      I-its a mans voice...Hes sayingits my addressp-propane explosion4      I need to get my girls out of here. Pleaseplease dont let it be too late   The tip of one of my fingers is slightly crooked (thanks a lot, dad's genes). So, naturally, people IRL call me a heathen and a monster, and it's only normal for me to go out and try to eat them at night. I would therefore not mind it if my kind are portrayed that way.  In all seriousness, though. If the reader can't tell the difference between the opinions of your CHARACTERS versus YOUR opinions, then there's something wrong with THEM.   Good job, Ben!   It hasn't happened to me, but if it ever didit wouldn't bother me if the artist didn't ask permission. I would just hope that a. They link back to my story, and b. They tell me about it so I can gawk at the artwork and scream with joy. Unless said fan art was made using the real blood of the artist's victim. Then, I'd be screaming for a whole different reason.   Welp, I'm going to go curl up in the fetal position and cry myself to sleep now.   I love this story so much, I've actually listened to both the NoSleep Podcast version and the Chilling Tales for Dark Nights version.  ...when you say "brought it to life", you mean the story...or the scarecrow corpse? DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN.   coitus cab. xD;   Happy day of womb-expulsion! My two all-time favorites are:  [The Scarecrow Corpse] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wi9mx/the_scarecrow_corpse/)   and     [Grow Up](http://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/t94dh/grow_up/)  It's from Library of Shadows instead of NoSleep, but it is so awesome. Words cannot describe the love I have for this one.   That's some pretty solid advice, o wise one. I think I, myself, will follow it, too. I tend to feel like an evil creative genius when I start to write. By the time I get to revisions, my confidence has gone down a few pegs but I typically still like the story. When I post it; however, I suddenly hate everything I write and feel like a complete fraud. And then I panic.  You're absolutely right: we write because we love to write. Sure, some stories are going to be hits and some will be misses, but that's life and those hours spent working on writing the stories were good, enjoyable hours.   Yeah. In hindsight, that tattoo of the green power ranger I got on my cheek was such a bad decision. I *knew* I should have gone with the blue one.   Of course. Was I not supposed to? I also promised him yours. Figured you wouldn't mind. You're all about the knees anyways, yeh?   My cat Dash got his name for typing a dash symbol on my keyboard a half dozen times.  ...  Also: that screen name! Holy cow. Creepy!   Killed by my goateed demon-clone, Colonet Lyset in the middle of a sword fight on top of an exploding volcano over the mysterious 'crown jewels', which just happen to be Henry the 8th's raisin-ified testes. :/   : D   That's an awesome idea. I would definitely buy it.   I can never get enough of horror podcasts. I will definitely be tuning in from now on.  I very shyly wonder if you'd be interested in [Do You Think It's Still Alive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lpxo6/do_you_think_its_still_alive/)?   I wake face-first on the living room floor, my eyes greeting an unusual sight: an empty bottle of booze and a splatter of blood. It's morning, and I can smell alcohol on my breath. I jolt to my unsteady feet and wipe my drool-coated face on my sleeve. Hung-over, I check myself quickly for any obvious physical injuries that would explain the blood, but everything looks fine. I stagger to the bathroom and reach for a tissue, clearing my congested nose. No blood: the splatter wasnt from a nosebleed, thats for sure. Where did it come from? As I inhale, I notice a pleasant citrusy scent in the air. Does the house usually smell like lime?   nbsp;  My head is throbbing with pain. Feels like a thousand sweaty construction men are jackhammering my skull. It hurts so bad that I use the wall for support as I head towards the kitchen. I know the key to nursing a hangover is to drink plenty of water. I reach for the fridge, but stop when I think to check my phone. Avoiding the blood splatter near the sofa, I extend a hand towards my cell, fully expecting a message from one of my drinking buddies calling me a motherfucker for getting into a brawl with him last night. Im sure thats how the splatter got there. Jimmy or Ramirez and I probably got into an argument about the fucking hockey game again, and I must have socked one of them in the face in my drunken stupor. To my surprise, I dont have any missed calls or text messages complaining about it. Huh.   nbsp;  I take on the painstaking task of going to the kitchen again. My parched throat is begging for some hydration, but I hear a knock on the door before I can even reach my destination. I approach the window and peer outside. OH SHIT! OH SHIT! OH SHIT! Its the cops. Holy fucking shit. Was it Ramirez!? Is that Habs-loving asshole pressing charges!? I look at the blood splatter, and then and at the squad car. Shit. This doesnt look good at all. My pulse, as they say on ER shows, feels thready, like I ate one too many cheeseburgers. I cant think. Theres so much noise in my head. Feels like my brains about to implode. How could he call the cops over a stupid drunken argument? Sleezeball. Ever since he graduated from law school, hes been such a stickler for the rules.   nbsp;  The doorbell rings.   nbsp;  Theres no time to clean up the mess. Im just going to have to deal with it. If they book me, they book me. I open the door.   nbsp;  "Good morning, sir.", says the officer in a chipper tone.   nbsp;  Who the fuck gave this guy the right to be so cheerful at this ungodly hour? Its barely 8:30, for crying out loud! I keep telling myself to be polite. I force a smile and step aside to let him enter when he asks to come in. At first, neither he nor his partner seem to notice the blood.   nbsp;  "Were looking for a boy. About 12 years old.", he tells me.   nbsp;  That cant be right. II would never hurt a kid. Panic starts to set in, and I frantically step towards the living room, hoping the cops are going to leave. The partner seems to notice my movement, and nods towards the living room. Both cops look at the blood. I start babbling incoherently about being innocent, begging them to believe that I would never kidnap or hurt a child. I loosely explain that I smacked a friend in the face the night before and that its his blood. Its not a complete lie, since even I dont know the truth. The expressions on their faces shift from serious, to confused, and back to serious.   nbsp;  "Sir, Im afraid you misunderstoodwere not accusing you of kidnapping. The boy is a suspect. Were just questioning the neighbors to see if anyone witnessed something last night.", he reassured.   nbsp;  "A suspect? What, did he TP someones yard?", I ask curiously, while a sense of relief washes over me.   nbsp;  The cops explain that the boy flew off the handle and decapitated his parents. Daaaamn, remind me never to take a kids cellphone away from him. With morbid fascination, I ask about their heads, as I walk towards the kitchen for that bottle of water Id been planning to drink all morning. The officers give my living room a quick glance, and then follow slowly behind.   nbsp;  "We found the dads head in their garage freezer. The momswellno luck yet.", one of them tells me.   nbsp;  I open the fridge door and I throw up at my feet almost immediately. All things considered, my body feels a lot better now that Ive vomited, though I cant say the same for my psychological well-being.   nbsp;   "I found the mom.", I say.   nbsp;  Her lifeless head is on the top shelf, on a nest of blood-soaked rags, sitting between a carton of expired OJ and my cleaning products. There's a post-it note on her forehead that says:   nbsp;  "U were waking up. Couldn't finish cleaning. Lol. BBL"   nbsp;  I hope my insurance covers therapy, because when the shock wears off, I think I'm going to need it.   Just a friendly head's up: the hyperlink to "There's something inhumane south of Seattle if you want to go looking for it" incorrectly brings you to "The Girl in the Log" instead.   gWhen I was around seven years old, I had a hamster called Creamie. Did you pick up on the very subtle hint in her name? Yes, the noisy rodent was cream-colored. Every night, my mom brought her cage down to the basement to keep her midnight antics (Creamie's, not my mom's) from waking us. Creamie had been my companion for the better part of three months before she croaked, like hamsters are wont to do. Most parents are careful about how they announce the death of a beloved pet: they explain that it has gone to heaven, lie about it running away to join the circus, say it moved on to greener pastures, buy a replacement and hope their child doesn't notice the patch of black fur on its face that wasn't there before, etc. Not my mother, no. Mom liked to do things a little differently.   nbsp;  "Honey, I need to talk to you.", mom said, as I ate my sugar-coated cereal.   nbsp;  "Mmhmm?", I replied, unwilling to draw my eyes away from the cartoon playing on TV.   nbsp;  "Its about Mrs. Cream.", she continued, getting Creamie's name wrong for the millionth time.   nbsp;  Mom reached for the remote control and turned off the TV to get my full attention. It always annoyed me how she interrupted my shows with no regards for my feelings. I had learned from experience not to do the same to her when I wanted attention. Id once turned off Quantum Leap during the season finale, and she flipped out. As punishment, she took away my Polly Pocket toys for a week.   nbsp;  "Yeah?", I asked, trying not to sound annoyed, so I wouldn't get scolded for giving her attitude.   nbsp;  "Im sorry dear, but Mrs. Cream got eaten by the monster in the furnace.", she announced, without hesitation.   nbsp;  Mom knew exactly how frightened I was of the large metallic furnace in the basement. Every time it shifted on, it released an intimidating and demonic gurgle. To make matters worse, it continually emitted a sinister red light, like some kind of a Disney movie villain. I swear, even now that I'm older, Im afraid of going anywhere near it. If I wasn't sufficiently scared of the furnace before she told me about the monster, I sure as heck wanted to steer clear of it afterwards.   nbsp;  Reading the fear on my little face, my mother smiled and continued:   nbsp;  "Oh, didnt I tell you about the monster in the furnace? Its a dreadful beast. When it gets loose, it grabs sleeping little girls that dont cover their feet and drags them under the bed, where it eats them in a single mouthful. We moms have to keep our kids safe by feeding it your pets from time to time instead.", she explained.   nbsp;  Needless to say, I was unable to take another bite of cereal, and dropped my spoon into the bowl. While I gazed at my mom wide-eyed, I could feel myself trembling with fear. She was an adult; there was no reason for her to lie to me. I knew I was going to have nightmares. Through a flurry of terrified thoughts, I wondered what would happen now that I no longer had a pet to sacrifice to the creature. Would it come after me tonight? I rarely tucked my feet under my blanket: I liked to let them dangle off the edge of my bed. Was I going to have to use a sleeping bag to stay safe? A question popped out of my mouth before I even had a chance to process the thought:   nbsp;  "W-what ddoes it look like?", I asked my mom, not really wanting to hear the answer.   nbsp;  She smirked wickedly, and abandoned me to retrieve a box of animal index cards shed bought to help me learn French. I was left alone with my imagination, which filled in the gaps and made the monster even more terrifying. I kept looking at the floor, expecting to see the unknown creature scurrying about the black-and-white linoleum kitchen tiles. Mom returned, and began flipping through the index cards until she found the ones she was looking for. She turned two of them towards me: a scorpion, and an anglerfish.   nbsp;  "It looks like a combination of these.", she told me. "Its about the size of a cat. Its body is similar to this scorpion here, but longer and with more feet, and it has a head like this, but with three rows of fangsand eight eyes."   nbsp;  The creature sounded more and more horrific by the minute. I could picture it skittering about the basement and trying to grab me while I played alone down there. Blood drained from my face and hands. I felt like crying, but somehow the fear kept my body paralyzed, and tears did not flow.   nbsp;  "Whawhat are we going toto do? I-I dontI dont wanna be eaten", I stuttered, on the brink of despair.   nbsp;  My mother gave me a small, reassuring smile.   nbsp;  "Dont worry, honey, Ill go buy a guinea pig later today in case it gets hungry again.", she answered, sounding quite satisfied with herself.   nbsp;  And that, my friends, is how my mother kept me from feeling sad about the death of my hamster, and the many pets that came after it. Though there is one thing that always bothered me: I still dont know how she managed to get rid of all their bodies so fast.   Saw your post in the OOC. Sounds like you're talking about Gurgles   Bugman:  http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/othwh/gurgles_bugman/   I'd say maybe 5 solid deaths and about 5-6 mushier ones. I meaninsinuated deaths.   A poor, innocent cat!? You *monster*.   I get up at 6:00 a.m. Eastern time and start working between 7:00-7:15 a.m. by choice. I prefer working earlier (while no one is around) and getting to leave earlier than facing traffic.  I was kind of wondering if everyone up in the morning here were from other time zones.   Thank you bot! : }   *Steps away from Kneeod slowly*   Well, someone came in on a load of turnips, huh?  I'm no psycho-analyst, but one would argue that if horror scares you, it's because you're able to identify with the protagonist and, y'know, EMPATHIZE with him/her. (Jump scares aside, that is.)  Thanks for the link. I had a good laugh.   Maybe she meant the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie, which was horrifically bad.   Note to self: bring padding.   I think I will! I'll learn as I go.  Quick question: does anyone bite?   Sadly, I have no idea what this is. When ya'll posted about it a few weeks ago, I tried to find the original post explaining it, but failed. Then food distracted me.   "Pay no attention to the corpse in the back.", said the professor, as we entered his classroom.   nbsp;  Thats how my second term Biology class started. I was in University, fresh off my winter break and mourning end of a good holiday season. I had stayed on campus and spent my time getting drunk with my buddies. The fun was over, and it was time to get back to studying. I had looked up my bio teacher, Mr. Blackburn, on Rate My Professor the night before, yknow, to know what to expect. His reviews were underwhelming: the guy was apparently a total bore. Students said he was monotone, never joked, and never cracked a smile. Thats why I was surprised at the state of the corpse in the back of the room. Mr. Blackburn didn't strike me as a funny man, but I guessed he must have had a bit of a devious streak in him.   nbsp;  The body had been placed behind a row of discarded tables and broken chairs. It sat on a sturdy wooden crate, wearing a civil-era uniform. There was a sombrero on its head and a pine air freshener dangled around its neck like a lame gangsta medallion. Again, I didn't peg Mr. Blackburn to be the kind to joke around. Maybe the old coot had grown a sense of humor, or maybe hed lost his marbles overnight. Either way, this being Biology class and all, I figured the body was there for a reason other than giving us a good laugh. I squinted and examined the corpse. It looked old. I dont mean it was decomposing, mind you. Heck, it was so well-preserved that it didn't even emit an odor. I mean the person it used to be was an old man. Its skin was shrivelled up and mummified-looking. Its arthritis-ridden arms stretched out at sinister angles that reminded me of tree branches in the dark. I looked at its face and saw its mouth and eyes were wide open, giving it an appearance of shock and terror. Man, must have been a rough death.   nbsp;  Mr. Blackburn started the lecture. He certainly lived up to his reputationand by that, I mean, I fell asleep after ten minutes of hearing him drone on and on. In fact, I cant recall a single lecture that didn't end with me dozing off.   nbsp;  After class, the other students and I exchanged theories about the corpse and why it was there. Over the next few weeks, we started to notice that someone, presumably Mr. Blackburn himself, changed the body slightly between classes. Trying to figure out what the prof had done to it became our new pastime. Sometimes, its arm had been repositioned, other times, it was several feet away from its starting position. Even its eyes could, at times, be spotted looking in a different direction. The corpse became our creepily awesome mascot. Whenever Mr. Blackburn caught us looking at it; however, he would clear his throat to draw our attention to the front, and repeat what he had told us on the first day:   nbsp;  "Pay no attention to the corpse in the back.", hed say slowly, his voice colder and harsher.   nbsp;  It was weird, because he had this gleam in his eyes whenever he told us not to look at it. I swear, it was like he was taking pleasure out of knowing we were peeking. He had the exact same look a toddler has when he drops his trousers in front of a group and lets loose on the carpet, knowing hes doing something wrong but relishing the moment anyways. There was something off about Mr. Blackburn.   nbsp;   One snowy afternoon, Cynthia, a really hot chick that sat across from me, dropped her pen. It rolled to the back of the class and stopped right between the corpses feet. She sighed loudly, looking more annoyed about having to get up than frightened to approach the body. Now, Id been pining over Cynthia since the start of the semester, so it was only natural that I turned my head to check out her fine behind as she bent down to pick up her pen. She suddenly shrieked like a harpy, and I knew exactly why.   nbsp;  "HES STILL ALIVE!!", she yelled, confirming my suspicions.   nbsp;  The class erupted in laugher, assuming she was playing some sort of trick. I knew better: I had seen it move, too. Its foot had twitched ever so slightly when she reached for the pen. I even saw its contorted fingers barely outstretch, as if trying to grab her but not having enough strength to do so. I overheard someone making a joke about the stiff trying to check out her rack. I was too freaked out to respond. Cynthia threw the pen at the body and ran out of the classroom, frantically dusting herself as though there were bugs all over her. The class erupted in indiscernible chatter. Upon hearing all the commotion, the teacher stopped his lecture. He calmly turned his attention to the corpse, and then to the rest of us.   nbsp;  "Class dismissed.", he said, in a calm and unaffected tone.   nbsp;  Mr. Blackburn straightened his papers, collected his things, and calmly exited the classroom without another word. His nonchalance seemed to put the room at ease. Had the other students seen what Cynthia and I had seen, I'm not sure they would have left the room cheering about their good fortune. I overheard someone say the teacher had probably rigged the body with electrodes or something to cause it to jerk. I wanted to check, because I wanted it to be true. Still, as the mass of students barrelled towards the door, I felt compelled to follow and leave with them, like a mindless lemming. In hindsight, I regret not examining the body before I left.   nbsp;  The next day, the corpse was gone, and it wasn't the only thing missing: Mr. Blackburn didn't show up for class. The old man never returned to school. No letter of resignation, nothing. The police was eventually called to investigate, but found no traces of him. After an internal investigation, the school discovered that massive amounts of powerful anaesthetic and embalming fluids were missing from the storage room.   nbsp;  As I passed through the hallway near the Deans office a few days later, I saw a plaque with the pictures of all the schools faculty members. Whoever it was that had been teaching our Biology class for weeks wasn't Mr. Blackburn. No, wrinkly old Mr. Blackburn looked a lot more like what we thought was just a corpse in the back.   Well, I'm never listening to the radio again without headphones.   Human souls? I have a few of those around.   In accordance with the prophecy, I am glad this suggestion pleases you.   I never noticed it in my own writing until someone pointed it out. It was then that I began making a conscious effort to eliminate the problem.   You could always do something I read somewhere a long time ago: preface every single sentence with "In accordance with the prophecy.", both in your writing and in real life.   "Hey, Suspense304, what's for dinner?"   "In accordance with the prophecy, baked beans and the tears of lambs."   My heart is a flutter with dreams of the butler,  He makes my soul utter words of desire,  Oh how I shutter when I sense him nearer,  The way he helps others, makes me stutter,  I l-l-lo-love y-you, y-you handsome b-butler.   Whats that? N-no. I don-I dont have a massive man-crush on the butler. S-shut up. Its PERFECTLY NORMAL for a man to write a romantic poem for someone else. Shhh. Nothing weird here. Nope.   How about getting paid in Timbits?   Zoom and enhance!  Wait...there's no need to zoom.  Good god, that is freaky.   http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wi9mx/the_scarecrow_corpse/  The Scarecrow Corpse. It was a good one. Really gave me the chills.   The Petitcodiac River, which passes through Moncton New Brunswick, is said to be haunted. The locals refer to it as the Chocolate River, not because of the fancy chocolatier shop on its south bank, but because heavy sediments in the water have turned it a permanent shade of brown. In 1968, a causeway was built in an attempt at controlling the flow of water to prevent flooding in agricultural areas, and to connect Moncton to its neighboring town, Riverview. Up until then, the Chocolate River was home to one of the largest tidal bores on earth, and had an ecosystem rich in marine life. After construction, the river died down to a trickle, and 85% of the creatures died. The locals urged the government to open the causeway doors in order to restore the river to its former glory. It was not until 2010 that the doors were finally open for good. The river began a slow healing process, and marine life gradually returned. Unfortunately, the restoration project came with a little something extra: something sinister joined the wildlife of the chocolate-colored river.   nbsp;   In Fall of 2013, I flew to Moncton to visit my sister for a week. She and I had been best friends since childhood, but our lives had taken us on different paths, and, a few years prior, she moved for work. We kept in touch through video calls and weekly chat sessions. She told me how friendly the people of Moncton were. It was the kind of town where everyone knew you and your relatives by name, even if you had never met. Everyone was polite and lived a nice, quiet life. From my sisters descriptions, an image of a quaint little village formed in my mind. Imagine my surprise when, upon arriving in Moncton, I found a full-blown city. Though un-obscured by skyscrapers, Moncton was full of grocery stores, highways, malls, government and university buildings, etc. It was nothing like what I imaged. I was shocked to see how big Moncton was. My sister picked me up from the airport, and we drove back to her apartment just in time for supper. We spent the evening catching up and geeking out in true sibling fashion.   nbsp;   The next morning, my sister and I headed to her workplace. On the drive there, I spotted the Chocolate River. I expressed interest in checking out the tidal bore: a wave that climbed up a river against its current during high tide. My sister promised we could go the next morning. Having checked out the schedule the previous night, I knew the morning tide was going to come in at around 4:00 am, and had no desire to get up that early. We had no plans for the afternoon, so I asked if we could go watch the evening tidal bore instead, which came in at around 3:00 pm on that particular day. I remember her answer quite vividly, since it took me by surprise. She raised her eyebrows and shook her head quickly: Oh, no. Thats dangerous., she said. I pressed her on the issue, and she explained that there had been a lot of accidents where people had fallen in and drowned. I could not wrap my head around why the city had not built guardrails, or why the morning tide was supposedly safer than the evening tide.   nbsp;   We arrived at my sisters place of employment with two boxes of donuts for her coworkers. After using the sweets to assemble the team, my sister paraded me around and introduced me to everyone. She had not exaggerated when she told me about their hospitality: they were extremely friendly and downright delightful. My sister left me with the group while she took care of some last-minute business. Her coworkers and I got to talking about the tidal bore. An older gentleman with greying hair and a bushy mustache warned me that the river was damned, and that those who watch the tidal bore three nights in a row get dragged under by the living dead, never to be seen or heard from again. He claimed their blood had turned the river brown over the years. At first, I laughed and dismissed it as playful folklore to scare an out-of-towner like me. He had probably told my sister another variation of the story. It was not like her to fall for silly tales, so I was kind enough not to tease her too much for believing in that superstitious nonsense. I banished thoughts of the Chocolate River from my mind and headed back home to play videogames my sister.   nbsp;   By late afternoon on the following day, I asked my sister come with me to see the tidal bore, which took place at around 4:45 pm. She reluctantly agreed to take me, but abandoned me to buy treats at the chocolatier shop not far from where we parked. Careful not to slip on the rocks, I approached the muddy river and took a seat on a stable concrete slab protruding from the landscape. The cool autumn air and the strong breeze made me thankful that I had grabbed my leather jacket on the way out. My hands searched through its pockets until my fingers caught my cellphone. I checked the schedule, and smiled in anticipation: the tidal bore was going to come in any minute now. I waited patiently, head arched towards the end of the river, until I saw a wave on the horizon. As the water approached, I began hearing a dreadful sound. Some person or creature was groaning. I averted my gaze from the water for just a second to see what was making the noise. By the time I turned my head back, I felt a splash of cold, mucky water flooding my shoes. An audible yelp escaped my lips and I jumped to higher ground. I did not expect the river to swell quite that much. The wave continued its journey up the stream, taking the moaning sound away with it, and the water eventually evened out.   nbsp;  That night, I did a bit of research on the Chocolate River. There had been no less than 9 cases of mysterious deaths and disappearances since the causeway doors had opened three years prior. Two of the victims were part of a camera crew getting preliminary shots for a documentary on the restoration of the Chocolate River. Their equipment washed up on shore several weeks later, so it was assumed they had drowned and that the river had fed their bodies into the Atlantic Ocean. Another case talked about a young photographer. A piece of his shirt, clinging to a boulder on the banks of the river, was all they ever found of him. Authorities speculated that the man, trying to get a nice photo, had slipped and fallen in. I remembered being taken by surprise by the volume of water that suddenly reached me when the tide came in, so I could understand how a couple of accidents might have happened. As I read through the articles, I began to paint an entirely different picture in my mind. There were only so many alleged suicides and accidents that could happen before it raised a couple questions, and I was shocked the authorities had done nothing about it.   nbsp;  The next day, we drove to Hopewell Rocks, which was the meeting point between the Atlantic Ocean and the Chocolate River. Hopewell Rocks had almost made it on the list of 7 Natural Wonders of the World. I was enthralled by the beautiful landscape of massive water-eroded boulders. It was impressive to see the natural marks that perfectly outlined just how high the water could go. You could see sediments and rows of kelp clinging to the stones. I was standing under one of the boulders for a photo, and looked up to see that the water reached at least 5 feet over me during high tide. That was probably how the handprints had gotten up there. I noticed them around the highest edges of some of the larger boulders. They resembled ancient cave paintings, in that they were simple and lacked the kind of profanity you would expect from regular graffiti. I explored the beach in complete awe, examining every cavernous nook and cranny along the way.   nbsp;  We got back in time for the next evening tide, which took place around 6:00 pm. This time, my sister joined me. I had packed us a couple sandwiches, which we ate while waiting for the show. I had chosen a spot on higher ground to avoid my running shoes getting flooded again. The first time was unpleasant enough. As time went on, the streets around us emptied and the sounds of the city faded away. It was not long before we began hearing strange noises. A chorus of agonized screams, howls, and groans erupted from every direction as the tide approached. I could see fear in my sisters eyes as she pointed towards the river. I followed her gaze, spotting dark shapes underneath the surface. Just like the ocean flooded the river, fear flooded every inch of me. I would have stayed frozen there, had my sister not grabbed me by the arm and pulled me to the car. I could still see something under the water as we drove over the causeway.   nbsp;  On the third night, I returned to the Chocolate River alone: my sister was still freaked out about what we had seen and heard the night before. I got to the river early, and watched the sun slowly crawl towards the horizon, giving me very little light to observe the tide. It was due to come around 7:00 pm, but I did not let the lack of light deter me. I cautiously approached the river, sat down, and waited until I saw the vague outline of a wave in the distance. Again, moans and screams filled the air, this time louder than ever. I could see something sticking out of the wave as it rolled towards me. One by one, hundreds of muddied fingers reached through the waters surface. I only had time to see the fingers turning into hands before I remembered what that man had told me: the undead would drag me under if I watched the tidal bore three nights in a row. I pounced to my feet and staggered towards the car as quickly as my legs could take me. My foot hit a crack in the concrete and my ankle twisted harshly. The pain brought me to my knees, but when I turned around, I could see fingers reaching over the riverbank, and I forced myself back to my injured feet. I ran to the car, throwing the door open and slamming it shut in one rapid motion. I turned the car on and the headlights illuminated the river: I could see arms reaching over the edge. Tires shrieking, I high-tailed it out of there.   nbsp;  I did not go back to the Chocolate River after that night. I spent what was left of the week in sisters apartment, trying hard to forget what I saw. On the plane home, I looked outside the window and saw the Chocolate River below. I swear, even from a distance I could see shadows under the surface. I cant help wondering: did the dead start inhabiting the river after the causeway doors opened, or was the causeway built to keep them out?   Too busy laughing about the beaver comment to come up with a good comeback.   The only pointy branches are the ones around my heart whenever you're away. ; D   *Sigh* How am I supposed to compete with that? You win, good sir. May your serious and meaningful long-term relationships with consensual ladyfolk be most fruitful. I can only hope that I will be as virile as you one day.   Can't say that I have, alcohol's not my thing.  But for you ladies out there: I have chugged an entire bottle of water once, without taking a breath. That's right, badass alert.   My Canadar alarms are blaring. Let us do a celebratory shot of maple syrup, my faithful companion.   I'd try replacing the photos with people you really don't like and see what happens. Maybe you can save your loved ones that way?   Have a happy and spooky New Year everyone!   You could switch to the lighter color scheme so that, on your next visit, you won't immediately know where you are.   The one about my car.   Read Roman numerals and read analogue clocks. It's ironic, because I have a beautiful grandfather clock with Roman numerals on it. I have no idea whether or not the time on it is accurate.   I agree: I got a 100$ bill once. Took me forever to get rid of it.   Everything is so black and white with this guy.   There's nothing wrong with implementing chunks of yourself in your stories: it helps breathe life into them. You shouldn't shy away from it. Besides, no one's going to know that you're using yourself in your story...unless it's someone who knows you out there in the 'real' world.   I half agree with you. I don't have a problem with people playing along per se, and I find some of the comments really entertaining, but I think two of the rules come into conflict with one another in such a way as to be really detrimental.  People have to **assume everything is real** and play along, but **people can't ask for proof**. If everything is real, then of course they're going to want proof. I wrote a story a few days ago about something caught on camera and a bunch of people asked for the video, which is only natural because the story is supposed to be real. I know they're not -supposed- to ask for the video, but they did, and I'm not a video-y person, so I provided no video footage.  I think it would be a step in the right direction to let people play around if they want to, but not FORCE them to assume everything is real if they don't.   I'm glad the story scared you! In the interest of being mysterious...ONE of the stories I have posted is 100% true. The rest are works of fiction.   The writer in me says: We've got some awesome readers here, which helps a lot! The reader in me says: Heck yeah, the writers here impress me tremendously.   xD   Last year, on Boxing Day, I found a really cool ornament in a clearance box. It had a built-in camera to record a unique perspective on your holiday celebrations. I grabbed the last one from the stores dusty shelf and brought it home for less than 10 bucks. I forgot about it until my wife, my two daughters, and I decorated the house earlier this month. I told my daughters about the camera and said wed secretly catch Santa in the act. I had an old costume in the attic and intended to deliver some gifts in full view of the camera on Christmas night. My girls were overjoyed, and went back-and-forth trying to find the best place to put the ornament on the tree. They had no idea daddy re-positioned it later so it could actually catch the living room and a good angle.   nbsp;  In the nights leading up to Christmas, I turned the camera on to make sure everything was working properly. In the morning, I previewed the footage---just long enough to confirm the thing was working. Satisfied, I inserted the Micro SD card back into the ornament, and slipped in a new battery in anticipation for the big night. Daddy didn't want to disappoint his girls with a failed recording.   nbsp;  We enjoyed Christmas Eve as a family, playing board games and eating way more junk food than there was room in our stomachs. Like we do every year, we let our daughters open one gift from mommy and daddy before going to bed. The girls, still riding their sugar-high, could be heard giggling in their bedrooms from all the way up the stairs. From time to time, my wife and I could hear one of them shush the other, claiming shed heard hoofs on the roof or bells jingling. Eventually, our kiddos dosed off. My wife kissed me on the cheek and headed to bed while I turned off all the lights. I retrieved the costume and tiptoed to the living room, getting ready for my big feature film debut.   nbsp;  I did everything you would expect Santa to do: I ate most of the cookies, I drank the milk, I pet my large stomach and said my HO HO HOs, and I dropped a few presents by the fireplace, all in full-view of the camera. A pretty good acting job, if I do say so myself.   nbsp;  On Christmas morning, the girls came running into our bedroom to wake us up. They excitedly insisted we watch the video before opening the presents. I transferred the footage to my laptop, forwarded to where Santa showed up, and pressed play. My girls squealed with delight and jumped in front of the screen, frantically waving at Santa while obscuring the video from my view. It brought me so much joy to see how happy the girls were. I was too lazy to stop the video, so it continued to play in the background while we unwrapped out gifts. I spotted a box I had not seen the night before: it was a small and wrapped in a blue foil paper I did not recognize. My name was on it, but my wife seemed as surprised as I was to see it there. Noticing my confusion, my youngest daughter spoke:   nbsp;  Daddy! Thats gotta be from Mr. Elf!, she said, her voice cheerful and bright.   nbsp;  I was ready to dismiss her elf comment as just another weird thing kids say, but my wife wasn't so quick to ignore it.   nbsp;  Honey, what elf?, she asked.   nbsp;  My daughter pointed to the laptop. By then, the video had ended and all that was left on the screen was a preview of the first frame.   nbsp;  The one that came with Santa!, she answered.   nbsp;  Panic struck me like a bird in a jet propeller. I know my wife didnt dress up as an elf. I scanned the video, clicking forward and back until I saw what my daughter had seen: there was someone in the living room. He walked into the corner after I had turned the lights off. He stood there watching me parading around as Santa. The video went completely quiet after that. It was as though the camera failed to record a single sound. The strange, tall man in an elf costume stood perfectly still for over an hour, watching the camera from a distance. After a while, he walked over to the plate of cookies and bit the head off a gingerbread man. I glanced at the plate and saw his teeth mark on the decapitated cookie. The man then quietly approached the Christmas tree. I thought the audio wasn't working, but as he reached the tree, I began hearing his slow and steady breaths. He reached towards the ornament, and the video stopped.   nbsp;  In a terrified frenzy, I grabbed the blue box hed left behind. I ripped the bow off of it and tossed the frilly thing away. I frantically removed the wrapping paper, opened the box, and looked inside. There, on a bed of bubble wrap, was the battery Id put in the camera the night before. My wife took the ornament and opened the back: the battery was missing. I dont know what scares me more: what the camera caught, or what the elf might have done after he turned off the camera.   As someone who has a 3DS, I find this unsettling. I think I'm going to keep a closer eye on who walks into my plaza from now on.   That chameleon is great, and that stamp is awesome!  My sister got me an alarm clock that imitates the sunrise. It's pretty dark in my room, so this'll make mornings a lot more cheerful. My current alarm clock is so old it actually has a cassette tape player integrated into it.  My parental units got me a bunch of cool stuff for my kitchen (including a potato ricer) and some DCU movies. Can't wait to watch Justice League: War with my sister. Never too old for Justice League!   Happy insert holiday here to you, too! :)  	77

 It was a good week!  New games played:  **Mage Knight**: Bought this second hand at a bargain and played the tutorial (exploring) game solo. Already now that I'll love it.  **Five Tribes**: Solid game. I find it more tactical/opportunistic than strategic. Just don't play with players with AP.  **Lost Valley**: Tile laying Euro with a badly written rule book. Turns are quite simple so a game was quick. We all felt that this game was just a bit short of being a fantastic game.  **Via Appia**: Fun light game which reminds us of arcade games.  **Valley of the Kings**: Great deckbuilding game with set collection for a small box. I plan to buy this one.  **Glen More**: Fun little tile laying + resource management Euro. Really liked the turn order mechanic. I'll buy this if I have the chance as well.  Games that I've played before: **Ingenious**,**Lords of Waterdeep**, **Agricola**, **Port Royal**. **Star Realms**, **Fresco**, **Dominant Species**, **Greed**, **Biblios**      I find that the best way to form a strategy is by looking at the monuments before the 1st turn begins. Decide on building a specific one, with a backup plan on building another one in case someone else built it before you.  Then based on the target monument, you probably have to upgrade your tech tree to fulfil your strategy more efficiently. The first half of the game is probably spent gathering wood/upgrading tech/gathering corn etc just to survive and build up for your long term plans.    I agree with the samey feel. Players can practically plan out their strategy before starting a game. Sure you would tweak your worker placements opportunistically, but you would be able to stick to a predetermined strategy more or less.   Sounds promising! Hopefully I don't have to throw away most of my games when I move.   I'll be moving back to HK in 2015 so thank you for the info.  Do you know any places/forums to meet random hobbyist for games? I'm just afraid there won't be opportunities for me to play Euros/try new games anymore.   I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum... Just started playing board games this year, have played 200 different games already but currently own only 10 (though I'm constantly resisting my urge to buy more)   **Martin Wallace** - If you like managing money and cashflows, you'll love his games: London, Brass, Steam.  Also games that are slightly chaotic: A Study in Emerald, Discworld.  Heard good things about A Few Acres of Snow but have not personally tried yet.   I played over 20+ new games in August so I'll just list my favourites:  **Ora et Labora**: I love resource management games and this is very enjoyable as there is not much stress of feeding your workers. The only downside is there is no setup variability so I am not sure about replayability.  **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**: If you play with the right crowd, this is immensely satisfying.  **Bruges**: This should be in the top 100! Although there are lots of interesting decisions to be made it plays quite quickly.  **Ground Floor**: There are some interesting mechanics and as a pure Euro I still find it quite thematic.  **Thunder Alley**: Looks complicated but actually isn't. Fast paced racing game.  **Star Realms**: Probably the best filler that I have bought. It's good with 2, and decent with 3.  **Dungeon of Mandom**: As a filler this ticks all my boxes. Easy to teach, slightly strategic, fits in a tiny box, and fun!  **Space Alert**:  This has to be my favaourite co-op game. There's practically no downtime, no quarterback issues, and you really feel that you win (or lose) as a whole team. Love the subtle humour as well (Did anyone wiggle the mouse?)   This should help you a bit:  [http://boardgameprices.co.uk/](http://boardgameprices.co.uk/)  I personally quite like boardgameguru.co.uk   Just tried **Impulse** yesterday. I like it quite a lot, especially how quick it plays. Not too keen on the battle element, so I'll pass on buying this one but will definitely play it again if it hits the table.   Heh, I have ordered it on Amazon last night and the price went up by 9 today! Can't wait for it to arrive next week.   Thanks! I'm interested in **Pax Porfiriana** but it seems to be sold out. **Biblios** is already one of my favourite light games, and I intend to pick up a copy when the reprint is out.   Thanks for your suggestions! **Blueprints** is on my watchlist and I just saw that the reprint is available on amazon, I'm tempted to click Buy Now..   I have yet to try this, thanks!   I agree with **Splendor**. I know this will lose a bit of its appeal but if I use wooden cubes instead of chips, I could fit the whole game in my pockets!   I enjoy euros such as **Terra Mystica** and **Agricola**, but they are difficult for me to transport during the week, therefore I consider them "weekend games". I am hoping to add to my collection some "weeknight games" that are compact (**able to fit at least 2 games in a backpack**) but are still complex enough not to be categorised as a filler. I know that **Glory to Rome** is an obvious choice but it's sold out everywhere..  Thanks in advance!  **Number of Players**: 3-5 players. (the group discourages 2 player games)  **Game Length**: 0.5 - 2 hours  **Complexity of Game**: As complex as possible and as little dice rolling as possible.  **Your Budget**: Not an issue  **Competitive or Cooperative**:Either  **Games I Own/Like or Dislike**: Games that I dislike: hidden roles/bluffing/confrontational (**coup**, **resistance**,**citadels**). Games I own that fit my criteria already: **Guildhall**, **Race for the Galaxy**, **Hanabi**  	17

 Your username leads me to believe this story might not be truthful...   Whisky also does the job quite well   r/thathappened   Freedom isn't free   They are absolutely incredible! I love their music. Your whole thread made me very happy :)   J5 is so dope. I've seen them live several times. They just performed at Outside Lands in San Francisco last year.   I'm a 29 year old man and still have not mastered that skill yet...   I was making a joke...Dr. Jones...Indiana Jones http://youtu.be/aU9A_oN6NV8   Was it an archeology class by chance?    Did your parents not hug you enough growing up?   That most of the people in the Reddit community were intelligent, contributing members of society. Some of you should never procreate. This topic has me in stitches...(just to clarify- that means I am laughing uncontrollably haha)   I always thought it would be really cool if they rebooted the series with a new Entourage. It could center around a young, upcoming rapper and his entourage. It could have some of the same players (Ari Gold, Billy Walsh, etc) but have a fresh new feeling to it with an all-new cast of characters. I would have loved to see something like that.   Maybe a 5 or a 6, I just have seen every episode and picked up on it part of the way through reading your well-written post. Funny stuff.   Smoke more weed Turtle   KY Jelly   Thank God I won't have to hear from this turd burglar anymore. I fucking hate this guy.   Godspeed my friend. Happy NYE. I will hit my Roor in your honor!   I haven't seen the interviews. I'll check them out!  Was hoping for some juicy stories from high school.   Was she a slut?   Taking a shower and hearing a loud noise and being worried you will have to engage in mortal combat...butt naked   Her eyebrows scare the shit out of me   Even before reading this article, I found this ass clown to be one of the most despicable, entitled losers in Hollywood. This just confirms his douchiness for me. Suck it LaDouche.   Sharks   The last season of Dexter. Spoiled a show I used to really like.   Filet mignon   A dolphin. No known predators, extremely smart, fast and are one of the only other mammals that have sex for fun.   Your son has a fiery temper!   Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll" was used in a Cadillac commercial and it's just not the same anymore.   There would be nothing funny about me seeing those clowns, because I would be sitting in a pile of crap. The poop would definitely be of the nervous variety.   Haha I was only kidding. No hard feelings.   That is tragic. Sorry for your loss.   Sorry for your loss   I just threw up in my mouth   I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.  It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further.  Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone.  TL;DR: A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries.    You laughed? I literally would have shit my pants...   Pretty judgy for a guy who was also in a drug den...   Luckily for me I wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy   Losing my virginity. That was awesome!   The wheel. Life would be impossible without it.   Kind of windy out today, I'll see you at the bottom...

That guy deserves to get his ass beat to within an inch of his life. I hope you are okay now and with someone who isn't a physcho.    Water   Can I borrow your card? I promise I'll give it back.

 Perhaps I just had a shitty therapist, but all I ever got from it was "you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, sucks, don't it?" Therapy just made me focus more on the stupid things, trying to figure out why they bother me. It ended up making me feel super self-absorbed, to the point that my very best friend told me to either change or get out of her life.  I worry less about what other people currently think, but rather what they may do if I pursue a certain want.   I suppose my biggest concern with this philosophy is that it seems like it just makes us all into selfish little twats. All I want to do is help people less fortunate than I, but I get so caught up in how I might be hurting them that I just assume that everyone is better off without me. I know it's not true, but that little voice is constantly telling me I'm a burden or a bother. I've been getting better at pushing it aside, but sometimes I just can't see the point, if it's just going to come back.  Tl;dr: maybe I just can't not give fucks, when my ultimate goal is to help others.   I've been lurking on this sub for a while now. Every post is full of "your problems don't matter" or "just do it" or "be confident."  It isn't that easy. Anxiety is part of my identity. It's like telling someone with clinical depression to "just be happy." It's pointless, and a little bit offensive. I checked the sidebar, and in the "how to start not giving a fuck" post, literally all of them seem like completely insurmountable goals. How do you go from not knowing what self-confidence feels like to being super confident all the time?  I'd love to take your advice. But it's like telling rabbits to stop fucking and pooping.   That is my issue with this whole sub. I know I shouldn't give a fuck, but then I just get hung up on doing that. At least for me, not worrying about things takes away one of the only constants of my identity.    And if you can't control your own basic bodily functions, there's no way in hell you can consent, no matter how much you want it.   So you might fit into a 32" and a 34", depending on the store. That still seems more reasonable than fitting into a 2 one place and a 9 somewhere else.   I can see where they're coming from. I live in Southern Indiana, aka meth land, and knew a handful of kids who cooked in high school. It's an awful drug, and those hooked on it will do anything to get/make more.  That being said, I think this is a little extreme. You can still go buy Sudophed (sp?), just not boxes and boxes. Maybe putting a cap on the amount you can buy at a time would work better.   Dissociatives are not fun (in my opinion). Instead of passing out, expect to be having conversations with the giant spider on the wall or freaking out cuz you can't find your bread.  Edit: also, a benadryl overdose is serious business. Seizures, vomiting, coma, etc. Source: I took an od of it on purpose and am literally the only person who's been in my hospital for one, had seizures, and didn't die. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but don't fuck with this stuff.   They may be driven to have it cuz it feels good, but that isn't the reason. It's a biological imperative that happens to feel good. If it didn't, horses would go extinct pretty quick.   Yes, it does. When I make potent cookies, it makes the place smell like grandma and dank. Not safe to do until you've got your own place.   I had a buddy who turned it into a game: take a standard drink each time they say standard drink. Have fun ;-)         I'm not sure about him, but I (also from the midwest) could find a zip anywhere between $275-$315.   I decide what I want to make beforehand, and then get so excited at the prospect of fresh pastries. It's also been a bit of a zen activity for me for years.  The dough for these takes about six hours, so there's a lot of down time to get more stoned or watch some Netflix.    For the dough I just used Julia Child's croissant recipe. For the filling, I put some berries, sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a saucepan and let it cook and thicken over low heat while I rolled out and cut the dough. Use water around the edged to seal. Sorry I couldn't give a legit recipe, I usually just wing it.   I just used Julia Child's croissant recipe for the dough. For the filling, I put some berries, sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a saucepan and let it cook on low heat while I rolled out the dough.   Madame. Madam is the head of a brothel.       Julia Child. I'm not sure which one has the most pastries, but french pastries are my schtick.      This is the best advice on this topic I've ever heard.  OP, everyone has to deal with relationships that just aren't right. And it hurts, because unless you're a sociopath, it really sucks to hurt someone else. I had a terrible, controlling, legitimately insane SO for a while. I loved him more than I could possibly say. I still do, even just for the good memories we made together. But we just weren't good together. "test_subject2886, shut up, you're about to say something you know nothing about" was a common thread. When I finally realized it wasn't working out, I agonized over the decision for weeks. I felt guilty for months afterward.  I've now been away from him for a year, and it was the best decision I've ever made. No one deserves a shitty relationship, but they help us figure out better what we need for a healthy, thriving one. So buy yourself some Ben Jerry's and remember that you've gotten through this frog, so you know you can do it again if you have to.  Tl;dr: we all have to deal with bad relationships so we can figure out what we need.   Sounds similar to my best Goodwill find: a vintage suede fringe jacket for $10. Looked up the tags online, turns out it's worth at least $300. I live for deals like this.   If you work it, as you clearly have been. Congrats!      http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/26/cold-sores-linked-to-cognitive-decline/  Apparently.   The other discussion is more relevant and informative, but from my experience this isn't necessary. I've never had a UTI, and I never make it a priority to pee right after sex.   Make sure to eat a lot of yogurt or other things with probiotics to prevent a yeast infection. The antibiotics for the UTI can mess with the levels of bacteria and yeast in the vagina, which can in turn create a yeast infection. Vagina problems are the worst.      That pretty perfectly describes how I am when I don't smoke weed. Clearly ymmv.   I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks on the regular. I am generally worried about something all the time. I smoke a spliff every morning when I wake up to calm myself down. Sometimes I get paranoid, but it only ever has to do with avoiding getting arrested. I have never had a panic attack while stoned. Just my two cents.   And a decent amount of them probably do, too.   That's my protocol as well. Also I don't ever seriously consider stupid tattoos.   Some places just don't have schwag. I can't even find mids in my town, and I've got several dealer friends.   My buddy once said "Look what the cat blew in." Now we use that regularly.   I think they're beautiful, but I just filed mine into a similar shape, but much shorter. I remember I posted them on here and someone told me "black always looks good," I'm guessing because they thought the shape looked bad. I say do whatever you like! I always feel ten times classier with my nails not square.   A good friend of mine started taekwondo this year and loved it. I got my lifeguard certification renewed last semester, too.         I always have the problem of the polish sliding right off my nail after I take it out of the water. I don't understand the magic.   It's called the Little Five-Hundred   We just girling out after quite a few whiskey shots nights.      Holy shit, I know you!   Trevor, Sam, and Darren had some shows this weekend, so a friend and I went. We wanted to smoke with them but  couldn't work up the nerve to ask.   Or it didn't. Looked like it did.      Sponge, just got a giant bag of makeup sponges at Walmart for less than 2 bucks.   Essie Chinchilly and NYC Times Square Tangerine      I think it's actually a puke joke. Even worse. But it's my personal favorite polish, too bad I can't find any place to buy it.   Like [this?](http://imgur.com/ys9moF7)   Where do I apply?   So, long story short, I make really idiotic decisions when it comes to boys.  I got played like a card by this guy for six months and all I have to show for it is a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and a short hospital stay. I decided it was a great idea to Facebook stalk him for a little bit tonight, and I ended up bawling my eyes out, just like every time I see or think about him too much.  I know that drinking my problems away will be bad in the long run, but tonight I'm killing what's left of a fifth of Captain and realizing that his new girlfriend is probably smart and funny and everything I'm not, but still holding onto the fact that she makes Sarah Jessica Parker look like she doesn't have a horsr face.  Tl;dr: fuck boys, fuck Facebook, and fuck ugly bitches.   AKA a terrible movie with hardly any plot glamorizing the very very young woman who fucked over most of the French population of the late 18th century.   I have to separate them, they curl in on each other and I end up with polish all over the place otherwise.   What is that green, I love it!   AKA I didn't have anything to separate my toes, so I used a pen, a nail file, and a lip balm. Color is CG Ingrid.         Classin' it up! I'm right there with you.   Juice of any kind, but I love Apple or Orange.      I'm going to give an opinion right now that I know is incredibly unpopular in this subreddit, because it's worked for me many a time.  I enjoy faking orgasms. I am a fairly orgasmic person, though. Usually what happens is that I'll be able to tell that a guy is about to come, and I start contracting my muscles. Doing that (depending on the position) also forces my hips into a position where my clit is getting stimulation, and seeing the guy feeling me get close usually sends me over into a real orgasm.  I have completely faked them during random hookups when I just knew that it wasn't going to go anywhere, and I don't find a problem with that. If you don't care for the person, an you know he won't be inside you again, you can do whatever you want, because the next person he sleeps with will be different from you and he'll have to learn how to please her specifically.   Hello all!  Today I splurged a finally got myself a bottle of Seche Vite. I used it straightaway but have a few questions. I searched and a few questions were resolved, but these ones I couldn't find answers to.  I didn't run into this today, but if I need two coats of a polish to get it opaque, do I need to let the separate layers dry before putting on the next coat, or should I do them all quickly and then seche on top while they're all still tacky? I don't mean between base color and art, that question has been resolved time and time again, I mean with light colors that require more than one coat to be opaque.  Secondly, how thick is a "thick coat" of SV? I figured it meant pretty think, but I got bubbles in it today. I know it isn't from the polish underneath, because I didn't see the bubbles while I was waiting for the polish to go from really wet to slightly tacky.  Thank you all so much! This stuff really is magical.   Maybe something to do with Doc Counsilman, the IU swimming coach back in the day who practically invented kinesiology as it relates to sport training? Only thing I can think of, considering we're practically landlocked (being from the Southern half of the state, I sometimes forget that Lake Michigan even exists).   NYC in a minute High Line Green, essie Chinchilly, Claire's no name white, NYC Big Apple Red Creme, NYC Matte Me Crazy      My friend just got Razzle Me Dazzle Me and Bling it On, both of which are amazing. She let me borrow Razzle Me Dazzle Me, and let me tell you it looks amazing over a dark grey, and even better matte.   Now, I may be misreading the signals, but they have feelings for each other right?   I go to the comments to see an explanation of why it works. Then I feel worse because it loses the magic.   Bitch, you can see the label. Oliver Soft Red, representing Southern Indiana!   http://www.imgur.com/bL76lmn.jpeg Proof enough? You ain't never had a friend like me.      Beautiful. Want.   I'm not vegan, but that sounds fantastic! Applesauce is a really good egg substitute. So are bananas    Aw, man. Syllabus week was last week for me, and I am still drunk as fuck on a Wednesday. Clearly your schedule isn't made right. I don't have class until 1 tomorrow, and that's the earliest I start.   My first mistake after I turned 19 was having sex with a sociopath who shared the birthday. I mean, neither of us would have had birthday sex otherwise, but it was a bad move on my part. So trust me, it could have been way worse. I had to make eye contact with the kid in order to pass him bowls after that.   At a store just off campus from my (dry) campus has a shirt that says "Dry Campus My A**" I plan on buying one as soon as I have enough money for my booze and some left over. Because it's so so true.   I won't downvote you for going to Purdue, even though it may be my duty as an IU student. But all those points are good, especially if you're an attractive female. However, since you're 21 in time, I highly suggest you make the 2.5 hour trek down here for Little 5. I can't fucking wait for my first Little 5 once I turn 21.   Also, I definitely turned this over for the picture and poured a little bit of vodka that hadn't evaporated from my last shot on my keyboard. Still seems to work fine.      Thanks. Although, your username makes me a little nervous, considering I am far from a furry. But, I do't judge, whatever you like is cool by me, as long as you don't try to force me to comply.   As someone who goes to college in their hometown (townies FTW!), I just ask my parents to let me have the car for a few hours as I load all my shit into four loads max in order to move back after the breaks. My roommate is totally cool with the level of messiness I deal with, for her half to the room is almost as bad.   We're working on it, don't worry.   They are always wonderful. My roommate let me take some of hers in return for a few shots of my vodka.   I'm not sure how to take this comment. A compliment? A thing to worry about in case my parents Reddit? I don't even know.   It looks wonderful! And your nails are beautiful! I could never get mine to grow that long without breaking them.      Not OP, but I tend to do a much better job on my legs if I'm a little tipsy. Forces you to concentrate more and go slower.   Caramel Apple drinks. One shot green apple schnapps, one shot butterscotch schnapps, two or three shots Maker's Mark. They taste so fantastic that you forget that you'll get wasted. I usually forget after three of these, because I also will just take whiskey shots, too.   Or putting tampons right next to the ice cream. Gets me every time.   To me that looks like a bad time in a bottle. But good on you for being able to handle it.   Relevant. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuDtACzKGRs   Also, I'm saving the fuck out of this post. Also also, each of my presidential cocktail nights must be accompanied with music from the particular period of time when each one served.   As a political science major, it bothered me a little bit that the article says "George H. Bush," not "George H. W. Bush." But also as a political science major, I'm really happy that this article even exists. I need to drink my way through the presidents as soon as possible.   Hair of the dog that bit you.   Relevant http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuDtACzKGRs   Totally random, but fuck beer pong: flippy cup is my shit! I'm terrible at beer pong, but everyone I know wants me on their flippy cup team.   Looks like my fridge, only it's soup I've got surrounded.   After more than 5 really long sob-story drunk texts to the same person, I just took his number out of my phone. Pretty much the best decision I ever made.   Even as a lady who was born as such, I love getting baked and doing housework in a dress and heels. I think (at least for me) it's the 50's housewife aesthetic.   Any one of my multitude of cute sweaters and a hot cup of coffee or tea.   Can you feel the cornstarch, or does it just thicken? I'm weird and can't stand the way cornstarch feels on my skin.   Not a lot with the lips. I'd just go for maybe a slightly pink tinted gloss.   I'm a big fan of waking up, checking my phone, and sending "Sorry about that, man. I was really drunk." Because calling someone man means it's just friends, right? Or maybe that's just cuz I'm a chick.   As a Packers fan who hails from Indiana, I am very jealous that you got to be there at all. Upvote for winning dat game, though.  EDIT: Also, since my whole family is from Wisconsin, I understand the special kind of drunk y'all get up there. I hope to be able to drink beer in Milwaukee with everyone there sometime fairly soon. I feel as though this crazy alcohol tolerance is in my Wisconsin blood.   I know that feel, boy. I've had 8 shots of whiskey in the last 5 hours and should have been so fucked up that I'd pass out at 3pm. Alcohol tolerances fucking suck. Take a shot to that, I guess.

 I really hate when people give these insignificant morons the attention that they seek by doing and saying awful things. If you detest them, don't give them what they want. Ignore them.   This is why I question Blizzard's explanation of poor matchmaking being due to a small player base. Everyone I know that wants to play, can play. The game has pretty much been semi-launched for a while now, and I don't see much changing with launch.  I hope I'm wrong.   Contact your representatives and voice support for the measure. Be prepared to say why, as they will most likely ask.  And spread the word.   What's next? Handing out seat belts in schools!?   Working as intended.    They absolutely are not "against" bc.  Not sure about that. They frequently promote "abstinence only" policies.   They're against public funding for it.  That's true enough, though why it's preferable to pay significantly more for the costs of unwanted pregnancies, rather than paying much less to prevent them, is beyond me.  I'm pretty liberal, though, so paying $X for social policies to prevent $6X in long-term costs is right up my alley.    abortions were down 40%  The "pro-life" party in action.   I think Jaina is the hero that has the most variability. I feel I'm making a choice at every level, which is fantastic. For most heroes, I have a set build that doesn't change, or if it's only one or two talents that might change situationally. Some heroes I have two builds that are like that.  Jaina is the only one that I play where everything is in flux at almost every level, and I love that about her. Almost all of her talents feel viable and useful, and very few of them stand out as the "correct" choice for every situation.   Yeah, probably. But likely lower than if we fail to adequately address climate change.   I guess is that they'll be closer to actual prices, given that we subsidize fossil fuels rather heavily.   Oh, ha. I never take that talent. Thanks for pointing that out.   I might care, if I didn't buy my current Moto X on the promise that it would get fast updates, and am approaching 6 months of waiting for the last update.  Probably going Samsung on my next phone.   Here are the ones that I've come up with off the top of my head:  * A Starcraft non-combat support unit like an overlord, raven, arbiter, etc., that has no actual combat abilities, just provides information, buffs, and infrastructure. * A starcraft builder, like a probe that literally just builds things. * Ragnaros - literally can't leave the base as he has to inhabit a building at all times.    Well, my advice for every gaming site is to copy Rock Paper Shotgun to the letter. They are the only ones I know that are doing it right.  What are you referencing here? What is it that they do that you like? I'm not familiar with them and nothing really stood out as I dug around a bit.   Yup. Me too.  TL;DR - Me too.   Kinda defeats the point...   Grats!  How do you deal with really bad teams?   Agreed. Very sad to see that his trait is still not being addressed.    He needs a trait  FTFY    Leave it to PolitiFact to find a way to rate a completely true statement "mostly false".  It's technically true, but certainly not actually true. You really don't see the distinction?   [Wouldn't it be great if you had more than two choices?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w)   You'd hardly be the first, but by all means.   What have they distorted?   You eat all the cookies. Your mom asks if you ate all the cookies. You say no, because there are billions of cookies still in the world that you did not eat.  Just because what you said was technically true does not mean that you did not lie.   You really don't see a problem with distortions of the truth?   Don't forget religious freedom.   Sgt.Hammer decides to go mines alone.  Hammer's wrong.  Sgt Hammer entered siege mode and died almost instantly.  Hammer's wrong.  she rages  Hammer's wrong.   Fair enough, though I wouldn't really call confirming something that he said an attack.   Not sure anything is worse than free Hammer week. "Don't worry, guys. I'm sieged!"   I feel sorry for people who feel the need to rub it in whenever they have a good move or victory. Why isn't winning enough?    Sure, you will get some buildings down before you die but I doubt you will reach a fort this way.  I do it all the time.  Don't get me wrong, I think the team should be there to support the terror, but even if they aren't, I think it can still be very effective.   You can do a lot of damage with the terror, even if the enemy is responding. You just need to bounce between forts and try and maximize your W. You might not get a fort, especially if *your* team is ignoring you (which is a pretty big mistake), but you'll still make them feel it. And if your team does show up, you'll really do some significant damage. A fort at least.   You mean checking the facts of politicians? I agree.   I'm not sure I agree. A well-used terror can easily get 2-3 forts. That's massive. If the other team is ignoring my terror and it results in a 4v5, I think it's on my team to simply play safely while I absolutely wreck the opposing team.  The only times that I think it's all that appropriate to fight as the terror are:  1. If you're near enough to a kill/fight that you can secure it without sinking too much time into it. 2. If you're in desperate need of defense.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but in my experience, you want the terror pushing, especially if the other team is letting you do it.   inform themselves of optimal strategies  Agreed, but I think it's worth pointing out that this is not a case of a "non-optimal strategy" so much as it's a "rather significant mistake".   Hearthstone crawls. It goes months, often many months, without an update.    Also dislike having it select according to team composition, though i can understand and respect that change  I feel the same way. It's pretty much just a "random support" button. But it's better than the alternative.   I'd really like to see Mephisto, Baal, Maltheal, or any of the members of the Angiris council.   I've updated them many times over the last year. I try and stay current.   Zagara is incredibly strong. She dishes out insane amounts of damage from far away and has the ability to zone enemies out very effectively. She almost always dominates her lane, can hold her own in many 1v1 situations (though it's usually a game of chicken), and she's awesome to have in a team fight, especially, though not exclusively, thanks to the incredible power of maw.  Her only serious weakness is her lack of an escape before 20, and you can compensate for that with creep by keeping your route to safety covered and using it to see threats early enough to run.  TL;DR - Zagara is always awesome, just be prepared and informed well enough to run in time, while murdering anything and everything that you don't like (for the swarm, of course).    Lv7 Death Touch: A noob trap talent, you should never take this. Frozen Tempest already provides enough damage to kill minions.   Reminds me of Possession.   This is a good idea for Blizzard, because personally speaking, I would never, ever buy anything requiring a timed commitment like that. It would seriously piss me off if I bought a stimpack and then got slammed with work and couldn't use it or something.  If it was based on actual game time or game count, I'd actually consider buying one, but the current form is definitely not an option.   Something I ask myself every time I see things like one team having two tanks and no supports, and the other team having two supports and no tanks. Could ya maybe have just...   Do many vikings players really soak 3 lanes? Unless it's during an objective, I don't see much purpose to this. I typically put Olaf in a solo lane and keep Baelog and Erik together. As long as you have at least one other person soaking the third lane, you're not gaining anything by putting a viking in it, and you're giving up attention, viking safety, and some pushing ability.  What's the point of having vikings in all 3 lanes?   Great save!   He's referring to sites like politifact, that attempt to confirm or disprove what politicans say.   I disagree. AC could be a 4/3 today and still wouldn't see much play, if any.  OP didn't ask about today. He asked about when I started playing.   8-mana mind control.  Runners up: 3/3 Shattered Sun Cleric and 4/3 Argent Commander.   You're not considering the fact that because self driving cars will be much safer, they'll be able to drive a lot faster. So if it's truly a matter of time and patience, you're a lot better off taking those 2 minutes to set up your destination, because you're probably going to get there 30% sooner if you let the car drive.  Also, as has been stated, the state of technology is such that your phone likely knows where you're about to go before you do. So 2 minutes is likely over estimated by about 2 minutes.   Looks slick. Wish the gif were a little larger so I could see it better.  Great work!    tl;dr: the driver must pay attention at all times to avoid anything the car can't.  Maybe, but not necessarily. Google has recently adopted the stance that a human driver is not a reliable backup for an automated car. A person trying to correct the car's decision making would likely cause more issues than they would prevent.  Of course, we're in very uncharted territory, so we'll see if that pans out or not.   It's not a stupid question at all. It's one that is frequently asked, as a matter of fact.  The short answer is yes, it's very possible, and it's something the industry is going to have to account for.   I mean after this guy has called for a recorded vote. For example:  17 representatives in the room, Boehner says it's 218, guy runs in and asks for a recorded vote, they count and record a vote, and it's now very clear that there were nowhere near 218. Why hasn't Boehner committed a crime by saying there was? That rule exists for a reason, and he has very obviously broken it.   If this angers you, why give them free publicity? They publish outrageous and crazy things to get people's attention, and clearly it's worked on you.   Serious question: when Boehner declares a quorum of 218 congressmen, and then the actual count commences and then it is proved that there are like 30 congressmen there, why doesn't Boehner go to jail? Is that not a blatant and undeniable example of fraud and abuse?  And are the records of these obviously false quorums publicly available? I'd love to see what he's tried to get away with.    The people in power are afraid it could actually pass  Just the republicans. The democrats voted in favor of legalization.   List them?    I always thought they were FOR personal freedoms, am I just mistaken?  You are mistaken.   The "party of small government" strikes again.   The "party of small government" strikes again.   That's a lot of black arrows.   They grab creeps?   Beats me. I just play the game.   He's super fun and very effective. I don't think he's considered a top-tier hero, but I certainly enjoy playing him.   I've had to forfeit several winning games because of this, now that the game is available on mobile. It's my own fault for trying to squeeze in very fast games, but it still sucks.   Impressive. Great work!   Clever. I like it.   Many, even those of us with relatively high end machines, suffer from periods of lower frame rates (30), stutters, etc.. The hope has always been that the game hasn't been optimized yet, and that it would be before launch.   What do we think the difference between "open beta" and "launched" will be?   As long as you're actually going to monetize it. If it's just going to sit in a repo and die, you might as well let open source it. Otherwise your work is just going to waste.  Looks fantastic, BTW. Would love to hear how you did it.   Looks great! Nice job.    Thank you. Is totally confused.    Sure, here are several key points.  1. Prohibition doesn't work. People that want pot can get pot, and all we're doing is denying ourselves the opportunity to tax and regulate it. It's the exact same thing that happened during alcohol prohibition. In fact, many kids choose pot over beer because it's easier to get. 2. We're taking money and jobs out of the legitimate economy, and giving it directly to gangs, drug dealers, and ultra violent cartels, who, along with marijuana, deal in harder drugs, weapons, and slaves (and who knows what else). To say nothing of the massive tax revenue, and the fact that we're packing for-profit prisons 3. Marijuana is very likely a gateway drug, not because people that use it are inspired on to harder drugs, but because anyone that wants pot has to know a drug dealer. CVS is not going to push meth while it's selling you pot, but your normal weed hook 4. Weed is, by virtually all accounts, harmless. In a free society, you don't need a reason to make something legal, you need one to make it illegal. 5. We're packing for-profit prisons and destroying the lives of many law-abiding citizens. We lock them up, ruining their jobs/careers, and when we do release them, they're now in a harder situation and with many more criminal contacts. 6. We're arbitrarily denying people medicine and treatments that could really help them. Medical marijuana is often the only thing that can relieve pain and siezures for many people, and is now even being shown to be an effective treatment to some types of cancer. People are suffering, and in some cases dying, all in the name of (not really) inhibiting the use of recreational substance far less harmful (if harmful at all) than alcohol. 7. The only people who have something to lose by legalization are drug dealers, cartels, for-profit prisons (and the industry built around the monetization of incarceration), and beer companies. The rest of society, even non-smokers (like myself, don't plan on ever even trying it) will benefit almost immeasurably.  Oh, you said arguments *against* legalization! Yeah, I've got nothing there...   Well, if you lock them out for a period of time, those players will simply be in (and thus leave) fewer games.   Legitimate disconnects and reasons to leave the game exist, sure. I'm talking about the ones that do it frequently. The first one each week should be free. If you're quitting more than that, it's almost surely not due to emergencies.   It's entirely redundant with her kit, it serves absolutely no purpose in a team fight, and Wailing Arrow is insanely good.  Honestly, if you removed the increased CD for mercs, I'd still take Wailing Arrow.   Sounds good to me.   I think so.   Yeah. Maybe the first game you quit you can't queue until it's over, but the second in a week gets you a 24 hour suspension, with higher and higher times.  Clearly these people aren't that interested in playing the game anyway, and the rest of us sure won't miss them.    I still don't see what the benefits are of legalizing it other than some hypothetical talk about how much money it'll bring in from taxes.  It's far from hypothetical. Look how much Colorado has already brought in.  I don't want people getting stoned and then possibly getting behind the wheel or doing something that ends up hurting or killing someone else.  Here's the core thing to focus on: prohibition isn't prevent people from using pot. They already are. Tons and tons of them. Many kids choose weed over beer because it's a lot easier to get. The only things we're doing by making it illegal is giving up the opportunity to regulate it, and funding criminal enterprises.   If they go making it legal for cancer patients as a pain management drug, do they really believe those patients are going to be the only ones using it?  This is a particularly disturbing comment. If you'd let people suffer in an attempt to keep other people from using marijuana recreationally, I think you really need to re-examine your priorities.  Sure it might slow down the black market for pot  When is legal all across the country, there will be no black market. If you want proof, try and find a liquor bootlegger.  the bigger problem is what pot does to you when you smoke it.  Alcohol is far more harmful than pot. Do you support a return to alcohol prohibition as well?  TL;DR - Prohibition doesn't keep people from using marijuana, and it does far more damage than it prevents (if it prevents any at all).   Didn't mean to. Thanks for letting me know.   The problem is that in almost all cases, you're better off closing the distance and doing something else.  Much of the time, yes, but not almost all of the time. Knowing the difference is what makes it good.  It's not that the long-range banelings are a hard-to-land skillshot on the Zagara players' part  It's not always about landing the banelings. Often it's about zoning your opponent out.  Anyway, feel free to disagree. I think it's a good talent.   The only thing I disagree with is that Baneling Range isn't good. I find it very useful. When you get good enough with it, you can put it to some really great effects, such as cutting enemies off from a route of escape, splitting them up, dissuading a chase you want to avoid, disrupting objectives, adding presence to a fight from afar, etc.  I'm not saying that it's better than the regeneration, but it's definitely a worthwhile talent, once you've gotten good with it.   That number, and the ones in the comments, are way, way lower than I would have thought them to be.  Reddit has a maximum population of Ohio...   True. It's not a bad pick. I just prefer Hardened Shield.   Really clever. Nicely done.  I build a little differently, though:  4: Amplified Healing if we have a healer, if not deadly strike if their team is especially squishy, Swift Reflexes otherwise. SR is nice, but Chen is unbelievably tanky as is, and chances are SR is going to proc during a shield.  13: Enough To Share - most enemies are smart enough to not attack Chen, so extending your shield to allies while you drink is quite valuable in a team fight.  16: Bolder Flavor - You can survive just about anything with this.  20: Hardened Shield - Makes you truly unkillable. I really just take this, though, because the other options aren't fantastic. Bolt of the Storm is redundant with Flying Kick, and the barrel is plenty strong as is. Kind of a lackluster level 20 for Chen.   Good for you. Never give up!   I agree, but I do really like that there are hybrid heroes like Tassadar, Sonya, Sylvanas, etc., so if there is a change made in this direction, I'd like it to be a small one.   This deck was great a couple of weeks ago, but now I can't win with it to save my life. It's just far too slow. Unless I draw early innervates and wild growths (which I mulligan for aggressively), by the time I have enough mana to play anything of value I'm instead spending my turn on healbots to prevent my inevitable demise. Even with the early mana cards, face hunters burn me down too quickly, and I often don't have a way to play around mirror entity. As mages and hunters make up 90% of play right now, those are two very big problems.  Suggestions?   What he said:  Despite what Republicans may want you to think, unrestricted free trade is not a Constitutional right.  Your response:  Republicans aren't out to wreck the country just because you don't agree with them on everything.  Quite a leap you took there.   As much as I'd like to see poor neglected Diablo get a 7th hero, Fenix would be my first choice as well. I think they could make a really interesting hero out of a zealot, Starcraft needs a warrior, and while they're certainly in better shape than Diablo, they could definitely use a little loving to help balance out Warcraft's dominance of the roster.  And Protoss are cool.   That would put it about 3 weeks away, which would really suck.   I really hope it's a Diablo or Starcraft hero, especially if it fills a role gap for those franchises (support and warrior respectively).   I really want to see Mephisto, Baal, Izzul, Malthael, or one of the other members of the Angiris Council.   Making him slightly weaker than the Hearthstone version.    Get your shit together republicans.  FTFY   Is this a quote from something awesome?   Write an op ed.    Did it eat the freezing trap?   Are you under the impression that people can't get weed now?  Let see how the younger generation is effected, as teens become more frequent users.  Many kids choose pot because it's easier to get than beer. I'd be amazed if actually regulating marijuana, instead of effectively ignoring it, doesn't decrease teen use.   Instructions unclear. Punched friend in genitals. Did not hurt.   Constance Justice   Tyrael. Total bad ass and bully. If only he had a trait.    My favorites are Master Tyrael (both white, which I run, and black), and the green Hellscream Thrall.    Black master Tyrael is great, but I like the white one better. Fits his character better, and as a tank I want to have a big, bright presence.    It's gotten a lot worse lately, too. Never used to be much of a problem but now I see it somewhat frequently. I wonder if I've just dropped in MMR to a place where these immature players are more frequently seen.    Suggestion: buy a hero.   Or the state could just stop murdering people. That sounds like a pretty good plan.   And how will we deal with all of the glaciers!?   Majordomo, a legendary so bad that you're better off giving him to your opponent.   "These games wouldn't be as good if it wasn't for the opponent across from me".  Classy guy. Wins handily, but he's still gracious enough to compliment his opponent. That's the demeanor of a true champion.   "Even though some might say this is just a teenage prank, who knows what this teenager might have done," Nocco said.  Based on that logic, you could charge somebody with murder for picking up a knife. "Who knows how many people he might have stabbed!"   There are a number of issues with it, but the primary one, at least as far as I'm concerned, is that it actually makes you *more likely* to die, as it's factored into his kit's balance. In other words, if it didn't exist, they would have to buff him in some other way to keep him balanced. The more they buff his death, the weaker he is while alive, and thus, less likely to remain so.   Cool concept, but having faced him in Hearthstone, I don't know that I could take that much of the voice actor.   Tyrael just needs a better trait and he'd be fine. He's really fun, and very effective, but his trait pretty much doesn't exist.  A minor stat buff might not be untoward, either, as his stats are very low across the board, but the trait is the bigger issue.   Do we think this is for real?  I, for one, would love to see faster hero releases. One of the best things about this game is the variety of the heroes and their playstyles, and I can't wait to get my hands on more.   Tyrael is a full tank, he is designed to soak damage, not die.  I main Tyrael, and I build him very tanky, but I disagree with this. I think he does a better job initiating and bullying than soaking damage. He's not squishy by any means, but I would consider him an off-tank, not a full tank.  I think that would change if he had a worthwhile trait that contributed to his survivability, though.   The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him *more likely* to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion.   Disrupting the enemy's positioning momentarily is *very* little recompense for losing your tank.   The problem is that death traits suck. They're basically a small reward for being bad, and they do absolutely nothing for you while you're alive.  You could buff his trait to oblivion and it would still suck.   Agreed. His trait is practically non-existent. It does nothing while he's alive, and hardly anything when he dies as it's both easily avoided, it's almost never enough damage to get a kill, and even if you do get a kill, your team is now missing a tank.  The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him more likely to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion.  It'd be much better if he had something that helped *avoid* his death, rather than making his death slightly inconvenient for the enemy team.  Here's my idea:   **Archangel's Watch**    Every time a hero deals damage to Tyrael, that hero gains a stack of guilt which decreases damage done to Tyrael by 0.5% per stack. Upon reaching a maximum of 10 stacks, the hero is deemed guilty and one of Tyrael's wings reaches out and grasps the hero. Guilty heroes are always revealed and have an additional 5% of the damage they deal to Tyrael reflected back at them.    If a hero leaves Tyrael's area of influence, all of that hero's guilt is forgiven, and if Tyrael or any of his enemy heroes dies, all enemy guilt is forgiven.  This gives Tyrael some additional survivability (after a while he's taking up to 10% less damage from heroes focusing him), and it's very thematic. You shall pay for your sins, but an enemy's sacrifice can absolve you of your guilt. And Tyrael does use his wings when he fights, because he's a bad ass.   Thanks!   Good advice. I almost didn't ask for this reason, though I'm still curious.   How can you see their rank if they talk?   Welcome! Glad you're having fun :)   It could even be a boat!   If they bring the cast back together and make the show snappy once more, then I'm excited. Season 4 was just a terrible, confusing, poorly paced, unfunny mess, and if it's more of that, then I'm not even going to bother watching.   What's wrong with that song?   This is huge. I was really disappointed when they removed the AWD option from the 60. Not that I could afford $70k, let alone $75k, but it's nice to know that if I could, that I again would.   Agreed. The Kerrigan text is on screen for literally less than 2 seconds.  I would pull this down and put some more time into it.   Why Overload? I get your point about not being able to take advantage of Conjurer's Pursuit, but what does the extra range get you that's worth losing the mana that comes from Psi-Infusion?   This is why I'm really glad that there's no surrender option. I've been down like this and come back. I know it's rare, but I'm glad that I always have the option to try.   Life finds a way.   Do you keep inane amounts if glitter on hand for such an occurrence? Or would you have to go (hopefully) buy some?   Diversity is healthy for the party. Also, I consider myself a liberal, not a democrat.   What does "Basalisk" refer to in this instance? Is that the name given to the theoretical killer robot?   Bad form.   It is awkward, but play him enough and you'll get surgical with positioning it. It's a feel thing, and it comes in time.  And yeah, I generally ignore the speed boost. It's nice, and on some occasions I factor it in, like if I'm not in any danger but an ally is, I'll use it along with my Q and W to help them escape. But largely I just use it for the damage.   [Can confirm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpW5vAnRI88)  Also comes in [Tyrael, Brightwing, Thrall triple ult flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeIU7F2yYfw feature=youtu.be)   Brilliant!   That's a lot of arson.    When did Samuel L. Jackson say this?    Tesla.  You're speaking my language...   Preferably under $1,000, but as long as it's in that ballpark I can manage it.  How is the 800 on getting dishes clean and fitting things inside? And do you know anything of its efficiency?   Filters... riiiiight.... I'll look into that.  I'll also look into if I have hard water.  Thanks for the suggestions!   Some people, pros even, won't play ~~No-Limit~~Hearthstone. They can't handle the swings.   Does that make the older dog in the first picture Jorah?   When I went to WWDTM a couple weeks ago (with Richard Price), I had *so* much fun  You snuck the body of [an 18th century Welsh moral philosopher and nonconformist peacher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price) into a taping of WWDTM?  Impressive.   Agreed. I've come back from some pretty staggering deficits, as well as been on the other end of that stick. The fact that you can be way down, but win a crucial team fight that positions you for the win means that every single fight matters.  One of my favorite things about this game is that it's not over until it's truly over. Players that understand this will have an edge over those that don't, and that's a good thing.   Cool!!! Eventually! Someday. Maybe...   Awesome! Thanks for posting this.  All republicans? Or did some democrats vote for it, too?   That's real?   All I've heard so far is [not midnight](https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/583444231374536705).   [You face Jaraxus and you face Jaraxus and you face Jaraxus and EVERYBODY FACES JARAXUS!](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/809/oprah-free-car.gif)   Goblins vs Pirates vs Gnomes vs Ninjas vs Pirates again vs Trump vs more Gnomes vs Pirates    and can't make it past rank 20 because "everybody else has so many legendaries."  I hate that so much. Legendaries do not win games. Good players win games.    Finally, Motorola has yet to release Lollipop for the 2013 version. At least for the US AT T version. I know that they mentioned having problems with the chipset, but if fast updates where part of the phones promotion, and it's been this long and we still don't have the latest update, then it's going to make me not want to do business with that company in the future.  This is the big dissuading factor for me, as well. It took 2 months to get 4.4.4, too, and we never even got 4.4.3.   Hence the fact checking...   The question is, what *did* I do?   Good idea, but that didn't have any impact.  Thanks for the suggestion.   [Theory one](https://www.screenused.com/images/mib2/DVD_VIDEO-51.jpg)  [Theory two](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Zed_0.jpg)  [Theory three](http://www.impulsegamer.com/dvd/legendoftheseeker03.jpg)  [Theory four](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/poohadventures/images/5/52/Lord_Zedd_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101111194604) (my favorite)   What is "this"?   Awesome!   I agree. Any time I've used Possession, I've thought wondered what picking up an extra minion per wave was really doing for me, considering how hard I could push lanes anyway.  More importantly, though, was during team fights, I was really wishing I had something that was useful in a team fight...  I like the charge idea a lot.   You mean because yesterday was 3/29? ;)   I don't know, I didn't go in a Burger King.   Thanks.   Glad to see both shaman cards are good. Almost as glad I was to see that both mage cards are weak.   He's probably referring to the arena where warrior is extremely weak.   How did you check your average game length? Time a few?   How does one keep game times down? Really fast decks and forfeiting a lot?   Pre-grats!  What's your secret? Incredible patience? Do you forfeit a lot to stay at lower ranks and get better opens?   'Cause of the metric system?   Quartermaster with cheese?   Great site. Just need something to deal with the trolls. Auto-hide functionality based on downvotes is probably ideal, but in the meantime you might want to delete some of the more egregious ones.  Also the ability to un-vote would be nice. So clicking downvote twice would bring you back to having not-voted, like reddit does.  Thanks for the effort!   How can you see the ranks of your teammates?   Though probably not the one he intended to make :P.   Great idea. That works be super cool.   I love the interactions between the heroes. I wish their were more of them.    For #2, I generally find the reverse to be true. The more pushed our lanes are, the farther we are from our towers. That's why I try not to push without a good reason (e.g. upcoming objectives).   Is my thinking flawed?   Around $80USD.    How did you play it? Straight push? Run from fights and ignore objectives?   It's not correct, but it's accepted. "He" and "she" are singular, "their" is plural.  Many of us use "their", though, because "he or she" is very cumbersome, and there just isn't a better alternative (yet).   Done. Thanks for the suggestion.   My first thought as well. The immortal's shield doesn't proc on lethal damage, but I think it's close enough.   Who said anything about the immortal being Fenix?   If it's early September it will only come out approximately 2 years before the 2013 gets 5.0.2.  I wonder if the Moto X 2019 will be released before we get 5.1.  Bitter.   Similarly, don't pee *into* the hot tub, either.   The music was depressing. Kind of killed it for me.   Makes sense. I'm just surprised that he uses it for fine work, too. That has to take some serious mastery.   Great tips! Would love to hear more.  Thanks for sharing!   Got it. Thanks.   Makes sense. Really I just want to know if 90 is low or high, and what that number being lower or higher means.   Poor Tyrael really needs some love.   Fantastic!  One suggestion: lose Title, Role, and Franchise. They don't really provide much (especially title), and they take up valuable horizontal real-estate.  Thanks for putting this together!   Before this current free hero rotation, I swear I hadn't seen him within my last 100 games. Not once, on either side.   Nice shot. That had to feel good.   Which episode is it from?   What is this referencing? Sunny?   And Ainsley gets to pee in Leo's closet?   I say pack token, and if we're going down that road anyway, also implement golden card tokens as arena (but not pack) prizes. These let you change a card of an appropriate rarity golden (e.g.an epic token can make a common, rare, and epic token).  	200

 I love that store. I always go there when I'm at the mall. I love cookies. Makes me happy to eat cookies.   Congratulations! Merry Christmas. Good luck with the new house.   I want mine to get pregnant too. It's also been difficult.   Wow I got all misty eyed. That's sad. I'm glad she was able to see you really enjoy your gift first though. Wow.   My wife experienced something similar around that age. Her and her younger sister both woke up around 3 or 4 am and cried because no presents. Their parents had been waiting for the kids to fall asleep and ended up falling asleep themselves. When the girls ran to their parents and were sobbing, they were convinced Santa was just late. After the girls went to bed, both the parents rushed to the hiding spot for the presents and rushed around wrapping them.   Same for me. Got married on Halloween.   It was 2004. I was walking with my brother "C", his girlfriend at the time "M" and her best friend at the time "B". I was about 16, C, M and B were all about 14/15. A beat up old blue/rusty car full of ghetto looking 30 something guys pulls up next to us, I was on the outside of the group closer to the road. I told everyone to go ahead, these guys looked aggressive. The guy in the passenger seat told me to move and let him get a better look at "her" gesturing at M. I told him fuck off and bring his old ugly car to the junk yard where it belonged. He pulls out a very large pistol and waves it sound and then aims it sideways at me threatening to shoot, the rest of the group had already made it to M's house. I ran and he fired one round and missed then they peeled out in a cloud of smoke. I told my dad about it immediately and we got into his big truck and chased them down. Dad shot at them and they ran off the road. Btw we lived out in a very rural area and the entire police department was friends of my dad. I never saw that little blue car again.  TL;DR: Perverted "gangstas" in old car tried to get to my brother's girlfriend and they ended up getting shot at.   Glass bottles full of habanero hot sauce. Bottle brakes and cuts the target. Hot sauce burns open wounds. Win!   I had a job as a correctional officer at the local state penitentiary. Loved going to work. I had two regular days off but I would have worked those too if they'd let me. I never took personal time off so it just kept accumulating. It paid pretty poorly for that field of work but I didn't care. I absolutely loved that job. I made a minor mistake in paperwork and was fired. It really sucked because that job had potential.    TL;DR: born, lived, expects to die one day.   Each episode is exactly one hour and four minutes apart. 11:00, 12:04, 1:08 etc. This is only relevant for the episodes I scrolled through. I'm certain it's relevant to at least the 7th or 8th episode.   Another one: breaking bad and Malcolm in the middle.   Scrubs and Ground Floor. I know scrubs is over but a guy can dream, can't he?   Christmas isn't Christmas without a real Christmas tree because of the smell. I don't care for the artificial crap either. There has never been a more Christmas smell for me.   I've tried this twice and the first one it did not guess after asking 60 questions. The first was Greg from Hay Day. It guessed Johnny bravo   I hate mountain dew. That crap is horrible.   Not do the stupid shit that caused me to lose my job. I probably would have continued to pay off my debt with my dad. Oh the good ole fantasies of paying off debt.   "Wait... if this is Mr. Goldman, then why does he still have his foreskin? Then he's not the Jew. Damn he almost lost his left nut."   Most of the stuff I read on this thread doesn't bother me but when I got to the sleep paralysis thing, I say nay nay. I suffer it enough on my own along with some PTSD sleep dysfunctions. I don't need any help making it worse. Goodbye to this thread.   Just realized most everyone here is mentioning age. I'm 25 btw.   Avoiding the lava floor by hopping from couch cushion to couch cushion.   We must be related...   Commercials: Not ALL commercials, just some. If your product is actually worth anything, if it does what it should, great. Advertise the Hell out of it. I could rant about poorly advertised products all week. I'll list an example or two but there are many commercial styles that bug me. Amazon kindle paper white. The commercial where everyone is using it and one person compares the brightness of it to the brightness of the iPad (whichever version). I'm not a fan of Apple products but I can't stand complete and total lying in advertisements. They show both tablets screens and the iPad screen is really dim and the kindle screen is really bright. Words pop up near the iPad the read something to the effect of "The iPad is on". They are insulting the intelligence of the potential consumer. As though we wouldn't realize the iPad's brightness setting is all the way down. The kindle is a great product and can hold its own, in the market. No need to blatantly insult my intelligence and lie about the competition's product. If I had to choose one of the two products I'd go for the kindle if they hadn't produced that commercial. Now I would choose neither because I still don't care for Apple. Now example 2: The wax vac commercial. This style commercial is moronic in its own way. Sticking a q tip in one's ear canal might hurt a bit but I've never experienced or witnessed someone experience pain enough to cause me or anyone else to scream as loudly as he had. "OUCH!" really? Tone it down a bit. If your product is as great as you say, don't make alternate methods look terrible, just make it known your product is better. Be factual about your product vs the other one. Like the viewers have never used a Q Tip.- I'll end this here.   Or: keep running all the way. Stay in the Army, you miss it like crazy. You'll regret ruining that opportunity. Everyday, wasted on regret. Every moment, hating yourself. If you stay college is still in your future.   Don't get involved with her, just stay in college. Avoid serious relationships until you graduate and find an appropriate career. This way you won't end up unable to be qualified for federal student aid until you pay off that fucking Sallie Mae loan. Then you won't be broke and on Reddit because you have nothing better to entertain yourself with. Also, you won't end up owing your dad and step mom 3 grand and they don't show up at your wedding because you owe them money.... got off track a bit but y'all get the point.   I used to stripe parking lots and parking garages in New Orleans. I took home $200 a day (18 hours a day minimum). Katrina hit and bam! I'm here in north Mississippi.   I don't know how others feel about him, but uncle grandpa. I hate the idea of this show.   Taylor swift... she's fictional right? I mean there couldn't truly be such a talentless dumbass, could there?   Laughed...too...much   No network connection. Or some form of "Reddit is experiencing heavy traffic. Please try again at a later time."- I've paraphrased.   Let's try my name. John, who's the lucky hooker? Hur dur. John, you should be in the bathroom so I can take a shit. Real funny people, after about 25 years, it gets old.   I guess I'll hop on the greetings train. Greetings from Cleveland, Mississippi, United states.    The season after season 8 of Scrubs. They call it season 9, I call it a pitiful excuse for a sad attempt at a spin off.   Would be funnier to do this to the cable/satellite set top boxes because then they'd have to boot up.   I've got a better one than my last. I'd be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile. Drive like 50 mph over the limit and when a cop pulls me over, just sit completely still and quiet. When he goes to his car to call for backup just climb to the back seat and lay in the floor incase he comes back and tries to reach in the driver's seat. When backup arrives, if they open the doors to search, just slowly climb out of the vehicle like nothing's going on. FUCK THE POLICE!    Gotta love hooch.   Or switch items out like Pillsbury biscuits for store brand or vice versa. Margarine for butter. 2% for whole or skim. Splenda for regular sugar. Tea for coffee. Etc.   I'd hold a hundred dollar bill down on the sidewalk and move it when someone reached for it. Like really far and fast. If they got it, they could keep it.    Yo momma so fat she walked past my tv when I started a Lord of the rings trilogy and missed all of it..... twice   I'm a guy and I can do that. It's all about memory. I remember numbers very well but I suck at math.   I have this same problem. It really brings me down because I'm as harmful as a light breeze. You can't tell them anything like "I'm harmless don't worry about me" because it only makes things worse. They'll never know you're harmless. I'm a white guy and this is tough. I couldn't imagine being a black guy built the way I am, I'm sure that'd be harder what with the way society had deemed black guys as bad news.   A supreme pizza topped with another supreme pizza but the second one is topping side down.   Drinking rum does it for me.   It may not interest you, but my wife carries a diaper bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag. We don't have any kids. Lis of pockets of various sizes. She loves it.   I have three brothers. In order of males, it's me, Chris , Paul, then Brian. As the oldest male, I always expected certain things. Like I figured when the time came, my dad would teach me to drive a car with a manual transmission, but no he only taught Chris. There have been other things in life such as this which have caused me to resent Chris but this one caused me the most because it's one of those father son bonding things. I'm also named after my father which one might think there'd be a stronger connection with father and son, but no. So in response to the original question, driving a manual transmission personal vehicle.   I just want cellphone signal bars with a triangle next to them. (Roaming symbol) and the words "the after life".    Shoplifting and torrenting. I've got about 20TBs of torrented data most of which I seeded to a 20+ seed ratio (good guy torrenter). I have about $1800 in merchandise from various stores in my house. Things included are countertop appliances, such as juicers, electric skillet, steamer, etc. Blu-ray player, a stack of Blu-ray discs and dvds. 20 1 TB  hdd. I'll stop right here. Let it be known I've stopped and don't plan on continuing the shoplifting. It's boring.   Go to sonic drive in. Order the bacon double cheese burger (number 3 here) add bbq sauce chilli and slaw. I order without mayo because I don't like mayo. This burger is the messiest burger I've ever sunk my teeth into and so very tasty. I'm slobbering on my pillow thinking about it.   This entire town. Fuck the not hiring my broke ass. Fuck their not having a movie theater, or decent mall. Fuck off Cleveland, MS. Fuck off Bolivar county. Fuck off 38732.    Raviolis and a nap. (Not exactly healthy but....) I'm Starvin'! Anyone?   A Pok'edex for people.(I can't do the accented "e" on my phone's keyboard).   To a fat trainee: "a few less donuts and a few more laps and your tubby ass wouldn't be running in the back of formation, would you Grimace?" The DS called the fat trainee Grimace like the purple thing on the old school McDonald's commercials.   When people blow their noses or similar things at a restaurant instead of going to the restroom. It makes me cringe.   A thousand upvotes to you.  	54
 Immediately after the announcement, I tried to feel sad that I didn't win. And I tried. But I couldn't feel sad. There was no reason to (aside from the lack of communication between the hosts and participants). I would have made Running Red anyway, I'd had the idea for a while, but this competition just gave me a reason not to procrastinate. It wasn't about winning. It was about making a good pack. And I feel I have done that. I've made a pack that sends a message, and is unique, which is something that rarely happens these days. I've accomplished my goal, and gone far above it. Running Red got listed, which is something I've only dreamed of. @PurpleMentat , who has always been one of my favorite Youtubers, did a series on my pack. Plus, I tied what is currently the most popular modpack. I consider that to be a huge achievement. I'm happy to have been part of this competition. It wasn't about winning. It was about sending a message. And you know what, I accomplished my goal.  Thank you for all that you've done, and congratulations to Parcel.   It (once I finish the story) will have a great impact if you choose to kill the cows and chickens.   I'll look into that   Forge version 1217   The biggest similarity is that is uses HQM.

You won, because you had a Mini-Me of Slowpoke101. Slowpoke said in the dream post that there was no other reason.  It was the worst nightmare ever.   You wish.   It's LOL.

Increase the slope by one degree and suddenly you have to walk.. it should gradually slow you down to a walking .. or slower.. speed.  I know some of you have experienced it, where you dont feel like the hill is that steep and suddenly you are walking. It feels wrong, because life doesnt work that way.                                                                                                                        It calls itself homeopathic but it has measurable natural ingredients. Not a fan of the homeopathic stuff. DO any of yall think this actually works?                                                                                                                        I miss space scifi but it would be really nice to see a good hard science scifi like Rama. you could have an entire season in the solar system. heck you could do an entire show in the solar system, with shows dealing with the politics between the colonies and then have a spin off show where rama leaves.  I see there was talk of a movie, but it doesnt look like there is anything firm.                                                                           annoying as crap when making posts here.. the title bar on the reddit submission form is thin and the hijacked text always seems to be scrolled beyong my view until i hit submit and then my title says "and read more at ....jerksite.com  yeah I have blocked tynt..

It seems to turn their heads for about 10 seconds before they remember they wanted to eat your brains.      with all the old school tips, i forgot how i used to love to play back when zeds were harder.. at night(not harder than today, harder than just recently.)  the new patch brought back zeds with a vengeance. It can be tough as hell to even loot anywhere during the day, especially bodies.. outside.. houses with one door and the like. At night it is still scary, they still knock ya down, but agro less besides night is more conducive to horror.              yeah I know it would either take a crap ton of work on the dayz  commander dude, or cooperation by every single mod crew to provide a common website summary page that dayz commander could easily scrape.

Thumbs up east bay   I'll be happy if he's Darren Sproles part 2   Are people stupid drunk in the draft?  Does it get kinda boring in between?     Concerned for your safety?  Oh so when officer Bologna's pepper sprayed those people b.c he was in danger.     its all about the chili cheese fries, and they're spicy chicken soft taco   If you choose not to attend the wedding, don't tell the fiance either.  My reasoning, is that you're choosing to cut him out of your life completely.  You're acknowledging that he is not your brother.  However by informing the fiance, you're now taking a step back into his life.  Furthermore you're potentially opening up old wounds.    If you're going to tell the fiance, send a letter, no return address so they don't know who it's from.  At least this way you're not getting caught up in the BS   If you're looking for re sale value, I wouldn't go with the studio.  Most young professionals come to NY for X number of years, and by the time they're wanting to settle down a studio is not what they have in mind.  If you can, go with a 1BR.    Jelly=Jealous..."I'm so Jelly!!"   Go to La Quinta Hotel on W 32nd st in K-Town.  Take the elevator to the top, you get an amazing view of the Empire Building plus great Korean food after you get blitzed.  Plus it's not a stuffy area like midtown/meatpacking.     Happy World Hemophilia Day!   Never underestimate the "power of the pussy."  Now this is not the same as putting the pussy on a pedestal, it means that in a blink of an eye a woman can get what she wants easily more than a man can.     Fish sauce, lemon/lime juice, ginger, brown sugar or honey, scallions, pepper.  Marinade on thin pork chops, grill or broil.     Just curious, did this happen in the bayarea a few years back?

Does "that" guy have a higher up he reports to and etc?  How deep does the food chain go?  Are you close to your source?        After reading this post, you made my Monday a bit more bearable.

Specifically I design medical education programs for patients with bleeding disorders.  My busiest times are in the summer, work comes in waves as well    Spam n Eggs, spam n rice   Exactly this.  I'd like to know the backstory to this.  Was there hardcore texts being passed back n forth?  Were they drunk as hell?  It was their first time hooking up, and they went dominant rough right from the start.  That's an open invitation right there.  I'm not saying what the guy did was right, but there's many variables that come into play here.     What kind of messages were said back and forth leading up to this?    Clearly this guy took it overboard and violated you, but if you showed signs of wanting to be dominated and taken, this goes both ways.  This was your first time hooking up, you're gonna be going 100 m.p.h with excitement and such.  You've got to pony up a little bit and think what drove this guy to lose it.  Was there booze involved, how many texts back and forth were there, nature of conversation, etc.  Cops are gonna be all over this asking you how you even allowed him to enter your house and hook up?  As much as you are the victim here, when the cops question you and the incident, you need to make sure everything adds up.  There is a huge grey area when it comes to this unfortunately.      Randy Moss..Oops already signed him!  For Defense, Mario Williams.  Our front line would J. Smith, A. Smith, and Williams.

Buy a 4 pack of Guinness, pour 2 cans into pot with beef along with some water and simmer for at least 4 hours.  For the cabbage, slice thinly. Saute with garlic and pepper, boil some balsamic vinegar and reduce till thick.  Drizzle over cabbage and drink the remaining 2 cans of Guinness.     the "warrant line" won't do shit when you're up against cops that want swift action/justice.  that's gonna provoke them even further.  as a minority that's been in similar situations, i've learned to keep my mouth shut and let them do their thing   drama queen    I think this happens over 50% after I blaze.

Worst mistake ever, basically acted like a immature bitch the entire time not wanting to do anything except sleep in the room.  Even worse, she forgot her makeup bag in my friends car, and refused to go to the wedding even though my friend was going to bring the bag on the day of the wedding.

It's Old School mentality.  Is it right?  Absolutely not, but the mom doesn't have alot of options. It's not like here in the states where there's support groups, organizations etc.  Sadly, psycho social support in Japan is not on top of the list.    And unless there is complete followthru, I actually disagree and she shouldn't inform the organization.  She's only staying for a year or two tops, it's a different dynamic she's witnessing than if she were there for 5 years.     A man is running home.

 I rarely remember my dreams but sometimes they are extremely vivid, sometimes not so vivid. I'm curious as to why that is.   Architecture: I don't give shit about physics, it's pretty.

 Yes. That was surprising but in an amazingly good way.   Toronto FC is actually doing extremely well this season...   As a Netherlands fan who is not Dutch, I cannot imagine what they are going through. As for me, six contractors have approached me requesting to use the bricks I have shat to build a new apartment complex. Stay strong Oranje!   I think the Dutch will finally get that star :)   I worry people will lose respect for Julio Cesar who is a fantastic goalie and really has been Toronto FC's saving grace this season.   Thanks for the advice, I'll have a look :)   Try C and Am :)   It helps to just look up the guitar chords and play around with those. Most of the time you only need to make minor changes to make it sound good on a uke. Good luck!   Alright that makes sense. Good luck :)  	9

Nancy Buffone, the universitys executive director of external relations and university events, said the university was in planning mode.  Were expecting a visit in the fall, thats all I can say right now, Buffone said Thursday. Were in very intense planning.  The details of his appearance at UMass are still being worked out.  The Dalai Lama, Tibetans exiled spiritual leader, last came to the region on May 9, 2007, to speak at Smith College and receive an honorary doctorate from that institution.  He was welcomed that day by both Hampshire and Smith colleges. The Five Colleges run an exchange program with the Tibetan universities in exile in India. The Dalai Lama also spoke privately with members of the Tibetan Association of Western Massachusetts.  With a good education, facilities and warm-heartedness, a person becomes fuller and, I think, better equipped to face problems, he said to a group of thousands at Smith. Education gives us guidance, and warm-heartedness gives us the proper use of all our knowledge.  Constance Kassor, a lecturer in the religion department at Smith and the current director of the Five College Tibetan Studies in India exchange program, said she is pleased the Dalai Lama will likely return to the Valley.  Its a really exciting opportunity, especially for our students, Kassor said Thursday.  Some students who have participated in the exchange program have gotten to meet the Dalai Lama and have a private audience with him, Kassor said.  Anna Lee White, a senior at Mount Holyoke College, participated in the program in January 2013. During her stay in northern India, the Dalai Lama visited the university for a week to give public teachings, she said.  It was incredible to attend these teachings along with thousands of Tibetans, White wrote in an email to the Gazette.  During her groups private meeting with the Dalai Lama, White remembers how many groups were waiting to see him, but how calm, friendly and curious he was with everyone he spoke with.  The group before them were all blind Indian children, and he gave each of them a hug before saying goodbye, White wrote.  I remember him telling all of us that he hopes that someday we would have the chance to travel to Tibet and continue learning about Buddhism and see what it is like there ourselves, she wrote.  The experience led her to return to India the following year for a semester and she will be studying Hindi in India next year after graduating in May.  She will miss the Dalai Lamas visit, but hopes to hear about it from her sister, who attends Amherst College, she said.  Elena Read, a senior at Smith, also participated in the exchange program in 2013.  She said the Dalai Lamas teaching sessions stuck with her more than the private visit with him.  Much of the teaching focused on death, and living with the awareness that one day each person will die, she said.  The only certainty in life is that it comes to an end, Read said. And so to kind of not waste time, I think that stuck with me pretty strongly.  Tibetans believe that the Dalai Lama is the reincarnated being of the Buddhist patron saint of Tibet, known as the Bodhisattva of Compassion, according to the Dalai Lamas website. Bodhisattvas are beings who have chosen to become reincarnated rather than achieve nirvana so that they can serve humanity, according to the website.  Born on July 6, 1935, in northeastern Tibet, the Dalai Lama began education as a Buddhist monk at age 6.  In 1950, the Dalai Lama was called upon to lead Tibet in the face of a Chinese invasion. He went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders 1954, but was forced into exile in 1959 and has lived in Dharamsala in northern India ever since.  The Dalai Lama has spoken to the United Nations and governments of the United States and Europe, seeking for Tibet the status of an independent nation and a place of peace. He has advocated for non-violence.  He has traveled to nearly 70 countries on six continents and received more than 150 awards including, in 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize. He has also written or co-written more than 100 books.  While the Dalai Lama continues to be the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, he is no longer the political leader, having transferred that authority to a democratically elected leader in 2011.

Remember each speaker is invited by the voters of that graduating class, speaks to the quality of the class vote         of course this is how it starts.  Look up James Corbett's "How to fake an Alien Invasion"      It pisses me off when my grandson's teacher talks about her church in class, but there's really nothing I can do about it.  As long as she's not preaching or praying, that is.   For about 15 years, my wife and I donated $500 to the western Mass food bank, so whenever I would see homeless people on the street, I'd convince myself that I'd already done my part.  While I still think donating to the food bank is a good thing, I've changed my thoughts on what to do when I encounter someone on the street.  I now give them whatever cash and loose change I have in my pockets.  Sometimes it's only a couple bucks, sometimes it's a few hundred.  I'm always going to be better off than them, so why not share what I have?  Honestly I don't care where the money goes, and I'm done with judging people on the choices they've made in their lives.   I work in an ER.  We see a few of these "cases" a couple times a year.  All of the patients have a history of heroin use.      Unfortunately, it's not.  I can't post there   OP how do you have so much time to devote to posts like this?  I mean, who the FUCK CARES?   Fuckers should donate that money to their own people north of the border.

It's just a shame they didn't dig deeper, into the murders and other conspiracies      Thanks for posting that.  I watched the first 30 minutes of it before turning it off.  As I said earlier, none of this is new.     I've heard it's not very good, that the book is better and that there's nothing new revealed about the church that isn't already online   No thanks, NSA   Let us know how it goes.  I'm not really interested   There are a lot of cool places where poetry is often part of the "scene" for example the Thirsty Mind coffee house in South Hadley      Well an RSS reader like Google Reader is what I'm looking for.  Something that I can share to and can be shared/discussed   it's an aggragator, no more no less.  You have to be able to read between the lines.  There are very few journalists/researchers I trust.  James Corbett is one of them.  His agenda seems to be fairly open, although I did wonder at the fact that he took a very long time to open up about his personal history/timeline.        You posted this in Northampton too right?  As I said over there, there's not much to do in Amherst except you do have the Fretted Instrument Workshop here which is pretty great.  If you're a hiker you'll want to check out the Metacomet Monadnock trail which is nearby, also the Robert Frost Trails.  Speaking of Frost, there's a museum for him at Amherst College  And if you're really into writers, how about the Emily Dickinson museum on Main St?   Has nothing to do with belief.     I've been watching episodes of "the Wire"...sheeit   I think the bulb show is still going on at Smith College greenhouse.  Worth checking out.  Thornes Market is fun.  We take our grandkids there.  Just walk up one side of Main St and down the other.  There're lots of cool shops to check out.    Head over to Downtown Sounds on Pleasant St and check out the instruments for sale there.  If you're into music, Turn It Up has used CD, also on Pleasant St.    A2Z is a hobby/toy store on King St if you have kids that's a fun place to visit.   A couple nice galleries in Noho.  Amherst doesn't have much to see for tourists.  There are a couple book stores, but the selection isn't great.  I guess the thing I like about Amherst most is the Fretted Instrument Workshop, a great music store with guitars and mandolins and banjos.     Why?  A boat on the water?  An over exposed/filtered picture of trees and water?  I'm confused.   Nor can you, Mr Panetta   The Birds, The Birds!  Like something out of a Hitchcock movie   she's ugly.  WTF.

By spending every penny they have!  I worked for the city of Boston in the 1970s.  You could tell a government worker because they would push all of the paper, delay as long as it was legally possible and "hide" whenever they could.  Government workers take the maximum # of breaks that exist, take all of their vacation, and sick time, and know every loophole that exists to keep from helping you or doing their job!  So I'm not surprised to read your story, and I'm positive there's no conspiracy here   It won't affect me much as I rarely read MSM anyway   The biggest problem with Voat is you can't vote!

That's what I love most about Asian models...eyes, cheekbones, etc.   don't be that guy!   Fake tits and eye surgery = White American.  Not interested      I don't think there's a conspiracy here...Sure it makes sense to put your rant in /r/conspiracy because there are fewer rules here than the rest of Reddit and the mods are generally great guys.  There's a shitload more "democracy" in this subreddit than the rest of the site!  But what I'm saying is, this is just one of the swings of the site...it's going way to the right now and will probably go this way for a couple more years before it swings back the other way.  I should know, I was here when it first started...I learned about it from a FARK link for chrissakes, back when Mike Arrington had just started Techcrunch as a blog...do you guys remember when there was a forum on that site?  With conversations about startups and great new social media sites.  Those were the days!  Reddit used to be this tiny FARK imitation site where you could vote, share and discuss any fucking thing you wanted without moderation, kinda like 4chan, but with a better setup.  I guess some of us are waiting for the next thing, but for right now, we got /r/conspiracy and that's good enough for most of us :)   Are you saying Aaron Schwartz was killed by reddit?      hitomi furuya   It's an obvious and poorly done photoshop.

The Slaves That Time Forgot  John Martin Global Research May 29, 2012  They came as slaves; vast human cargo transported on tall British ships bound for the Americas. They were shipped by the hundreds of thousands and included men, women, and even the youngest of children.  Whenever they rebelled or even disobeyed an order, they were punished in the harshest ways. Slave owners would hang their human property by their hands and set their hands or feet on fire as one form of punishment. They were burned alive and had their heads placed on pikes in the marketplace as a warning to other captives.  We dont really need to go through all of the gory details, do we? After all, we know all too well the atrocities of the African slave trade. But, are we talking about African slavery? King James II and Charles I led a continued effort to enslave the Irish. Britains famed Oliver Cromwell furthered this practice of dehumanizing ones next door neighbor.  The Irish slave trade began when James II sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World. His Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.  Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.  From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Irelands population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britains solution was to auction them off as well.  During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.  Many people today will avoid calling the Irish slaves what they truly were: Slaves. Theyll come up with terms like Indentured Servants to describe what occurred to the Irish. However, in most cases from the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish slaves were nothing more than human cattle.  As an example, the African slave trade was just beginning during this same period. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase, were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts.  African slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling). Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling). If a planter whipped or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime. A death was a monetary setback, but far cheaper than killing a more expensive African. The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit. Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the masters free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master. Thus, Irish moms, even with this new found emancipation, would seldom abandon their kids and would remain in servitude.  In time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new mulatto slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed forbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale. In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.  England continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew would have plenty of food to eat.  There is little question that the Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much (if not more in the 17th Century) as the Africans did. There is, also, very little question that those brown, tanned faces you witness in your travels to the West Indies are very likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. In 1839, Britain finally decided on its own to end its participation in Satans highway to hell and stopped transporting slaves. While their decision did not stop pirates from doing what they desired, the new law slowly concluded THIS chapter of nightmarish Irish misery.  But, if anyone, black or white, believes that slavery was only an African experience, then theyve got it completely wrong.  Irish slavery is a subject worth remembering, not erasing from our memories.  But, where are our public (and PRIVATE) schools???? Where are the history books? Why is it so seldom discussed?  Do the memories of hundreds of thousands of Irish victims merit more than a mention from an unknown writer?  Or is their story to be one that their English pirates intended: To (unlike the African book) have the Irish story utterly and completely disappear as if it never happened.  None of the Irish victims ever made it back to their homeland to describe their ordeal. These are the lost slaves; the ones that time and biased history books conveniently forgot.

"Ma'am, the vibrators are on the wall next to the fire extinguisher."      You look for fresh prints         Personally I feel like some of the things posted to /r/gaming that are labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers. They are not spoilers because they give away story, they are spoilers because they give away crucial gameplay elements that would have been fun to discover on my own. Now, if it was a movie, any talk about the movie before you have seen it is a spoiler because a movie is a linear thing, it goes from point A to point B and if you give up something in between that line it's a spoiler. A video game on the other hand, or any video game worth its salt, is a non-linear dynamic media that somebody interacts with. I get pleasure out of discovering things about a game, about the little nuances and side-routes. I make it a point to never read a walkthrough guide until after I have beaten the game by my own wits. For example, I saw a "Last of Us" post about how it is a survival horror game with no scare jumps. Well great, that takes away some of the suspense I might be feeling when I finally play it. Or, on a post I have made a while back I labeled as a "Minor Spoiler" because I told people the best way to kill a Cazador in New Vegas. But people complained, said that it wasn't a spoiler. But to me, it definitely was because when I found out how to do that on my own a whole new world of gameplay elements opened up to me in New Vegas. So...I leave it to you...should we modify the spoiler policy or am I just bitching to the wind?  TL;DR I think that certain things labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers because they give away gameplay elements.                                                                  	130
 I read in a book once about an idea for a machine that could take your brain out of your body and fit both it and your body with transceivers so you'd keep functioning as your brain communicated with your body.   So your body is outside the glass container holding your brain, and you think, "Here I am looking at my brain. Wow." Then you realize, "Wait, shouldn't I be thinking 'Here I am with my body looking at me'?"  I think the book was by Raymond Smullyan.   I did that one all the time when I was a kid and had never heard of yoga; can barely do it at all now, and only for a couple of seconds.   Maybe because they're dressing for their own comfort instead of your gratification?    Some people consider that capability in the language a bug. I say it's a feature.   The nice thing about English is how adaptable it is. In the informal register that permeates Reddit post headlines, "AM" meaning "morning" is perfectly legit and easily understood.

My friend Jason always looks puzzled when I call him July-to-November.   Your order should be ready next week.   Not to mention, some people who like both X and Y only have the money or skill to make one costume, and if it's for X they'll still wear it to Y-Con, and more power to 'em.

Owning a plane means you don't spend hours in departure lounges every time you travel for business, or have to take an inefficient route through a commercial hub. When your job is basically to be in charge of billions of dollars, the time you save is more valuable than the cost of the plane.   The problem that this county wants to address isn't "some people are homeless," it's "some people are bad."

A lot of students work on campus, and a good number of them have probably joined the state employees union. I did when I worked there.

Of course most of my classes were in the northwest corner of campus, so I didn't have far to go anyway.  If you can walk to 29th and Lamar, the 338 bus goes to the HEB at Hancock Center. (It may be shorter to walk to 24th and Lamar from where you'll be.) Also the 21 bus goes from the campus area to the Fiesta Mart at 38th and I-35, which is also a short walk under the highway from that same HEB. And Wheatsville Co-op is on Guad at 31st; it's a bit pricey on most items, but you can get some basics there without spending too much.  EDIT: Also, The 338, the 3, and the 22 (the same as the 21 only going the other way) also go to or near Central Market on North Lamar, which is basically an upscale HEB.

In general, if the original increase was keeping pace with inflation, then it wasn't a *real* increase, only a *nominal* one -- it looked like it was going up, but it was only because the counting system in use was being degraded by inflation. It's confusing the measuring stick (dollars) with the thing it represents (purchasing power).  (This is not a comment on the policy in the OP, just on how these discussions often go in general.)   So it's a reduction relative to inflation, which does count.   Someone said economics is "quantitative psychology." Strewth.

    Thanks for letting me know the sentence. The sentence states:  Consistent with these observations, we demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of the PI3KCD isoform, but not other PI3K isoforms, was senolytic in preadipocytes.  The vast majority of drugs are not specific and have multiple targets. When researchers find a drug has an effect they want to know why/how it's working.  What they are referring to in this sentence is an experiment which they performed in cells in a dish (not an animal) to see what molecular target is causing the effect that they are seeing with the drug therapy. What they used was a small interfering RNA (siRNA). These can be made/designed by any researcher and are extremely specific to a target. Researchers look at the genome and find the nucleotide sequence for the protein of choice, find a unique nucleotide sequence in this sequence (so it's specific to the protein of choice), make this sequence which when put into a cell results in degradation of the mRNA of the protein of choice. This stops the protein being made and therefore is a way to stop it being made and used in the cell - this process is a really good tool for a researcher and figuring out the process resulted in Andrew Fire and Craig Mello getting the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006 only 8 or 9 years after they published their paper on the process (that's a REALLY short time from publishing to getting a nobel prize).    In this case, they are interested in PI3K, which is involved a range of processes including cell growth and cell death but specifically interested in the PI3KCD isoform which is known to help cancer cells resist cell death and therefore may help senescent cells survive. For the experiment they treated the cells (preadipocytes in this case) with the siRNA for PI3KCD and nothing else (i.e. no dasatanib or quercertin was used). They found that the siRNA had the same effect as the drug treatment suggesting that the drugs could be acting by inhibiting PI3KCD. They used siRNA for a lot of other proteins as well to find a few molecular proteins that act as senolytics. Identifying these proteins will help target future drug therapies and research directions.  In short, the drugs aren't attached to an RNA but a specially designed RNA was used to figure out how the drugs might be working. In theory you could use the siRNA as a drug but it would be unbelievably expensive. Hopefully that helps!   They gave the drugs orally to the mice so in theory delivery shouldn't be an issue. The first issue would be the dose of the drugs, quercertin shouldn't be an issue though it is quite a big dose. Dasatnib would be the issue with the dose they gave. It's used as a chemotherapy drug and is suggested to be used at 100mg/day in humans which some people cannot tolerate and there are number of side effects. They gave the mice 5mg/kg body weight, it's often assumed that the average guy weighs 70kg so that's 350mg - how well that could be tolerated remains to be seen. They did find that a one off treatment was sufficient which might make any side effects, which I guess would be pretty horrible, worth it in the long-term.   It's a proof of concept study really, that if you eliminate senescent cells then you can improve/maintain organ function for longer. I doubt this treatment would be used in a clinic in the future but it'll mean that more research is focused on this type of treatment which may lead to a better drug combination or technique in the future.   In the animal studies they used an oral garage which is basically a tube that delivers the drug directly to the stomach. Dasatanib was at a concentration of 5mg/kg and quercertin at 50mg/kg body weight, most likely they were dissolved in water but it might have been with a different solvent. That info is from page 8 of the paper.  There's no need to bind it RNA which I can't see making any difference unless it prevents it from degradation, if you let me know where it says that then I'll have a look as I skimmed through the paper to find the dosing info.     You seem to know what you're talking about! I'm a bit swamped at the moment, I'll try and get back later but this review might help you:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849637/  In a nutshell, it's too simplistic to just look at ATP requirements as I was trying to point out in point 1 of my last reply. So in terms of ATP being needed for synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids, that's true but so are carbon chains, ribose etc. which come from glucose. So are other metabolites from glycolysis (NADH, NADP etc) and you still get ATP (albeit lower levels). The increase in glycolytic flux and glycolytic capacity (i.e. glucose uptake proteins and enzymes) means that in some instances the total ATP generating capacity from glycolysis is higher than that from the mitochondria - so even though it's less efficient more ATP can be generated.  The other point to take into consideration which you allude to with "I don't see how a hypoxic tissue can continue to proliferate for long." is that this isn't a "perfect" metabolism shift that overcomes hypoxia. Cancer cells do die and become necrotic and they aren't immune to excessive levels of lactate accumulation or hypoxia. They are better able to cope with the harsh environment and the stresses placed on the cells further ramps up their metabolism and anti-apoptotic abilities, "super-charging" them even more - in essence the harsh environment induces a selection process for cells that are more glycolytic, more resistant to cell death which seem to promote metastasis and more aggressive tumors.   It should also be noted that not all cancer cells show this preference for glycolysis/Warburg Effect and there is a broad spectrum in cancer metabolic phenotype just to make it more complicated!  In terms of the mechanism of this treatment in causing cancer cell death/longer survival it's not actually due to changing cancer cell metabolism or ROS production. They showed that using a potent antioxidant, which would inhibit ROS production, had no effect on tumor survival. Instead it's due to activation of the immune system, as deletion of immune cells prevent the positive effect of hyperoxia and that the treatment causes an increase in the relevant immune cells (T and NK cells). In hypoxic environments cells release adenosine which dampens the immune system and consequent removal of cancer cells. The first post covers this in more detail.   Fermentation does yield less ATP/energy compared to aerobic respiration (2 ATP vs 36 ATP) but cellular function is more than generating ATP.   1. For cell proliferation, glycolysis is actually more effective because it generates other intermediates, acetly-CoA for fatty acids, glycolytic intermediates for non-essential amino acids and ribose for nucleotides with the latter 2 only available from glucose/sugars. This is actually put to use when cells are grown in a dish, most nutrient medias contain high levels of glucose and glutamine which increase cell proliferation rates in both normal and cancer cells compared to media that favors oxidative phosphorylation - this is one reason why in vitro drug screens are pretty crap because the cells don't rely upon aerobic respiration and drugs that are toxic to mitochondria are only found when used in an animal (the Crabtree Effect).  2. ATP inhibits phosphofructokinase, the rate-limiting step of glycolysis so aerobic respiration would decrease glycolysis, due to high ATP production,which is required for maximal/optimal cell proliferation as explained in 1.  3. If the niche/environment is hypoxic then using glycolysis allows cell proliferation to continue which is better than waiting for vascularization. Having more cells will also increase the signal for vascularisation so it is likely to occur faster than by waiting for it to happen. Once vascularized and oxygen is more abundant the lactate can then be used as an aerobic fuel source by the cancer cells (cancer cells are still capable of aerobic respiration). Also lactate induces acidosis which limits healthy tissue growth and favours cancer cell growth (they are more resistant to the negative effeccts of high lactate).  4. A lot of the genetic mutations that cause cancer (e.g. PTEN, mTOR, LKB1) result in activation of glycolytic pathways and activation of a protein called PKB/Akt which increases the glycolytic enzymes but also increases proteins that reduce apoptosis/promote survival.   5. Aerobic respiration also induces reactive oxygen species to which cancer cells are more sensitive to than healthy cells.  6. Aerobic respiration is used/found more in a differentiated tissue than in single proliferating cells which is what cancer cells are. This is because DNA replication and cell membrane synthesis are required at much lower levels than during cell proliferation. The advantages of aerobic respiration can then be utilized  Hopefully I stayed on track with the answer! Although it seems counter-intuitive it does kinda make sense!   This is a summary and link of the paper (it's open access):  Summary The healthspan of mice is enhanced by killing senescent cells using a transgenic suicide gene. Achieving the same using small molecules would have a tremendous impact on quality of life and burden of age-related chronic diseases. Here, we describe the rationale for identification and validation of a new class of drugs termed senolytics, which selectively kill senescent cells. By transcript analysis, we discovered increased expression of pro-survival networks in senescent cells, consistent with their established resistance to apoptosis. Using siRNA to silence expression of key nodes of this network, including ephrins (EFNB1 or 3), PI3K, p21, BCL-xL, or plasminogen activated inhibitor-2, killed senescent cells, but not proliferating or quiescent, differentiated cells. Drugs targeting these factors selectively killed senescent cells. Dasatinib eliminated senescent human fat cell progenitors, while quercetin was more effective against senescent human endothelial cells and mouse BM-MSCs. The combination of dasatinib and quercetin was effective in eliminating senescent MEFs. In vivo, this combination reduced senescent cell burden in chronologically aged, radiation-exposed, and progeroid Ercc1-/ mice. In old mice, cardiac function and carotid vascular reactivity were improved 5 days after a single dose. Following irradiation of one limb in mice, a single dose led to improved exercise capacity for at least 7 months following drug treatment. Periodic drug administration extended healthspan in Ercc1-/ mice, delaying age-related symptoms and pathology, osteoporosis and loss of intervertebral disc proteoglycans. These results demonstrate the feasibility of selectively ablating senescent cells and the efficacy of senolytics for alleviating symptoms of frailty and extending healthspan.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12344/abstract      Hypoxia may actually drive tumours to be more aggressive and promote metastasis. The lack of oxygen converts their metabolism to be glycoyltic (which allows them to better survive without vascularization), upregulates anti-apoptotic genes/proteins, promotes release of factors (i.e. VEGF and PDGF etc.) that promote blood vessel growth into the tumour and may help keep the cells in an undifferentiated state, which in turns helps to keep them proliferating.   There's a review here that shows providing oxygen doesn't seem to stimulate tumour growth and talks about the role of hypoxia in tumour progression and phenotype  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510426/  	9

I bet Marriot's going to learn this one the hard way....         Need a real regulator and the rest will follow    Want to make a difference in local government?  You want broadband included as a priority in your municipality?  If you live in a municipality that has any sort formal planning processes, you need to get it on the radar of your Planning Commission, and included in your Comprehensive or Master Plan.  The bad news is that if you live in a place where no formal planning takes place at all (e.g. all counties in Texas, as far as I know) you likely live in a place so red and "freedom loving" that the idea of "municipal" mostly doesn't exist.  Texas counties, for example, don't do any planning at all.  Many cities in Texas do plan, however.  Some even have massive budgets to do it with.  ------------  **tl;dr:**  1)  Form a local interest group with focus, goals, and consistency.  2)  SHOW UP.  Get noticed.  3)  Find out who the decision makers are in your municipality.  Find out what they do, what they are required to do, where they get their authority.  YOUR OVERALL GOAL:  Get municipal broadband included in your municipalitys Comprehensive Plan as a defined community goal.  ----------------  Step 1:  Form a *local* interest group.  Local is defined as people who live close enough together to meet time and again.  To get attention, your interest group doesn't have to be sane, rational or even right (half of regulars at your local Council/Commission meetings aren't).  I would recommend you be all three if you want to really be effective, though.  Your goal is not to lobby Washington D.C.; it is to lobby City Council Members/County Commissioners and Planning Commissioners.  You'll need:  -Leadership (not this "everybody-is-in-charge" OWS crap).   -Goals (not this "we-want-everything" OWS crap).    -Focus.  This goes along with Goals.  You must know what don't want, or are willing to give up (again, none of this "we-want-everything" OWS crap).  You are not Wage-Equality group.  You are not an Anti-Poverty group.  You are sure as hell not OWS or an offshoot.  You are the Municipal-Broadband Group.  This is what you are, this is who are.  You are an organization with clear, distinct goals and focus.  YOU ARE NOT OCCUPY WALL STREET.    -Committed membership.  Commitment equal that of the retired, pissed-off old people who show up angry and pissed off at every meeting.  Commitment equal to those oldsters who will be dismissing you, belittling you, ignoring you, and trying to push you aside so they can talk about what *really* matters (like a new subdivision ordinance to let them up-zone their land and sell it for massive profit, for example).  This is where Step 2 comes into play.  SHOW UP.   -Consistency.  You are nothing until every member of the City Council, every member of the Planning Commission, every County Commissioner, the Planning Director, the Public Works Director, and all of the Long-Range-tasked Planners in your muni know the names of every single one of your group's principles.  They should be on a first-name basis with you.  Until this happens, you don't matter.   Step 2:  SHOW UP.  Show up at meetings of your City Council/County Commissioners and show up at Planning Commission Meetings.  The only people who show up for these things regularly are the same 5-12 pissed-off old people, *every single time.*  This is because the meetings are boring, and no young person in their right mind wants to be there, not even me (If I'm there, it is because I am getting paid).  SHOW UP ANYWAY.  Your group should never let a meeting pass without at least one of your principles being present and accounted for.  Though I would recommend you come prepared to be all three; remember that you don't have to be have to be smart, informed, or even rational to get heard.  Half of the regulars there aren't, I guarantee it.  Don't let them intimidate you; half of them are suffering from dementia.  If you are smart enough to know what "Municipal Broadband" even is, and why it is good, you are probably smarter and better informed that anyone else in the room on your topic of choice.  Step 2a:  Remember what I said about the same pissed-off old people showing up time and again at local government and planning meetings?  Yeah, as an intermediate step you may find you have to first campaign for evening meetings in your municipality.  Seriously, a substantial number of "public" meetings are held when most of the productive working public is at work, which means you can't attend and no one in power has ever considered that this might even be a problem.  If you want a good indicator as to how much of your local policy is set by old people (e.g. retired people) just look up the meeting times in your muni for Council and Commission meetings.  That alone will tell you all you need to know about who really matters in your community.  If every Council and Commission meeting happens between the hours of 8-5, and you happen to be under 55, I've got a news flash for you:  YOU DON'T MATTER TO ANY OF YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, AND NEITHER TO ANY OF YOUR PEERS.  You don't matter because none of them have ever seen you before.  Step 3:  Research the following people and things:  All members of your City Council/County Commissioners.   All members of your local Planning Commission (if you have one). The Planning Director for your municipality (if you have one). The Planners for your municipality (if they exist). The Long-Range Planners for your municipality.  Each muni is different.  Some split Long- and Short-Range Planners into departments or sub-departments.  Some munis task only one Planner with everything.  Find out if you are in a GMA (Growth Management Act) state.  If you are, then your munis are partly governed by things called Comprehensive Plans.  These are mostly written by Planners tasked with Long-Range Planning, with input from the Planning Commission and the Public (that's you!).  *These things matter, in a GMA state they are supposed to have force of law.*  In a non-GMA state, they kind-of have force-of-law (it varies from state to state, and how much they matter really depends on who is in office at the time).  If you are in a GMA state and want municipal broadband, I don't see how it happens without this being worked into your muni's Comp Plan.  If you are not in a GMA state, you may still have a Comp Plan for your muni.  Find out if you have one, and when the next update is scheduled, and how you get involved.  If you live in a muni where Comp Plans exist and have force-of-law, getting Municipal Broadband included as Comp Plan goal is a HUGE step to making it a reality.  In a GMA state, you can potentially drag a muni before a State Hearings Board if the muni has a defined goal in their Comp Plan but take no steps to implement it.  Hearings Boards can sanction munis that violate their own Comp Plans. State funds can be withheld.  Step 3a:  GMA vs. non-GMA:  Find out how Plans are created in your state and in your muni.  Do you have a Growth Management Act (a state law) or equivalent that requires Planning?  Alternatively, do you live in a state where Planning is legal, but not required (e.g. Texas)?    Examples:  Washington is a GMA state.  Planning is enabled and Comp Plans are required by law (RCW 36.70).  Most munis do not have an option about creating one, they must make one.  They must have certain required components.  Munis don't get to opt out.  Most Comp Plans end up with mostly the same structure, because the GMA says so.  If a WA State muni doesn't Plan correctly, they can be punished by the State for not doing so; by the Growth Management Hearings Board or the state legislature.  Idaho is a non-GMA state.  Comp Plans are required, but Idaho does not have GMHB equal to WA state.  There is basically no enforcement on Comp Plan creation in ID, and some of the Plans are really bad as a result.  Planning in Idaho is allowed to be done by munis through the Planning Enabling Act (Idaho Code Title 67, Chapter 65).  Munis are given almost complete freedom in the creation of their Comp Plans.  Comp Plans are still supposed to have the force of law.  Find out how your state and your muni do planning.  Get involved.  In general, remember that political will to enforce Comp Plan goals and policies is generally less in Redder states, and generally less in non-GMA states.  ----------------------------   Some success stories   * [Chattanooga's super-fast publicly owned Internet](http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/innovation/chattanooga-internet/)  * [In Chattanooga, residents and businesses can access Internet at speeds as fast as 1 gigabit per second.

Their job is to regulate in the way they best see fit (whether or not the way they see fit is good is another argument). The premise of this (which is, as you said, technocratic) is that the will of the people isn't necessarily the best choice, and often *isn't* the best choice. People are very easily led astray or misguided.  Gotta also remember that Verizon sued the FCC about net-neutrality... *and won*. The FCC really cannot do *anything* at this point without doing a ridiculous amount of research, otherwise they risk being sued and losing again.  If you want what is supposed to be the will of the people involved, Congress needs to act. Organizations like the FCC were created so that they would be apolitical and unbiased (whether they are or not is questionable). It's also the reason that it's rather difficult for presidents to *remove* heads of independent agencies - it promotes them being apolitical, since they don't have to bend to the will of leadership.   FCC in February:  "It was a really close decision, but we've decided to ignore the entire nation's population and do what a handful of rich guys are telling us to do: destroy the internet."   I have good empathy but I'd be less tolerant of others' flaws if I won the lotto -- I'd tell a lot of people to sod off.   * "Don't tense up with the cold wind - relax, no really, relax, let it pass through you." It was very Jedi, and it works... I just have to remember it, because it's a reflex to tense up in the cold.   * For the sake of the environment/your wallet, you DON'T need to leave the heat on all the way when you leave the house. DO leave it on a little bit, though. I generally turn it to about 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). When you come home, turn it back up, put some new warm socks on and keep your sweater and hat on until it's warm again.  * When it's very cold outside, or you are leaving the house for a few days, you may need to leave the faucets running a little bit so they don't freeze up.  * Get plastic sheeting to insulate your windows, you essentially shrink-wrap it with a hairdryer and it creates a bubble of air that will block any drafts.  * Use thick curtains, but open them while the sun is out to let the heat in.  * Keep your doors closed inside the house.  * Make or buy draft stoppers from fabric and dense filling and put them at the base of your doors and windows.  * Cook a lot! Make sure you have proper ventilation for boiling, sauteing, etc. because the steam will cool down and it will actually be counterproductive. Baking is best, and after you bake leave the oven door open to let the heat escape into the room.   The question  would be 'listen to the following story and tell me what you think?'                        There's a priest, a minister  and a rabbi.                               They're out playing golf and  they're trying to decide...                               how much to give to charity.                               So the priest says, we'll  draw a circle on the ground...                               ...we'll throw the money way up  in the air and whatever lands...                               inside the circle,  we give to charity.                               The minister says "no", we'll  draw a circle on the ground...                               throw the money way up in the air  and whatever lands outside...                               ...that's what we give to charity.  The rabbi says "no, no, no"...                               we'll throw the money way  up in the air...                               and whatever God wants,  He keeps.

I think they know that it is impossible to eliminate Daesh/ISIS by military force on their own.  They need to manage it until the local politics and Iraqs own strength overcomes the islamic state.

Just think of the negative reaction on reddit and elsewhere and how it would unite people on behalf of the victim.    I think if the privacy of the customer agents is respected ... i.e. leaving out their name, then there is no good reason for Comcast to try and use the small words of a contract against you.  then again, they are evil      satellite bandwidth cost money     	138

 It sounds like you guys may have an entity in your house. It can be attached to the house, land, or one of you. I agree with alot of the other posters about trying a night or two away from home. If it follows you, then its not the house. Might I suggest those shake-battery flashlights. If power fails, kinetic energy will likely prevail at least. Here's a question for Shauna: Have you ever dabbled in the supernatural? Playing with Ouija boards or trying to talk to spirits in graveyards, or the like? Sometimes it can cause something to pay attention to you. I know OP said he had toyed with one before. They have been known to bring about bad entities, and it may not show itself right away either. Sorry if it doesnt ease your worries any, but I'm trying to throw up any possibilites at this point.   oh wow! I've never thought of using quartz for grounding. I know it can hold energy though. I usually use my bare feet on the ground for grounding. I do get the whole feeling a spirit but not communicating with it thing.

(normally just their voice, but sometimes they will show themselves) which is why I sleep cocooned in my blanket for the most part. I pick up on people's moods so easy, though it doesnt really work unless I'm on the phone or in person.

 i've put up a logcat long back on the page. What more info is needed? i'll try to provide max details :)   i've tried all, beta, stable and nightly...but its still present. Hoping it gets resolved soon :)   i did try it out, still a major WIP but a real good effort :D   ah yes, very true that opera handles much of the processing on the server side.    But i've had extremely good browsing experience on both dolphin and the stock android browser. I feel they dont disapper off because they are very lightweight in nature.     If Firefox has just a bare browser thing on android, it would be awesome.  4.1.1 device here :)     it actually doesnt involve particular pages. For eg. scrolling through general sites like Facebook, Complex just close the browser down. (i did file a bugreport on this issue - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968)    Heavily noticed this happening while scrolling when the page is loading.   I've noticed a lot on low RAM devices(=512), the browser just disappears after a light usage run. I mostly suspect an Out of memory situation is the cause of it.    But if a really light version like the something in the likes of a opera mini version happens then firefox can surely run stable on low end mobile hardware.   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056875   i think its the problem with this new switching graphics tech.   Hopefully someone will give a solution :)   Song to Siren - Candy soundtrack   ah nope only H-title, video downloadhelper and downthemall   i've tried chrome, and things remain almost constant.   I've tried on fresh profile, and all addons and plugins disabled.   Guess ill open a bug report.     i really have a strange GPU issue while using firefox.   My system dell n5110 has an Intel i3 and nvidia 525M optimus(Hybrid) running with bumblebee(Proprietary drivers) on Fedora Linux 20   Every time i use Firefox, the GPU fan goes on and off over and over after a certain time of operation.   My normal laptop temp is around 48-54C but when i use the browser its slowly rises above 60.   The Processor clock jumps from 101MHz-1200MHz   The Graphics clock jumps from 50MHz-600Mhz    I've tried switching off Hardware Acceleration but this still happens.        thanks a lot for your time :) _/\_   there's a lot of speculation that it could be Shirley Mansion of garbage   ah its not, song to the siren is a different one :/   The song appears in the candy trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U   The songs appears at 1:15   Most believe its some unknown Australian Song.   It's not present on the OST.    Few of the words in the songs are:   don't you worry   about the flight yeah   careful and true... we've flown   sing for the way we've grown... we grown      thanks a ton, _/\_ it sounded so familiar! i've listened a lot to this and yet it slipped away from my head    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtIzADkd504  Could anyone let me know the song playing in the background?   This post should be stickied   lib-ray-off-is      Instabug, you guys should get intouch with Facebook, their android app kinda seems like hopeless now.   your issue is strange, try browser reset or new profiles (proceed with caution to back up data first).   And check for updated sound card drivers.   Incase its still faulty, then please do file a bug report.    EDIT- webm and vp9 are implemented in Firefox but still needs smoothing out. So if youtube is serving you in these formats, then thats most likely the problem.    che, the issue disappears. But it appears again in a while.    I should mention that I am usi  do you have mediasource enabled in about:config?   if you're on the stable release, try reinstalling flash and see.   it looks more of a connection problem.    If you feel its a browser problem, then try clearing cache.   Still plauged with the problem, try a browser reset or a new profile.     your issue on linux?    #tabbrowser-tabs tab:not([selected="true"]) .tab-close-button {   display: none !important;}  Hey thanks @shortkey :D :D :D i just needed to change display: inline :D   try clear cache?   but i guess voting can bring about a perspective on the yays and nays of new features(mainly UI changes).   Core technologies should be done as per firefox devs, which is much better in their hands.     https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427   Why does the close button have to disappear just after 8 tabs?   Its kinda annoying. Chrome allows upto 18 tabs with the close button present.    Im kinda sure people have more than 8 tabs opens in a normal browsing session.

Hope we sail strong through the internet!   i guess a simple webpage where people vote yes/no on a new ui change or so could be an easy task for Mozilla, and better for Firefox progress as well.   Browser - firefox   Arts - blender, Inkscape and GIMP   Audio video - audacious, VLC, Winamp    Honestly changes are great as it happens.   But then there are certain ones which are kinda very different, and need a lot of talking back and forth and agreeing to.   For eg. the tab screen is really starting to look weird in nightly :/   Is there any such forum or place where normal people can interact with the firefox development community?   also the rounding       Lots of unticks on Chrome and Firefox even when they do support different things.     search for this 'media.mediasource.enabled' and enable it in about:config.   its still a bit buggy when playing vp9 encoded videos - plays fine thought -test it out. you might like it.     edit - To check if its on visit http://www.youtube.com/html5   if you really want to take some extreme steps delete the .mozilla folder in your home directory.   Im also a fellow Fedora user with 2 Firefox versions, stable and nightly, and both are working fine for me.      d the Google Talk Plugin, and I've installed NoScript consistently with each new profile.    Fair point though, a bit of digging says SIGABRT is triggered by angry libraries? I'll tinker with profiles (add-ons) in mind. Thanks.   ill suggest a totally non-addon approach first on new profiles. check if that helps. Or else remove it via yum and reinstall and see if that helps   Thats true. But I've faced similar playback issues on Vimeo as well. The content would have already streamed ahead by the player will start playing for a few seconds, stop and if it wish continue playing more or until i click the play button again.    Also the loading(buffering) bar keeps going out of its limits into infinity and beyond.       sadly chrome is much smoother in video playback on linux   Try a complete system update and reboot or Try reset the browser. If thats not helping create a new profile.   i would include all video sites in general.   codec for playing most web content - http://www.openh264.org/   its happening on both Youtube and vimeo for me. Can't make a switch.   HTML5 here we come!   ah the kernel 3.15.4-200.fc20.x86_64   and Fedora 21 is still away  EDIT- GNOME yes they havnt updated, they'll be pushing it out on the next version with wayland support   oh okay, not much familiar. i'll just shut my mind :|   But pretty much everyone installs them anyway, because otherwise your video players don't work.  thats true, but i guess mozilla is trying for an out of box working option.     and also, i think might be better if a software runs with its own set of stuff, than pulling stuff from the OS every now and then   i guess most distro's don't ship the bad and ugly versions of gstreamer.   Also Windows tech is proprietary    i saw this after the latest update   Thanks for the link! :)   Fedora 20   Gnome 3.10.2   Seriously wish it had a fill background option too.   and thank you guys for making a great browser! :D     i wish i knew how to code properly and contribute. i only know bits and pieces of C++      Is it possible to extend a persona theme as a complete background onto the speed dial area? Im not wanting a background addon that allows me to choose a background image, but something that just utilizes the persona theme itself or the colors in it to give a good back ground            You just need this and all's good https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin     Do try out the beta or nightly version. They kinda work better than the stable version for me.File bugs too when crashes happen.   It has performed much better in recent times but things like chrome displaying the page as soon as it loads, kind of create a better illusion of speed. Things need to feel very smooth for the users. Even the tab movement area is much smoother and of larger area in chrome that in Firefox. Miss the area and you create a new window while reordering the tab.   maybe chrome might use google dns built in(not sure).  But since the android app is also not working, it needs to be a DNS issue. Bombard BSNL! xD   the instances ive got crash reports, ive submitted, but this as you found out was different    thank you for the link! :D   yes...you too?   Sad state :/   something good needs to be done to thwart that drm cancer.   hmm probably true, i use like a normal user, i'll have apps that maybe running in the background without me knowing also.  ill shall try find the log file and submit soon   I don't see how Shumway will allow Firefox to get users back. Most people don't exactly use Flash voluntarily. They need it because video sites require use of patented codecs (H264) and DRM.  Linux users are fed up with Adobe flash(no new versions-except security updates), and most crashes happen due to flash or some flash based content on webpages. Plus lots of people use YouTube and other video based sites a good part of usage, having something inbuilt and stable like shumway like the way Google does with Pepper, it should probably improve the reliability of the browser.    Can you please file bugs about these issues? This sounds really strange, should absolutely not happen, and we don't know of any current issues like that. Do you have some task killer or anything installed that's nuking Firefox while it runs?  Sure i shall file a bug, but i just have no content to attach to a report sadly :/ It'll just close down without any message while browsing. And i dont use any task killer.    It already uses very little memory, and will work well on any Android phone with as little as 384M RAM (Firefox uses FAR FAR less, but your other apps will eat up most of that!).  i do know it does uses very less, but when other apps are also present, then things get slow, like using swiftkey, whatsapp, facebook and firefox one after the other :/     i think some DNS server is at fault.   Unless someone fixes it, it'll be the same situation for people who are routed through that server or ISP.    The bigger problem is that YouTube is not aware of this issue. Some thing similar happened to WhatApp users in india connected to a particular ISP. Only after the social media and news exploded was the service fixed.    People need to inform YouTube about the issue! Attack Social Media!   Hats off to the developer community for all the work they've done all these years. Truly, its been a great product. And i keep hoping for more good stuff from you guys! _/\_ MASSIVE RESPECT      A little focus on more important things will probably show a positive change eventually. It will take time to fight back whats lost to chrome, but im sure a good number of them will be Firefox users who are wanting to come back to where they felt at home before.     I guess Firefox also needs to increase its social media presence, Google can do it for Chrome through their ads system, but Firefox has to fight it out without spending much on Facebook, Twitter etc.  Once Firefox fixes up electrolysis and Shumway, that coupled with the privacy, peace of mind and the add on ecosystem, it will be a great combo to make some groundbreaking ad to get back whats lost, and add more new users.    it will take time, but these should be worked on with a great pace now, coz time costs everything these days.     i agree the attitude of the common man is hopeless.    only few of us try to make a valid change. I try a lot to convince people to shift to Firefox. Some do but others just stick it to the other competition because it works out of the box and without any trouble.    I still feel Firefox has every chance to grab back the market it lost, if it starts focusing on the current basic essentials to web browsing.    Back to square one is the need of the hour.   i feel the browser should focus on delivering speed, lower memory usage, per Tab process and shumway.    Honestly i don't think normal people do care if a browser is super developer friendly with all the features it provides; The general crowd wants the content or webpage to load super fast and with very little to no problems.    I've tired Firefox Beta on Android and the Nightly versions too, but there are lots of performance issues, when compared to others in the market. Ive got lots of instances when the browser will just close without even a Crash Pop-up to send an error report.   Plus Firefox Mobile needs to make use of less resources(RAM etc.) of low end phones, since most of them are 512 MB RAM mediatek chipsets.  Its been a really long wait from the browser that was a game changer back then :(   i think its a DNS issue, lots of people are facing this, but in certain locations, or based on the browser.    Cause chrome is able to go through. But the YouTube android app is totally failing to play and same with Firefox.    Using google dns solves this problem :D YouTube or your ISP(im not sure whom) has to fix this problem.    https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/     enabled as default. still no change on Firefox PC version.    i've also noticed that the android YouTube is also failing to play videos.   This is totally weird, since its working perfectly on chrome(desktop).     same issue, works on chrome. latest nightly build. FF33.0a1 Linux   same state unfortunately :/   But please do spread the news if you can to others who could help out. :)      Lots of apps have language support problems because there not enough user contribution     i also have a horrible problem on vimeo, where the video stars playing, streams ahead but the player automatically stop and ive got to hit the play button again. Very annoying! Linux Build.    Since the keyboard is now free and everyone can download from the Google Play Store, it would be great to have Malayalam language support for those like typing in Malayalam on their smartphones.  Kindly contribute to testing if you could. Or spread the message!  http://vip.swiftkey.net/index.php?/forum/531-malayalam-feedback/      same, i was deeply interested in the Gary McKinnon case but everything seems to have disappeared.

But then all sites have this problem to a varying extent, leaving me totally clueless on what/why its happening :(   yeah, they had been horrible with kernel support.   hope that will change soon for the better      I've been noticing this for quite some time now, video's even though fully loaded tend to stutter a lot during playback. It was more profound on vimeo, when the playback stop and the video  button changes from the pause button to play button. The video was fully loaded though - http://vimeo.com/48043470 - this was the video, while this thing was happening.    Its also present on facebook videos, though to a lesser extent, and least on YouTube.     I played the same vimeo video in another browser(chrome) and it was playing very well, even while streaming without any stutters.  Fedora 20 Linux, Latest Updated Nightly.   Well, it's like an iTunes clones visually, with support for themes and add-ons. It's good for managing music when you have a large library. It's got SoundCloud, last.fm integration among others. Auto scrolling lyrics support. And the most important of all, it still works as a browser.   I use it and am definitely happy. Of course there are minor bugs here and there bug for a normal user I don't think it'll be a problem.    It's the open source version of the now abandoned Songbird media player.    its more of an annoyance when people are trying to get work done fast.   Something like ad pop-up windows ruins your internet browsing flow   maybe a few millisecond time delay if you hover over the bookmarks icon, to add to bookmarks, can fix that issue i guess    't been fixed yet, along with some tab-tearing and tab-pinning visualization, when Australis is all about "beauty" and "sleek-ness". I guess it's because Firefox ships with tabs on top by default, which makes the lack of this "tab sliding movement" almost unnoticeable (or less painful) in maximized state, because you can just press your pointer against the top of your monitor and when moving the tab (that is  It is however a pain on Gnome shell, because on the main panel on the top, so even if you move up a bit, your off the main firefox window, and eventually create a new Firefox window.   This exists on the latest Nightly too. 32.0a1   Opera is simply sweet in that gif you've uploaded!  	113
 Yeah my garage has been duplicating my cars too... weird.    From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT   I have the AMD Radeon HD 6630M and I can run at at 40-50 fps. Just run it and play around with the settings a bit.    Surface RT runs on flash memory, not a hard drive, so the slowdown shouldn't be from there. Did you run Windows Update multiple times? The updates fix a lot of the lag/slowness issues.    Those floors are only accessible by CS students. If you have a friend in the CS department, just have them open the door for you. The elevators work the same way too.

MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input. If you mouse over the box a window will pop up saying "Your answer: _______." I'm sorry but I'm 100% certain you input the y = which is technically an incorrect answer.    Well the y = is already given... so technically you DID input the wrong answer.

New Facebook cover photo right here.

In which case decide whether a college degree is really worth it to you. If you foresee yourself getting a better job/being happier once you get a degree then go for it. I don't want you to be like "well what do I do now?" after you graduate.    You should go only because of the fact that it's a unique and rewarding experience. College is a unique experience because everyone there is living together and striving to achieve the same objective - the only other place like that is the military. The lessons, skills, and friends that you have there makes it well worth your time.    There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."  During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room.   While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed.   Both students switched dorms after that.    On the thumbnail it looks like his nose is made of a dirt block.   Looks like Frogger couldn't handle this challenge, either.   I've always felt it was the other way around...

 As someone who was born 100% deaf and had surgeries as an infant that restored my hearing to relatively "normal" range, I am baffled, putting it mildly, that there is a segment of the Deaf community that attacks cochlear implants for treating deafness as a disability and not a cultural identity. Have you encountered any hostility for having the implants, and how have you dealt with it?   Bench trial. No jury, so verdicts can be a heck of a lot faster.   Didn't mean to criticize-I was just confused. It was an interesting (and I'm  sure, frustrating for you) story, and I'm glad you shared it!   Note: I am not your attorney, I'm not giving you legal advice other than to tell you to seek counsel in your area, I am not advising you on courses of action to take or when things have to be done.  Disclaimer out the way, if you're in Montgomery or PG county, I might be able to give you some names of attorneys in the area.  It's a misdemeanor-a crime that carries a potential fine and/or potential jailtime as well as MVA points. It's probably a decent idea to consult with an attorney in your county-this isn't a mere parking ticket.   I strongly urge you to consult a lawyer to advise you how to handle the charges. For one thing, you'll want to investigate if being found guilty or pleading to the Utah charges could affect your current probation.   I am not licensed in Minnesota. I cannot give you legal advice.   I'd continue to keep an eye on the MN case records, but I'm not sure what you could gain by contacting the court or DA's office yourself. If you are concerned, you could/should contact a local defense attorney. He or she can advise you what to do next, if anything, and if it becomes necessary to speak to the court or the DA's office, he/she can do so on your behalf. Remember-anything you say can and will be used against you. That's not just a TV line.   Unfortunately, this sort of thing is a common scam as others have noted. It sucks, not just because you're out $50, but also because it means that when folks are in situations where they legitimately need emergency cab fare etc., it's impossible to differentiate oneself from a scammer.  You could contact the local police, since you have their phone number and it actually goes to them, but if it goes to a burner phone, or if your local police are a busy bunch, you're sadly out of luck. :( Sorry.   Thank you. :-)   That saidI'm not convincing you, you're not convincing me, and nobody else is participating or paying attention. We might as well agree to disagree and leave it at that.   Depends who you ask. http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101129/00172312030/why-tsas-searches-are-unconstitutional.shtml  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/24/AR2010112404510.html   Your hypothetical: "if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on "obscenity". There's already a sweeping ban of obscenity, as you seem well aware.   You proposed a faulty hypothetical for a law and actions that already exist, and I'm splitting hairs for pointing out your hypothetical is pretty much already in place?  Senator Feinstein didn't claim that she was qualified to write a law because of her experience with the shooting, she pointed to her 20 years on that Senate Committee and 9 years of experience as a mayor, too.  Yes. There is no exactly analogous ban on obscenity. What this has to do with the price of tea in China, however, escapes me. Getting back to the original argument, that we have plenty of limitations and exceptions to other Constitutional protections like the 1st and 4th Amendments, not specifically enumerating what is and is not obscene is not something that makes it less of a limitation on First Amendment protections. I'd argue that it is a greater limitation because of the chilling effect and, I'd argue (and lose in court, but I'd argue it anyway), that the nebulous definition of obscenity violates the void for vagueness doctrine.   Ah! That would make sense.   Is there context that we're (or at least I'm) missing, or did this woman randomly decide she won a prize?         And if you insist on a Senator arguing for prosecution of obscenity, instead of merely the Romney campaign and GOP '12 party platform, how about a letter signed by 42 Senators (the vast bulk of them Republicans but some Democrats, including Senator Feinstein), calling for prosecuting all major producers and distributors of adult obscenity, with a focus on internet porn. http://www.politico.com/static/PPM153_obsc.html   Here's how I can claim obscenity prosecution was a top priority of the Bush Justice Department: http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1125318960389 slreturn=20130216131119  As for your complaint we've moved from your original point, let's recap. Your original point was that if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on obscenity, you'd hope other Senators would be as zealous (your word, I'd choose others) as Cruz was the other day with the 2nd Amendment.  When I pointed out we already had a sweeping ban on obscenity, you complained I pointed to caselaw and not a statute. When I pointed out the statute, you complained it was little used. When I pointed out that it was a major priority of the George W. Bush Justice Department, you complained that the small percentage of convictions was negligible. When I pointed out that the Republican party and Mitt Romney stated their intent to do exactly what you claimed would be outrageous (going after a wide range of porn on the web and elsewhere), you ignored it.  Which one of us is moving the conversation away from its original point, hmm?   Wouldn't the wiser course be to contact the cops and ask them to deal with it? If there are drugs, guns, etc. inside, do you really want any level of responsibility for it?   Peter David's "Q-In-Law" is a classic....   I agree entirely-two years as a sample size is not enough to determine whether global climate change IS affecting tornado season. I was more interested in the bottom third of the article where it discusses the competing forces on how global climate change COULD affect tornado season.   This is a bit of an odd role reversal given my original comment, but it appears you are arguing based on passion and I am using facts.  How many people are currently prosecuted under the federal obscenity statute? Not many, perhaps, but during the GWB Administration, the DOJ taskforce targeted some big fish, and all it takes is a few selective prosecutions to have a massive chilling effect. You didn't see the internet suddenly devoid of porn, but more fringe pornographers did close shop for fear of prosecution.  Big names that were targeted include Paul Little (AKA "Max Hardcore") sentenced to 4 years in prison(1), Ira Isaacs (who came to public attention for distributing the 2 Girls, 1 Cup video) was sentenced to 4 years in prison(2), the DOJ prosecuted John Stagliano for milk fetish porn(3), and a woman named Karen Fletcher was prosecuted for "fantasy stories...pedophilia, torture of children, and murder of children."(4) Fletcher's work was disgusting, but it was also purely text-no children harmed in the making of the work and all.  I can do better than naming a Senator-how about a major party's platform and a party nominee for President? Yes, that's right, the Republican Party platform in 2012 stated, "Current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced," and the folks who pushed for this language made clear that they meant going after porn on the internet, on pay-per-view in hotels, in retail shops, and on pay-per-view on cable/satellite TV. (5) Mitt Romney himself called for strict obscenity prosecutions. (6)  **the tl;dr version is (1) that Bush made obscenity prosecution a major feature of his Justice Department; and (2) that the most recent Republican Platform and Mitt Romney made it clear they intended to use current obscenity law on the books to go after 100s of types of images and movies, and if Senators or others raised hell, we seem to have both missed it.**  (1) http://boingboing.net/2008/10/07/adult-film-director.html  (2) http://blogs.findlaw.com/technologist/2013/01/1-viral-video-4-years-in-prison-how-2-girls-one-cup-led-to-obscenity-charges.html  (3) http://www.popehat.com/2010/07/12/obscene-priorities/ and http://reason.com/blog/2010/07/12/if-you-care-about-free-express  (4) http://www.katzjustice.com/justiceblog/archives/9-George-Bushs-Injustice-Department-Returning-to-the-dark-ages-of-obscenity-prosecutions-for-the-written-word..html  (5)http://www.virtueonline.org/portal/modules/news/article.php?storyid=16471#.UUSIMaUbKPA  (6) *id* and http://reason.com/blog/2012/07/19/would-president-mitt-romney-vigorously-e   You haven't been paying attention.   Federal law prohibiting importation or transporting obscene material: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1462  Note that during the GW Bush presidency, he instructed the Justice Department to form a task force to go after hardcore pornography.   I'm merely a consumer of weather-related information, but to my novice eyes, this seemed like an interesting look at how warming trends may increase convective available potential energy while decreasing wind shear.      There IS a sweeping ban on obscenity. Under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment.   Good for you! That sort of mistreatment of employees is beyond unacceptable.   Ted Cruz's condescending treatment of a fellow Senator was disgraceful, and your link's describing Senator Feinstein as "lash[ing] out with emotion and hyperbole" continues the misogyny. (Taking a thesaurus to "hysterical" doesn't make the sentiment any better.)  Senator Feinstein wasn't a recalcitrant witness. She was not there to be cross-examined. Cruz was free to make his argument, as silly as it may seem. (There ARE limits to the First Amendment. Child porn is but one-material support to terrorists, fire in a crowded theater, fighting words, obscenity, time, place and manner restrictions, etc. There ARE limits to the Fourth Amendmentvehicles is certainly a huge one.) But Senator Feinstein was free to make her points, and was under no obligation to answer Cruz's haranguing questions.   Senator Feinstein made her points based on her years of experience as a US Senator and politician, her experience with the previous assault weapons ban, and her experience putting her finger through a bullet hole on Harvey Milk's neck as she tried to see if he had a pulse.   Wired magazine has a decent writeup explaining the court's ruling and its significance. http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/nsl-found-unconstitutional         Um, story time? When was this? Do you know what happened next?      The only advice I can give you is a caution that "If anyone has experience with copyright law (particularly in Canada)" isn't the right inquiry. The only thing that matters to you (assuming that you're in Canada!) is Canadian copyright law. The copyright law in the US, UK, or the Federated States of Micronesia won't help you in an actual legal dispute (as opposed to an academic conversation).  Try finding a clinic, a public interest group (like the EFF in the US), or whatnot to help if you can. Otherwise, please do speak to a lawyer in your jurisdiction.   The kid on both teams wasn't Danny Alamonte. This wasn't a 13 or 14-year-old ringer on the 10-12 year-old team. I don't see how this team got an unfair advantage from the kid playing on two teams, and it seems really cruel to strip them of the opportunity to play this weekend. Surely this could be dealt with without the need for collective punishment of kids.         If the accident was indeed both of your faults, you might not be entitled to anything from the insurance company. Or what you're entitled to may be reduced. Or you might be able to recover in full with pain and suffering damages. It depends on the state, and a lawyer can help ensure you don't screw yourself over. Proceed without a lawyer and you're likely to eff yourself over.   That's adorable! What is the kitten's name?   Where in the county? I've had good luck with Medstar Health. I go to their location in Spring Valley, about 3 blocks past the Bethesda/DC border on the DC side, but they have lots of locations throughout the metro area.  Since they're associated with Georgetown Hospital, I'm pretty sure Medstar Health takes most insurances.   But there was no evidence, to my knowledge.   Incredibly misleading way of phrasing it. Your phrasing suggests that an Israeli film crew actually did hand out candy to get people to dance.   Not a huge fan, but I supposed given the conservative nature of the present cardinals, there are few options I would have been a fan of. His position and his past statements on same-sex adoption are particularly disappointing.   Alton Brown's books are useful and well-laid out.  If this is for someone more advanced, Modernist Cuisine at Home is pricy but supposed to be spectacular. (Out of my price range, though.)   I hadn't realized they've been together for that long.   Great photo. One of these days, I hope to get to see them perform in person.   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan office, scored the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") as reducing the deficit. Republicans such as Paul Ryan continue to make false claims that repealing Obamacare would aid with deficit reductions when in reality, it would increase the national debt.  Why isn't the President, and the White House, being more forceful in rebutting these false claims? I understand that the President is trying to reach a "grand bargain," and to do so, he is trying to court Republican votes (or at least stop obstructionism), but by not going on television and repeatedly demonstrating that these claims about Obamacare are not true, it allows conventional wisdom to form that Obamacare does raise the debt. That's not helpful for an eventual grand bargain. That undermines national support for the President and for his policies and continues to ossify public perception that the GOP's plans would lower the debt and not merely shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class.   This doesn't make a great deal of sense. Yes, he was on sick leave for an extended period of time, but if this was cause to fire him, why wait until now to sack him? The vast majority of the comments have focused on how long he was on sick leave, but that is irrelevant to why he was sacked.  Looking at the stated reason to why he was sacked, according to the Independent, is that if he was well enough to travel to Australia, and well enough to grapple the shark, he should be well enough to work. This does not seem logical. For the sake of argument, let's view things in the light most favorable to Mr. Marshallsea. Being on leave for stress shouldn't mean he is on bed rest, going on vacation seems like a reasonable response. Whether it is in Australia or London shouldn't make a difference. That he was capable of grappling with a shark is not particularly of import because he was not on leave with a physical disability like a bad back, injured shoulder, or what not.  Given that going on a vacation is a decent way of dealing with stress, and that his reason for being on leave was psychological and not physical, what difference does it make that he went to Australia or grappled with a shark?   Hmm-perhaps that's what she was going for, but even then, as a former ANC Chairperson, I'd think she'd constitute a public official, and her statements were certainly an issue of public concern, namely alleged corruption and theft of public funds.   Good question, and I'm not sure what the best move is. One of the risks of truth serum is not just that one might be found sane, but that one might say something damaging in response to a question that might have led to pleading the Fifth had one been in one's right mind.   There's a surprising dearth of articles on the subject, but there are some, and they support what the Guardian reported.  http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57573934/truth-serum-eyed-in-james-holmes-trial-what-is-it/  http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_22772445/truth-serum-may-be-used-assess-holmes-sanity  http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/03/11/174048168/alleged-colorado-theater-shooter-could-face-medicated-interviews  http://thestir.cafemom.com/in_the_news/152431/dark_knight_rises_suspect_james   I agree-it sounds like bad science and like something that should not be admissible, but it also sounds like something that should not even be permitted to be attempted.  You and I are in agreement that this should not be admissible, but I respectfully disagree with your assessment of this as bad reporting. Sounds like the Guardian got the events right, and the judge may have (I hope) gotten the law wrong.   I hope it's only bad reporting-if it is as described, it seems rather horrifying. What part of the report are you disputing?         I'm not a DC licensed attorney. My understand of DC civil procedure is that the DC courts give a more generous view of pleading than other jurisdictions, but even then, to my eyes, the complaint embedded in the linked article seems incredibly flimsy.  1: The statute Ms. Seegars cites does not state what I think she thinks it does. She cites 23-542 which discusses wire interceptions and interception of oral communications, and yes, certain conduct is prohibited by this section. Unfortunately for Ms. Seegars, 23-542(b)(3) states that "it is not unlawful under this section for...a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication." Joshua Johnson was a party to the conversation, he recorded the conversation, and unless he recorded it with the intent of using it to commit a crime or other injurious act, it's okay under the statute. In other words, DC is a one-party-consent jurisdiction, both parties were in DC, are DC residents, Ms. Seegars is suing in DC court, and the statute she cites is one of the defendant's best defenses. Bwah?  2: The statute she cites is not related to libel and slander. It's a wire/oral communications interception statute. Bwah?  3. She does not specify in her complaint what exactly she is claiming to be libel and slander. As far as I know, and if I recall correctly, DC does not share the same heightened pleading requirements for defamation that other jurisdictions have in place, but even then, the allegations need to be specific enough to allow a defendant to form a responsive pleading. Merely saying "libel and slander", without specifying what the defamatory remarks are, is not sufficient to my knowledge.  4. Unless there are remarks the article is not referencing, it would appear the defamatory statements are things she herself said. In which case, bwah?  Is there a logic or merit that anyone sees to this pleading, or is it the rantings of a pro se plaintiff abusing the legal system?      *nods* I think the Nissan Cube is bright orange, if I recall correctly. I used to see it in Bethesda fairly regularly before the surface level Bethesda Row parking lot was turned into a construction zone.   :-) I'm so glad to hear that Ray Bradbury was kind to you. Thank you for sharing your story with us.   Indiscriminate? Hypothetically speaking, if the strike that killed the infant in question WAS an Israeli, would it have been indiscriminate, or would the determination that "Palestinian militants were firing rockets at Israel not far from the al-Masharawi home" persuade you that an errant strike, while awful, happens in wartime? Collateral damage is not avoidable-mistakes happen.   She was thinking about buying flowers and therefore she should still get the promotion? By that logic, a guy who was thinking about going to medical school until he flunked organic chemistry and switched his major to film should still get to practice medicine.   There are sites where you can do research for free. If you're having trouble using them, well, as I said. Law is hard for the layperson.   Law is hard. You can't just google symptoms and get a sense of what the range of options is. Every case is different. Your options, how much you can recover, statutes of limitations, etc., all turn on the individual facts of your case, and moreover, it's not just what the facts are, but what facts you can prove and how you can prove them.  There are real reasons why lawyers licensed in jurisdiction A can't practice in jurisdiction B without getting admitted to the bar or being allowed to hire local counsel. The cynical, and partially accurate reason, is a monopolistic attempt by each state bar to protect local attorneys, but the other reason is that every state's laws and rules differ, and even in areas of law with a lot of similarities between states, it's easy to screw things up.  Saving yourself the legal equivalent of a callout and labor can quickly lead to completely screwing yourself and leaving you with no remedy or no defense (depending on which side you're on).   The customer isn't always right, but the customer is sometimes right. Had the exception been printed on the receipt as it was supposed to be, fine, but it wasn't. That's not on the customer. That's on the store. Shifting explanations to vague "health and safety" concerns would likely only make one more suspicious/angry.  You wrote "I'm getting a bit tired of her, and she's clearly just lying at this point", but it would have been perfectly reasonable for the customer to have been getting tired of you and thinking you were lying, given you claimed something could not be returned due to a clear policy on the receipt, that turned out to not be on the receipt.  Not your fault it wasn't on the receipt, not okay for her to yell at you, but even leaving aside your later comments/actions, the customer wasn't wrong to expect a return if the policy wasn't given to her.   He's local. I think his business address is in Rockville. He has a bright orange car with question marks all over it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Lesko   It's a prototype iPhone 8.   Wow. It's amazing to see how many people are commenting without having read the article. Folks, this student is at Northwestern University of Qatar, not the Illinois campus. He is not Americanhe was born and raised in Spain. He wasn't in Qatar as a reporter, he was in Qatar studying journalism at Northwestern University of Qatar.   I don't understand how there hasn't been an immediate response from Congress to place compounding pharmacies under the auspices of the FDA, given the amount of harm NECC caused and the high possibility that it could happen with other compounding pharmacies.  This isn't to say that compounding pharmacies should have to follow all of the same requirements of manufacturingmanufacturing in large quantities poses much higher risks that what compounding pharmacies are supposed to be doing, namely creating 1 medication for 1 patient. But placing them under the umbrella of the FDA's regulation and giving the FDA the authority to inspect them, demand compounding pharmacies follow Good Manufacturing Practices, and the like should not be overly burdensome for small businesses.      We don't have the fraud problem of Russia, at least nowhere near the level found there, but a dash cam can still help prove one isn't at fault in an accident.   I was at a T-intersection, where the road becomes two-lanes a few feet further on the right of the intersection, but traffic coming from the left is still one lane. A car to the left stopped and waved for me to go (since the traffic light a block up on the right was red). After checking for traffic coming from the right, I started to make my left turn at the T intersection, only to have a bumper-to-bumper strike on a car that went around the car that stopped for me on the left (slightly going over the double-yellow to pass). Neither of us could see the other based on lines of sight until getting past the stopped car where we collided.  Unfortunately, the only car that stopped was the one that hit me, not the person who stopped to let me in, and the driver of that car claimed to not have noticed passing a car.  Since I couldn't prove the other car was there and the other driver couldn't prove it wasn't, and since we had the same insurance company, the insurance co. said it was assigning fault equally. Not much damage to either car, scratches to the paint, really, but I'm still ticked off about this one.  Had I had a dash cam, I could have proven I was not at fault.  In the event of more serious incident, a dash cam can definitely be useful.   You have GOT to be kidding. Palestinians are NOT Israeli Muslims. One can argue about whether there is a distinct Palestinian identity or whether Palestinians are displaced Jordanians, but nobody credible on any side of the argument defines Palestinians as Israeli Muslims.   Employers can generally monitor company email at all times, but there ARE exceptions. If there is a published policy in place stating that the employer will not snoop in email except in certain circumstances, said employer cannot snoop in email except in certain circumstances.  All the comments here saying variants of "it's their server, they can do as they please" misses the issue. The issue is whether or not the deans in question fall into the category of faculty or not. If they are not faculty, then yes, the general staff policy allows Harvard to do as it pleases. If they are faculty, however, and there seems to be a strong case to be made that they are, the faculty policy seems to prohibits Harvard from taking the actions it did.   Um, it's almost certainly not the IT Department's policy, it's likely the law.   Dawww.... Very sweet looking.   Good grief-in my jurisdiction, removing a shopping cart from a store's property is a crime carrying a $25 fine, and there's legislation pending that would raise the fine to $100.   I'm amazed the EC was stupid enough to complain that the carts she swiped were accumulating, and for that matter, I'd even be appalled if she was complaining that other people caused the accumulation.   Wow. I am impressed! (And my apologies for suggesting you erred.)   $5 each for the skittles or $50? (I'm trying to picture what $50 of skittles would be!)   Fortunately, it's not up to doctors. HIPAA requires giving patients access.   Depends. Some allergies can kill people. Others can make people pretty darn sick. (My mother is allergic to dairy products, and sadly, lactaid and other types of meds don't help.)  On the other hand, according to a 2008 article in the British Medical Journal, many "allergies" are actually a manifestation of mass psychogenic illness (AKA epidemic hysteria). http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pdf/publications/misc/023.pdf If this article is accurate, it makes sense for food allergies to come in waves.   What is the process for writing the Rachel Maddow Show? What is the blend of direction from you versus from producers versus what your staff comes up with? What is the process for becoming a staff member?   It's state specific. In Massachusetts, some vehicle-related offenses are criminal, and some are Civil Motor Vehicle Infractions. See http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/districtcourt/faq/faqs-cmvi.html#1 .   I disagree. The difference might be meaningful if judicial review down the line gave further process, such as a right to a de novo hearing somwhere along the way. It didn't. And so it creates a fiscal balance for due process in the civil arena, and not just in the administrative law arena.   Many, even most of the characteristics of a criminal charge? Sure. But it is still a civil violation, and therein lies all the difference in the world.  It's a civil matter, and just as in other civil contexts, there can be a filing fee. The state never pays a filing fee, but it's not exactly the initiator. (Not that it would matter if they were. To quote Mel Brooks, "It's good to be the King." The State doesn't pay filing fees. And why would it? Who would collect it? The State!) Anyhow, the initiating party, when it comes to this review process, is the person with a ticketit's an appeal.  How is Matthews on point? Because of the language I cited. The Massachusetts judicial system was (and is) underfunded, and the courts responded by putting a fee in place, both to raise revenue and cut down the amount of appeals. Unfair? Absolutely. Contrary to due process? I'd say so, but the Supreme Court doesn'tTHAT is the point of Matthews. Conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources and balancing harm suffered to individuals versus the cost of providing due process.    Almost certainly not. Woman who received the package did not realize the package was misdelivered until after she opened it. Moreover, she did not lie about possessing it. She said she didn't have the package and she no longer had the package, both true statementsthe police had already come and taken it.   Violates ABA standards and the school could theoretically be penalized if it fails to penalize Cody Wilson. I doubt anything will come of it, but it was pretty stupid of Mr. Wilson to admit his skipping classes on the record.   I agree that it seems remarkedly unfair. Hell, it IS remarkedly unfair. But it's constitutional.  Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), is a Supreme Court case that discusses the impact of finances in due process. The Court essentially comes out and admits that fairness and process can have a price tag attached.   The Court says, "Financial cost alone is not a controlling weight in determining whether due process requires a particular procedural safeguard prior to some administrative decision. But the Government's interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed. At some point, the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected by the administrative action and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just may be outweighed by the cost."  (Before I get blasted or downvoted for laying this out, please note that I disagree with Matthews v. Eldridge, and I disagree that entry-level appeals of tickets to a clerk-magistrate should involve a non-refundable fee, but sadly, nobody in power asked me. :P)   Even if someone legitimately has a seizure-how does that translate to free food? You call 911, they check him out, take him to the hospital if need be, etc., where does free food come into the picture?  (I know, I know, I'm trying to understand insane troll logic, but just...erngh! The stupidity burns.)   Not necessarily. It really is a state-specific analysis.   Board of Education v. Earls (2002). Reading the majority opinion alone, it may not seem terrible, but compare the reasoning with that of its predecessor, Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, which the majority supposedly relied on as precedent, and you'll see how the Court completely ignores all the key factors that made warrantless, suspicionless drug testing okay in Vernonia.  In Vernonia, the school had a real problem with drugs, limited the testing to student athletes who had unique safety concerns given the potential harm drugs could do to students with that level of exertion, involved a population that already was used to a lesser degree of privacy due to situations involving communal nudity (i.e. locker rooms) (and yes, this is a dumb argument in my view but still, not mere dicta to be ignored in future rulings the way the Court did in Earls!), etc.  Compare that reasoning, which the Court claims to rely to Earls, with the situation in Earls. In Earls, the school did NOT have a serious drug problem, it involved students involved in any extracurricular (and it's hard making a plausible argument that students in show choir or on a chess team present an elevated safety risk), and the unique lesser expectations of privacy of people used to locker room situations did not exist.  Instead, the Court took a South Park's Mr. Mackayian view of the situation, said "Drugs are bad, mmkay", and handwaved their way past precedent. O'Connor said as much in her dissent in Earls. (Well, minus the South Park reference.)   Yeesh. Glad to hear things worked out for you! I admire your restraint.   All the drama you can shake a stick at with very little authority to get much accomplished beyond throwing some social events. You'd be better devoting the time to being a staff member of a journal or brief.   Any advice may be state specific. Unfortunately, many, many states still permit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientationyou may not have a remedy if you complain and get fired. I suggest talking to a local plaintiff-side employment lawyer.   Yeah. She was going to steal it. Even had you not seen the box knife, her response suggests she was going to steal it.   I have to give you points. You called this one.   That looks delicious! Thanks for posting!   What's really scary is that the way you were treated is pretty much standard operating procedure, and its why false confessions can be such a big problem for the criminal justice system.  Put teens, or those with some form of mental issues, or even just scared adults in an interrogation room for many, many hours (sometimes double-digits), with police officers lying about what they know, intentionally or unintentionally coaching suspects with what the "right" answer, saying "just admit ____ and we can all go home", etc., and you end up with people falsely confessing to homicides, rapes, pretty much you name it.   I have the same set and I really like them. Cook's Illustrated rated them highly-it's why I bought them.   What are you used to? That's the only criteria that really matters.  When I was a JD student between '05-'08, the school was still majority PC but barely. Now that I'm back as an LL.M. student, I was surprised that the vast majority of laptops are macs. At least 70%ish.   A Restaurant Opportunities Centers United Report, admittedly a biased source but most sources are, claims that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/ )   Ad hominem attacks are not helpful, and your assumption that people tip at a constant 15% is a rather large assumption. Plenty of people don't tip-see http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/tipped-workers-left-out-as-minimum-wage-rises/ where a bartender talks about foreign tourists unaware of the custom.  Many servers DO make more than the $7.25 minimum wage. Many make at least around the $7.25 minimum wage. And a more useful point to make, which I should have conceded in my first post, is that the $2.13 wage is allowed only if tips bring up the total wage to at least the $7.25 minimum wage. BUT-reports claim that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (see ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/  Tipped workers are often forced to participate in a shared-tip pool, bringing down their total earnings, sometimes below $7.25 an hour.   Restaurants with policies that make servers responsible for dine and dashers or for meals sent back can also reduce wages below $7.25 an hour.  The low minimum wage for tipped workers is one more reason for a gender pay gap. According to http://www.nelp.org/page/-/rtmw/ROC_GenderInequity_F1.pdf?nocdn=1 , non-tipped workers (minimum wage of $7.25) are 52% mage, while tipped workers are 66% female (with sub-minimum wage of $2.13).   This is unconscionable. The cost of bread, milk, public transportation, gas, etc., between 1991 and 2013? Heck, I was in second grade the last time the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised. I'm now an attorney. WTF?      The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13. It has stayed at $2.13 since 1991! (Since 1991, for non-tipped workers, the federal minimum wage has been raised five times and has gone from $4.25 in 1991 to $7.25.)  Think of how much bread, milk, gas, public transportation, etc. cost in 1991 versus now.  You don't have to tip for crappy service, but sequestration is NOT an excuse for not tipping.   Sometimes Reddit confuses me. Collective outrage at prosecuting Aaron Schwartz and cries for more exercise of prosecutorial discretion, but then in a thread like this, many suggestions that the authorities should intervene when a neighbor puts a note in another neighbor's mailbox.   I can't offer you legal advice, but you may want to consult with a lawyer in your jurisdiction. Generally, a false accusation of stealing is slander.   As _yours_truly_said, I would take a big grain of salt from the pessimistic attitude towards classmates and professors. The method can be worthwhile, as far as getting certain books and reading ahead to know the black letter bedrocks of subjects before the classes start.   Um, no? But if they are aware of a patron that is intoxicated to that extent, in many states, they may have certain legal duties to summon or render aid beyond placing a guy in the passenger seat of his car.   Fair enough. :-)   I can also imagine the liability if a bar did not do this and it had tragic consequences...   I'm a fan of personal responsibility and most of the blame falls on the dude who vomited everywhere and passed out. But. Doesn't some of the responsibility fall on the bar for overserving? (At least it would in some states.)  Also, if someone is that intoxicated, isn't a call to 911 more appropriate than dumping him in the passenger seat of his car? Alcohol poisoning can be fatal.   It's worth noting that according to USA Today, McMillan was indeed murdered and a person of interest is in custody. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/28/gay-murder-mississippi-politics/1953187/  *edited to change word "suspect" to "person of interest"  	110
          For someone of your experience, your base salary sounds about right but the bonus seems like there should be upside to that number, especially in a city like NY. Without knowing your detailed background, three potential career choices come to mind:  1. Move from a software lead to more of a technical manager / project manager role, either at a large corporation - this may not be much of a premium to your current pay but can offer you better career advancement opportunities  2. Look for a similar technical manager role at a startup (a large startup if needed to avoid overt risk). This might be at or around your base but ideally gets you meaningful stock upside, and there is the chance to handle real responsibilities and grow with the company  3. If you are ready for a bigger leap and do have some business experience / interest to go with it, try your hand at product management jobs. These take you further away from the code but give you a better chance at building a management career if you are so inclined, and therefore the long term compensation potential is better  I have curated three collections of each of these types of jobs here: http://tapwage.com/channel/code-boss-fortune-100  http://tapwage.com/channel/code-boss-unicorn-startups  http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager  http://tapwage.com/channel/managing-a-startup-product-senior-edition   Good luck and if you have something else in mind, or something more specific, ping me and I can try and craft a more custom collection to give you an idea of what some of the options are.    yeah, it might be something like your transferable skill set isn't coming across clearly in the interviews which you can then refine with practice. Good luck.    Thats really odd. Do you generally send a thank you email to your interviewer (not the recruiter)? It might be worth sending them an email after the interview with a simple "I really enjoyed meeting with you. I understand that I was not the right fit for the role. Can I trouble you for 15 minutes of your time over the phone to better understand how I could prepare myself better for this role since its one that I am really keen on". Try that with a few of your interviewers and you might get some candid feedback that the recruiter is not sharing with you.       what types of corporate careers are you applying to?  There are a few types of careers you could consider given that you have a) people skills b) managerial skills and a history in finance  1. Get a customer experience job at a startup.  These roles can be fascinating ways for graduates of a range of majors and backgrounds to build a career at a startup and be a part of a fast growing environment. Compared to customer service roles at more mature corporates, these are often critical roles at a startup for introducing the innovative product to a new customer base and helping customers navigate a disruptive and novel experience. These roles can be stepping stones to sales and business development careers as well as other leadership roles Examples of such jobs are here: http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup  2. Try and get a junior sales job at a larger corporate. Examples of such jobs are here: http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits  3. Try and get into HR / recruiting. You probably have good people skills and these can be great roles to build a career in. A few examples of such roles are here: http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition http://tapwage.com/channel/get-and-deliver-the-perks  Good luck and reach out if you have more specific questions                     Without a ton of facts, on the face of it, 45k seems reasonable at this stage. Its lower than what you would make in a bigger city but its not dramatically lower.  One easy way to check - go on a freelance site like upwork, show your portfolio and see if you are able to command  $30 / hour. (alternatively, try their HTML and CSS tests and see how you score relative to other developers there that do command  $30 / hr). That will give you a sense of whether you are underpaid or not based on your relative skills.     You have been here a while. First - get the offer. No point counting unhatched chickens. If you get the offer and you like the offer (better money / responsibility), take it. Try and negotiate some time before you start so you can give your current employer some notice and transition the project. But you do not owe your employer that you will stay till the end of the project.    If you are good at sales, stick with it, and build a bigger specialty. Ideally, find a way to navigate into enterprise sales roles (selling to large companies) because those tend to be the most lucrative. Here is a collection of such jobs so you can see the types of jobs these are and the types of skills you need to get.  http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits  Good luck!   One idea that you may not have thought of is looking at startups in "customer experience" roles. These are (perhaps unfortunately) customer centric roles, which I know might be a problem since you describe yourself as not a people person. However, they are really interesting because you are effectively evangelizing and helping the customer experience with a new technology, so unlike retail, its a more promising role.  Moreover, at a startup, you can break barriers, spend time learning and potentially honing your technology and design skills, and have a career path as the startup grows. Moreover, the positive can-do vibe at a startup might be a good change of pace.   I have compiled a list of such jobs here so you can take a look and see what these jobs are like:  http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup  Feel free to reach out to us on tapwage.com if you have more specific questions. Happy to try and help.       It really does sound like you have had a really rough spell. If you like your job, I would stick it out. Cities grow on you, even pedestrian unfriendly ones, and it takes time to build a network of friends and a support system. There is no guarantee that if you did move, you'd love that city either (unless you find a job in a city that you think is 'home' in some sense). Moreover, finding a job is often stressful and frustrating.   I agree that a downward move will look bad. I think moving after a few months will look bad too, and especially without a great portfolio of work to show.   Maybe instead of spending 10 hrs a week looking for a job (which is candidly the least amount of time it typically takes), spend 10 hrs a week signing up for a class, or volunteering, or trying something new and fun that might give you the chance to meet some people and settle into the city.      Sorry I am late to this discussion.  Yours is an interesting background. A career in equity research is a good option and worth pursuing. That said, your easiest path of action is pursuing an MBA from a top 15 school. Big banks recruit at these places and you will get the finance training you need to do well at an equity research role. A CFA would be useful and you will likely need to sit for those tests anyway in an equity research capacity but I agree with the responses that say that MBA   CFA given what you are looking for. I would however, at least take CFA level 1 and 2 during your business school.   Other finance areas you could consider where you can leverage your healthcare /  bio background is high yield research (like equity research but on bonds), and credit risk management (again a similar role but slightly easier to break into for career changers)  Pasted below is a collection of junior equity research jobs: http://tapwage.com/channel/picking-stocks  Take a look at these and the types of requirements that they entail and you will get a good idea of what you need for these jobs. If you have more questions - feel free to ping me on tapwage.com and we can try and be helpful. Good luck!        1. I agree with TunaSandwich - better to have a job before you quit 2. I have found in my experience that sticking at your first job at least 2-3 years credentializes you. Also most jobs suck in the first year so its not unusual to not enjoy it 3. There are very few jobs out there that are going to pay 100k a year for your experience and background  Maybe look at other sales jobs:  http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits (a collection of junior sales jobs at large companies)  http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs (collection of ad sales jobs)  Do you have an idea of what you enjoy, or are good at? Do you want to get out of sales?  If you are really smart and quantitatively driven, you could consider junior banking and finance jobs. Those pay well and are very intellectually challenging. Here is a collection of those: tapwage.com/channel/beginning-in-banking  Finally - I wrote an article on finding jobs you love that you might find useful: tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/14/do-you-love-your-job  Good luck. Reach back out if you have more specific questions.    There was this fantastic AskReddit from a few years ago (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l1tb5/who_actually_enjoys_their_job_what_do_you_do_what/) entitled "Who Actually Enjoys" their job. This continues to be a really popular topic and a topic that is top of mind for so many people. So we decided to summarize some of the answers there and tie them to jobs so people could easily start searching for jobs they might love too. We hope Reddit likes it. http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/14/do-you-love-your-job         A few types of careers you could look at: 1. Become a recruiter. Your experience might be overlooked but its a career with advancement opportunities A few collections of such jobs: http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition http://tapwage.com/channel/get-and-deliver-the-perks  2. Customer experience jobs at startups. Good place to start, and you can learn a lot and grow in your role as the company grows Collection of such jobs: http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup  3. Try to break into junior marketing roles like the ones below: http://tapwage.com/channel/fight-night-marketers http://tapwage.com/channel/pete-campbell-with-benefits  It will be tough but try and get an entry-level job at a large company and in general you will get the branding and the internal opportunities to grow a career. Good luck. Reach out (via the Tapwage.com site) if you have more questions    Try some environmental focused meet-ups or mixers. When you go to these events, try and avoid asking for a job. Just learn about what they do and bring up your experience and background. Then follow up with a linkedin message or connect after.  Have you tried connecting with people via linkedin? Even if you don't know people directly, I am guessing given your role as an ecologist, you have friends or colleagues who do and you can ask them for an introduction.  Identify the specific companies / departments you want to work for using the websites, and then find someone who know at the company (at any level and in any department) and try and have them submit it to the hiring manager/  HR from inside.    I forgot to add LPT pre-fix. Should I resubmit?      If you have an understanding of real estate and some finance experience as a loan officer, finding a role at a big real estate firm is a logical step. Look at a variety of companies like big real estate developers (rental and commercial), big data center companies that lease real estate (like digital realty), banks that do real estate financing, and also large corporations that have real estate arms.  Don't limit your choices  I run a career site (tapwage.com) focused on addressing such questions  Check out a few of these collections of jobs: http://tapwage.com/channel/first-time-buyers (this is in real estate investing). May not be perfect for you depending on your background but gives you a flavor for some of the types of companies you can look at.   We post new collections of jobs everyday. If you want one specific to your background, ping us on the site and we'll make a collection for you. You can also search our large database of jobs but if we make you a collection, it might be easier to find suitable stuff, especially if you aren't familiar with what types of jobs might be out there for you     It will be hard. Unless you are going to get your degree at one of the top colleges like Harvard or Penn, chances are slim, and even then chances are difficult. There are other great jobs to look at. Maybe real estate finance at a local bank / financial institution. Either way - get moving while at college, try and do as many internships as you can over summers and through the school year and network hard. Good luck.  I run a career site - tapwage.com  We list a lot of banking, investing and real estate finance jobs. Check it out and see if those make sense for you   It will be hard.

There are a few different things you could do:  1. Look at startups. They are looking for smart people and are more open to diverse backgrounds. You could use your various skills to good use there. Maybe a data and analytics role given your programming skills, physics background and banking background: Here is a collection of such jobs http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-startups   2. Consider going to a bank looking for investment management jobs that involve programming. they re often open to physics backgrounds and great math skills. A collection of such jobs is here: http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence  3. Consider going to a corporate and using your programming and analytical skill set. A collection of such jobs is here: http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates  4. If nothing else, before you try for Walmart, consider going to  a startup in a customer experience role. These are interesting and your verbal and written communication skills are probably good enough for some of these roles: http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup  Maybe do some C++ programming jobs on odesk and other sites?

 I'm thinking about going down there. I know a house burnt down before this house was built.    My girlfriend, her mother, and I live in a two story house with her 5 year old son. The house is in an area that is prone to flooding so the house was built raised off the ground about 6 feet. It's a nice house, but it came with an unexpected visitor.  I noticed early on that something was going on in the house, that everyone else seemed obblivous too. When walking by the stairs on the first floor I can see a black shadow person standing at the top of the stairs, sometimes even walking by up there. Also when on the first floor we can hear footsteps walking around up stairs, everyone jsut blamed it on a creaky house. It likes to peak down from the space that the stairs meet the ceiling. I tried telling everyone about him, but I'm just crazy right? My girlfriend asked me once to check her tires and see if they needed any air in them. So of course i went straight to teh car and checked the tired and noticed a few of them needed some air in them. I walked into the garage and the air compressor was plugged in an outlet and was running. We happen to all be outside at the time doing yard work.  I noticed however that I wasn't the only one in the house that noticed our frequent visitor. My girlfriends son could see him also. He would come running into the our room every so often crying that a man in his room woke him up and scared him. I ran downstairs to his room to see if there was anyone in the room but it was just an empty dark room. when i walked back to our room I saw a shadow walk by the stairs on the first level. I quickly ran down there to stop the intruder but there was noone down there but me. All of the doors were locked so there was no way someone could have entered the house. My girlfriend chalked it up to bad dreams, but I knew what was really going on. Evetually it became like a ritual of her son running into the room crying.  This weekend I noticed her son was outside talking to himself. Thinking how its cute to listen to a child talk I listened to the conversation.  He was talking to a locked entry way to underneather the house. http://imgur.com/cPVDPIA "Stop waking me up I don't like you in my room. Please stay down there and don't wake me up." I asked him what he was talking about and said he was telling the man that lived under our house to stop coming into our house because he's very scary. It sent a chill down my spine becuase I knew I wasn't crazy then. Last night I had her son sleep with us in our room, partly so he could get some sleep and partly because I didn't want him in that room by himself.  As he was sleeping he started talking in his sleep. He quietly mumbled that the man was in our room. I sat up quickly and saw the black shadow man standing in our corner. The man vanished but I could hear him walking towards the door. I saw the door slowly creak shut. I ran towards the door and flew it open, jsut as i heard the door downstairs open. As I go down the stairs i saw our back door wide open. As I checked outside the locked entryway was also open and the lock was nowhere to be seen. I closed the entryway to underneath the house, closed the back door and crawled back into bed. My Heart was pumping uncontrollably and as soon as i calmed down and was about to fall asleep her son whispered to us again. "The man said he is coming back tomorrow night to see us.   edit: added picture of opening underneath house  	2
 Nah im content with booty calls i dont imagine ill find someone worth dating through an app. Im not saying this is my only source of dating but its effective if you want a quick hookup.   A lazy way of finding a booty call. Thats what i use it for atleast. Every girl Ive met through dating apps only wanted to fuck. Those girls looking for a relationship never want to meet and lose interest that same day. My experiences atleast.

 Makes sense...Thanks!   It's not hard...I just like to leave the shirt untucked because it gets that way through the course of the day anyway.   I've recently tried to graduate from zippered sweatshirts to cardigans/sweaters. The problem is that I like to leave my shirts untucked.  If I do however, the part of the shirt below the sweater looks like a skirt. Is this conventionally acceptable, because I think it looks silly :-/  Should I stuff in the shirt under the sweater or something? If I tuck it in and then tuck it out later, it comes out all wrinkled.   Any advice will be appreciated!  EDIT: Well, the internet seems to tell me that if my shirt is long enough to be looking like a skirt, it should be tucked in anyway! What do you guys think?   Yeah...exactly.  The last few years have taken away a lot from me. I'm prepared to spend many years getting it all back, even if I have to do it one step at a time.  Whenever you feel like you can't go on, just let a few days go by. The weather will change or a grocery store girl will smile at you...I never can tell when it begins and when it ends. When it ends, I exercise...   Very glad to be of help...   I am new to this subreddit, but only because I didn't know it existed.  Reading through it gives me so much hope.   To the people who post their problems here:  I am truly inspired today by your courage to lay your heart out on reddit and take advice. This gives me hope about me, and tells me that no matter what I'm feeling, there are always people who will care.  Thank you.   I tried again and again for 4 years before finally giving up on trying to be confident. After 8 months of soul-wrenching self-reflection and a reasonable amount of hurting myself, I decided the following:  I'll make a small change, and stick to it. I won't worry about any other problem. I can't work? It's okay. I can't sleep? It's okay. I am disappointing people who think the world of me? It's okay. The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.  As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.  The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.  I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh.   I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure.   I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls.   But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.  I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression.   The hurting is in the front of the kneejoint, especially when I'm climbing stairs.  Thanks for your advice about the stretches. I was doing only general stretches, but will include these specific ones as well.   Relevant username? :D   Okay...I guess I'll take you on your word and try!   I have two questions...I'm not exactly new to r/Fitness, but this seems to be the thread where I can ask basic questions freely!  1. I used to be a competitive runner about 6 years back in school (400 m, 800 m, 2000 m and 5000 m), but then I stopped. I started again a few weeks back. I run 3 times a week, 3-5 miles in each run, with an average pace of 7:30 per mile (8 mph).   The problem is that my knees are hurting. I've just attributed it to not running for a long time, but the pain hasn't gone in 3 weeks. Is this normal or should I be worried?  2. I see squats being recommended over and over. But I don't have a partner and I am not confident of my squatting form. Will I get the same advantages if I use the squatting machine at the gym?  I'm a grad student in university, so have access to good equipment.   Thank you all who commented! I will be listening to all of these tomorrow.   Beethoven's 7th Symphony (2nd Movement): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBfKXHoSvDM  I feel a certain finality to my actions when I listen to this. Like I'm an officer and a gentleman sitting on a chair with great poise thinking back over my life.   I don't have answers to any of those questions :)   I know...thanks :)   I would tend to agree with the general gist of your comment, especially the part where I'm putting in more effort than her. But changing that requires changing me, which is a lot of effort...  Well, I am going to take your advice to heart and we'll see how it goes!   Sort of..we're flatmates :)   I would like to say I don't have enough strength to do that. Circumstances too...but well!   No...Circumstances prevent the stopping of hanging out to this day. It's been six months now and I'm very tired now. Where are the other women?!   I physically proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a day. I verbally proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a week and even cited said physical proposal as a sign of my betrayal.  The friend zone is a lonely place.   "consider", not "considered", and Commic of course!   Also, I will be there. If you come in, and shout "Reddit!" in a loud voice, I will buy you (or the first person to do this) a beer.   Esquire in downtown Champaign has no cover and a live band.   Reading through the rest of the comments, I wish this was at the top. I believed strongly in the article till I read this comment. This goes with everything I've learned about nutrition as well.   I wish they had done a more long term study with more gradual weight loss.    "Put down the damn fork" believe me, is easier for some people than others.    No. I think the point is that what you call "lack of effort" is rooted in genetics. While some people use it an excuse, it is unfortunately very true for others.  I think of it in the same terms as depression. What you're doing is equating depression to a bad day.   Wow...Can't believe I searched the rest of reddit and missed Fitness...  *Palm sets off determined to have a few words with Face*  Thanks!!   ...for some people more than others, but I had no idea how wide the difference was. This article, while long, is very insightful IMO.  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/tara-parker-pope-fat-trap.html  I see that this article has been submitted to r/science (http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nuhrp/a_full_year_after_significant_weight_loss_these/) and health...but I subscribe more to this subreddit, and would like to see responses to this thread here.   I don't know...If the enemy is dropping pamphlets during a war, which government would want their people to read them?  How would it matter at all what the pamphlet said?   Thanks! It's (sort of) from a poem I wrote long back. Come to think of it, I think I submitted it to [/r/Poetry](/r/Poetry);  http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/iyw6v/shower/   Oh wow...I stand completely corrected!! An internet apology and thank you to you, kind sir/madam.   Thanks! You have now given me specific words to go find the meaning of...Off I go!   I did say "rest of the internet", didn't I? Google is it, and I asked.  While I showered in the torrent of information, I came out only wet, not cleaner.  It's more reliable to ask a forum where people seem to know what they're talking about.      I'm getting conflicting opinions both on this subreddit and on the rest of the internets. Some say they exercise only the arms and some say pushups are an awesome all-round bodyweight exercise.  Which is true? I have a feeling the truth lies somewhere in between...but well, I can't build my exercise routine only on feelings.  Thanks!   My mother is a yoga teacher, and I've heard her talk about this:  There are two different schools of Yoga (I'm not sure what either is called, so I won't take names):  1. Stretch as much as you can - This means go only to the extent you feel slight tension in and then hold that pose. Don't push yourself. You'll eventually get to the point where your heels are on the ground.  2. Use "props" - This could be a something under your heels so that they are resting. Maybe a pillow. Anything.  I don't know for myself which is better. My mom teaches yoga the first way, so that's how I do it. You'll get better at Yoga the more you do it.   The study talked about cancer and heart disease. Is that all health is these days?   i know this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but it did work for me: Try to enjoy cooking. Look at it as part of your fitness routine. It is also a lot of fun and very interesting to try out various things.  Start with simple things and keep expanding. I used to cook once a week, and now I cook almost daily and keep trying new things. Of course, I don't make anything that takes longer than 20-30 minutes, but there's a whole world of cooking hidden in that time frame too.   To be fair, my mom went against her religious beliefs and out of her way to make sure we got protein through eggs in our diet. She'd never even touched eggs before in her life and still cooked it for us for breakfast.     Came to say this. But then saw it said and realized I don't really like the joke. Sorry HighSorcerer!  The written word truly is different.   Ah..Shit!   I don't know. I like Sex better than Racing though.   That doesn't look half as bad as I thought it would.   How was your year?     About the reason for eating this way: I really have never considered health. My mother is a dietitian in India. She's strictly vegetarian for religious reasons, but allowed us (my brother and me) to eat eggs because she realized as sportsmen, we would not get enough protein otherwise. Come to think of it, she also used to give us Vitamin B-12 capsules regularly. She also did tell me recently that for the amount of lentils and beans we eat (approx 0.5 cups per day) plus the beans and the eggs, she was making sure that we got enough protein as kids.   While I was not religious at all, vegetarianism stuck with me mainly out of inertia.   When I went to Singapore once, I was out with friends and had steak and loved it. So I plunged headlong into meatland with gleeful abandon!  However, I am also a poor graduate student. So, I don't eat out very often (i.e. I cook at home) and I don't know enough about cooking meat. And meat is more expensive in grocery stores, so vegetarian it is. I started working out in earnest recently and hence this thread!  Though as I write this, I am having delicious prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and basil.  Sorry for the long reply...Am a little drunk and happy with  my cooking!  Also, thank you for the advice on supplements! I will buy some whey protein next time I visit a grocery store!   Thank you! This makes perfect sense!   Yes, I'm looking it up...  Look at this article: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you-illuminated/201102/does-vegetarianism-make-you-dumber  Though this is about memory...Seems Creatine does not help memory in omnivores, but increases it in vegetarians! Crazy shit!  EDIT: And a similar trend for bodybuilding/exercise: http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2003issue4/vj2003issue4weight.htm  "Vegetarians have lower levels of creatine in their blood, urine, and red blood cells.21,18 This does not necessarily mean that they have lower levels in skeletal muscle, which is where it most matters during exercise. In one study, vegetarians and meat-eaters took 7 g of creatine three times a day for six days. The vegetarians' power output over three bouts of exercise improved significantly after the six days of supplementation, while it did not change for the meat-eaters.18 In another study of vegetarians, creatine supplementation did not improve power output.22  Generally, a daily total of 20-30 g of creatine, broken up in smaller doses over the course of a day and taken for five to six days, has been shown to increase performance.17 There appears to be no benefit of taking this dose for longer than six days.17 After the initial "loading" phase, 2 g/day maintains creatine levels for at least one month.17 Some researchers suggest taking creatine only every other month to maximize its effects.10"   I don't even know that word! But off I go to Google...Thanks!   I am mostly vegetarian. By mostly, I mean I eat meat only once in a while, maybe once a week and I was completely vegetarian till a year back.  I am also Indian, which for my diet means I eat a lot of vegetables, lentils and rice. I was always told my required protein comes from lentils and eggs. So I assumed I had everything required for a healthy life from a vegetarian diet.  Looking at some threads on this subreddit however, has given me the impression that I still might need supplements.  Vitamin B-12? I'd never even thought about that before, though someone said milk which I get enough of, I'm sure.  Is there anything else I should be worried about, especially since I started exercising regularly and reasonably intensely (mainly running 5 miles, rowing 2000 m and some dumbbell exercises 3-4 times a week)?    Yeah, I don't want to read the logs either. I just want to have a way of knowing when I move from home to office if I've missed a message.  Chrome does that very well with the Google Talk extension.       I didn't realize the mistake there, and kept wondering how the first sentence and the rest were connected!   Yes, I have to agree...MFA is a great influence indeed! Thanks to this amazing subreddit, I'm now wearing clothes that fit, and thinking about what I'm going to wear depending on where I'm going!   Somehow, your amazingly weird analogy makes perfect sense!   In that first link, Beckham looks like he's wearing a towel :O That's supposed to look good? Even if it is, no way I have enough confidence to carry that off.  The second one's cool...  Thanks...that did help!   I need some guidelines on wearing a scarf. I've figured out the knots, etc. after watching a few youtube videos, and have on basic question:  Does the scarf go inside or outside the jacket?  Okay two: (How) Does the answer to the above depend on what I'm wearing?   Oh I had completely forgotten about the Google Talk Gadget...Thanks!   I really like empathy too, but I also like the ability of Google talk to automatically sync chat logs as I'm chatting between my laptop, home and office computer.  I used empathy for a few weeks before I realized that if I forget to sign off at home (which I always do), I miss everything that's said till the time I get to the office, unless I open up GMail and look in the Chats folder.  I know I'm griping about really small issues, but it would be cool if it all worked. And it seems like it should!    I recently switched back to Firefox because it looks and feels so much better on Gnome.   The only thing missing is a Google Talk extension. I don't want to open up a page of GMail because I have thunderbird running all the time anyway. Chrome has a Google talk extension available that runs in the dev version with panels enabled.   Are there any alternative solutions for Firefox?   Also, looking for deals on the Transformer always gets me more results on Transformer toys.    Oh shit, me too!    I did nothing all year.   The version on the album is more than 9 minutes long...and when listened to as part of the whole album, is a completely different listening experience.   This be very good advice. Going to class and doing homework not only lets you learn better, but also gives you good work ethic.  I took the easy road in undergrad, which has made my current road very thorny indeed.   I really can't get myself to do it. Was supposed to be coding, but here I am...I've lost my whole week :D I installed StayFocusd on Chrome and Leechblock on Firefox. The extensions lasted about two days before being disabled!  And I'm sure I'm not the only one.   Part of the problem is that my work depends only on me and how much I can motivate myself. But I'm sure there are still solutions.   Yup...doing that right now!   That was unexpectedly pleasant!      So it happened again tonight as well? The power plant must be going full swing for the winter...    Yeah that's what I'm thinking too...But then it must be hell for the people close to there!   Does anyone else hear that loud continuous noise that's been on for the last hour or so? I thought it was the wind, but when I opened the balcony door, it sounded more like a big engine.     I would love to exchange stuff too...Email ID pritamps+writing@gmail.com      Really? That's complicated Math? That's some of the most beautiful concepts you can find expressed in a cool, simple form...    Well, Mint's numbers are higher on distrowatch, so it's a reasonably good rumor to believe.  Distrowatch numbers don't mean anything of course, so I would tend to agree with your statistics.   I posted this question when I was new to reddit, and didn't get any karma. It made me hate everyone.   I have light grey jeans...thanks! :)   I really thought for a moment I could pull them off! Guess it's going under shirts, then!   By pants, I mean jeans and Dockers Khakis...         Was talking to my friend in Miami who has a motorbike and complaining that I really wanted one. She said we should do a motorcycle trip.   So in 3 days, I rented a motorcycle from Chicago, rode to the Smokies and back alone. I didn't have a jacket and I didn't have glasses (for the first seven hours before i finally gave up and bought a $5 pair at a gas station). She and friends rode from Miami and we met at the Smokies and did "The Tail of the Dragon".  My eyes were red, my skin first chilled to the bone and then burned and chapped. Best trip :D     This is how I read this:  1. Oh nice, a guy got a homeless guy fried chicken. 2. What? The homeless guy was black? He got a black homeless guy fried chicken? So?  3. Wait? *Reads the status again* He didn't say the homeless guy was black?     Are you currently a backpacker?  Yes. But never longer than 2-3 days.   Do you know how to use your equipment well and repair it if needed?  I can use it, but can't repair it.   Do you know basic first aid, especially for blisters?  Nope :) I guess my preparation has to point in a different way!    Great advice on the rucksacks walks. I've done lots of hikes with heavy weights, but never trained. This is a good time to start, then.     My goal is to stay healthy, and fit enough to do the Appalachian Trail in 4 months two years from now. However, I have very little knowledge of the Science of fitness and my regime is based only on personal experience of the following:  1. Playing sports all my life (Soccer mainly). I was a competitive swimmer as a kid and a member of my collegiate athletics team in India (long distance) 2. Yoga. My mother is a yoga teacher and I learnt the basics (only) from her.  This is my new fitness regime. Please criticize freely! I alternate days because I was told I should not do the same exercises on consecutive days.  ** Days 1,3,5 : **   1/ Run 4-6 miles (It's been 6 years since I've run, so I run at the slow pace of about 8:30 per mile)  2/ Row 2000 m (in about 10 minutes)   3/ If I feel like it, I swim a little and pay a visit to the sauna.  4/ Stretch.   **Days 2,4,6 :**   1/ Yoga for stretching (about 20 minutes).   2/ Push ups (I am currently on 60 in sets of 12-15)   3/ Sit-ups (On 70 in sets of 12-16).  Then I repeat. I use runkeeper and android apps for the pushups/situps. That's about it. Like I posted before, I have never really used gym or machines before, so any suggestions, help will be greatly appreciated!    That makes perfect sense! I will try squats, deadlifts, etc.. and post again for more feedback.  Thank you!   I've grown up doing a variety of athletic activities and exercises, but I never really had access to a gym.   Now I do, and what I want to know is this:   What advantage the machines in the gym (and weights) offer over say push-ups, sit-ups and pull-ups, which I regularly do anyway. They do look like fun and I see that a lot of people are really into it, which must mean there's solid reasons for it!     I'm going back now to see this girl you speak of!   I just saw the guy. He's pretty boring.   I will be dare   I will be dare    To be there!    I am a graduate student. I live paycheck to paycheck and I currently owe my friends+brother about $6000. I make $900 or $1700 per month depending on the semester and what course I'm teaching.  Most of that money goes in rent. I have no car and don't eat out to save money, which means I've become one mean cook!   Ah...I see your point. So I came up with a clever line where it wasn't relevant...shit.   Well, independent story. I was the Instructor for an Engineering course and caught 6 Indians cheating. I am an Indian too and I cheated when I was an undergrad too.   However, they still got zero credit for their assignments.   **tl;dr**: Rules are rules when you have to enforce them. When you have to follow them, use your judgement!   I really can't believe someone's complaining that their girlfriend wants to have sex.  NotAlone Problems -- Stranger to ForeverAlones than FirstWorldProblems are to ThirdWorldPeople   She isn't really that impressive or stylish :-| Just more impressive than Bad Romance indicates   I don't know why there's such a backlash against violence. You didn't mean any humiliation with your slap, only retribution. Violence, like everything else is good in moderation.  Her cheek will heal, you'll have your revenge and everyone will laugh at it two weeks from now.    I like ketchup on the side...not in things.   Ketchup with fries = good Ketchup on burger = NO Ketchup on Chicago Hot Dog = NO WAY! All those other things go so well together. I can't imagine why anyone would imagine adding ketchup is a good idea!    This is only for rich people to say.   Okay that just made my day, night and week. Have been thinking similar things all of the last few months, but I guess Neil Gaiman just says it better.   I'm south Indian. I don't hate north Indians. And the ones I don't hate, don't hate me.   There's a bus which goes to Iowa City  https://www.burlingtontrailways.com/  Costs $56 round trip...Not sure about amtrak!   Just curious. I came to the first world from the third world and while I would laugh at all the silly problems "those guys" would have when I was there, I think they're all very real problems when I'm here!  Well, some of are funny, of course. But most of them seem like real first world problems to me. Is it just the fact that they're not problems in the "third" world that makes them funny? Because when I face the problem (like going to pee when I'm already asleep on a comfortable bed), I don't laugh at the fact that I didn't think this was a problem before, because it is one now!  	99

Seriously, good can an album be to shave off a song like this?   I wrote both of them well after.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I hadn't planned on writing a follow up to [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2w8arl/the_window_washer/), but a few people asked what happened to me next. So here it is.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the message again. And again. And again I didnt want to believe what it said. Maybe I had misread it? Or misunderstood it? No, no it was much too simple to be misconstrued. He was coming after me.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I forced myself to snap out of it and ran over to the lifts console. I quickly pushed the lever up and waited as the lift lazily crawled upwards. I would have gone down if I could, but these kinds of machines only go down to the 14th floor. Going up was the only option.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I couldnt help but to cringe at the leisurely speed of the lift. One Chase Plaza is only 60 stories tall, but I still had a dozen to go. I found myself nervously glancing at the railing on the roof to see if he had made it. So far so good. 49th floor...50th floor Ten left.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to get the attention of anyone working in the building, but most had already left by now. I got the attention of a janitor, but he just smiled and waved to me, oblivious to my peril. I didnt give up. Every floor I passed I pounded on the glass and yelled at the top of my lungs.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;51...52...   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I glanced back up and froze. There he was. Looking over the railing smiling down at me. I reached towards the console to stop the lift but he laughed and shook his knife like a finger saying no. Then he ran over to the turbine collecting the wire that was hauling up the lift. To my horror, he started hacking and stabbing at, breaking the wires one thread at a time. He started panting between his hysterical laughs. *This man is a monster!*   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; I had never been more scared of anyone in my entire life. Every few hacks would send a jolt through the entire lift, it started to tilt like a ship taking on water. I moved to the raised end completely helpless. I needed to get to the roof to get off of the failing lift, but doing that forced me closer toto him. I looked down in terror at the streets below. Should I jump? Should I end things on my own terms? I shuddered, and reached for the console.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He must have seen me because he let out a scream like no noise I had ever heard before. Nooooooo! he hissed.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked up just in time to see him lose patience with the wires. He reached for the railing and launched himself over, hurling knife first at me. I yelled and dove towards the lowest part of the lift. He missed, but just barely. The entire structure shuddered under the impact. Before I knew it he was back on his feet and charging at me. I backed up until I could feel the cold metal railing behind me, I had no where to go. Like the woman had been in her office, I was trapped.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In a final act of desperation I jumped into the air and slammed myself down as hard as I could onto the failing lift. The cables buckled under the pressure and nearly snapped. It sent a shockwave through the lift and sent us both off our feet. I expected it though and grabbed on. He didnt. His feet went out from under him and sent him down onto his face. The knife flew out of his hands and skidded towards me.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was no time to think. I grabbed the knife and ran over the man. 59...60. Yes! I jumped over the roofs railing and turned to face the man, knife in hand. For the first time he wasnt smiling at me, the expression on his face was one of shock. Then it turned to anger. He began to scramble to his feet screaming. I ran to the wire coil and looked back at him. ILL KILL YOU! he screamed. That was all the motivation I needed. I swung the knife as hard as I could at the weakened wire.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;For a second I thought I hadn't cut through it, but then I heard a series of loud popping noises and a section of the lift lurched downwards. The cable snapped and the other chords began to pop one by one. Every time the lift dropped a few more feet he laughed harder and harder until the weight was too much to bear. The remaining cables snapped and the lift fell into the open air. He laughed hysterically the whole way down...   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was stunned. I almost couldnt move, the knife fell from my hands and followed the man to the ground. I didn't wait around for it to hit the sidewalk though, I couldnt bear to watch. I got myself together and walked back to the elevator. I got some looks for my torn up and battered uniform, but I didnt care. On my way out I asked a concierge to call the police, which she did without hesitation after she got a look at me.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I stepped out the front door and saw the lift immediately to my left. It had landed partially on top of a parked town car, but no one seemed hurt. I looked back up at where the lift had fallen from, broken cables were swaying in the breeze. A crowd was slowly gathering around the lift, and I was pushed inwards closer to it. Thats when I realized something truly alarming, I hadn't seen the man's body yet. A chill rushed through me as my eyes darted across the lift looking for something, anything. I forced myself to walk onto it. I needed to know it was over for good, I needed to know he was dead. I didn't find him though, I found the last thing I ever wanted to see: another note.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I picked it up, it was almost identical to the one he left on the window. It was beaten up and covered in drops of blood. I read it. *No* I read it again. *He couldnt have*   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You should have kept the knife   No idea what videos your talking about, but sounds like GRiZ.

No I got the point with the "they can't understand complex sentence structure" but it just goes way too far.   Um, well I would say you should probably finish reading before you comment next time. Besides though, aren't comments like these not allowed?   Thanks dude, that means a lot.   Haha I thouht that a few seconds after I wrote it but by then it seemed vital to the storyline. Not really, but that was the excuse I used to keep it in.   Please repot back after you ask, I think we would all like to know.   Oh no, an incomplete jump. It seems as if he didn't even try until he was almsot the quarters of the way there.   I smell a Giants fan...care to weigh in, OP?   Its so inorganic it makes it a little painful to read. The best way to sound smart in writing is to only use words you actually use when you speak. If you want to write using fancy words, expand your vocabulary.  vendor of fuel and complex carbohydrates.  Its called a gas station, a petrol station if your British. This is the other thing that bugged me, don't go out of your way to sound smart. It's completely condescending and it makes you look desperate.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I am the man who washes your windows. Well, I am at least if you work at One Chase Manhattan Plaza. Every day, five to five, Im outside on my lift washing windows. Window by window, floor by floor, Monday through Saturday. I know what you're probably thinking, but its not all that bad. I like to work outside, and the pay is very reasonable. And when the weather gets bad or dangerous were required to stay inside but still get paid! Score!   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I began today as I do most every other day. I walk in the front door, take the industrial elevator all the way to the roof, and prepare my lift for a days work. After I make sure everything is safe and sound I start maneuvering the metal-death-basket over the side of the building. No matter how many times I do this, it will never cease to scare the living shit out of me. There is something about stepping off the edge and putting all of your life in the hands of a machine that you can never quite get used to. And on top of that, the only tiny holding you up is four tiny chords. If even one snaps, the whole thing is going down. But I try not to think about that. Once I'm actually out there I'm usually fine.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;When the hard part is over, I drop down to the 20th floor or so and then work my way back up. The lift is slow, and a peaceful long ride is a nice way to wake up.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Under normal circumstances I would have a partner up here with me, but weve been a little understaffed lately. By lately, I mean the past four months. New workers were supposed to be hired to fill the open spots, but the building manager has yet to find anyone suitable for the job. In other words, he doesn't want to pay for any more staff members and is putting it off for as long as possible. Technically that breaks a quite a few safety violations, but I dont mind. Its kinda nice to be alone out here.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;This kind of job can be pretty interesting too. Being a window washer gives you an unavoidable glance into the lives of 100 or so corporate employees on a daily basis. Whether they want me to or not, I get a front row seat to everything happening in their offices. On multiple occasions Ive seen employees sleeping, doing drugs, fist fighting, even fucking (sometimes a few at the same time). Ive even seen more than one example of corporate fraud. Employees always think if their desks face away from the door their privacy is being protected from wandering eyes, but in reality its the window they should be worried about.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Today actually turned out to be pretty boring though. For the most part, people either werent in their offices, or were doing actual work. How mundane. As I pulled up to the 47th floor the sun was already setting and people were going home. When I least expected it though, I stumbled upon something interesting. On the 47th floor there was an older woman shouting at some poor guy who had clearly royally fucked up. Her expensive looking suit implied she was some sort of executive, while his loose fitting dress shirt and pants made him look like a green intern. It was getting pretty intense in there, I could hear the muffled curses and threats through the glass. The man just stood there though and took what was coming to him. No matter how much she yelled and shouted, he would just stare back blankly. It was almost freaky how emotionlessly he was handling the situation.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man eventually left the office and the woman sighed and returned to her desk. She noticed me for the first time then, and sent me a wry smile. I thought she would be happy to take some pent up anger out on an intern, but she didnt seem to enjoy the shouting any more than he liked being shouted at. What a terrible situation, truly a lose lose for everyone. I did my best to ignore her and keep washing the windows.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Suddenly there was another commotion in her office. The intern had returned, but this time he was the one yelling at his boss. She was clearly caught off guard, as evident by the shocked look on her face. *You idiot* I thought, *you were in the clear, shes going to fucking fire you now!* Suddenly he stopped talking and turned around to shut the door. He kept his back turned for a while, I could see the woman tilting her head to try to see what he was doing. He twisted his head towards her and smiled. Then he turned to reveal what it was he had been concealing. A huge metal knife.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I suddenly found myself paralyzed with fear. I had seen a lot through these windows, but nothing like this. Even though I was outside there was only two inches of glass between me and this psychopath. The sudden turn of events caught me completely off guard and left me almost too shocked to react. I cant even imagine how the poor woman inside must have felt. She screamed and jumped out of her chair in a helpless attempt to defend herself. It didnt do much. He rushed her, wildly screaming and swinging as he charged forward. He never stopped smiling.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She had nowhere to run, he quickly caught her. A fine spray of red immediately stained almost an entire wall of her office. Then another. And another She laid sprawled out on the floor in a slowly growing pool of dark red. I was stunned and appalled. *This isnt happening, this isnt happening* I thought to myself, knowing full well that no matter how many times I said it it would never change what I was seeing just before my eyes.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He left the woman dying on the floor. She was no longer screaming, I dont think she had the energy left. Before she stopped moving for good though she looked back towards me. Our eyes locked. I felt a sudden rush of sadness and grief pass over me, this woman was barely clinging to life and there was nothing I could do to help her. She kept watching me as she took her last breath.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man walked over her body to see what she was doing. He slowly bent down and traced her eye lineto me. Our eyes met. He saw me. He knows I had saw him. I panicked. I ran across the lift to my utility bag. Hands shaking, I fumbled through it. *Where is it?!* Yes! I grabbed my phone and tried to flip it open. I was rushing too quickly though, and the little phone went flying from my shaking hands and off the side of the building. FUCK! I looked back up at the office. What I saw before me made me jump backwards so hard I hit the back of the lift. He was standing in front of me, nose pressed up against the glass, grinning ear to ear. His loose clothes were torn and bloodied and his knife was still dripping wet. I was terrified, this man was a monster.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He backed away from the glass for a moment to get something on the woman's desk. I couldnt see what he was doing, his back was to me. Like the woman had done, I tried to look around him and see what it was he was working on. He was hunched over whatever it was though, I couldnt see anything. Suddenly he spun around and slammed a piece of paper onto the inside of the window. A piece of tape kept it from falling and stuck it to the glass. Before I had a chance to examine it he shot me one last smirk and ran out of the office. I didnt hesitate, I went straight over to the paper. It was a note. I couldnt read the sloppy writing at first, but soon it came together.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Youd better hope you make it to the roof before I do   1,627   Yeah...theres a plan.    nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary loves to take selfies. Whenever I see her she insists that we take at least one. It happens so much that we have a routine. She puts her purse on her right arm, and her left arm around me. I put my right arm around her, and point at her phone with my left hand.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes become very particular about how we take these selflies. Everything must be perfect. Our hair must be neatly combed, we must stand up straight, her phone must be positioned at a perfect angle. If something doesn't go perfectly as according to plan, Mary gets angry. Very angry.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary stopped taking selfies in public. There are too many distractions in public. 'Too many things that can go wrong' she says. I don't mind though; its nice to have a break from it.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary is at my house right now. We were just sitting on the couch looking through our selfie hall of fame. Silly selfies, serious selfies, sad selfies, the list goes on and on. She has more selfies on her phone than I can even remember taking.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"I'm thirsty" she says, "I'm going to get something to drink"   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I keep looking through our selfies. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. Wait. What was that? Go back. What is that? You can see it in the windows reflection. Shes holding something behind me. That's odd. That isn't in our routine. I shrug and keep swiping.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, wait   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There it is again. You can see it in the TV's reflection now. What is she holding? Does she always do this? It's a little closer to me than it was last time. I've never noticed it before. She has never mentioned it before. I should ask her about it when she comes back.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You can see it in the mirror now. The mirror isn't like the window or the TV. It's much, much more clear. I see what it is now. I see what shes holding behind me. Its a knife. A big, sharp, metal knife. And its getting closer.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I don't think, I act. I grab her purse and rifle through it. Makeup, phone charger, book, ...my heart stops. There it is. Buried at the bottom of her purse. Chills shoot down my spine. I pick it up. The metal is ice cold. The blade is razor sharp. I can't take my eyes off it. I am petrified. I am terrified.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes coming back. Quick, bury the knife back in the bag. Put her purse where she left it. Don't let her see, she can never know.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Every step is louder than the last. Faster! Quietly! She can never know.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes almost here.    nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Pick up the phone. Stop breathing so quickly. Sit still. Dont look up. She just outside the doorway now. I can see her shadow moving closer.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes back.   nbsp;   nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"Ready to take a selfie?"   I prefer Dazed and Confused, but Stairway is *THE* song to play at a funderal.   STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN??? How am I the 35th comment but the 1st to drop Zeppelin?! I'll just pretend you all assumed someone else had already claimed it to make myself feel better...   All of North Korea. That's gotta be like ten laptops, it won't be easy but I think it could be done.   I think the [Karma] (http://i.imgur.com/Ag4mbBX.jpg) was a Vengeance Camaro in another life.   Give that man a medal.   Lol well I hope not...   That was your cue...   Ah, the 'speedos' threw me off. Deleting...   If you can do that, your girls had quite a bit of experience.   I'm disappointed that there's no gold train here.   Kinda reminds me of a much better version of [a picture I took playing hooky on the last day of school] (http://i.imgur.com/sWWfVDM.jpg). I'll give gold to anyone who can guess the province or state or city where this was taken. I'm willing to do that because I really don't think anyone is going to get it, but if you do I'll promise to come through!  nbsp;  EDIT: Back tomorrow at noonish crown a champion (hopefully!)  nbsp;  EDIT 2: Wow! Two people, that's awesome! It was central New Jersey. What gave it away?   I don't think the rhyming was the problem here.   "I can taste it... Onions...and ketchup?"   I call your avocado, and I raise you my huge lemon*  You shouldn't play poker.   Is it strange that I really want to get in? I don't even know what it is...   Joanne Snow*   Um, could you please explain this picture?   You're going to need to speak up, this nice *SHINY* trophy is making a lot of noise.   Whats that? Sorry I can't hear you over this nice shiny Lombardi trophy.   ...perfect spiral!   Because the Patriots have in fact struggled with defense many years. Either way, no team will win without a balanced team. Of course you need more than just a good quarterback to win games, but that doesn't make the quarterback any less awesome.   No, not really. LeBron is thought of as one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball, regardless of things outside his control. Sherman isn't even necessarily the best in his position today. On top of that he's very arrogant. That being said, hes still very, very good and one of the best cornerbacks out there right now.   Richard Sherman (Seattle) and Darrele Revis (New England) are arguably the two best cornerbacks in the NFL. Them going head to head in the Super Bowl has been the cause of a lot of media attention. Tom Brady (New England) and Sherman also met once in the regular season. At the end of the game, after the Seahawks won, Richard Sherman approached Brady and said "You mad bro?". Hes known for being very arrogant and pretty full of himself.  Fast forward to the Super Bowl today. Sherman again openly taunted Revis after a blown play when he mocked his number '24' at the camera. Then the Patriots came back from a ten point deficit in the final quarter (something that has never been done in NFL history). They end up 4 points a head. Seattle look like they're about to score one final time with less than a minute left, which would have given them the lead and almost certainly the victory. Instead of safely running the ball though, Seattle elected to throw it and the Patriots came up with a miraculous interception that gave them possession of the ball for the last minute of the game. Theres a gif of Richard Sharman watching this play, he goes from all smiles as a Super Bowl champion, to completely devastated in about two seconds (it's pretty damn funny). This is him basically apologizing for being an ass, and Tom Brady respecting that. What I'm more surprised about though is whats happening outside of the picture. This was taken whils both teams got into a fairly large fight, they we're literally the only two players not fighting. I do not respect Richard Sherman as a competitor, but I very much respect him being the only person on his team not to fight and to try to make amends for being a general ass. That being said, I'm sure he would have gone right back to arrogant jerk mode if his team had won.  EDIT: By the way, LeBron James played basketball.  ANOTHER EDIT: Actually this wasn't the play with the big fight, nevermind, I'm sure he was very much involved in that.   Me too. I honestly thought "Fuck. Okay, they can't be stopped, just give them the touchdown with as much time as possible still on the clock"   -why did you have sex with a married woman?  -how the fuck did the ordeal last 12 hours?  -'rape fantasy'?  -DID YOU FUCKING RAPE THIS PERSON?  -how did you know she was married?  -why did she think you didn't know?  -what the fuck were you thinking?   So many questions   This is very outdated, for one thing New York is 1st in the United States, San Fransisco is 2nd.   Good god... That's almost New York caliber   To be fair there are a few words where you can pick it out. 'About' for example.   $8 FOR A GALLON OF GAS?!!! I paid $1.68 today! I think you're paying roughly the same amount when you factor in paying so much for things like gas.   Bugatti, Citroen and Peugeot and Alpine make some of the finest cars in the world. And the Renault-Nissian alliance is perhaps the most powerful and important partnership in all of car manufacturing. Not to mention Renault's stakes in almost every major car company in the world.  It really seems to me like you have no idea what your talking about.   Canadian English is almost identical to American English...in fact I've talked to many people where it's indistinguishable.   You seem to have very little experience.   'fuckyolaws'...   Thats a good point, a native American speaker can communicate in many more places around the world than say a native Japanese speaker.   My character is allergic to bees. Now which developer thought that was a good idea?   Oh my god yes, instead of grown ups handing out candy and  treats, kids could hand out beer and shots of vodka. Kids, alcohol, drunk adults, I can't think or a reason not to do this!   A 2003 Special Edition [Fender Splattercaster] (http://m.imgur.com/OO7zCTv), its beautiful! I got it for about $350 a few years back, and I think that was an awesome deal. The last big special editions Fender did before that was the [Bowling Ball series] (http://m.imgur.com/eYCoxzH) which go from anywhere between $3000-$7000 these days. Hopefully ten years from now mine will be worth the same! Not that I would ever consider parting with it. Ever.  I also have an 11.something carat piece of uncut Tanzanite. I'm not married or anything, I got it from an Aftican warlord I met while in Tanzania. We weren't close, he either had no idea how much it was worth, or he was *really* trying to impress me (which didn't work, I didn't know it was worth anything until I was back home for a few years). Fast forward 15 years and the Tanzanite mines are going dry and the price is skyrocketing. I plan on selling it 7-10 years down the road when the market is completely under supplied . Right now Tanzanite is worth about $700 a carat, but an appraiser told me that it's price could triple in a decade. Maybe I'll be able to but another Splattercaster!   Damnnnnnn   Yeah I would.   But why???   Holy fuck.   No, but seriously.   What?     Um, no results.   That...was very risky.   What?   Whoa...   I'll save time from Googleing this one and just assume that's what I think it is.   Well that Google was well worth it.    I once saw my friends sister laugh really hard and have 'milk' come out her nose after leaving the bathroom at Six Flags. We weren't drinking milk. Or anything. I wonder...   Maybe buried, but I still found it ;)   I'm not sure who Lisa is or why her username would be 'Stop*man*'   Um, sexual adventures? That sounds promising, go!   Wait...I've seen this before. Repost or retelling?   What are you going to do for money eventually?   How old are you?   Really wish you posted this earlier, it might be my favorite.   You tiny evil genius.   ...To go on Reddit instead of studyi-never mind...   I just read your username, it all makes sense now.   Should have said it was a meteor.   Um, okay. Go on?   What it lacks in NSFWness it more than makes up for in weirdness...   ...what?   Whoa, I might consider a throwaway on that one.   Holy shit I just got a great idea...   So...you're not okay with it at all?...   Well, as it tuns out, there is a very NSFW comic book based around a 'superhero' called test_subject3655. From what I can gather, he has the power to stop time which he utilizes to fuck this same person over and over again. It might be rape, can you give consent if time is stopped? Can you fuck when time is stopped?... Its a little hard to tell because there are a few Asian words thrown in here and there-now that I think about it this sounds like something Japan would create. It is anime after all.   Um, the whole point of this is for 'secrets' that aren't really a big deal. If it's a big deal don't post it here...obviously.   Phew, glad that's cleared up. The way you worded that kinda made me think you were shitting your pants on the regular and that your 'wife' was a guy.  EDIT: 'Phew'   Thanks for clearing that up.   I had no idea this was a job.   Details?   Um, rookie question: what exactly is swamp ass? The name is putting a picture in my mind that just cant be right.   No. No, no, no, no, no. Nononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononono.  I cannot stress enough, this is not what my username is referencing. No.  	102

 the problem is... everyone would just assume you were homeless. Those guys are always doing zany things.    5? why not more?   why do you hate football?   this is very similar to me. I often just talked to myself as if I was talking to some of my friends, just imagining how they would respond.   yall need to see some of the veteran cooks I work with. Years and years of standing for 9+ hour shifts.... Legs turned into jelly.   so, it's like this. You're right in every way possible. But I still want to argue with you....      ^^^^jagerbombs   ah, you absolutely **must** get a dog with some fune in him.   I thought this was a switcharoo. You failed me.   so true, so true.   hah, very close. a bit more south.   this. if someone is making fun of you for drinking water... I have nothing.    if it's freaking you out, just rinse the pasta afterwards.   any pharmacy, walmart or places like these.   okay, here's one:  I grew up in a small small town in Massachusetts and the house that my family was living in at the time had a lot  of forest behind it. I wish I could tell you how much acreage-wise, but up until I was probably 17 I used walk through the woods back there and I never hit the small road that was on the other side.  So, one of my favorite things to do was go out during January/February after a couple of good snows had fallen. All the brambles and undergrowth had died out and you could follow animal tracks forever. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a good at tracking animals or anything, it was just fun to see what animals were running around out there. I was always looking for Bobcat tracks... but anyway, I digress.  I was probably 15 at the time, I had just gotten out of school and it was this time of year and not too cold. I started out, and chose to go a way out that I had been in the summer, but it had gotten too think to move any further. So I'm walking. and walking. for probably 45mins or so, perhaps a bit longer. I stopped for a moment to get my bearings, realizing that I'd never come this far in this direction. I look around a bit, and then take few more steps forward. And then slowly, I start to hear this music. Not complex at all, it sounded like a pipe or flute. The melody was very simple, five notes total, repeating in two phrases. I was scared... mostly because encountering anybody this far out in the woods could go bad.   So I stood there. The music just kept going, steady and not relenting. I was too afraid to go anywhere closer, but I still just wanted to listen, to see if anything happened. Finally, after about fifteen minutes of listening, my fear got the best of me and I went home.   I was pretty upset with my self the second I got home, so I decided that the next day after school I'd go back, retrace my steps and go see what was going on. I did, and there was absolutely nothing. No footprints in the snow, no houses, nothing. Just fresh powder underneath a pine grove.   That is the weirdest thing that's happened in my life by far. I always went back to that place to try and figure out if there was any little cabins or homeless shacks in the area. Never found anything... kind of spooky.  TLDR, I heard some weird music in the middle of the woods.     in watching the gif I thought they were falling to their deaths... I'm very happy they weren't.    wow! that's funny!   interesting. Link to the study?   Brohonestly, you can't identify yourself on Reddit.    nonono, its to prevent the brim from getting oily when you touch it with your grubby hands.    I can verify this.   I actually don't mind this one so much...   ugh. Those shitty cheap Fedoras. Terrible, TERRIBLE I SAY!   damn, I'm sorry to hear that you have to drive a boat on wheels... you probably should have spent less time procrastinating in college.    being a 5'4" male and living anywhere, I've gotten used to this feeling.   nope.   I have seen this done on a FN show with making pancakes (or something similar) and I also once read the steps to do this in an old french cookbook:  where you separately mix egg yolks and flour together to get this yellowish paste. Then afterwards, add milk and other ingredients. Does this have a specific name? I've wanted to read about it for a while... how to do it right, what it does etc...   just out of curiosity, do you have any science to back up both this analogy and also the general premise that this is (a) harmful to the animal and (b) technically considered animal abuse.  If so, then shit, I've got egg on my face. If not then  Science motherfucker, have you heard of it?   this comment of mine is going to get down voted. But that aside,  please just shut the fuck up. For the love of god.    me too man   you know, I agree with this. But before everyone starts to shit on me, I'd just like to explain.  All feelings are valid, in that they are phenomenally there. But some feelings/responses can be misguided. For example,  "When you go out with your friends without me, I feel like you are avoiding me and that makes me think you don't value our relationship. It would make my life better if you took me out with your friends ALL THE TIME."  now of course this is an unhealthy statement. I'm not arguing that it's not. But these are legitimate feelings that are completely off base. (Specifically I know this, because it happened to me once upon a time.)     well that's funny   huh... I can't feel my hands today. Oh well, two Tylenol and it's off to work I go!   Im going to upvote you because you say wildly unpopular things on reddit. Good job.   I never thought of it that way. Have an upvote.   that might not be what he said.   I honestly think that it's more complicated than this. Namely, that min. wage earners are poor and need money to survive. People will do funny things to survive.   some people don't want to be helped. Not everyone solicits help with life decisions... This is what bothers me about smoking. There is so much literature and research that shows how harmful it is.   I consciously don't give a shit. I smoke.    damn you family guy!! DAMN YOU!!!   you know.... I expected this. I expected it, and you delivered.    that is some of the most gnarly shit I've seen in a while   Ah, good sir, I've been had. Have some upvotes... even if people hate me in this thread.   Soo.. when do we get the video of this bug presented on a plate to be enjoyed for it's delicious, delicious meat dunked in butter?   my apologies, but what has been misspelled?   I think I love you   I am mad because you didn't draw realistic versions of people! rahrahrah!   oh my god get over it. have you never seen caricatures before?   He probably should've taken her out of there before they got to the funeral home.   I spit out my drink laughing so hard. I do the same shit bro   here, have an upboat   hmm... I'm fairly positive that's not chicken.    I'm sorry... but it is ridiculous enough to wager a guess at who might run in 2016. Four years is a political eternity. But 2024? Who the fuck knows what's going to be happening in the world, never mind who might be running for pres.   ...not that I really am that invested here. You're comment just made me giggle.     I wouldn't actually be that surprised.   agreed. My views are often pretty unpopular because of this line of thought.      hahaha, I can't believe you got downvoted for that.   dildochrist, absolve me of my sins!   oh you get um   calm down. you're on the internet.   It's crazy, I just watched a Google IO talk by Colt McAnlis that got me feeling really good about multiplayer html5 games. I come here, and find a course he's teaching. Today is going to be a good day.   agreed   You are fucking ridiculous! I never said that that's what I wanted to do. Stop being such a reactionary.   I even began this whole thing with "I honestly don't **feel** so good about it."   It's strange, because I feel that you're the one trying to muddy the issue. I suppose it would be foolish to take this argument any further, because I can only see now that we will not reach a middle ground.   just one thing: it's about the fact that pornography is not a healthy basis for understanding sexuality from a biological angle and I think that 8 years old is to young to be taught about sexuality from an instructional angle.  You are upset, from what I've gathered, that he knew the distance between the holes. This seems strictly anatomical. But also remember that one hundred and fifty years ago, pinup girls would have been seen as hardcore porn, and a child seeing a girl's ankle would have been unhealthy.   I'm not trying to muddy the issue, I'm trying to withdraw my feelings from a controversial subject in order to find some truth. It would appear that you cannot help but inject your feelings into it and conceal them as fact.   I mean, I honestly don't *feel* so good about it. But I'm not sure if there is really any inherent reason for this to be wrong.  For example, I would have no qualms about a 16 year old bringing an 8 year old to an art museum where there were nudes on display (painted, or otherwise). The line between what we deem as "smut" and tastefully done -- is in my mind -- nonexistent.   Furthermore, and why I asked if you had a specific argument, is simply the question of how diegojones4 felt about the whole thing at the time. It seems like he was alright with it. And if that were the case, then quiet literally no one was harmed here.   Is it that you feel sad because you had an innocence at that age that you would like to hold on to, and therefore it bothers you that someone else did not have that same innocence? If that's the case, then, yes spell it out. There's no reason to go on making moral arguments based on silly little feels.    Oh please. He was not suggesting that children have sex. Please stop using the internet.   is there a biological argument for your sadness? Or are you just sad for the sake of it?   logic!   A good Heineken product placement   wow, the water on those rocks looks great   My apologies mate, hope the best for you and you're kids.   As long as there were rules in place to prevent a pissing contest between candidate and fact-checker. It would have to be heavily moderated and have a clear format.  I would watch either way, really. The sad thing is that even with experts fact-checking in real time, people would still cling to partisan feelings and thus the debate would be spun based off of those inclinations. I have a feeling very little would be accomplished, it would just be a longer and more educational debate. But when it came down to it, people would hear what they wanted to hear and the experts would matter very little.  Actually, it would probably just prove to be a big shit show for the experts. Their careers would probably be under such scrutiny after trying to prove Mitt Romney or Barack Obama wrong that after the first one, no one would step up.   it must have something to do with the squirrels phone number   you're picture is too big and I hate it!   eh, you let a little affair ruin your whole marriage huh?   his is a common misconception. It's actually done with a long piece of string.    who's that?   you just had that thought, eh?   blahblahblah wear your seatbelts.  Listen, everyone's going to get on their high horse about wearing a seatbelt. Personally, I wear one. But I dont give a godamn fuck about about what anyone else decides to do.   hah, I don't need a throwaway for that one.   innovators.   rawk    stop yar bitchn and dig in matey.   23   bout a pack a day. sometimes less. on a really ragin party night, I do mayhaps a pack in that night. But usually I want nothing to do with smoking that next day.  I am not proud of this.   I switch between camel filts and camel lights.   I don't pick a lucky. My last one is always an emergency and I invariably will light it backwards.  You will look back on this post someday and think, "goddamn, why did I think smoking was so fun?"   go away, and never come back.   came here to say this.  You got to earn your red wings someday, son.  	85

But, since it's a wifi edition, i don't have an app to view them and can only view the message from the notification (Evolve SMS is not compatible, Contacts+ wont show it's SMS features).  Is there any solution for that?  Thanks!

Japan wants to host the first Olympic Games for robots in 2020. What's your opinion? Is this something that could/should happen?  http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5927879/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-wants-robot-olympics-2020      And last. Don't think that will see them in Europe or USA.      Reddit Gold? Where?                  Bitcoin will always have a bad smell for me. Don't know why.   I like the open nature of Linux and that's why I've been using it. It's part of a different philosophy, ideology, part of a different way of life. And life is not easy for everyone. But it's good. Linux is not easy. But it's also good :-).             Something like that I guess..    Yes. They are unable to do something about it.  The only way I found that blocks them is the "I'm under attack mode" on Cloudflare. It totally blocks them. But if I turn it off (or set it to any other mode) they just come back..  And Cloudflare is unable to help me more, if I don't pay for a premium subscription...   Yes, I'm using WordPress, secured in many ways.      Nope, only GETs.   There is. They are accessing my homepage. Some stop there, some others access content on my wp-content/uploads and wp-content/themes. That's all. they like. Mostly images.  Others stop when accessing my pixel.gif, which i have created by following http://kb.site5.com/security/how-to-block-bots-that-dont-respect-your-robots-txt-file/. They don't get block, they just stop.   Unfortunately, yes.   I have blocked several countries using Cloudflare, so every visitor from these countries must now complete a captcha to proceed. They are unable to (since, i guess, they are bots) and i'm now on sustainable levels, but this is not a solution. Every country that is not blocked keeps on hitting me.  Nope, no exploits on my site.   Hello everyone. Starting yesterday, i'm facing a major problem with my website: even though, for the last 3 months, i was having a very small number of visitors (most of them from my country), the number exploded yesterday and now i'm getting several hundreds of hits. This could have been a good thing, if they werent real visitors acting like bots.  So, here is the pattern:  - Hits from every country imaginable, from multiple IPs. If i block their country using Cloudflare, they dont come back (so they are unable to solve a captcha). - Analyzed some of the IPs, they seem legitimate, no spam or bot records, nowhere. - Each and everyone of these IPs has a useragent in the lines of Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0. Some of them have different versions of MSIE or Trident. But they all have this agent. - Every hit is to my index page. I believe that some of them hit my naked domain, because i see a redirect. They get to my main page, and from there, some of them, hit a few .js, .css or images. But the majority does nothing, stays for 0 seconds and leaves. - Hosting provider cant help, since they believe that all those hits are from legitimate visitors (so, someone wants to convince me that users from Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Senegal, Iraq etc suddenly type the address of my greek blog to their browsers, pay a visit of 0 seconds and the leaves. Nah...). - No refferal, since they are all direct hits.  This is causing me problems, since im on a limited shared hosting account. They also hit my Adsense (no hits, just impressions), so i decided to remove it temporarily (in case Google blocks it for malware activity and fake hits).  The only thing i could associate with this situation is some hits im getting from a bot. They are a distributed computing project, so they might direct all those IPs to my site. I contacted them (waiting for answer) and blocked their bot using robots.txt. No difference.  Some of the hits from my logs:  - 46.130.101.177 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:28 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0)"  - 46.130.101.177 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:30 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 20742 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0)"  - 89.152.206.67 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:34 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"  - 89.152.206.67 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:34 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 20742 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"  - 78.174.87.179 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:09:15 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"  - 78.174.87.179 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:09:15 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 20742 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"   You get the pattern. There is a long list that looks like this.  Has anyone else experienced this situation? Is there a solution?  Any help is appreciated.

They should implement an automatic redirection.         "New icons, including a beautiful new launcher icon. The rest of the icons on your home screen will be jealous of its good looks. They will plot to get rid of it. They will scheme in the night, when your screen is off.

 Play Monopoly   Nice try Plankton.   A long, long time ago...  There are two directions this one could take   Even still, we shouldn't make the assumption that this is actually what goes down in the movie. For all we know, none of it could be true.   Yes   So a crossover with two movies that involve cars and crazy stunts with lots of action would be crazy? I don't see how that couldn't work other than the time period difference...   Was it ever NOT gonna be a good movie?   Could someone please link me to the episode or clip where Rich says "mopies" instead of movies?   I dunno, I thought this season was a big improvement over the last few. Did you see the finale last week? It was actually pretty good!   I gave someone a link to something I found through an easy Google search   *Hello,* Newman   And Jewish, born in the Bronx.   Me too      Contaminated with Ebola   Already happened twice   /r/nocontext   3late5me   Haha   Space Cop   [Confirmed for 2018](http://imgur.com/1JyQLbd)   He wasn't shoved out...   Well, we don't know yet if IX will be the end of the series...   Well, I would think Disney wants a change especially since those DVDs were made when Fox owned Lucasfilm   Oddjob!   Yeah, I'm secretly hoping the the SW7 DVD will have that same style of box art (even though it probably won't)   The haven't used a word like "rise" yet  I bet   Star Wars Episode VIII: An Ancient Fear  And  Star Wars Episode IX: Dawn of the Republic or sumthin   "An Ancient Fear"   Single explosion =/= Michael Bay   What about Churchman: The Secret King?   The James Candle one?   It's a default sub   I doubt they'd call it that, they've already used the word "rogue"   What is this, 1857?   http://imgur.com/UUol61K  Did this quickly   I disagree, at least with them being bad. The visual effects in the prequels were ahead of their time and they hold up pretty well today.   What??   So you ask for people's interpretations, but then you say that their arguments are invalid, despite the fact that they are based on logic?   My two favorites will always be Bootleg Pokemon and Takeshi's Challenge. On the other hand, I'd have to say that his earliest stuff isn't very good.   http://imgur.com/MsEg1b5  Hope that's good enough!   Sure - I'll get right on it      I would think they save it for D23   That's possible   ow my back      Well, he was sorta the key to all of it, he was a funnier character than they've ever had   I thought that was also in The Clone Wars from 2003   7 months from today, Star Wars The Force Awakens will be released in theaters.  When do you think we'll see another poster or teaser?   Haha! Women in a movie! I thought that was so hilarious!  /s   Oh it definitely matters how good it is. Would you rather have 1 bad movie about and influential figure or 2 movies, one of which will be excellent?   Yeah, but this'll be good.   Who cares? I think they're funny and entertaining, it doesn't make a difference to me if they aren't actually legitimate film critics.   Exactly!   So you've seen every film in existence and know for a fact that he is the only man who's ever slowed down the frame rate of a shot?   Source?   So? Seriously, what is so revolutionary about that? Did he invent some new technology? Is he the first person to ever do this?   So I would be praised for revolutionizing the art of film by putting a couple of slow motion shots in my movie? I know that's simplifying what Miller did by a lot, but the principle still applies.   But the ability to express the characters in terms of audio and visuals is unique to filmmaking. It gives you a clearer picture of who someone is and what their motivations are.   More so than a movie like Star Wars? Jurassic Park? Even something like Birdman?   For you.   Seriously dude??   Not really   Some guy with a broken leg watches other people out of his window   Pretty good!      I'm on it.   I guess so   Yeah, but he said it was *a lot* deeper   Yeah, but don't feel intimidated by it or anything.   Don't generalize all of our food when you see places like McDonalds or KFC - try to find some nice, local restaurants, as a lot of them are very good.   I've got an amazing cable access show and I still know how to party!   Well, he's still aging every year    You mean movies that you've seen this year?   What's so special about the frame rate/editing compared to any of the other big budget action movies?   Well, no offense, but don't talk about it like its some low-budget spiritual piece of filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but there really wasn't *that* much there in terms of story or character development.   Exactly - it's not about how it was made, it's about what you see on the screen. If that doesn't stand out in any way, then there's no point.   ok I'll be quiet   It made 100 million dollars this weekend. Not exactly tanking.   Saw **The Bridge on the River Kwai** for the first time. Loved it.   It almost felt like the precursor to Lawrence of Arabia, such a large-scale story told beautifully.   Sarcasm, I hope.   Exactly   In the mud   What do you think a PC is?   Life, um, finds a way...   Did that comment take you 12 years to write? /s   Wayne's World   Nope.   http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/imitation-game/   Did it take you 12 years to come up with that /s   Yup, that really bothered me   It just ends in such an anti climatic way   Boyhood    Yeah, it all felt very over dramatic   Oh my gosh! I was wrong   Sorry, got confused   I disagree - I really don't think anyone could've done as good of an Alec Guiness impression   No, I think it was shot on Arri Alexa digital cameras   Honestly I think James Franco could play that role pretty well   Seriously, why wouldn't it? It's a big budget Hollywood movie based off an already existing franchise with big names as stars. It had a decently large advertising campaign, and it's been doing incredibly well with critics.   I've been starvin' 'em, tazin' 'em, singing off key...   Can I play the piano anymore?   The movie will also spread through the massive ad campaign. Trust me, you guys are talking about this like its a low budget indie movie based on a completely original idea.   Yup   Sounds like it could be cool - more of a "Close Encounters" approach   For example, I've always wanted to see what Stanley Kubrick could've done with Lord of the Rings, or even 1984.  What movies do you wish a director had made?   That is all.   On a Thursday? Not really. Wait till the weekend is over.   Yeah, but that doesn't really make much sense  	109
 ("My mother says conservatives only become more conservative as time goes on, because each year, they get a little further through Atlas Shrugged."*  :D  -One of the best Simpsons quotes ever,   You're welcome on the info thing.  Well, neither of those games play like bloodborne, and most games don't in either style, mechanics, or lore and story-telling, but they have their similarities and are quite different.  Dead Space 1 and 2 are solid survival horror games.  They follow mysterious plotlines that you have to fit together and are slowly revealed, yet even then mysterious, leaving you with many questions.  Also, the game-play is similar to Dark Souls in that it is a bit more slow and plodding and thoughtful, and it can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, though it is standard load/save type method of doing things.   Darkest dungeon is a RNG party-based dungeon crawling game, where you recruit characters who die permanent deaths, focus on party comps and smart item usage and upgrades of your town hub, characters and armor, and it is pretty similar to the Cthulu mythos of crazed cults and mysterious dark portals and Eldritch truth.   A few others are Salt and Sanctuary - an upcoming 2d souls type game yet to be released, and Lords of The Fallen is a similar DaS style game (die and leavebloodstains, lose all your currency, focus on builds and weighty combat) was released last fall, and even though it isn't anywhere as good as DaS/BB, it is still one of the only directly DaS inspired games out there.  And of course, there are the Original Souls - Demon Souls, DaS and Das2, all worth playing, even though they are similar yet quite different from Bloodborne.   Edit:  Some other good 2D souls like games (death has consequences, risk vs reward, etc) are Rogue Legacy and Shovel Knight.   Right, but it depends on weapon scaling and stat investments as well, and the point remains, that there is only one in main game play through, and it sucks having to run hours of chalice dungeons or run to a whole new playthrough if you don't pick it up.   Takes a lot of patience - you can't get greedy or you will be killed in one shot.  I stayed at range, baiting out his charge attack (turns into a leap later on, so it changes the timing of when you have to dodge), which is easy to dodge once you know the tells and the timing, or his vomit (which he hardly ever did for me ).     If he vomits, and you can get to him quickly, whack his legs 3 times, and it will stun him for a moment, but make sure you don't get too greedy.   When he charges, dodge to the right and behind him, and either do one running or quick attack, and back away/dodge again, as he will quickly retaliate.  With the axe (what I think I was using), I could only get off one attack or risk being killed.   I've fought him in his weaker versions more head on which was easy, but that is the strategy I used to beat him, as I wasn't doing so hot facing him head on, as a lot of times he would charge at me even if I was close to him, and I hardly had the time or room to dodge, and it just complicated the fight too much for me, though in his last phase he hardly would want to charge me at all, so I did some very hesitant, scared shitless face-to-face combat, but I wasn't happy about it :D   Dude.  That shit totally reminds me of full-metal alechemist and the creation of a philosopher's stone.  All you need is a large number of hapless, terrifies souls to complete the ritual create it :D   Edit:  And the other ones who didn't get turned to stone were turned into giant lumpy, human flesh-ipedes!   Nope.  I don't like the blunderbuss or the cane, but the pistol is awesome and easy to parry with.  Maybe you should mix up your weapon useage and play style?  As much as I enjoy(ed) the plodding, strategic combat of DaS, I definitely think FROM did right with a change, and I find BB infinitely more fun, fluid, intense, and enjoyable when it comes to combat mechanics.  I love DaS, but BB has been a step in the right direction in terms of actual gameplay, though of course it could use more weapons and armor and etc.   I'm gonna be sure to leave notes in front of all the dolls and ladders now :D   I try to update my cloud save files like, every other day, especially if I make a lot of progress.  Don't know if PS4 automatically does this by default.  Can anyone confirm?  Either way, definately worth doing it manually every now and again to be sure, and also back it up on a USB drive maybe once every few weeks or once a month, that way, you're never totally screwed.   There is one blood rock you can get in the main game, and I suggest you get it before you kill gherman and get booted to NG+, as then you will miss out on it, and they are very hard to come by.  NG+ doubles everyone's hp, so a +10 weapon can definitely help you feel like you are fighting with something more than a limp bread stick :D   Cool, glad you took that as I intended it to be read, even though I perhaps sounded a bit dick-ish at parts.  Definately.  I liked how you bowed in the first match, even in the midst of his onslaught (also annoying that you can't cancel emotes as quickly in this game), and then you proceeded to beat him in a close match.  And cheers to older etiquete, I just find it amusing when people get mad that people don't act as they insist.  Wish this game had something more implied like red sign soap stones and arenas :/   Ehh, Squid headed Cthulu-esque monsters are always a visiual cue, but often it involves eldritch (sinister/ghostly) type of truths that induce madness, and that somehow bring to light the limitations of humanity and our perceptions and understanding.  Two come readily to mind:   A newer game called Darkest Dungeon on Steam (awesome by the way, and brutal like souls/BB) is heavily influenced by Lovecraft.  Hell, even a game like deadspace (all about evolution, taking humanity to the next level based on this "alien" artifact that induces a madness that believers see as truth and growth) is very Lovecraftian, even though there aren't squid-headed monsters in it.   Dude, you don't even want to know it!  The Eldritch Truth will drive you mad!  MAD I SAY!!!!1!   Not passive aggressive, I just wanted to crush his moment of triumph and  give him a heads up that it only gets worse :)   Yeah - a lot of Lovecraft's focus was psychological, that is, fear of the unknown, and the limitations of human comprehension, hence so much of the focus of the game is about insight, and understanding the sinister truth and perception.  Ie., can you think of a five-sided triangle?  Or absolute zero, or nothingness?  Such things might exist, but they are truly beyond us being our comprehension.   You do know that's not the blood letting beast that everyone has the hardest time with, right?  :P   Nice work though!   Dude got wreckt, and that's cool, but why would yo ube so solipsistic in the first place?  Does everyone have to play by your rules or even the community's rules either in a game, or outside in the real world?  That shit can get you killed there too :D  Also, there's something to appreciate in how that dude just ran at you all aggressive as fuck, just like the hunter NPCs, no bull-shitting around.  None of the other hostile hunters in the game stop to bow and have tea and crumpets with you bdefore starting a fight, so why should he?   Have done lots of PvP in souls games, and honestly, who gives a shit about it in BB?  It's not like we placed down red or black soap stone signs to duel, and it's not like it's hard to inflict damage. Fighting is so fast-paced, and there are so many items and weapons to utilize for fun, that both people can use, why try and put the same honor code here?  With how long it can take to even get matches, I appreciate the longer and more drawn-out fights, so long as the invaders aren't hiding in a group of NPCs, or totally shitting on both of our time in one way or another.  Don't mean to sound like a dick, but I'm sick of people complaining about this shit or other arbitrary PvP rules, especially since BB is not the same as the Souls games, and it's the perfect game to play a sleaze ball, and use all the dirty tricks in the book, and to have fun with some intense fights, and I think putting restrictions on such a game are just limiting the full experience of the PvP  :D   Would it upset you if I told you I killed this guy on my level 4 beastbro run?  That poison is no joke with low vitality :D  Here are some tips.   You can parry him (when he extends his arm all the way back, pretty much as he is just shooting it forward, pow, parry+visceral.)   Save a firepaper, and your oil urns and molotov cocktails for the last phase so you can stay away from the poison, and kill him ASAP.   As others have said, if you stay to his right side, locked on, always ready to dodge, he will never hit you, but again, that poison can be brutal in that last phase.     Don't they aren't definitely afraid of anything?   PSA:  You can use the beast claw to deflect objects, including fireballs, bullets, and even the giant rocks those fuckers throw.  You can thank me later :D   Plz make a bloodborne movie Disney!  PLZ!   Eh, but same thing goes for the rest of the souls games as well.  See Onebros :D   Was about to say, if you kill Rom before Amelia, it can bug out your game...   I know right?  Dude should get a room if he is gonna be spamming his bone, then he has the nerve to come at you before he even washes his hands?!  What an asshole!   Yeah, but the axe does group damage and crowd constrol so much better and easier, and somehow it's even quicker and more versatile.  You think they would have made the whip at least a bit quicker :/   So what if you have deft little delicate hotdogs for fingers?  How do you have the strength to punch your hand trough a pig's ass and rip out its intestines?!   Can you confirm that guide/dlc thing?   That sounds like a fun fight.  I actually was sort of miffed by hemwick my first time through.  I mean, it was super easy, but it was sort of quiet and I didn't know what the fuck was goin on, in an anti-climactic sort of way.  Then I realized there was a little barnacle covered toad lady you had to whack, then another one, then she was dead and it was easy and I was like, how does this shit fit into the story?  0_o   Hahahaha.  Thanks for sharing.   I totally enjoy onebro runs or limited items/weapons and other challenge runs, but the tedium and insanity of barehanded and guitar hero controllers just sounds maddening!  I can already feel the frenzy meter rising just thinking about it, feeling a bit sick, but at least I can die human.... rooooAAARRr scREEEACH BLARRRRGHHHeeEeeeeRRRRRRRR RAOOOR!   And all those heavy trade-offs are why it's obnoxious that people even bitch and moan about in-game mechanics, items, and weapons that are clearly meant to be used, especially in PvP :D   Yeah, how dare people use in game items and weapons and intended mechanics.  From here on out, you are not allowed to use the rally system either!  Rally system is total CHEEZ mode!!1!   I'd defeat him with the sprint button :P  Last time I bothered to kill one of those assholes as a regular dungeon mob, he only dropped a bent paper-clip or something stupid like that :/   Is there a cannon armed undead giant surrounded by dogs and undead with a bellmaiden nearby dropping spiders on your face?  That one has been, my, uh, favorite one so far...   I wear it with the crowfeather garb, as the black feathers on the bone ash set better matches the crowfeather jacket.  Looks pretty sick.  The whole vibe is a nice angel of death one :D   Also a heads up - make sure you run it blind with no spoilers/help/etc., as, yes, the level design is awesome, but it also hides how short and straight-forward the game truly is :/   Goddammit lock ness monstah, I dun told you I aint givin you no tree'fiddy!   Eh, say what you will, but Dark Souls 2 was still the best game of 2014, and still gave FROM fans a bajillion hours of entertainment for both PvE and PvP, and still had the best fashion souls and PvP to date of the whole series.  BB would be closer, if not for the lousy match-making and load times and lack of multi-player options and covenants.   What you're describing is Dead Space, almost :D   U stoopid newb got reckt!  Just kidding :D  Yeah, if only we did something more useful with some of our spare time...man, the amount of souls knowledge and trivia up there is the reason I can't remember people's names anymore :)   That wasn't just you.  That was everyone.  DaS PvP was an economy of backstabs, and a lot of lag :D   There are covenants in this game?  :D   Being human itself allowed summons, bonfire kindling, etc, and also raised your resistances, and the humanity stat itself also increased your item discovery, aside the other affects of AR for certain weapons of ETC.   Point is, I had that thought as well (about insight doing more or being linked to idiscovery), but it would need a better balance.  In general, insight needs more of a purpose in game...   And then you join scientology, and they take all your echoes in tax-deductible donations, and the brain-sucker slurps out all your intelligence and free will!  Totally spot on!   dON'T GIVE UP SKELETON!   Well, I like the idea, and it would balance out since not everyone levels arcane (and honestly, the wizard stuff equivelant in this game is kinda lame anyhow, even for some extra utility and damage), but it would need to be balanced more though - like how in DaS1, your humanity raised your Idiscovery, but you risked losing it if you died...   Yeah, my level 4 beastbro is kickin ass and he's half way through the main game, and its pretty much like playing the whole game ond defiled cursed chalice dungeon mode, since a lot of late game enemies and most bosses kill you in one or two hits.  My main who I just like to derp around with is around level 200 or so, so who knows why the fuck he sounds so self-righteous and upset.  What else is my main supposed to do after easily aquiring all items?  Just sit on top of 2 million souls?  Nah, spend that shit.     The most important part of a build is focus, and then the skill to use it, and a few extra levels (even 50 of them) hardly make a difference.  Anything past a level 100-120 specialized build doesn't necessarily make the game any easier anyhow, as most Bosses can still kill you in one or two hits, and the small damage bonuses are negligible, especially since an extra 10% damage doesn't mean much on a swing, when an enemy will still take two whole swings to kill anyhow.   Yeah, at depth 5 chalices and NG++, I find my main wandering around with a million souls fairly easily, so I've just been pumping his levels up.  Almost level 200 on him.   I have a level 4 beastbro who I will never level, and I'm also working on two separate builds I'll keep in co-op and pvp ranges.   Edit:  Also, with how wonky multiplayer is, and how tough certain chalices are, I can safely say I miss soul memory  :P   And the rent is too damn high!  Wait, what...?   Dude.  I tried the cane last night on a new character, and I got my ass handed to me over and over again at beginning of the game, and I'm in NG++ on other toons, have beaten all the lowest depth chalices, and I even am working on a Onebro challenge run.  Sure, I don't know how to play as effectively with the cane yet, but even then, the weapon just seems so lacking, namely in whip mode.  My level 4 beastbro kicks far more ass with a hunter's axe than my canebro, and onebro is in the forbidden forest, fighting much tougher enemies.  Cane just seems so whimpy, slow, and lacks damage on its whip attacks, as they have a ridiculously long wind up time, yet don't do as much damage as the kick-ass hunter's axe halberd version, nor do they stun as easily it seems.  Am I missing something here?  Or does the cane sort of suck, namely compared to other weapons that do both 1h and 2h modes better in general?   Right, and this is all the more reason why they need to focus and fix those issues sooner rather than later, and we know their is a match coming on the 23rd, though I don't know if that is the announced one to supposedly optimize multi-player.  I agree with a lot of your other ideas, but game balances like that can be tweaked later, after we're done yelling "Rabble rabble rabble!" about the critical-mass multi-player problems  :D   You made a good write up though.   Edit:  Also, 2nd most important, is we need covenants that matter, covenants that carry some fun interaction, risks, and rewards.  As it stands, covenants are lame as fuck and pointless in this game :(   I love this game, 9/10 rating from me, but there are a few huge problems in it at the moment, and they are brutally critical for a FROM game, and they definitely threaten the longevity and replayability of Bloodborne.  The biggest problems imo at the moment are the invasion system/mechanics, lack of covenants and covenant interactions/rewards, lack of even duels or an arena type system, and the wonky, undependable multi-player system in general.  Invasions - This game needs more invasions, in more areas, even if the boss is dead.  This game was not as exciting as previous titles, as there was far less risk due to a lack of player invaders.  I think bell maidens should spawn in pretty much almost every area of the game, and they should also still spawn after the boss is dead.  *I'm not even a fan of invading or invaders, but I still enjoy the mechanic, because it creates even more of a threat, and adds another delicious layer of fear, precaution, and excitement.*  I myself much prefer soapstones for dueling and arenas, and on that note:   There needs to be better, non-penalized dueling systems (ie, no -30% health penalty).  There should be bells for even-matched duels and fight clubs, as well as an arena system implemented.    Multi-player in general needs to be better, faster connections, less time-outs, and insight should not be consumed until a match is found and you are actually placed in another's player world.   There needs to be covenants in this game, along with all the risks and rewards of being in them.  Oh, there are covenants in this game?  You could have fooled me!  :D   Those are my biggest gripes for now, never mind any of the other critiques.  Still give the game a 9/10 because it is a fantastic game, but the issues that are there for the moment are very fucking glaring and unforgivable in a game like this.  I almost want to say, FROM could have or should have known and done better :(    Edit:  And yes I agree - frenzy is a goofy ass mechanic that needs some tweaking.  Bleed was cool and functional in DaS, negligble and useless in DaS2, and the equivelant in BB is just OP and WTF and kind of stupid...     I don't know why a bunch of random assholes are downvoting you for no apparent reason, but you're right, it's definitely more fun than a heart attack, but not as fun as say, an aneurysm  :D   Create a level 4 beastbro for a challenge run?  Or some other type of chalice run?  That's the only other thing at the moment, other than what you mentioned and playing more NG cycles...  or, maybe trying new builds, or something besides quality/ludwig's.   That being said, hopefully they patch multiplayer soon...   other than what you mentionedLevel than what you mentioned and NG cycles and more chalice dungeons...   Yeah.  I think that's a pretty dumb way of calculating damage for viscerals...   How would you redo the character?  I mean, don't get me wrong. To really go for it ya really gotta use everything in your arsenal, and sometimes it's the environment, so no biggie there.    No summons for a true beastbro run for some, but the true deciding factor is not leveling. I managed to get Amelia on my second go, but I burned up my last 3 fire papers and used a few molotovs as well, as well as 10-15 blood vials. I'm currently getting destroyed in forbidden woods. The dogs just fart in my direction and my HP melts. Just lost 70k souls too, which is a lot. After amelia though, id recomend going to cainhurst ASAP to get blood chunks. You can at least get your weapon up to +7 or 8 if you're lucky.    That being said, if you're around to night, I'd be willing to help u with Amelia in true Beastbro fashion, that way some higher level isn't doing the wimping for you. Let me know.    Yo dawg, I heard you like dreams, so we put dreams in a dream, so you could dream that your dreaming while you're dreaming about dreaming.   You cheesed him behind the graves and objects though :|   If we're bragging here, I beat him in one go on my first attempt with my level 4 Beastbro.  No, it was not gracious, as I had to do a lot of running and dodging in the last phase, but yes - most of his attacks will still kill you in a one to three hits with a level 4 at 10 vitality too, but don't worry, all enemies and bosses will be killing you with one shot later on in the game.   Welcome to Camera Souls, where the most difficult enemy you will ever fight is the camera, and he follows you into every boss battle!   (Seriously though, the camera has always been an issue in these games)   So this was right before he beat you to a bloody pulp with his sack of dead hookers, huh?   Uh, I thought Yharnam sprang up on top of the labrynth - as a result of blood healing and the further experiments with the splits in the school of thoughts from Byrgenwyrth?  Ie., Yharnam came to exist and thrive because of the blood, rather than being incidentally infected with it?    Dude, after several playthroughs with a dozen other toons, for whatever reason, my mage could not make it up that one arch with the two silver archers shooting him for the life of me!  And the last time I tried, a fucking black vagrant spawned right in the middle of the arch, blocking the path, and it proceeded to 1-shot me!  Good times!   Well, I think the weapons they do have are pretty great, and I'd take one or two unique weapons over a whole table of 20 axes that are virtually the same (aside fashion, of course), but still, give us a few more chunks and/or rocks in each play through or whatever so we can at least play around more with the few weapons that are there :D   Dude.  She plays it like she's one tough crow, but really she is a super sensitive softy and she's super pissed that you didn't talk to her when she was leaning against that fence that one time...   Or just run straight through it all :D   Well. What about the 3 dozen or so baby great ones up near the upper ward and orphanage?  They all are drawn to where Ebriatis is - seemingly pining to get back to what is possibly their mother.    Edit:  or are those Kin babies?  Like a precursor?  Because as a baby squid genuinr great one, we look muh different than the models used as ariannas baby.    Also. By true ending they mean it is the only ending in which you truly transcend the hunt. The other two endings have u repeat it in some capacity.     Did you kill Ron the funky caterpillar?  It so, you are blocked temporarily from going back there.    Thanks. It's a bummer to hear they made experimentation harder in this game. Shit, I'd rather get blood stone chunks instead of mad men's knowledge :/   You bet. I'm looking forward to it. Also, did you hear that they might be turning it into a movie?   For the chalice dungeons?  Yeah. I found a lot of the info on the spread sheets to be inaccurate or incomplete:  one dungeon had an extra rune in it, and another one said the blood rock is on level 2, but it was really on level 3.    Or, do you mean you've found blood rocks in  each of the dungeons, and now when you try to go to a different glyph dungeon with a bloodrock supposedly inside, you find he madmen's knowledge in its stead?   Haha.  I'm sort of in the same boat.  I bought the PS4 as an Xmas present for myself, then played destiny for a few hours before I quit because it was a totally shit game, but then I got into the last of us, played it on and off for a few weeks, and I haven't picked it up since.  I was just thinking recently, *"I should go to youtube and finish up the rest of the story,"* as I tend to agree with you - shooters with controllers suck, and as fun as those sort of mechanics are in general, I tend to tire of them pretty quickly.  Sure, it's kinda fun to stealth around and bash peoples heads in and fight off zombies, for a bit, but then it just starts feeling redundant, and now that BB is out, I don't see myself going back to finish the game.  I'll definitely look up the rest of the story soon!   I took out the master race thing, and just put "PC gamer."  It's not about being better than, but if I can play a game on a machine that performs and displays the game better, I will at every chance I can get, which means I will always choose a PC unless the game is an exclusive like BB.  As for the achievements, again, I personally don't care or see the importance unless it's a challenge run (again, for the fun of the challenge, not the badge), or unless it unlocks more content or in-game items.   Have you played the last of us?  It's the only other game with it for PS4 (dice it's exclusive). Definitely a solid story game, a once in a generation type experience.    Are you a PC gamer?  If so, that is probably why :P   I'm a PC gamer myself, so I don't get the point of it either. The only reason I really see achievements mattering is when it actually unlocks more content or gives ou ingame rewards :D   Edit: I totally get challenge runs and stuff like that, but there aren't any Cheevos in BB for completing those. They're just little badges saying you completed parts of the main PvE game.    Do you need red jelly?  It unlocks as a purchasable item in the insight store, but I don't know the trigger for it.   Edit - also, you should be able to find enough in the main game to open the chalice dungeon in the first place.    Really?  Fuckin aye!  I've been wanting to play that game so I am super happy to hear that!  Now I feel like the Bloodborne Player is starting to pull its own weight a bit more, and maybe I can stop calling it that :)   Edit:  But when will they make a new GoW game?    If you have the disposable income, sure it's worth it, but if not, I'd say don't do it if it's gonna stress your wallet.  There is The Last of Us remastered for PS4, which is definitely worth checking out and a great story of a game, but so far there are no other solid exclusives, or at least, games you can't play on other systems, and most games play better on PC anyhow.  Before BB, my PS4 was basically like a fancy paper-weight.  Maybe some more exclusives will come out (and next gen god of war plz?!) to make me think more highly of PS4 :D   In the pre-set dungeons?  No, there are no blood rocks in those, all the way down to the final boss :/   Lots of people have already completed Level 4 Beastbro runs (onebro equivelant in this game:  lowest level you can be with no leveling, though any base starter class qualifies so long as you don't level for the most part).     I'm working on one right now, and I'm just coming up on Shadows of Yharnam after clearing Cainhurst, and I can tell you that at 10 vitality for waste of skin starter class, most enemies and bosses kill you in one shot anyhow, so I don't see a vitality of 7 being all too different  :D   People need to shut the fuck up and mind their own business.  It's become way too common for people to interfere and be nosy with how other parents choose to raise their children.  There are far too many incidences of people misjudging a situation (which they have no business in, in the first place), say, seeing a kid being left in a car (on a perfectly cool day) for a minute, and calling the cops on the parent, even though the parent was just running in and out of the store for a quick minute.  Or god-forbid, you see a child playing outside, and someone calls the cops just because a parent isn't hovering over them.   The point is, all you pushy, needy, helicopter parents out there need to stop turning your children into pussies.  You're fucking ruining your kids.      Statistics show that most children who are abducted are kidnapped by relatives and friends of the famly.  I'm more wary of the strangers I know than the strangers I don't knot.  Stranger-danger was bull-shit hype.  Of course, shit happens, but such is life.   Stranger danger is bull-shit anyhow.  The majority of children are abducted by family and friends of the children.  Don't worry so much about the strangers you don't know, worry more about the ones you do know.  Of course shit happens, but that's life, and more power to the parents, but I totally get the concerns.  Alls it takes is one nosy-ass shit-head who can't mind their own business, and bam, you have family services or cops called when your children are perfectly fine.   Fuck this generation of pushy, needy, over-emotional helicopter parents.  They're only serving to weaken the species, turn little boys into little girls, turn all children into total sissies, and hindering the future of the current generations and our country.   Clawmark.  I often use the +30% and +20% ones.  Nothing like killing Gherman on NG+ in 4 visceral attacks.  That, and the +15 and +20% stamina ones.  For the oath runes, imo, the hunter's oath rune is the only one that doesn't suck balls.  I'm totally bummed Eileen got killed by Henryk on my level 4 beastbro run, so now I'm gonna be stuck using the shitty executioner rune :/   I agree.  I feel like Micolash was a wonky version of this.  It was so... anti-climactic.   Dude - you saying you don't like the Bag-Lady-Cultist look?  I rocked it for awhile until I put together Bone Ash and Crowfeather sets for a reaper vibe.  Though my level 4Bro is Lemmy fucking Kilmister, so he doesn't even need fashion to be awesome.   It's definitely not insight.  My level 4 Beastbro had over 10 insight before killing BSB, and they definitely don't spawn until after you kill the BSB.   I'm pretty sure you have to find her first before you kill Father G, as later, part of her dialogue is, "So you killed father G huh?"   So no one is sure if we are limited to one blood rock ever for each dungeon type?  Ie., I alrready collected 3 blood rocks from each of the loran, Isz, and Pthumerian dungeons.  Does that mean I will never find a blood rock in one of those types again, even if I use different glyphs?  (The three I found were using other people's glyphs, I have yet to explore the ones I originally created myself).   Yes, you can get blood rocks from the lowest depths chalice dungeons.  So far I have looted an additional three blood rocks from the lowest root loran, pthumeryn (sp), and isz chalice dungeon glyphs (two from the reddit spreadsheet, and one from fextralife), though I don't know if these are limited, ie., I don't know if you are limited to one bloodrock ever per chalice root type just like you are limited to one blood rock per play through for the main game, or if you can keep running different variations of a root chalice to farm blood rocks.  Can anyone confirm?  Thanks.   The level design in both games was awesome, and in bloodborne, the awesome design definitely hid how straight-forward and linear the game really is, though once you learn the maps in either DaS or BB, areas that once seemed sprawling and large really aren't sprawling or large at all.  Even if you have a few wider areas, most places are enclosed between walls and pits or fairly straight-forward paths.   That being said, I thought the variations within BB were pretty great, from gothic cities to the woods, to the nightmares, to the dungeons and so forth, but I'd rather them keep it focused, rather than trying to cram in a volcano world or any other number of cool environments that might not have fit, though hey probably could have implemented a marsh for sure, and maybe a snowy area (more so than the outside of Cainhurst castle which is very small).  Still, I'd rather see it focused like bloodborne, rather than overly ambitious and thus lacking in feeling and atmosphere.  Even then, Dark Souls design suffered a bit past Anor Londo due to time constraints, and DaS2 was definitely stitched and connected together the poorest out of all the games, though the areas (often small) were still fun to explore the first time around.      The problem is imo, Dark Souls is just one hell of a game to live up to, and it was so new and fresh and unseen in the gaming world (not including DeS here), whereas BB in all its different glory, is still sort of more of the same.  I bet if BB had been released first, and DaS came years later, we would be saying BB was better, because it made such a large impression on us, and you just can't beat nostalgia and that virgin feeling for games like this.   I think the statues are statues in yharnam, as they have base stands, and are very repetitive and numerous, and they are also larger than hunan size. The statues in yahr'gul do indeed look like people who were turned to stone just like pompei as they were fleeig for their lives, and this all happened when the nightmare ritual was completed after Rom's death (there are many indicators and notes in game hinting that rom is blocking communication with the great ones, ie, the lake is mud, the byrgenwyrth spider keeps the master (great ones) from us (the cultists), the spider is hiding the rituals)  nd even his name vacuous somehow indicates he is absorbing/blocking the red moon and the rituals)The rest of the people in yahr'gul look like they were fused together into massive lumps of human-flehipedes. It sort of reminds me of the way philosopher stones were created in the series fullmetal alchemist - you had to sacrifice a lot of people for that shit, and it is possible it was the same in yahr'gul.    I would ignore them, as the depth 3 ones are lacking in challenges and rewards IMO. By the time I completed the standard dungeon progression, I had more than enough materials to make 3-4 depth 5 glyph dungeons, and plenty of insight to buy more materials, and I quickly obtained 3 blood rocks in one day as well as the top tier of all my favorite runes.    Edit; as for the challenge, there's nothing like fightin a cannon armed undead giant as a regular enemy that is surrounded by dogs while a bell lady sends endless waves of red asshole spiders at you :D   I'm just glad iframes are no longer tied to stats :D   That being said, the worst thing to me about dodging while locked on isn't the movement, but some of the terrible camera angles, especially for large enemies. Staying locked on can be super handy, especially to take advantage of openings and to put yourself in favorable positions, but I've died more to the camera angles than the actual bosses themselves :/   Thanks for the ideas and tips. Going to cainhurst ASAP is a great idea. Sad to hear viscrals are out the window, but I've still been using parry for the free attack window and to ease the pressure off, but the difficulty has definitely has ramped up after Amelia. I don't think I have the patience for this shit tonight (I just died 5 times in a row in the same spot, mostly in one hits from the big axe guys). I think I'll play my main and go spill some blood in the chalice dungeons to unwind -_-   Did you get the bloodrock to +10 your weapon?  There is one in the main game in each playthrough.  I missed it on my first no help/spoiler/solo/blind run through, and NG+ was a bit harsh at first, and having a +9 weapon for most of it definitely sucked :D   My pro-tip - dodge/roll/strafe to any bosses right side, just get the timing right for their attacks, and never get greedy, and you can pretty much kill every boss in this game that way (aside the ones you should shoot to parry)...especially this asshole.  He once gave me a lot of problems and had me against a wall for a minute, but now he is trivial and I have farmed him several times, including his funky ass...sick version.  (Same method for Parl/Loran Darkbeast by the way)   Eh, even then, not all 5's and 6s and 10-20s are created equal.  I forget the exact way they said it was calculated...but yeah, gems in this game are kind of obnoxious :/   Dude.  I've gotten a bunch of rocks from various dungeons, but I have never seen a chunk to date, and that's with running all the lowest depth dungeons and root dungeons    Dude.  You say that now, but when you see the new saw cleaver soaps....   No parries?!  Why would you do that to yourself?!   Dude.  Don't get me started.  Sinh's stupid fucking 20 mile-span wonky ass hit box that one-shots you while being a mile above your head is total bull-shit     Did you use +flat damage gems on your weapons like raw enchants from previous titles?  Or did you use +%physical damage?  Did you experiment?  If so, which gems come out to be more total damage towards end game for Bloodbros?  Also, what were some of the most useful rune setups you found?  I have a few in mind, but I'll have to see how they play out.  Also, how dare you speak unfavorably about the Great Axe of Cheese!  It served you well!  It loves you!  It wants to make mutant alien babies with you!   But I thought you can't use the burial blade cuz of stat deficiencies?    Also, I have a few questions for you if ya don't mind.  It is a post of mine yet to be published that I copied/pastrad in draft form that I plan on putting up soon, once reddit stops giving me it's bullshit "you can't do that message:"    So, I just killed Vicar last night (Reindeer dog bitch ruined my no-death kill streak, then Hynrick proceeded to kill Eileen, and then me repeatedly), so I'm not too far into the game, but I was curious for the OneBros who are further in the game or who have beaten it, what has been your best option to pump up your damage, especially for visceral attacks?  For example, Even with a +3 or 4 hunter's axe with the only gems I have at around +2 or 3% physical attack, my viscerals on Heynryk were only doing around 100 damage, and that dude has a few thousand health, so I set that fight aside for later, though I'm pissed I can't get the only Oath rune worth a damn in this run-through, but I digress.    Another question in line with this is - has anyone found a build (combo of runes and gems) to really maximize visceral damage, and make it more worthwhile?  I mean, either way, it is a valuable move anyhow to buy time and avoid direct combat/damage, but I'm wondering what the end game numbers can look.    That being said, anyway, how does the damage look later on in the game with more options?  Ie, the +flat damage blood gems are pointless on say, my main high level toon with pumped STR/SKL, but for those who have come across the +flat damage gems on their onebros, do they wind up being the equivelant of Raw type enchants for your higher level weapons, and thus are better for OneBros?  I mean, I don't have any yet to calculate it myself (and no clawmark runes to pump damage either), but does anyone have the stats or info on how a +9 or +10 weapon on a OneBro looks damage-wise, specifically whether or not +% runes or +flat damage runes wind up being better?  Thanks in advance for your input, and any other tips or tricks are welcome as well.   Ah, ok, that explains why it seemed so wonky, as i'd double tap share to start recording, and it would seemingly then not record my next actions (ie, killing father G and cleric beast on 4Bro first attempts )   Dude.  BeastBro all the way.  FourBro just doesn't sound right :D  	105
 Bonus points for Spinning Attacks to the Body   the Head in WTF Taekwondo.  Bonus points for aerial strikes are awarded in ITF Taekwondo.   As a Taekwondo practitioner, winning a US Open Champion title isn't that huge of an accomplishment.  National-Level Tournaments where you have to qualify first before competing are where it's at and to my knowledge, Rogan has no record of competing at the National Level.  Not to say that he isn't a very experienced competitor.      AND TATER TOTS WITH CORN ON THE COB!!!   Couldn't they just ask Deathbolt himself how he got his powers?   I would argue that they are a majority in a minority, tbh.   Are detectives stupid?   There's a lot of rumors around my campus that ADHD and Dyslexia are just cover-ups for lack of concentration to learn.   How do you become a Surgeon with a brain disorder? It's not like it's by any means easy to go through all that certification, education, and training.   ROAST   The Cal State Fullerton Titans? College ball?   You mean how they eat?   Did you just link the same fucking video as in the title?   Not God; Grodd.   You mean Hyuga?   "....know his identity. He's very selective of who he wants to know and I hope you can respect that."  The fact that the Flash meets up with Iris and she still doesn't know his identity would piss her off if he said this.   Thank you friends.   Three shows?   Um, what the hell?   Where did Roy leave off to?   Respect, fam.  Keep on that grind.   College is fun now with no study habits.  I'm sorry... this is sarcasm, right?   Thank you.   That said though, I've found that WTF footwork gave me great ability to get in and other, but poor lateral movement.   - It's a common beginner tactic to slide back and forward rather than use angles.  For the more experienced fighters at my Dojang, we emphasize angles.  Most Taekwondo kicks travel down a linear line in order to reach their target so angling out at the same time as someone is about to chamber off-sets their attack and gives you time to counter-attack while they have to re-orient or reposition themselves.  Angles are quite common in higher belts but just back and forth motion is very common amongst lower belts.  We definitely practice lateral movement with ladder drills.  Ladder Drills are a staple of Taekwondo footwork training.    I've heard that this is less of a problem now because of electronic scoring being able to register the impact of a lead leg side kick and thus score it properly. Is that right?    - The Side Kick is one of the most powerful kicks in all of Taekwondo, in my opinion.  However, it's hard to score on someone's Hogu or eHogu (The Chest Guard) with a Side-Kick because of the side-on stance that Taekwondo Fighters adopt.  That said, we use front-leg side kicks very often at my Dojang as a "cut kick" or an attack that intercepts someone's forward movement and keeps them at range.  The Side Kick is the longest weapon in a TKD Fighter's arsenal.  Also, practicing proper technique for the Side Kick translates into the thrusting motion at the end of a Spinning Back Kick which is very often used to counter an opponent's Roundhouse Kick.  So to answer your question - it depends on the fighter and how they train.  I've sparred with opponents that consistently rely on their straight-line side kick and I've sparred with opponents that seldom use it or never use it at all.  Haven't seen a decreasing trend in it's usage though.  But, it's important to note that I've noticed a lot of fighters don't score on the Hogu with it.  Like I said, they use it to cram or push an opponent's ongoing attack or they'll score with a high side kick to the head.  EDIT: Hopefully I answered your question somewhat.   "Spinning Shit" is the epitome of Taekwondo and their destructive power is what defines the style, in my opinion.   "You are good enough to have submitted a BJJ black belt with guillotine and americana (Lyoto Machida, Vitor Belfort)  and everything, but that does not make you a black belt."  This is true.   Contra?   Hi, friend. Thanks for calling me over here.  I would like to share some thoughts of mine regarding the Taekwondo fighter, as I, myself, also come from an Olympic Sparring background and how he could've addressed some of these issues to sufficiently prepare himself in the Kickboxing match.  **1.  Boxing**  I'm just gonna point out the obvious here and say that Yong Soo Park did not work on his boxing enough or, seemingly, at all.  He would always keep his hands down in his fighting stance which is a huge no-no in kickboxing.  Also, his lack of experience with punches attributed to his weakness by lack of experience against punches.  As you've all noticed having watched the video - he had no response to any barrage of punches.  Every time he was overwhelmed, he would clinch up (WTF TKD style clinch) to avoid getting hit until the referee broke it up.  This is a habit learned in WTF Taekwondo.  In WTF Taekwondo, whenever someone is being flurried by kicks - they usually jam and clinch until the ref breaks it up, go for a high kick from close-clinch range (Think Crescent Kick - which can be done at very close range to the head), or move back while striking simultaneously. (Think Jumping Back Kick for the last one)  Because of his lack of boxing training, Park went in fighting Taekwondo-style instead of adapting and evolving his arsenal of attacks to fit in and survive in a Kickboxing or Muay Thai environment.  **2.  Checking the Leg Kicks**  As Lawrence Kenshin has pointed out, the classic side-on stance of Taekwondo makes the fighter a smaller target and allows them to move in and out quickly to find proper range for their kicks.  This could've worked to Park's advantage... had there been no leg kicks involved.  Again, like Kenshin said, the side-on stance makes it very difficult - almost impossible, imo, to properly check leg kicks and, therefore, Park was left taking the majority of all the leg kicks Kaoklai threw.  You could see how this affected him in later rounds - the guy looked like he was about to just give up.  Especially for a style of fighting that heavily relies on kicking to attack - leg kicks crippled him.  **3.  Lack of Diverse Kicking**  In my opinion, Park did not demonstrate his [full Taekwondo arsenal](http://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/31joyw/taekwondo_v_kickboxing_good_example_of_how/) during the bout.  He stuck to Mid   High-Leveled Roundhouse Kicks to, respectively, the body or the head.  Few times he threw Axe Kicks or tried to make use of a Spinning Back Kick but every time he did, from what I saw, he either missed completely or barely grazed his opponent.  You would think a Taekwondo fighter would fight to his advantage against a Thai Boxer by trying to overwhelm them with unpredictable kicks at every opportunity they can find.  **4.  Lack of Strategical Footwork**  In my experience with Olympic-Sparring Taekwondo we put a lot of time on footwork.  In-and-Out movements along with checking and feints to help us control the distance and bait out our opponent in order to trap them with whatever we choose - usually a counter-kick such as a Spinning Hook Kick which can be devastating if landed properly.  From what I've seen with Park, he didn't use any good footwork in his match with Kaoklai.  He either just stepped in to attack or stood there for Kaoklai to attack him.  This is a big reason why he couldn't use his full arsenal of Taekwondo kicks as stated in reason #3 above.  Without proper footwork to lead into various kicks, he limited himself to just throwing Roundhouse Kicks off the line - which in my opinion, did nothing to Kaoklai.    **5. NOT using his long reach to his advantage**  Kicks give more reach than punches do and in Olympic Sparring - taller fighters tend to ward off their opponents by using their reach to their advantage by keeping them at bay with long range kicks such as front leg Side Kicks whenever their opponent tries to step in to attack.  Park did no such thing against his much smaller opponent.  At [SIX FOOT SIX or 6'6''](http://k-1sport.de/en/database/show_fighter.php?id=1112), Park was by far one of the tallest Taekwondo fighters at the time and he could of easily used the strategy I mentioned in the last sentence to his advantage - yet he didn't.    **Additional Thoughts**   It's amusing see that a National Taekwondo Champion stripped himself of the best aspects of Taekwondo sparring when integrating into Kickboxing.  In my opinion, Kaoklai made him look like a White Belt - straight up.  Coming in with mid and high Roundhouse Kicks as his only attacks with predictable footwork only made himself an easy opponent for Kaoklai.  Wrote this on a short notice but these are the obvious issues that should be addressed.  May this video be of reference to any Taekwondo fighter looking into Kickboxing.  In my opinion, to be successful in Kickboxing or Muay Thai - you cannot be a Taekwondo Fighter that trains Muay Thai; you have to be a Thai Boxer that also, in addition to their Thai training, has had solid Taekwondo training as a plus.  Like /u/Carlos13th stated above regarding TKD techniques:   All the technqiues were valid technqiues and could work under the right circumstances but you need basic striking fundamentals to set them up and use them effectively in a full contact fight. They cannot be your entire game.  EDIT: Fixed formatting.   EDIT#2: Added in 5th point.   EDIT#3: Added in reference source material for Park's height.   Happy Cake Day!   much better gif.   fucking epic.   Forgot to mention Felicity had feelings for Barry at one point as well.   Yeah, I figured as much. :(   With the Arrow and Firestorm showing up and all that.  The trailer under the title "All Star Team-Up" showed all that.  I was really looking forward to seeing a battle against the Reverse Flash this episode - I even skipped out on a couple other things tonight just so I wouldn't miss it because I couldn't wait.  Not complaining, tonight's episode was cool but definitely not what I was hyped up for.   Have you seen that Street Fighter Web Series on the top row? It's really good.   Yet he constantly talks about how he stays grounded.   Holy shit, I thought that was just an ugly girl at first.   Can you kill someone and get away with it in Russia?   It's China. Whatever's cheap, remember?   As someone who does a Martial Art known for it's arsenal of kicks, I must say that Muay Thai kicks are not pathetic by any means.  They were designed to immobilize.   [Oh shit, they mentioned the infamous **Rabbit Kick** from Taekwondo](https://youtu.be/MLIEPff_mNw?t=12647)   If so, I'm an avid reader.   What if you gave her a 100 on Sex Appeal?   Yeah, but can your "science" explains why it rains? *Scoff*.   Bare knuckle boxing also breaks your fucking hands.   Dennis Quaid pulled a Christian Bale.   No shit, sherlock.   Isn't it crazy how homosexuals don't (can't even if they tried to) reproduce with each other yet straight people make more homosexuals all the time?   What the hell is that dog trying to fuck?

I'm gonna be honest - the reason I take my phone out and start browsing whatever I'm browsing is to avoid awkward moments in Public like, for example, if I arrived somewhere early and I'm waiting for my friends by myself.   Thank you friend.   I agree with you. Gotta point out though - his kicks were really fluid.  This guy has a good level of flexibility.   But eating more is the exact opposite of what I should do to lean out for abs, right?   Would you consider this body type - skinny fat?  EDIT: http://tinymuscles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/skinny.png                     Keep in mind this is TV Production quality, not King Kong Hollywood Quality.  That said, it's also 2015.

And I mean apologize directly to Eddie, not apologize through/to Iris.                  What illness did Kaori succumb to? All I know is that it affected the mobility of her legs. Was it ever explicitly hinted or stated?      Why does she keep claiming she can never get married whenever someone catches when she's indecent?  Whether it'd be her skirt blowing up, someone walking in on her undressing, or her parents showing her naked baby photos.  Is it a Japanese thing that you can't get married if someone sees you naked or whatever?   Even when standing or kneeling still, even when no one else is seemingly around he vibrates his vocal cords as well.  Why does he do this?    Eobard Thawne's original target was Barry Allen, but wouldn't killing Barry mean that his existence, or at the very least - his powers, would be erased?  EDIT: 8 minutes into EP17, and that's exactly what happened.  So why did he do it?      I've been training with the BoB (Body Opponent Bag) in my backyard without any mats for awhile now and I've been injured a couple times falling or rolling on my ankles on the hard concrete.  I think it'd be safer if I started putting mats outside my backyard so I can train with the dummy and not be afraid to fall.  Can any good mats for this scenario?   Despite whatever his true intentions are, he's been such a great mentor and family, even, to Caitlin, Cisco, and especially, Barry. While Eobard Thawne may be a genius who can easily cover his tracks and manipulates other people to his advantage, I honestly want to say that he genuinely does care about everyone in Star Labs, at least to some degree.  I'm really going to miss him giving sage advice to Barry and being a mentor and a true friend to him - even, if it's mostly all an act to get what he wants.  "We all want you to stay because we love you too... now, I am not a parent.  But, in many ways, you have shown me what it's like to have a son."   Always mind boggled me how some skinny guys (low bodyfat, lean) don't have low enough bf % to have a six pack showing.  Remember a lot of guys on the HS Cross Country team being really lean but not having a six pack.  Does that mean their bodyfat isn't low enough or...?     How do you take out the bar that's set up for squats in the power rack like so: http://www.showmeweights.com/PDGImages/Body%20Solid%20Pro%20Power%20Rack%201.jpg  to do other exercises like deadlift and barbell row.    What's the proper way to take it out and put it back in?                              To train in the ''Blue Belt'' program (Gracie Combatives) at the Gracie Academy in Beverly Hills is $130 for 4x a month and $160 for 6x a month. Each combatives class is an hour long.  How can a student expect to improve very much with only four hours of training a month?  My BJJ school is $100/month for 5 days of training/week. I definitely would not be able to afford the GA training and I know for a fact that it would take me forever to reach Blue Belt had I been limited to training for only 4x a month (due to cost).  Thoughts, opinions?

Obviously, there's a difference between a Grappler's Gi and a Karate Gi. But what about between different grappling arts?   Is there a sticky or anything for a thorough guide on proper weight cutting for Martial Arts competitions on this sub? I'm fairly new to weight cutting   I generally just don't eat or eat very little while drinking water to keep my hydrated which makes me really lacking in energy by day of weigh ins.   Miesha Tate was the first to survive past the first round and fought all the way to the third after having time to train against Ronda's Judo   that signature Armbar.  Everyone else has never made it past the the first round. So who can actually pose a threat to this beast?  The Royce Gracie of WMMA as some dub her.         The scene where Barry reverses all the damage that was done to the future by travelling back in time to stop himself from saving his mother.            Thoughts, opinions?   Imo, once again, Hollywood has changed the lead Asian character to "half-white" in order to appeal to major audiences.    Same reason why David Carradine replaced Bruce Lee as the lead role in *Kung Fu* and the original Chinese character was changed to half-white - because Hollywood cannot have an oriental face playing the lead role.  My only problem with him is he doesn't look Asian at all: https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rush-hour-pilot-cast.jpg?w=300 h=208 crop=1   It just seems like an illogical thing to do since they're just dehydrating themselves in an environment where water isn't as easily accessed.

Knifehand strikes, deep stances, back fists, etc. are incorporated in various Taegeuk Poomses. However, they are never practiced in sparring. What is the purpose in learning these various blocks and strikes in forms if we cannot apply them in live combat?            Does this quote really apply to BJJ? A lot of martial artists will say that a Black Belt only demonstrates mastery over the basics. This may be true in styles of Martial Arts where you can obtain a Black Belt in 2-3 years, but in BJJ, where it can take over a decade, I believe that congratulating a BJJ Practitioner on their Black Belt and saying, "Now you know the basics!," is an insult to their hard work and dedication.  I understand the meaning of the quote is humility but I, personally, would feel that if someone ever told me that upon being promoted to Black Belt, I would feel that they're undermining my training a bit.  Thoughts, opinions?   And is there a reason why we don't have fights the day of weigh-ins?    Thoughts, opinions?   Thoughts, opinions?   In all of the Buu Saga, Gohan transformed into a Super Saiyan 2 only once to fight against Kibito.  However, after he was ambushed and had his power drained by Spovovitch   Yamu, we never see him ascend to this level ever again.  Even in his following match against Dabura, Gohan only ascended to his first Super Saiyan state.  In Battle of the Gods, before going Ultimate, Gohan only transformed into a Super Saiyan as well, no further.  Why has Gohan neglected his ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 2, or is it rather he no longer has access to that transformation?  From what we've seen in the trailer for *Revival of F*, it doesn't look like Gohan ascends to Super Saiyan 2 either.  It's rather disappointing to see him no longer use a transformation that was so hyped up from the moment his character was introduced.  The battles against Cell   Bojack as a Super Saiyan 2 were epic.  EDIT: Downvotes? I'm new to this subreddit   I just wanted to have a little discussion...      Blocks like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/EVD-kumite-042.jpg  I've practiced them all the time in Taekwondo, Shaolin Kempo,   Karate. Down Blocks, High Blocks, Inside Blocks, Outside Blocks, Out-To-In Block, In-To-Out, Knifehand Blocks etc. are mostly used in forms or traditional "One-Step" Sparring Drills. However, we never use them as a part of sparring (expect maybe Down   High Block for Roundhouse Kicks) and I have no idea what the practicality or application of these would be in a street self-defense scenario or any kind of fighting scenario.  Are these blocks just for show? Are they practical at all?  I found a video of a TKD Instructor explaining how to use an Inside Block against a Punch but I find just moving out the way or parrying to be much more practical: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKfimAcKL5w spfreload=10   Blocks like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/EVD-kumite-042.jpg  I've practiced them all the time in Taekwondo, Shaolin Kempo,   Karate.

Might we eventually see things such as a Super Saiyan 5?! Super Saiyan 2 and 3 are nothing more than powered-up variations of Super Saiyan. After the fight with Beerus, Goku realized that mastering his normal state and Super Saiyan would raise his level more and sap less strength, so I think he probably wont become Super Saiyan 2 or 3 any more.  Super Saiyan 2 was already hyped down in the Buu Saga in favor of Super Saiyan 3,   now we won't even get to see Super Saiyan 3 anymore? I was really disappointed that Super Saiyan 3 didn't play a big role in BoTG. I thought it was amazing as a finisher in Wrath of the Dragon. Thoughts   opinions?  I've always wanted to see Frieza's personal reaction to Goku unlocking higher levels of the Super Saiyan transformation and I'd be disappointed if Goku doesn't demonstrate his new forms in Revival of F.  I may get a lot of hate for this but I thought the Super Saiyan God transformation's appearance looked ridiculous.  Also, does anyone want to see Gohan go Super Saiyan 2 again like in the Wolrd Tournament? We can tell by BoTG that he still has the option of going either Super Saiyan or "Ultimate/Mystic." By the trailer, it looks like he goes Super Saiyan but will he ascend to Super Saiyan 2?     Hi everyone, I'm test_subject387.  I lurk around a lot in this sub   I've made some posts every now and then.   In one of my threads many people went over an argument over a hypothetical situation regarding how well Bruce Lee would do in a fight versus a modern day fighter. I might get a lot of hate for this but there were a lot of misconceptions on both sides and I just wanted to express my opinion on them. I'd be grateful if you took the time to read before expressing your opinion.  And while I'm a HUGE Bruce Lee fan, this **is not** a "why Bruce Lee is the Greatest Martial Artist of All Time" post so I tried to keep everything closer to facts rather than opinion.  **Who is Bruce Lee?**   Bruce Lee is one of, if not *the*, most well-known martial artists of all time. He is famous for his short film career which left a global impact on the world, especially with *Enter the Dragon* being the first Hollywood produced Kung-Fu flick.   **So, he's just an action star?**   Aside from being a kickass movie star, Bruce Lee was a father, a husband, a dancer, and a life-long martial artist - being the founder of his own hybrid-martial art, Jeet Kune Do.  Bruce's philosophy on the martial arts for his time were considered radical. The notion of breaking out of what he considered "set styles" in order to become a complete martial artist through means of cross-training by taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't was revolutionary.  As a side note, Dana White, the President of the UFC, credits Bruce as being the "Godfather of Mixed Martial Arts."  What was unique about Bruce was that he studied various styles of martial arts, starting with Wing Chun and expanding onto Western Boxing, Jiujitsu, Savate, Judo and more. He used his knowledge to create, in his own vision, the most practical   efficient method of self-defense for street-fighting scenarios.  The hybrid martial arts style   philosophy of *Jeet Kune Do* is his legacy.  His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do," "The Art of Expressing the Human Body,"   "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method" illustrated his training methods and personal fitness routine.  Bruce's ideologies on weight training and exercise focused on making his body as functional as possible for fighting - keeping himself light, flexible,   strong in order to hit fast and hard.  His personal method of fighting focused on economy of movement, for example, he favors the lead leg, southpaw stance because, in his opinion, Bruce believed that the strongest side should be the side you put forward.  The Jab, whether it be in the form of a kick or punch, is the shortest distance between you   your opponent and therefore, it should be used with your strongest side forward.  Everything should be efficient, he believed.   His his own words, the best definition of his own interpretation of efficiency in fighting would be a glass of water.   *"Water is the softest substance in the world, yet it can penetrate the hardest rock.  Water is also insubstantial. By that I mean you cannot grasp hold of it, you cannot punch it and hurt it."*  *"Be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."*  tl;dr: A fighter must be fluid, ready to adapt to any opponent.   **So you're saying the guy was a fighter? Prove it. There's no professional record of him in existence.**   I want to make it clear.  It is *obvious* that Bruce Lee was no professional fighter.  Aside from winning a High School Boxing Tournament while in Hong Kong and various alleged streetfights, there is no existing fighting record regarding Bruce Lee.  Also, other than demonstration footage and low quality training footage, there is not very much visual evidence to cite his level of skill.    However, the man trained his entire life to be the most efficient fighter he can possibly be - always reaching to surpass his limits.  As Linda Lee stated in the documentary, *"I Am Bruce Lee,"* Bruce would always play flipped footage of Muhammed Ali (because Lee is a Southpaw) and analyze his movements hoping to fight him one day.  While it sounds ridiculous to compare Lee to professional champions past   present, it just goes to show that Lee would have taken any challenge thrown at him.  The man was not afraid to prove himself.  So was he a professional fighter?  Not by any means but does this mean he wasn't a fighter?  I'll leave it up to you with this analogy: If you practice martial arts but never compete, are you still considered a fighter?  **How do you think Bruce Lee would do in the Modern MMA world?**  Bruce Lee was a complete martial artist.  He studied various styles of striking along with grappling as evidenced in his illustrations and notes printed in *"The Tao of Jeet Kune Do."* Bruce's philosophies of taking what is useful   rejecting what isn't when regarding cross-training is the underlying definition of what MMA is.  However, MMA is a sport that has evolved through hundreds of bouts.  In order to be a good MMA Fighter, one must train under the rulesets of the sport to maximize what they can do in the cage.  Simply put, while having trained in and mixed various styles of martial arts, Bruce Lee is not an "MMA" Fighter.  Modern Mixed Martial Arts is the epitome of how martial arts have evolved over time to the highest level suited for the cage and, as stated earlier, Bruce Lee wasn't training for that kind of environment.  It's still fun though to speculate how Bruce would've done against modern fighters in and out of his would-be weight division, but at the end of the day, Bruce wasn't training for a competition-style environment.   **You still haven't answered the question, would Bruce Lee do well in the UFC?**  In today's UFC roster with the skills   knowledge he had before his death? Probably not. The sport has evolved into a mix of striking and grappling suited for the rules of the cage.  However, it would've been interesting to see how he would've done in the early UFC Tournaments where it was still style v. style.  In my opinion, Bruce's diverse arsenal of techniques would've taken him far in those early tournaments.   **In Conclusion?**   Bruce Lee isn't some sort of unbeatable God of a fighter or anything along those lines nor did he claim himself to be.  He was, however, a highly-respected martial artist that was ahead of his time, the founder of Jeet Kune Do, an international movie star, and a family man.  **Anything else?**  I wanted to repost an old comment of mine from /r/mma where there was a argument that Bruce was just an actor and nothing else.  While it repeats some of the things I've stated above, it also goes into detail on some of the topics I touched on.  It has to do a lot with Bruce's *actual fighting style* as opposed to what we've seen on-screen in the movies.  Regarding that subject here is my personal opinion on it:  A lot of people on /r/MMA will claim that Bruce Lee was an actor and nothing else, which is inaccurate. Bruce, before anything else, was a Martial Artist. The techniques and philosophies that he trained in and preached were definitely revolutionary for his time. The ideas of taking what is useful and rejecting what isn't, how styles are a crystallization, and to be a complete martial artist - one must cover all their bases were ingenious and are what Modern MMA Fighters apply today. A lot of people will say Bruce was a flashy fighter, but what they don't realize is his on-screen style is completely different from what he preaches for fighting. He just knew what would look nice on camera, and obviously what looks nice on camera may be less than applicable in real, live fighting. Bruce's fighting style emphasized economy of movement. His books, "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" and "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," which explains his ideas regarding fighting, are very scientific. His concepts were very unique, for example, he puts his strong side forward instead of back because he believes that the lead leg and the lead hand should be your strongest side for it covers the least amount of distance required to reach your opponent. A "signature" move in a lot of his movies is the Spinning Heel Kick, AKA "Dragon Whips His Tail." However, in his book, "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method," he claims that the technique is too high risk in order to rely on and favors the Turning Back Kick when regarding kicks. The Turning Back Kick is now a common move taught in Muay Thai striking for MMA Fighters and many fighters have utilized it in their fighting career. It really shows how he favors realism, applicability, and practicality over flashy theatrics when it comes to real fighting. Not to say flashy moves do not work, we've seen plenty of instances where "spinning shit" ends in knockouts, but they're risky moves and Bruce favored what was more reliable. What's ironic is Bruce actually preferred low kicks to high kicks because they're easier to land and you have more targets: the kneecap, the groin, the solar plexus, the liver, etc. Also, regarding grappling which is a staple of MMA, Bruce's book shows that he had researched Judo and Jiu-Jitsu and the illustrations in the book portray various submissions such as chokeholds and armbars along with throws.  (Original Comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2qpb4z/boxing_and_bruce_lee_the_five_ways_of_attack_my/cn8eei8)  -If you've made it this far without wanting to Spin Kick my face off, I just want to thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm happy to hear any and all of your comments and opinions whether positive or negative. Thanks again :)  EDIT: Grammar, clarity, etc.  Had the urge to write this on a short notice, sorry if it's sloppy.      Aside from all these crazy memes, I've heard people say he's a World Karate Champion or something along those lines and that's how Bruce Lee came into contact with him but I've never seen anyone post any actual sparring footage or competition footage of him fighting. Is Chuck Norris legit? Anyone seen any good videos of him fighting? (No movies)      I noticed that my flexibility is compromised especially the day after the day I do squats (I try to go as deep as possible without compromising form). My legs are sore, I'm slower, I'm stiff and it takes a lot more effort to kick high and even when I try I don't think I can kick high as I can prior to leg day.  A lot of the guys at my gym have a rule that they don't lift any weights the week of competition to avoid any type of lagging soreness and I think I'm going to adopt that rule.   How would you stop weightlifting from compromising your flexibility and freedom of movement?  I'm currently doing Stronglifts 5x5 for my weightlifting regime which focuses on full body workouts based on major compound exercises such as Squat, Deadlift,   Bench Press.      /u/PhilosophyOfTheWorld asked why the Reddit logo on the front page was "My Little Pony" for a particular day and the rest are deleted comments.  http://i.imgur.com/BRS7b3j.png   Where he fights a guy who predominantly uses consecutive chains of punches, Chan just slaps or parries them out of the way until he can find an opening.   What style of Martial Art practices that? I noticed it's used a lot in Chan's modern Kung Fu-oriented films as well as other martial arts genre movies.  I know boxers practice parries, but nothing to that level.  Also, is this a real technique or is it just for show?  I don't think it's Wing Chun, though the description sounds like it is.  He also uses various "Traditional" Martial Arts blocks against punches, the kind of blocks you see in a form.  I've always been impressed by how inventive Chan uses those blocks in the choreography of his movies and wondered if those blocks would actually work in a real fight.  On a short notice, I can't find an incredible sequence from him but I managed to pull this short scene out of Supercop. It demonstrates the traditional martial arts blocks I talked about earlier and the hand slap blocks early in the clip.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR4d7r6--I4 spfreload=10         I know there's many BJJ schools out there without Black Belt instructors. In those cases, the instructor may be a Brown Belt training for his Black.  Are Brown Belts allowed to promote their students? Is there a minimum belt ranking you have to be to have students and promote them?     	132
 Not many meals slipped free of Gerards sweaty palms. His sausage-like fingers barely grasped food long enough before his yellowed teeth ground down the substance that only further added to the padding surrounding his innards. In laymans terms, Gerard was fat. Ghastly overweight. A bubbling heap of gastric swelling asterisked by jelly rolls for arms, vats of bacon grease for legs and a cherry on top that left one wondering where the neck ended and the head began. Yes, Gerard was a sight for sore eyes  in life. Now in death  or the suspended state of animation hanging somewhere between the grips of life and death  Gerards presence was no worse for wares.   It happened innocently enough. Two weeks ago Gerard, or G, as he was commonly known to those close to him, was working the night shift at the security desk of the Center for Disease control in Atlanta. On one hand it made perfect sense: the CDC was fortified to the hilt, yet still someone had to remain on hand in the event an elevator shut down, emergency services had to be called or, simply, just to keep an eye on the janitorial staff. G, never one to sit for long in public without snoring as if he were sound asleep or sweating like a suspect in an interrogation room, was the obvious first choice the night shift. Out of sight, out of mind. Thats was the best way to utilize a man who tipped the scales at close to 350 pounds.  On this particular night, G sat uncomfortably in his chair  after all, outside of beanbags and moo moos, its certainly hard for a man of his stature to get comfortable anywhere else  racking up heap after heap of chicken bones as he watched reruns of Golden Girls. Each soda only added another exclamation point to an already devastating health report filled with warnings of high triglyceride counts, diabetic concerns and an array of heart conditions.  Blanche always did it for Gerard, and his greasy chicken-covered hands began to move south of the equator as he twisted his neck from side to side as a precautionary glance for any oncoming threats. Seeing none, G chuckled to himself knowing full well only one thing would be coming tonight.  As his right hand rubbed the outside of his pants and gently stirred the sad excuse for a penis nestled deep, deep beneath his waist line, Gerards eyes remained locked on Blanche. Every cut to Sophia brought a hint of guilt, akin to that of a man with deeply-rooted grandma issues. But the slightest of jump cuts to Blanche got his genital neurons roaring again. Thank you for being a friend, Blanche. Thank you indeed.  All the while as Gs hand continues to awaken the overweight dragon below, Larry, the CDCs Master of Janitorial Arts waited for the perfect time to slip out of the shadows and walk his way past the front desk. In his pocket was the vile of Virus H1-93-D, his easy pay day and quick ticket out of the sordid South. From there all he would need to do was meet his buyer at the Greyhound station, make the exchange, and be well on his merry way. Hed played the scenario out in his head countless times, but now found himself playing and replaying to the soundtrack of a masturbating whale.   Minutes later when Gerard was complete (Did he pull a muscle or orgasm?, thought Larry), the janitor waited for the security guard to make his way to the bathroom for a clean-up in aisle one. That time never came. In fact, G sat unfazed by his actions and merely returned to chomping on legs of greasy chicken and grunting in amusement at those wacky, seasoned southerners on the TV before him.  Shit, thought Larry. Shit. Shit. Shit.  It would have to be quick and casual.  Heyyyy G, Larry said with his long, drawn-out drawl. How you been man?  Unmoved by the janitors presence, G merely waved him off and said, You know, you cant surprise me Larry. You have more keys than a gatekeeper, and that gimpy leg only further blows your cover. If this were Dungeons and Dragons, youd have totally blown your D20 roll on Move Silently. Gerard laughed again, only to himself. No one else ever found Gerards jokes to be funny or, frankly, to make any sense.  Right man, Larry said, patting down his keys that up until moments ago were at the base of his wash bucket. Nothing gets past old G.  No way, no how, Gerard proclaimed.  Aight man, Larry said. Im done for the night. Gonna head home, squeeze one out and call it a night.  Gerard glanced eerily at Larry, wondering just how long it had been since erupting in his pants and having this conversation. Long enough, thought Gerard.  OK, he finally said, turning his attention back to the screen. Ill see ya.  Larry grabbed his bucket and headed toward the exit, adjacent to the storage closet where he kept his cleaning supplies. Already he could see the wads of cash, the cocktails on tropical beaches, surrounded by beautiful women in bikinis  no, topless!  reacting lavishly to his every beckon call. What he didnt see was the greasy puddle of bones and chicken sinew waiting in the center of the tiled floor like an unavoidable trap for a hungry animal in the wild.  Larry lost his balance on his good leg and, unable to adjust on his bad one (damn you high school football!), flopped straight onto his back losing all control and slamming hard onto the floor. As if in slow motion, the vile of H1-93-D flew from his pocket and landed in a smash of glass at the foot of Gerard.   At first G failed to register the gravity of the situation, but by the time he reacted with his sloth-like reflexes, hitting the red quarantine button that would bring down the house, as he liked to say, Larry had already escaped through the front door.   From the outside looking in, Larry watched as the heavy-plate steel curtains crashed in around the building, locking in G and anyone else unfortunate enough to be within the confines of the CDCs downtown offices. All of Larrys hopes and dreams were dashed right before his eyes. But given the power of the virus, he was lucky to escape with his life. That is, moments before he realized that in a fit of utter hysteria he had limped so far from the facilities that he was standing in the middle of the local truck route. To this day no one knows how he didnt hear the truck coming, but it was probably all for the better. When the authorities found him the virus had obviously taken hold, but the only part of his body still moving was a twitching finger and the toes at the end of his bum leg.  Gerard on the other hand was luckier. Or perhaps unluckier, as it may seem. He lived. Or maybe he died, only to live again. Whatever the case, his reaction to quarantine the building was the correct response in that sort of situation. On that front, his training had paid off, saving the lives of countless research scientists who proved to be more valuable to humanity than Gerard would ever be. On the other hand, G became the only specimen known to display the results of an H1-93-D infection, rendering him to the state of a circus animal amidst the crowd of bewildering analysts and doctors.  G, the man who was hardly a threat to anyone but himself, now remained no threat to those around him thanks to his own quick-thinking but slow-moving actions. Ever in a zombie-like state during the overnight shifts, it was now his absolute pleasure to no longer have to exert one more iota of energy. He merely sat in a pit surrounded by glass walls separating him from the scientists, merely existing on a diet of road kill and dog food.     Why is it people so easily forget about the serviceable aspect of technology when it inconveniences them?      Truthfully, I don't think they're even looking for money. It's a labor of love through and through. But they do have bins if you want to drop stuff off.   It's broken down by subject. When you first walk in its Sports, Sci Fi, and research books. Then there's a whole room for fiction and mysteries, along with a shelf of his personal picks. In the back section they have history, world history, tech books, and sciences. Don't hold me to that exact breakdown, but all in all it's about three rooms and probably 100-150 shelves full of free books.   Honestly outside of checking for hours and skimming the FAQs, I didn't go into the site much. However I heard someone walking the aisles telling her friend that it was started by a guy who ran a bar.  Just checked the website now that I'm back at my desk and came across this video. Didn't realize the guy stocking the shelves was the one who started it all:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRfysnRDCKA  (Also, guess I just answered my own question hah)   Cool. Good to hear. While I have your ear, do you have any idea about the back story to the place? How it started? How it functions? These are questions my girlfriend and I were wondering as we browsed the aisles.    Had the pleasure of spending Valentine's Day weekend in Baltimore and, per the usual, did a search for local bookstores. I came across this awesome place called "The Book Thing." I didn't realize why it was called that until I got there. You don't buy books. You don't even trade books. You literally just walk in, browse shelves and take whatever you want, as many as you want. I left with about 10 or so, ranging from Malcolm Gladwell, Stephen King, Le Carre and Michael Crichton.  Part of me felt obligated to at least hand some stuff over in exchange, so thankfully I had about a dozen books in the trunk I was looking to donate. It's not required, but as far as I'm concerned it's a small price to pay for what is essentially one of the coolest book THINGS I've ever seen.  Has anyone ever been?   http://www.bookthing.org/   I love the simplicity of his voice, yet the complexity of his stories. I like feeling as if he's sitting there telling me the story every time he breaks off and puts things into layman's terms (for example, in Breakfast of Champions).  I sometimes wonder if authors like Vonnegut were successful because of the times they were writing in, not so much the topics they covered. Of course, he wrote his stuff in a post WWII world and took an anti-war stance on practically every subject, but I guess what I'm really asking is, would Vonnegut be as popular as he is if he released Slaughterhouse V today? I don't know if there's really an answer to that question. Just throwing it out there as a subtopic, I suppose.   And as a side note, there's something that has ALWAYS bothered since Vonnegut passed away, starting with the exact day in which he passed. Quite possibly one of the greatest authors of the 20th century passed away two months after Anna Nicole Smith. While the courts were still going through the "who gets custody of her kids" story, Vonnegut was demoted to a mere side note in papers and news programs at the time. Meanwhile, a news story that was two months old remained above the fold.    As a Penguins fan it was actually my first impression as well. It can go either way I guess. As a teammate of Letang's, you have to see it as dirty though, hence the scuffle.    Can't be true...right? I mean, the dude was a monster and all but 22 pounds at birth?   Story here: http://www.badlefthook.com/2015/2/11/8022359/crumbling-mountain-the-body-of-primo-carnera  1934 footage of the fight mentioned in the article:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf67JevtNcc   When's the next library sale?   100% agree with your statement about his fans. Probably the only thing worse than him.    Wasn't it intended for children?  Yup, I do believe so. Although writing for children in the 1930s/40s, if this book is any indication, seems to be a bit more cerebral.    Yeah, can't say I've heard of that one. Interesting.    As far as trilogies go, I really liked The Strain, although I was fairly disappointed with the last book. Anyone ever read em?   Funny you should say. I'm actually on the very first book of the series and can't wait to tackle the next (which consequently inspired this thread).   If "Women" and "Tales of Ordinary Madness" are any indication, then I'd have to go with a very firm "yes." It seems like he had a lot of self-confidence issues growing up, which has been mentioned in one of the previous comments in this thread. So in an effort to maybe cover up that universal truth, he masked it with degrading comments about women and fictitious sexual interactions with them.   I often sometimes wonder if Bukowski would've been well-renowned in any other decade outside of the 70s.     What's your favorite trilogy or series of books?   Is this based purely off his works or for more personal reasons?   Well, that could explain why I couldn't find CS Lewis' comment then haha. Thank you   My favorite critic of Tolkien is CS Lewis. Apparently the two were friends, tied together in some way through Oxford I believe. Anyways, Lewis apparently once (jokingly?) bashed Tolkien when asked to read a passage from one of the LOTR books. I can't remember the exact quote, but it was somewhere along the lines of, "This isn't about singing dwarves again, is it?" I'm trying to dig it up on Google right now but I can't seem to find it. I always found some solace in the fact that even Tolkien's friend, and another famous writer in the genre, couldn't stand his works.   I've actually debated whether I should consider reading more than one at a time. At times I struggle with keeping interest in one that didn't exactly pique my interest, and find that I'd rather not read at all than subject myself to it. However, I've always maintained the one rule that no matter what I have to finish a book. So, the beat goes on, however long it may take to finish.   	24
 NEVER go full retard!   Oh, hey wrestlefan!   just cobra plz   Could i possibly have that cobra also PSN:test_subject3919   An combined w/ the bee its the better sniper for bosses   I Just need the slag hawk now.   your beards made my day.

Just ask if you want a gun and I will give it to you if I have it, hell; I'll even dupe my whole inventory. PSN: test_subject3919  Edit: even a singularity w/ a low fuse time instead of the quasar will work, but preferably the quasar.   Thanks so much I didn't think of making a new lvl 1, don't know why but whatever. I found out you cannot trade it or drop it though so i can't give it with a second pad from my other lvl 50 axton who dose have it.   I just finished a playthrough to try and get all the legendary solo and before the warrior fight I sold everything I thought was garbage... including my loot relic. Is there any way to get it back?   God damn it dude flag it NSFW! I'm at work!   Ha, ours is named lucy too!

Just finished this map earlier today with my buddy.   He's most probably referring to the [band](http://www.noahandthewhale.com/). (I've got your back ronry!)   I use dual turrets with sheilds ad a distraction so i can keep my bee up         Ummmm, just so you know if you drop the head, dashboard or turn off the xbox. You keep it and they get it too, but make sure they pick it up first if they are in your game. :D that's waht duping is.   this post contradicts itself            Day After Tomorrow GIF?   If you pair stuff up correctly like the bee and the sandhawk you can deal massive damage. I highly reccomend doing reaserch on legendary guns if you're into the game.      I'm assuming you mean DLC, and yeah, kinda short tho so be sure to take your time and not use any OP guns if you want it to last.   My dad was sitting at the table and I asked him if he would like some peanut butter on his toast. He replied "Yeah, put some of that green stuff on there!" We went to the eye doctor after breakfast.   Don't worry. jackenstine isn't what you think it is.   Jackenstine drops it. It's a e-tech smg with the red flair text saying "by the people, for the people" when you shoot it the bullets kind of teleport. I got rid of it because i ended up in this weird dupe-fest with a couple of guys. I'm just wondering if i should farm for it if it's any good.   MMM!

Last time I became lucid it was because i was having a totally normal conversation with a girl i kindof like, but she was naked and I was fingering her.   I usually take it up my nose. That's the best way to get the substance into your system.   OR MONEY!   No, could you still dupe me it though?    **I CAN USE INUENDO TOO! TONIGHT IT'S THE VAULT HUNTER VERSUS FLY BOY!!!! BLOWJOBS!!**   DOSEN'T HE KNOW THAT IT'S UNHEALTHY TO REMOVE A FLASHDRIVE WITHOUT EJECTING IT PROPERLY!   sweet, thatnks so much PSN: test_subject3919   Jaetman   I can give them to you after I get them, add me PSN:test_subject3919   Dude, that's awesome im jelous!   all I have is a caustic infinity, shock infinity, rapid infinity, and purging infinity, and I have no heads. Is there any way you could just dupe them for me? (drop them on the ground and turn the PS3 off without saving so we both keep the guns). And even before that I could just dupe my entire inventory like I said.   I can just give them to you.   I can dupe you the siren, and do you have a sweet fibber or a sweet sandhawk?   I have quite a few legendarys, including all legendary class mods except gunzerker, and other random shit, just ask.   [I'm so mature!](http://rlv.zcache.ca/thats_what_she_said_print-r79acb1096c5a46319fa318817ec8fc1c_2sor_400.jpg)    To be truthful I haven't gotten into multiplayer that much either so I'd be down to do that if I have time.   yeah just store stuff first.   I'm online now i just sent you a request    Dude, I'll just dupe you everything lol!   I'm pretty sure this one's a mural, in Montreal they have tons of huge murals on roads and buildings. I've never seen this one before but i have seen lot's. I live in the neighboring province so I have taken a few trips over, but I really don't know.   I can dupe you my stuff too.   Add me, I can dupe you and you don't need to give me anything.   The Incredibles!!!!!!   After you get it, can you dupe it for me?   What are you on, if ps3 i can dupe you a electric infinity, and do you have a legendary commando class mod?   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand no one's gonna!   I don't think you fully understand how this meme works......   [In regards to the 4th pic](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/314/1/6/beautiful_squidward_by_archangel_twilight-d4fsfmm.jpg)      I thought even writers were considerd devs. Oh well!   Yeah, what trippySG said, and you'll want to have a good sheild like the bee or the Impaler  The bee is dropped from: Hunter Hellquest (easier to get, he's in the arid boneyards in that building up on posts right across from spawn, and you need to do a mission to unlock the ability to fight him) The Impaler is dropped from: the warrior  Plus a good fire SMG will kick butt, if you do the maximum tip for moxie she'll give you one, I think. The damage is usually around 4000 and the fire rate is pretty high.   I'll Dupe you my hellfire or hornet, and maybe you could spot me a conference call?  PSN: test_subject3919   I'll trade for; it I'm cool with trading: the bee, hellfire, hornet, longbow, rolling thunder, and the Impaler for that stupid gun I cannot get to fucking drop!  Im on PS3 User: test_subject3919   Can I trade a Hellfire or the longbow for a Conference call?   *slow clap   Did anyone get the the ad at the bottom with Stephen Harper giving a thumbs up that just fucking made the post 999999999299999% better!   yeah, I think that was the original intention for her character, but not everyone took the joke that way, and if you watch the YouTube channel "hey ash; whatch playin" Ashely Burch, voices that character and it makes it a lot more enjoyable because that is a damn good YouTube channel, also her brother on the channel was a borderlands dev!     I never play co-op on PS3 because I don't have any friends who also play on PS3, I just recently beat it and now I'm farming legendary weapons and i have like 6, so you don't need more that one, to have fun....... I'll just let myself out........   http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090810142260/uncyclopedia/images/4/43/The_Ultimate_Wizard.JPG   "I'm a nigger, blah blah blah, faggot faggot faggot!"

Easy 6hrs I think of game-play.   faggot   [yep](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lf175qiKmD1qf3n9ko1_500.gif)   I got that at level 28, such a fucking beast!   MOTHER FUCKING BUBBLES!!!!   oh...fuck yes!   get it for pc, there's a multi player mod   I watched a video of streaming before a bomb hit; it was just plain terriying.   I check to see if I can see the rim of my glasses.   i came.   Nice job, jackass; you broke the universe!   you glorious bastard.   Exercise first, like do as many push ups you can then do one more, take a break then do sit ups in the same manner.   YES THEY DO! GOHHD!   It was really just an accident, I kinda gave up on lucid dreaming because I had some real life stuff to deal with, then never picked it back up. _____________________________________________________________  So I was talking to a friend of mine from 5 years ago, after the conversation I walked into a high rise and took an elevator to what I think was my floor (the top pent house) went into the bathroom and brushed my teeth not paying attention to anything in the room caught in  thought about the conversation. I recalled the events of conversation noticing it was a dream. I followed the events up to where I was standing. i looked in the mirror and my hair was orange and i had lots of freckles ( I have no freckles and blond hair) I walked out of the bathroom into a room with a grand window. The a lady with a terrifying face burst through the door and rammed me out the window I managed to start fly and it lasted for what felt like 15 mins. I'm definatly going to keep try to lucid dream now!   God, I'm racking my brain so hard to try and remember what game this is!   YES YES FUCKING YESSSSSSSS   *kissy kiss   [my first thought](http://cdn2.worldofminecraft.com/images/minecraft_creeper_4381_preview_RE_Minecraft_mob_grinder_tower-s256x256-117559.png)      [u wot m8](/10guy)   (-(-(-(-(-(-(-(-(-(- -)-)-)-)-)-)-)-)-)-)-)-) fuck you i have ninjas   Have not played ac3 but, I have enjoyed dishonored immensely.

That gave me cancer.   I know it's run of the mill but I'm loving borderlands 2 so much right now or if your looking for something inexpensive, Borderlands 1 game of the year edition it comes with all dlc's and has tons of actual hours of gameplay then after you beat it, you can try to get all of the super awesome guns. Plus co-op and single player are perfectly balanced.  	121
 I also have the newest one. Into the nexus. Is that okay if I do that?   Alright then, and I have the R C collection for ps3 that features Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando, and Ratchet and Clank: Up your arsenal. I no longer own a ps3.   Yes very much so!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply! Message me!   Thank you!!!! Someone not judgmental. Appreciate it. :)   Which ones do you have? Also have the newest one. Into the Nexus. I'd have to take another look but I'll keep you updated my man!   Like what?   I sold my ps3 but miss Ratchet and Clank too much. Thank you.   I watched first season and a little of second and not a lot caught my attention. Does it get a lot better?   I'm a new Chronos and I don't think that the build I'm using now is too good. Any long time Chronos players got a good build?   I fool you not sir, this was one of the smallest amazing thing I've ever seen.      I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post on. If it isn't give me the right one please but anyway. In January my family and I had discovered my sister had developed a nasty addiction to heroin and prescription pills. We sent her to rehab and she had gone for 4 months and she had just gotten out last week. The day she got out she relapsed, she started using cocaine. She had confessed to my parents and I. We had no clue what to do, so we started taking part in IOP (intensive out patient). She goes 3 times a week and gets tested, she has been passing but even so my parents have been super anxious, my parents are divorced. My dad does not show too much emotion but he does eat a lot of sugar and he has diabetes which is clearly not good for his health. My mom who I live with predominately has been pushing a lot of home renovations on herself and I. She said to me today "I rearrange furniture in my own house cause it is the only thing that I can control." I can't get it out of my head, it is just something that I thought was so deep. She does everything around the house and pushes way too much work on herself. My sister is in Vineland and then off to Woodbury if anyone knows where that is. I'm so anxious and so are my parents. Anything we can do you guys think we can do to calm our nerves? Thank you.   Damn I want that now   This is what's up. The name is awesome too.    I love Apollo he is hands down favorite character in game. There's just one thing he lacks. Skins. Anyone got some cool Apollo skin ideas?  	15

 there's nothing more fun than looking back at the things you made in elementary school. if you're a parent, please save all your kids stuff.    this is my favorite thing i've seen all week. granted, it IS Monday, but i stand by what i said.    yes, i totally owned that.    what was this from?   I'm still mad at my brother for throwing mine down the stairs and breaking it. I told him this recently.    Great work!   you should be a tattoo artist!    I have the same TV. just thought you should know.    i love this. a lot.    I just let out a big ol' "awww" at work.    because he invented anti-cancer.    this made me laugh a lot, despite the fact that 32 people were most likely killed right after.    she actually did a few of those as well. and the Treehouse Times. a lot of those huge mega corp books hire out other people! bastards!  	13
 Barlene!  A kitten, hat-off, huh? (like a dance off. but with kittens and hats instead of my sweet moves)   "I'm the mascot of an evil corporation."   My dog, Gregory,  does the head tilt.   Bruce is kind of a weird one.   Perhaps he was a dog in another life.  His favorite thing to do is play fetch with this random ceiling fan chain.  Only that chain though.  He will run for it and bring it back compulsively.  Adorable.  	3
 I kind of hoped she would. Would be more interesting than the lecture.  All I could gather was that I could pat an elephant and would be yelled at.     That is an amazing photo.  Great work.    Did you guys get hit with the overly excited Student Travelling people about going on a safari or something.   Had about 3 of them in different lectures yelling about how good it is.     I'm thinking on doing a Red vs Blue viewing and hangout sort of a thing but am wondering is there are any fans in Newy?   Good call, you have my follow.     Just behind the ferry port on the Newcastle side at the brewery has had some seriously good results.     Internet    What do you do?   	8
 Completely unrelated, but he reminded me of what my grandpa used to say. He was born and raised out West.   "On windy nights, listen to the wind, if you hear the door rattle more than twice in a row, don't get up, don't speak and whatever you do, don't check outside, because thems the dead, tryin' to trick you and once you let them in, they never leave, and not all of em is nice"   Yeah, this isn't as gruesome as the title says.   I was talking to my sister earlier and we were remembering some of the stuff from when my grandma was alive.   My grandma was born in 1936(she died two years ago)   There was a story I remember her telling my sister and I once that goes something like this.   When my grandma was a little girl, about 7 or so years old. Her dad found a scrawny little black dog. My grandmas dad according to her, was a big, tough guy that had a soft-spot for dogs, so he brought it home.   My grandma said that this little dog was really weird, it just walked around looking at everything or sat there staring into space, didn't bark, didn't play, and it barely ate, so it always stayed skinny. She also said it stunk constantly, no matter how many times they bathed it.   About a year after they found the dog, it got kicked by one of their horses (mind you she said this was a little terrier sized dog) Well, the dog simply got up, shrugged it off and walked away, when they checked the dog over, it had no broken bones at all.   A couple of years later, her mom accidentally ran the dog over with her car and the dog "died" so her dad took the dog out into the woods and buried it in a shallow grave and put a couple heavy branches over the grave so nothing could dig the dog up.   Two days later, they came home from church to find the dog sitting on their porch, covered in dirt but otherwise perfectly fine but after that, continued to stink like rotten meat, she said.   It got so bad that they had to keep the dog tied up outside.   The dog got attacked by a coyote and had it's eye punctured and one of it's ears ripped off. It acted like it didn't even phase it.   My grandma said that this little dog lived well into her young adult years (from the time she was about 7 to the time she was 20 or 21  During that time,  she said the dog had been shot twice, ran over again, kicked by two more horses and quilled by a porcupine.   It survived each event as if nothing happened.   She said the dog ran off when she moved out of her parents house and she never saw it again.   Edited for a couple spelling oopsies***   I'm actually not entirely sure about that. I know Slenderymans started out as a croopypooster. But I can, to this day, remember having a dream when I was younger, It was one of those realistic dreams, of walking past the steps which led downstairs of my old house, at the bottom of the stairs, there was a bathroom to the right. In the dream, I remember looking down and seeing a tall, white skinned figure with no face staring up at me. It scared me so much that I woke up bawling.   A friend of mine told me several years later, that he had had the exact same dream while staying over at the house one weekend. I had never told him about my dream.  and this was many, many years before Slenderman even became a thing.   	3
 Don't fret.  It'll all work out in the end.  Check your watch... it's almost time.   Sleep?  Don't go to sleep.  Come back to the pantry.  What's in the box?  -Allie   Okay man, that's cool.   My protagonist started a fucking band, man. What did your protagonist ever do, huh?   #[Thailand](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2kduka/it_found_me_in_thailand/) #Home #[Calling](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2klvr6/it_found_me_in_thailand_part_3/)  It always feels weird to go home. Surreal, like somehow walking into someone else's life; it's not mine anymore. The scenery changes very little over the years in small towns, but the things that happen there no longer concern me. My stresses and routines exist somewhere else while these ones have gone cold like the still air in the empty bedroom in my parent's house.  Mom was happy to see me. It had been over a year since I'd visited her, and she'd aged years in that time. Her hair was shorter, and flatter, and she had new glasses whose thick, brown frames made her face seem even thinner.  I couldn't tell her everything. It was just too weird, and my thoughts were too disorganized. I told her that Mark was missing, and I was expecting the police or someone to come looking for me in the morning. I talked for a little while about the rest of my time in Thailand, and then shut myself in my room. I fell onto my old bed, and was asleep.  I'm having weird dreams every night now. In them, I'll go places and talk to people like I would if I were awake. There are usually just bits and pieces - tall shelves, faceless men in suits and a few times now I've dreamed of the red tree. They feel like dreams the next day... but sometimes while they're going on, I'm afraid that I might wake up, standing in the middle of that shop in Thailand, Alan smiling at me with broken teeth, and empty eyes like Mark's mask.  I woke up at midnight. After tossing and turning, I gave up the fight to keep my eyes closed. I checked reddit on my phone while laying draped over the edge of my old bed. Damn, some of you seem to have it even worse than I do. Others of your stories are eerily similar. Out of curiosity, I decided to search for the post I'd found before, "All In Good Time."  Everything was almost exactly the same except for two things: the score was much higher and it had more comments than it had the first time. The second thing that had changed was the address. Instead of Pattaya, Thailand, it now had the name of my home town in Oregon. Google Maps pointed to a place about a mile and a half from my house.  I was tempted to go there. *Drawn.* Something pulled at the strings inside my head, puppeting my hands as I got dressed and laced my shoes. Just before I reached the front door, I stopped and stood for a full minute in my mom's living room. Just to see if I could.  This wasn't a dream. I wasn't sleepwalking. I wasn't possessed. I just... needed to know.  Out the front door, I pulled my hoodie tighter around my shoulders against the cold and stuffed my hands deeper into my pockets. It was colder here than Thailand had been, especially in the middle of the night. In high school I used to walk like this all the time, just setting out without a place to go. I planned on going near the store, but not inside. I wanted to see it, but for now... I was just walking.  As I reached the more populated areas, I passed more people out on the street. I skirted the lights and hoped that no one would try to talk to me and kept up a pretty fast pace.  I reached the place on the map where it had said the store would be. It was in the middle of a strip of little shops - book stores, antiques, boutique clothes. At first glance, I wasn't sure it was the place. It was conspicuously empty and barren. A white sign with red lettering read "For Sale" on the largest window. On my toes, I was just able to see through the windows to the shadowy empty shelves inside.  "There you are," said a voice behind me. I spun and saw a man leaning out the window of an impeccable white convertible Mustang. The car hadn't made a sound before, but now the engine was chugging in a low growl. It was the shop owner from Thailand still wearing the same suit that I'd seen him in before. His crooked teeth were on display through a thin-lipped smile. He looked slightly deranged. "I was hoping I'd find you here. It seems to me like you've got something I want. Two somethings, actually." He licked his lips as he looked me up and down.  "Fuck off!" I screamed as I kicked his car with a muddy sneaker.  Faster than I could react, he was out of the car and coming toward me. With surprising strength, he shoved me against the window behind me.  "Listen, you little bitch. You made a deal," He growled like an animal. Every word was punctuated with pain. He seemed to be all elbows beneath his jacket. Insanely, my biggest fear in that moment was that he would bite or claw me. He was panting, and his hot breath smelled strongly of stale tobacco.  Then his smile returned. He released me from the wall and took a step back, straightening his tie and jacket.  "Tomorrow night, before the sun rises, I expect to have the watch delivered to me. I'll warn you though, I don't give extensions easily, miss."  So that was it. He was after the pocket watch.  He ducked back into the ghostly white Mustang and slowly rolled down the street and out of sight.  My heart was nearly beating a hole through my chest. I pulled myself up from where I'd collapsed on the sidewalk and ran until I saw perhaps the only place still open in town that late at night. With no one in sight, I leaned against the wall and caught my breath before turning the corner and entering Rustic Sports Bar.  "Hi, we close in an hour!" shouted the woman from the behind the bar.  I told her that was fine and ordered a drink, downed it and ordered another. The noise and movement of the games replaying on the televisions was calming, though I wished that more people were there. I was afraid to go back outside.  After another drink and a few more commercial breaks, someone came up behind me.  "Hey I know you, don't I?" said a male voice.  It was some guy who I recognized him from high school. His name was Ben. He was a couple years older than me and we'd hever hung out, but was really well-known for being the school's star basketball player. I'd heard a lot of rumors of teachers being forced to give him extra credit and turning D's to B's to keep him on the team. There was pressure to keep him playing, but there was more pressure from his wealthy and well-connected father.  I guess the rumors had been true, since after he'd gone to play at a Division 1 school on a scholarship, he'd failed out after the first semester because of his grades. He looked like he spent more time in the bar than on the basketball court these days.  He was obnoxious and drunk, but talking to someone eased my nerves. When the bar closed, I convinced him to give me a ride back home. I dodged his clumsy attempt to kiss me and tried to ignore his creeping hands. It took him a while for him to understand that he wasn't invited inside. The tires of his too-expensive car squealed as he took off down the street.  ---  I was seven when my mom finally left my dad. The fight before the split dragged on all night. I guess that they'd each just had enough, and threw everything they had at each other. A few months later, he passed away and at his funeral, my uncle had said that it was because of a broken heart. Even at seven I'd known that he'd never had one to begin with.  Anyway, I remember packing my toys on the day that we left. I was a serious tomboy at that age, and didn't own even a single pink thing. All my toys were the cool boy toys of the 90's. I carefully appraised each one before putting it into the blue Jansport backpack I used for school. They wouldn't all fit, and I had to take apart my Legos to pack them down better. I worried that she'd make me leave them when I came out of my room, backpack full and carrying Stretch Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear in my arms. She didn't say anything though. She just packed some pictures and our clothes into a couple suitcases and then we got into her car and went to grandma's.  I stayed with grandma for a long time before mom came back. I don't think that she had a place to stay, so she left me there where I'd be safe. I hadn't really minded, since grandma's house was amazing. I missed the last month or so of school, and then it was summer.   I played outside every minute of the day, and whenever I came inside with grass stains on my knees and scrapes on my elbows, grandma would tell me how that was "just the way it should be," then she'd make me open-faced peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that were somehow sweeter and more delicious than the kind anyone else made.  The forest behind her house seemed huge. There were a few miles of hiking trails that no one owned or ever used that fed down from the main road along the top of the hill to the big lake at the bottom. Gradually, like entropy, the toys I'd brought in my backpack got spread out to all my favorite spots in the woods. Stretch Armstrong died in a tree-climbing accident when his rubbery legs got caught on a broken branch. He bled sticky corn syrup all over the pine needles and my hands and he slowly deflated.  I knew that there was no way to bring him back, so instead I reasoned that a fitting memorial would be to tie him at the very highest point of the tree, where his plastic smiling face could look out over the woods and the lake forever. He'd be the one in the crow's nest whenever I played pirates on the ground.  The tree wobbled as I climbed it. I was a skinny kid, but the tree was thinner, and it bent precariously. I quickly tied his arms and legs in double granny knots and raised him into his final resting place, then I looked out where his blank eyes were looking.  Straight ahead, not far away, reflections of clouds were swimming in the still blue lake. Going west would take me back to grandma's house, and to the east was more forest, and fewer houses until you went all the way out to the Boy Scout camp. From our perch, Armstrong and I could see their dock poking out from the shore. Just past that, something red caught my eye.  I double checked Stretch - he looked happy in his final resting place - then climbed down, found my best stick-sword and headed off toward the lake. My imagination was always in overdrive then, but now there was something real to investigate. I thought about what I'd do if it were a hot air balloon whose pilot needed my help to get back into the air. I shuddered to think what if it were a UFO?  I hugged the shoreline, moving quick to keep my feet from sinking in the soft sand. I passed a forked tree, the base of which held three of my power rangers, waiting for Zordon's call for their next adventure.   You had to be careful going into the Boy Scout's territory, and normally I never played in there. Girls weren't allowed. If an adult found you, they could have you "thrown out" according to my grandma. I knew that she meant that someone's dad would call and have you picked up, but I'd always imagined a band of scouts tying me up with chains and padlocks and tossing me off the end of the dock.  Thankfully no one was there this time. I didn't need to, but snuck through the campground like Mission Impossible anyway, eyes wide and ears open for any sound. Everything was completely silent. Strangely so.  I'd imagined a hundred things that the red spot I'd seen from the crow's nest could be. The logical side of my brain had even considered a piece of garbage, or the Boy Scouts' misplaced canoe. The only thing I hadn't allowed myself to consider was that it was just another tree.  Most of the trees in the forest were the kind with needles. In fact, the only trees I saw with leaves were the apple trees my grandma had planted in front of her house. As I came up on the curious red tree with five-pointed maple leaves, I wondered if maybe this tree had been planted too. Nothing else was growing for 30 or 40 feet in every direction around it. Each one of its leaves glowed bright, deep red like cranberry juice.  I snuck forward, casting one last look back to the empty camp, and the direction of grandma's house. It was starting to get that cool feeling that you get at the end of the day. I'd have to start back soon, or race the sun for its remaining light.   I stepped into the circle of dead around the tree, and a weird, irritating sensation washed over me. The evening air was no longer cold. Actually, it felt like heat was emanating straight up out of the ground. There was a smell with it too, like must and decomposition. I had the strong feeling that I was some place I shouldn't have been, like I had entered some kind of memorial or grave that I shouldn't have been treading on.  So I left. After sneaking through the camp and the woods, I got back to grandma's just as it was getting dark, sat at the table until I cleaned my plate, and forgot the whole thing.  Days came and went without a care or a thing to do. I started to feel like my time at grandma's would just go on forever. That was the life. I hoped that nothing would ever change.  But change came knocking on the front door as I was getting ready for bed. I was brushing my teeth in the downstairs bathroom, pajamas already on and eyelids heavy.  The knocking came, but it sounded more like someone was kicking the door. I heard my father's voice. Even through the thick, wooden frame, it echoed through the house. He was calling my name, and calling grandma something else.  Grandma rushed downstairs to get me, and whisked me up into the attic through a set of trapdoor stairs. She took something that looked like a briefcase with a lock on it, except it was almost as long as she was tall, then she kissed the top of my head and went back down the stairs, closing the trapdoor behind her.  I crawled over the insulation, and looked out through the window with one eye. I could see my father's truck, but one side of the hood had been dented in. The bed looked like it was full of cans and bottles. I could still hear him screaming, but it didn't sound like he was at the front door anymore.   I heard a crash downstairs, like a window breaking and then a bang that shook the walls and made me cover my ears. My father and my grandma were screaming worse than when mom and he had fought, then grandma went quiet.  There was a latch on the attic window, which pushed open and let me out onto the roof. From there I dropped down onto the garage like dropping out of a tree. I tried to climb down the rain gutter from the garage to the ground, but it wasn't fastened. With a screech and moan of twisting hollow metal, I dropped onto the damp ground and ran barefoot into the woods. A minute later, I could hear my father calling my name.  I didn't care. My fear gave me wings carried me away.  I had hiding spots. These were *my* woods, after all. If I'd wanted to, I could have hidden all night. To this day, I still don't know why I didn't do exactly that, but before I'd started running, even before I'd unlatched the window and gone outside, I'd known that I was going back to the red tree.  My father bounded loudly through the brush like a mindless hulk behind me. I moved quietly along the edge of the lake, like I'd done a thousand times before.  There were lights on at the Boy Scout camp. I could have run there for help, waking them in their cabins, but something about the tree was calling me just a little further ahead. My father had stopped yelling, and had cleared the trees and underbrush. I didn't know where he was.  I saw the tree for a second - bared of all its leaves, its trunk now bleached white, before the ground dropped out from beneath my feet. The whole dead circle around the tree had sunken several feet, and was now filled with rainwater. Shed bark and leaves covered the surface like tissue paper and shattered black ice. The water was warm, almost hot. I broke the surface and swam the best I could toward its bone white trunk, like a marble statue of a graceful hand reaching out of the muck.  "Allie!" my father called from behind me, teetering on the edge of the circle, holding a rifle. "I'm not gonna tell you again, Allie, get out of there, right now."  My fingers closed around the trunk of the tree. It was so slick. I'd climbed trees every day for the past two months, and even had a growth spurt, but there was no way to climb that tree.  My stomach fell. Despite all my imagination, I hadn't thought of what to do now that I'd made it there. I had failed. I gripped the branches and shook them in frustration. What had I thought was going to happen?  "You're going to make me do this, girl. You and and that damned mother of yours."  He had the rifle up at his shoulder, eye in the sights and finger on the trigger. I ducked sideways, sinking back under the water. Instead of a gunshot, there was silence like I'd gone deaf. Lights played across my closed eyelids. I felt the water swirling around me, throwing me limply around, and stretching me like thin rubber filled with corn syrup.  Then... it was over. I was sitting at the top of the white maple, my legs dangling below. The place that my father had been standing just a moment ago was illuminated by the headlights of a police cruiser. They were so afraid at first that I'd been shot. The water, dyed red by the fallen leaves had soaked me like blood.  In my hand, I found a tiny pocketwatch. The inside isn't a mermaid in the water... it's me.  Eventually - unbelieveably - I forgot... I forgot about the tree. I forgot how my father had disappeared. I forgot everything until it found me again in Thailand.  I don't know why it chose that place or that time, or why it waited so long to find me, but now it has. It found me in Thailand, but I think somehow that it's never been far away... and it will be waiting for me when I get back home.  It's waited all this time, and now it's coming for me.    Hopefully I'll be able to explain more tomorrow.  This isn't even close to being finished.   Post links? I don't see any posts titled "All In Good Time."   /r/darktales should be more popular than it is.   I am dancing! Wait, are you not dancing?   Congratulations, EtTuTortilla!   Some headshots.   #Thailand   #[Home]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2khdne/it_found_me_in_thailand_2/) #[Calling](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2klvr6/it_found_me_in_thailand_part_3/)  It found me in Thailand.  I came here with my best friend Mark for a 30-day volunteer trip. We're both graduating from college next year and we've been told that "extracurriculars" like this look good on a resume. The company that Mark's father works for paid for the whole thing. More important than the practical reasons, neither of us had ever been that far outside of the U.S., and you're not going to pass up a free trip to Thailand.  The work was easy. All we had to do was basically show up and lend an extra set of hands when and where it was needed. Our busy days combined with a healthy dash of culture shock made the time fly by. Before we knew it, we were being bused to Pattaya and preparing to fly home.  Pattaya isn't as wild as Bangkok, but it's got a firm grip on the second-place title. Every night of the year is a party. Downtown, there are bars and massage parlors on every corner. The hotel they put us at was right in the middle of it all.  We were supposed to stay one night there and then leave for Hawaii the following morning, but a potential hurricane in Hawaii and monsoons threatening Thailand canceled any flights that way until further notice. Mark called the volunteer organization to let them know, and everything was taken care of. They were amazingly understanding of the whole thing, and they even agreed to wire us some extra per diem to offset the cost of living in downtown.  Mark and I were 21 years old, sex and alcohol deprived for the last 30 days, and fate just plopped into our laps at least two days in Thailand, all expenses paid. We were living in a dream.  The first evening, we walked all over downtown. We knew we'd end up hitting the bars that night, but at about 5:00 pm, I thought it was a little early to get tanked. They've got about a million shops that sell cheap, knock-off goods, and the street food is fresh-cooked and out of this world, so despite Mark's bitching, we paced ourselves.  It was the last place we were going to go before we quit shopping and started partying.   Most of the booths and open-air vendors specialize in selling one type of thing. One guy will sell T-shirts. The next store will have fake brand-name headphones and electronics. The next will sell toys, luggage, purses, shoes... The point is, this store was different. It had *everything* - completely eclectic.  I'm in love. Every single piece has so much personality. They're the kinds of things that represent a story, someone's childhood, a life. Someone's stack of handwritten journals, antiques, a weathered leather briefcase with papers sticking out of the edges, a taped BB gun, a bike, a wedding dress...  We're the only people there besides the vendor, whose name tag reads "ALAN," who's standing behind a small counter, almost like a podium, and eying us while fiddling with something in his hands.  Mark doesn't care about the churchlike quiet because he's trying to get me to hurry up and go, so when the vendor greets us and says something about a "good time" Mark practically shouts, "Yeah! We're looking for a good time!"  The vendor smiles, and then brings something up to his mouth. With his other hand, he throws some pistachio shells into a little bin by his feet.  He wipes his hands on the pants of his black suit, and waves to Mark to follow him to the other side of the store. "Everything is for trade here. I collect all sorts of things, as you can see. I believe that I have just what you're looking for." The place is small, and in only a few steps, he's reached the wall that's furthest from the rust-colored windows. The vendor bends down, reaches into a wooden cupboard and pulls out a silver tea set. A steaming pot, cups, the whole shebang.  He smiles wide, showing rows of broken, tar-stained teeth, and holds up the tea saying, "Drink this, and I can guarantee that you'll have an unforgettable night."  The scent of the tea was amazing. Beyond amazing, it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. It seemed to fill the entire shop in an instant. The smell of dust and age was gone, and I found myself daydreaming about my grandmother's house as a kid.   In the summers, my dad would be out of work a lot. Whenever he was home, my mom and him would get into fights. When things got really shitty, they'd send me to stay the weekends with my mom's mom. Somehow it smelled just like the sunshine that shone through the woods behind her house that were all mine whenever I went there. It smelled like freedom and fun, adventure and good times.  After that, everything is blank. I don't even remember sitting down or drinking the tea. The very next thing that I remember is Mark saying "I gotta take a shit after this, my stomach is killing."  We were sitting in leather reclining chairs, having our feet massaged. I felt the familiar buzz of alcohol, but otherwise felt awake and normal.  I looked over at Mark, and noticed that he was wearing different clothes; black pants and a matching button-up shirt had replaced his colorful board shorts and tee, and for some reason he was carrying white mask like a mannequin's face.  Outside, the sun was gone and the rain was hammering down in sheets onto the muddy streets. When I got up to pay and leave, I found a big wad of Thai baht in my pocket equal to just over $1100 USD and a note in my own handwriting.      Don't let him have it.  I rushed outside into the rain. Mark cut his massage short and followed after me, collecting his shoes from the flimsy wooden rack outside.  "What the fuck is going on with you, Allie?"  "I can't remember anything."  "Yeah, you're probably fucked up from all the drinks you've had, I told you to slow down at that last place-"  "No. I don't even remember drinking. Mark, I'm serious, the last thing I remember is going into that little shop, and the guy serving us tea."  Mark smiled and stared at me for a second. "This is weird, Allie, I don't get it. Not a very good joke."  "You remember?"  "Remember? Yeah, of course, I remember the weird tea guy yesterday, what about it?"  *Yesterday? What the hell had happened all night?*  It was too much, I could hardly breathe. I sat hard on the crumbling curb, while cars and mopeds darted just inches from my feet.  "Uh... Hey, if you're like, sick or something, maybe we should go, but we can't just sit right here like this, they're going to find us." He pulled me up by the shoulder.  "Who's going to find us?"  "Those guys with the fliers that we were fucking with. You know, I was wearing the mask, and walking back and forth taking their fliers, until they started chasing us off... Holy shit, you really don't remember, do you?"  "I can't remember shit. I need..." *A doctor? A priest? A psychiatrist?* "I don't know. How do we get back to the hotel from here?"  ---  We each had separate rooms in the hotel, both on the seventh floor. From the elevator, Mark's room was the first door on the right, while mine was near the end of the balcony to the left. On the way over, Mark had complained about his stomach hurting again and had eventually gone quiet, holding one arm across his gut. Maybe it was just some kind of sympathy pain, but my stomach felt like it was starting to cramp as well. When we got out of the elevator he rushed over to his room.  "I'll call you in a little while," I said, unsure if he heard me or not before he disappeared into his door.  I went toward my room, and followed the convex curve of the building. When I rounded the final turn, I saw Mark in his black clothes, with his blank white mask on standing outside my room, then push his way inside and out of sight.  I froze. The balcony didn't go in a circle. There was no way that he could have gotten around me.  I walked backwards, eye on my door until I was out of sight, then ran back to Mark's room and pounded my fists on his door. He didn't answer, even when I yelled his name and pleaded.  I stood knocking for several minutes, trying to watch both sides of the balcony for signs of him or someone in a white mask. Then my stomach cramped. The sharp pain doubled me over. Once the pain cleared, I wiped the tears from my eyes and went back into the elevator.  Some Indian tourists were already standing on the tiny box before I got on, and said something in a language I didn't understand. I'm sure I looked crazy. Another wave of pain came on the way down. I tried to ignore it, and focused instead on the watercolor painting of a red maple tree that hung on the back of the elevator. Someone had burned a cigarette-sized hole through the canvas at some point before it had been set in its frame. I tried to burn another hole through it with my eyes, and bit my cheek to keep from screaming.  The pain subsided slightly when I got to the bottom floor. The Indian family rushed away from me, and I dizzily stumbled out of the lobby and into the street.  I nearly got run over by a pickup and then a taxi cab as I crossed the street to a 7-Eleven. People were shouting at me from the sidewalk, but I couldn't make out their faces through the pouring rain.  Another wave of pain washed over me as I was met by the blinding white lights inside the shop. I fell to my knees and everything in my stomach lurched up onto the ground. It felt like I was vomiting shards of glass set on fire. With every heave, I felt like my throat was tearing.  it went on and on, leaving me laying on the ground, gasping for breath.  Pistachio shells, a mound of them, lay on the ground in the center of a bloody puddle. On the top of the pile was a tiny ornate pocket watch with a delicate silver chain.  ---  Paramedics scooped me up off the floor of the 7-eleven. The Thai hospital was surprisingly modern, the staff seemed to be well-trained and polite. Despite most of the rest of the city appearing to exist sometime in the past decade, the ER was comfortingly modern. I was put in a bay, curtain dividers between beds. Primarily male nurses hustled about, checking fluids and medicines. Apparently, there isn't much you can do for esophageal bleeding besides ensuring that the person remains calm and doesn't try to eat anything.  I found my phone on the table along with my keys, my rifled-through wallet and the pocket watch. I was surprised again to find that there was free WiFi inside the hospital. I searched for the strange shop with the tea on Google, but it was like Google Maps didn't exist yet in this country, and practically no businesses were listed. Review sites and listings were worthless without already knowing the name of the place.          15% battery remaining.  I tried sending another text to Mark. Then, thinking I'd earned a short break, I opened up Reddit...  And there it was.  "All In Good Time," was right at the top of my front page. It was here - in nosleep. Strictly speaking, I didn't even think that the story belonged. It was more of a review of the shop that sold anything and everything you could want, located at 1111  street, just a few blocks from the hotel that we'd stayed at. According to OP, you could find any and everything you wanted, "as well as a few things that they hadn't known that they needed before they walked through the door."  As I said, the post wasn't the kind of thing that belonged on nosleep, except for maybe the strange description of the owner named Alan. The man that we'd seen at All In Good Time had been an elderly Thai man, but the man in the post was described as white with a southern accent and a habit of chain-smoking.   What was even stranger about the post was that shouldn't have been at the top of my front page. It only had a few dozen points and I didn't know how it could possibly have been right, but its time stamp was a month old.  Thinking I'd missed something, I scrolled down to the comments section. A few rulebreakers were calling out OP for posting something "unrealistic," while most others said that the shop was in their home town, and that they couldn't wait to check it out later that week. Apparently Pattaya is full of Redditors...  One comment in particular stood out to me, though. The time stamp said 1 minute ago when I found it. I copied and pasted it below:  MarkyShark  3 minutes ago  1 point  its all i know   the dark the cold   these four walls   when night falls   youll see it too   It was Mark's account. He was alive! I quietly cursed him for not answering my texts. I tapped on his name to see if he'd posted anything else recently but there was nothing older than that day. On the second picture, my phone died.  I set it back on the table and picked up the pocketwatch. I'd gotten it after my father had died. It was no bigger than a quarter, with a little knob and a ring for the chain. Pulling the knob out would allow you to wind it, and pushing it in would open the polished silver clamshell. Inside were tiny moving pieces showing a mermaid swimming in wavy water. She'd drop below the surface as the waves would rise up, and break the surface again and again. I've never seen anything else like it in my life.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHssd14YyYo spfreload=10) is the closest thing I could find, but imagine it being absolutely tiny, tucked into a coin-sized watch.  It was frustrating and confusing not to remember the night before. I must have swallowed it along with everything else - but why?  A doctor opened the curtain, breaking into my thoughts, and set a cardboard box on the floor beside my bed.  He spoke in incomprehensibly fast Thai, while making hand signals that I should hold out my arm and roll up my sleeve. From the box, he pulled one of those blood pressure sleeves. He took my vitals, which resulted in a frown. Then had me say "Ah" and looked down my throat with a flashlight. More frowns. He made the motion of bringing a cup to his lips and drinking, and made what I thought was a questioning face. I nodded yes, apparently not fully understanding. He made the motion again. I said yes again, and he grew more impatient.  From his box, he pulled a glass jar with a rubber cork that had a small fitting on the top. He set them on the rolling tray beside my bed, then he pulled out a piece of elastic surgical tubing and a clear plastic tube, which he fitted onto the cork. Then, from his pocket he took out a needle. He wrapped the surgical tubing around my arm, had me flex my hand a few times to find the vein and started to draw blood into the container.  This was weird. Thinking that maybe I had accidentally agreed to something I shouldn't have, I just waited awkwardly. Small talk isn't my strong suit anyway, let alone with someone who doesn't speak the same language. To avoid making eye contact, I scanned the patterns on the curtains while the container filled up. Behind me on the wall, where I hadn't looked before, was a painting. A watercolor that someone had burned a cigarette-sized hole into before they'd framed it.  The scene in this painting was slightly different than the one in the elevator. Instead of a red maple, this one was a red circular pool with two lines sticking out of it like hands on a clock. One line was just a negative white space that pointed straight up. The other was black, like a shadow cast by the white hand, that stretched horizontally over the edge of the red pool. At the very end of that black, tapering line, was the cigarette burn. The painting *felt* different too. The last one, I had felt was irritating for some reason. If that one was a little kid with a squirt gun, this one was like a cool, still pond.  I'm sorry if that doesn't make sense. I just don't know a better way to describe how a picture makes you hear silence, and can take you to another place like that.  I must have stared for a while - for too long, because when I looked back, the doctor was gone, along with the jar. The needle was still in my arm, pouring blood through the tube into the empty box, staining the edges red. I pulled the needle out of my arm, scrambled to throw the blankets and sheets off myself, grabbed my things from the table, and shot through the curtain into the bay. I was scared, but more than that, I was fucking mad.  A quick look back showed the box had fallen on its side. Its lid now appeared be sealed shut with bleeding tape. Nurses and cleaning staff were staring at me, calling out to me in Thai, but in a few seconds I was back outside in the rain.  I found my way back to the hotel. The elevator walls now only held mirrors that showed bags under my eyes, the same ratty t-shirt from the previous day, and hair stuck out in every direction. Between the mirrors, there were advertisements for restaurants and Ripley's Believe it or Not! I didn't believe it, but I also didn't give a shit anymore. At the seventh floor, I almost went right to knock on Mark's door, but decided against it. I had to worry about myself first. Once I was safely headed away from this hellhole, I could worry about Mark.  I opened the door to my room, and fumbled with the light switch without stepping inside. The room was clear. I checked the closet, under the beds, the balcony, and locked the conjoining door and the deadbolt to the outside. I put some heavy wooden chairs in front of the entrances and turned on the TV for background noise.  If they were ever going to believe me, I had to at least look sane. I showered with both eyes open, scanning through the glass window-walls to the rest of the room. I kept imagining a disembodied white mask floating in the air, watching me with blank eyes.  Nothing happened. I got dressed, grabbed my things and left. I never went within ten feet of the cardboard box sitting in the far corner of the room. I took a picture, but it didn't turn out - just black.  The cab driver had some trouble understanding that I wanted to go to the American Embassy. There had to be one, I didn't care if it was in Bangkok. Luckily, there was one in the city.  It seemed like they questioned me for hours... They couldn't find the name of the volunteer organization that had sent us, and the only deposits on our cards had come directly from Mark's dad's credit card. They tried to find a hole in my story, but I just came clean. I gave them everything I knew, which wasn't much. I wrote down a timeline from the time we'd gotten there to now and whenever they'd ask a question, I'd just point to it.  I insisted that I couldn't stay in Thailand; that someone was after me and my friend. It wasn't until they went to Mark's room that they finally believed me at all. An officer of some sort pulled the suited man who was in charge aside and showed him something on his phone. The man put his hand over his mouth and looked away.  When they came back, I was assigned an escort, and was taken via military jet to Hawaii. Before I left, the man in a plain gray suit covered with official-looking laminated badges said that they'd take care of everything there.  I thought that it was over, then. When we were safely up in the air, I pulled a borrowed blanket over my face, and quietly cried. It wasn't long before the droning of the engines and gentle rocking of the air currents put me to sleep.    Wow I want to believe that that was actually written by OP's grandfather. Such a cool story, especially if that's the case.   Finally got around to reading part 1. It's a long one, but the way it's told is unlike anything else I've read here. Good find.   Hey thanks for sharing this story. That's a really neat idea to make up an urban legend and tell it different ways.  I wonder if the post might have been more popular if you'd excluded the other links at the beginning of the post. I initially thought that I was missing something and that I'd have to go back to part one and read the whole series, but that didn't seem to be the case.  Thanks again for sharing!   This is why you're the man.   I awoke to the sound of glass breaking. Then I felt the impact of the car and the seatbelt digging into my stomach and shoulder.  I'd been driving two hours to my new job for three months. A job isn't even "new" at that point, I guess, it's just a job. The last week, I'd stepped up the amount of hours and I couldn't even remember seeing the sun. I went to work before dawn and got back after midnight every single day.  It was too much, I guess, and I fell asleep. I blamed myself every day for it. I thought about all the things I might have been able to do to prevent it. I just... couldn't take it back.  I went to her funeral. It felt wrong not to for some reason. Almost no one was there. Two middle-aged people I'd assumed to be her parents, an elderly man and the priest. Everything was extremely formal, dry and felt pre-packaged. The words that were said felt fake. It was a Hallmark funeral.  Afterwards, I went to talk to the girl's parents. I had to apologize in person, despite the advice of my lawyers.  "Excuse me? Sorry... I..." My tongue twisted. Maybe I should have written something down.  But then, bizarrely, they both smiled and shook my hand. "Hello. We know who you are. Thank you. Thank you so much."  I was shocked. Even more, I was offended. What about the girl we'd just buried? Didn't she deserve... some emotion? Some hate for her killer?  "Krista was a troubled child. I don't know how you could understand without having met her."  "Yes, deeply troubled."  "You see, we used to have four children."  "And now... well, now we have none."  "It was Krista."  "We can't prove that - "  "But we know it was her. They all died in their sleep."  "She posed their bodies."  "They looked so peaceful."  Tears were welling in both of their eyes. I felt sick.  "She finally looked peaceful, sir. So thank you."  "Thank you so much."  I was glad that I went to the funeral. Finally. I had no regret; I knew that despite everything that had happened, this was the fate she deserved.   This is nice. The whole thing just has that feeling of being well-said.      Vote.   New Orleans, a new drunk on the market and flags   I moved to New Orleans when I was in my early 20's and before Katrina hit, the place was awesome with a capital A. I loved the culture, the parties, the parades, Mardis Gras... Everything.  When the hurricane hit and the city went under, I was stupid. I didn't listen and didn't believe that something that bad could happen. A lot of people didn't. I didn't get out in time.  Everyone knows that things changed after the storm and the floods, but... I think what I saw was something different. Bear with me, I've never told anyone about this before.  The hurricane affected my neighborhood pretty much like every other neighborhood in New Orleans. The days following were something else, though. I came back to my house to find that almost nothing was left. The basic structure was (fortunately) still standing, but water had risen up to the gutters. The insides were trashed.  That night, some men came by wearing suits. We thought that they were from the government - they were very official-looking. But instead of... inspections, aid, assistance, whatever, they were selling drugs! I couldn't believe it - here we were without fresh water, food, clothes, shelter... and these assholes were selling drugs!  I'm not the confrontational type, but I stared them down until they were off my block.  The next day I started noticing flags being set up outside my neighbors' houses - almost all of them. An identical black flag hung in front of their front door. I knocked on the house next door to see if they were home. Maybe I'd slept through some kind of aid effort? Maybe the flags signified that the house was occupied or... I don't know. I just didn't want to be left out.  My neighbor Charles answered the door. I'd never seen him look so terrible. I mean, terrible had been re-defined by surviving a natural disaster, that was a given, but his lips were blue, and I swear his eyes were faded, turning white.  He opened the door and I asked him about the flag. He just wandered inside his house, sat on the couch and didn't say a word. His wife and daughter were there on the couch too. They were all staring at a black TV screen (we didn't have any power).  The neighbors across the street were exactly the same. I started suspecting that everyone with a black flag in front of their steps had turned into some kind of mindless drone.  It lasted for two full days. On the third morning everyone was back to normal.  I think... somehow, it saved their lives. I was struggling during that time just to live. Just to not be poisoned and to get by, but everyone else... it's like they had a free pass for two days.      /r/nosleep, we like you, but you're more fun when you're drunk.   This is the only serious answer here.   Not at all what I had expected from the title.  I pictured a kid knocking on a fish tank, or Dudley knocking on the snake's glass at the zoo. "Come on! Come out! We just want to play with you."   The title and premise is so zany, but man, this story just works!   I could picture this place so well. Terrifying.   Oh my god. Awesome.   Officers were waiting in front of my house in unmarked cars. I didn't even have time to get my bag out of my car before they had me in cuffs and carried me roughly into the back of a black SUV. At the station they asked me about a childhood friend, Rick. I hadn't seen him in twenty years - we used to frequent the same playset in school before he moved away. They shoved pictures under my nose of a crashed car, a bloody street, drag marks in the dirt leading from the highway and into the woods. I had nothing to do with it, I swear.  Hours passed, and they finally let me go. When I got home, it was after midnight. A cold breeze was blowing in through a broken window. Rick was standing in the shadows of my kitchen, a slit of light cast across his stubbled face.  "You said we'd always be best friends, Trev. I need a friend. I think I did something bad."   Thanks, brah!   For sheer insanity...  Vote.   Before my senior year of high school, I volunteered to be a camp counselor for the summer. The experience was life-changing for me in more ways than one. It was what made me decide to become a teacher. It gave me self-confidence and an excitement for leadership that I'd never had before.  As a counselor, you typically ran an activity station for a few hours at a time. The kids were old enough to decide for themselves what they wanted to do during free time. The coordinated events were put on by the full-time employees, as well as the running of the facilities and the dorms. (Most parents wouldn't have let their kids stay a week with a bunch of irresponsible high schoolers.)  I was typically in charge of the giant tree swing and the arts and crafts stations. I'd trade back and forth every day with another counselor named Leslie.  Kids were in camp for 5 days. On day three I ran out of ideas for what to do in the arts and crafts station. They had all kinds of supplies - rope, string and beads for making necklaces and bracelets, paints and easels, a whole bundle of knitting needles and string... the only problem was that I didn't know how to do any of those things very well.  Then in one of the cupboards I found some quilting supplies. Weirdly, I knew how to do that from trips to my grandmother's house as a kid. The rest of the day, I organized the camp quilting club. It really caught on. Our quilt looked terrible - stuffing poked out and threads ran along the ground - but the kids loved it.  On the third day, I noticed that we were running low on patches. I went back into the cupboard, and stuffed into the back, I found a whole quilt. I had no choice but to cannibalize it for the cause. I started cutting off the patches. I had a small pile started, when I started to notice that the filling of this quilt wasn't cotton. It was stringy and stretchy. It might have been some kind of sawdust.  Old Mrs. Collins, one of the permanent employees working there, bustled into the shed, and shrieked with fear when she saw what I was doing. She barreled over and ripped the quilt from my hands and took the patches with her as well, then ran out the door. I sat stunned inside the crafts shed for a moment, wondering what had just happened. I felt really bad for tearing apart her quilt.  The summer finished out without an issue. I'd had an amazing time. Spending time with the kids gave me an appreciation and a passion to work in a school (and lord knows, you need passion to do this job). But I always wondered what happened to Mrs. Collins.  This morning, I finally found out. On the front page of the paper was the name of the old camp, and Mrs. Collins's picture. I had to re-read the article several times to fully understand it.  Camp owner abducts children.  Bodies of children found skinned alive.  Collins, an award-winning quilter, used the skins to stuff her quilts.  ...casts a shadow over next week's upcoming quilting competition.   I thought you'd be too [drunk](http://www.reddit.com/r/drunknosleep) to remember.   They're always there. You just don't have to look at them in the dark.   When I was about 6 years old, my parents bought me a nightlight. They thought that it might help with the dreams that had driven me from my bed and into their room every night.  When I woke up from my nightmare, I could see the shapes illuminated around me. The way the arc of electricity jumped around the element gave it all the impression of swaying in the breeze. It wasn't the place I'd fallen asleep, it was a strange reflection of it.   With the covers tucked tightly beneath my chin, I was sweltering hot. The wrinkled face of the man at the foot of my bed stared on with empty eyes. If I moved, he would see me. If I left the safety of my blanket, he would take me. I shivered with fear and with the strain of pulling the sheets.  Slowly the face shrank down beneath the edge of my mattress and out of sight. I could hear his rough clothes rustling as he slithered his way beneath my bed, pulling himself along with sharp, stained fingernails.  I leapt from bed, bounding outside his reach. In the dim flickering light I saw him there, licking his lips with a long black pointed tongue.  I reached out my hand and switched off the light. Then in the darkness, I crawled back into bed.

Not enough love for /r/drunknosleep right now.   Vote.  Creepy and well-written. Shame on you, sir. :P   My cousin Larry and I are from Oregon. Going to the beach is a bit of a production there. It isn't what the typical person pictures in their mind when they think of the word "beach." There's sand and water, but the similarities stop there. You can rarely see the sun through the thick fog, and instead of a bikini, you're more likely to find yourself wearing cold weather gear.  But Larry wanted to learn to surf, so I rented a wetsuit and strapped a board on top of my car. I'm sure I looked ridiculous driving there.  He struggled into the stretchy neoprene. It caused his arms to stick out at his sides a little like a doll. He looked so ridiculous. He started running toward the water.  "Hey Lar! Forgetting something?" I said, pointing toward the surfboard still strapped to my car.  He looked ridiculous, heading to the water holding a board that was twice as long as he was tall. I stopped him for a photo. "Say, 'Hang loose, brah!'"  "Hang loose bra!" He giggled, and held up some unrelated gang sign. I took the picture.  His smile faded, and he howled as his suit filled with the frigid water. It took him a long time to paddle the big board into the breakers. I could see him getting tired right away. I doubted he was having fun anymore now that he knew how much work this was going to be.  When I saw a larger swell pushing up and rising over his small shape, I tried to yell to him. The riptides had been pushing him closer and closer to the rocky jetty. His board raised above him, overbalanced and toppled him. I saw the board, but I couldn't find him in the frothy wave.  I waited a full minute. It felt like forever. Then I was scrambling up the rocks and out along the jetty. I just had to find him. Barnacles cut into my fingertips and salt water sprayed across my back. I was roughly to where I'd seen him. The white board was all the way to the beach already, floating with the fin in the air like a beached animal.  I still couldn't see him or anything else under the dark water. The waves slapped against the rocks and sent spray flying into the air. Then I heard a scratching coming from underneath me, inside the large rocks. Sure enough, an opening appeared in a lull between waves. I tried to stick my head in and look inside. I saw a foot, and a little white hand.  I dove after him. My clothes, wallet, phone, I didn't care. All that mattered was saving Larry.  He might have weighed a thousand pounds of dead weight. Blood ran freely from his forehead, and his skin was all a sickly blue-tinted white.  I clawed muscles and barnacles from the rocks trying to scurry my way up away from the accursed ocean. Larry's dead weight pitched me off balance and caused me to lose my footing. As I fell back into the ocean and a wave swept us apart, I realized that there were people on top of the jetty, watching.  I screamed to them as I broke the surface. I found Larry again, but just as I reached him, another wave swept us under. I just managed to hold onto his leg this time. I was starting to get tired. My jacket was tangling my arms, and the hiking boots that I wore made it so that I had to kick twice as much to stay afloat. Larry looked dead.  Then my foot touched the sandy bottom. I pushed him forward toward the beach. With my last remaining strength I dragged him out of the water. I was too cold to cry. Too tired to think. I pounded my fists on his chest. People gathered around me. I heard one of them say ridiculously, "That was a gnarly wipe out."  A man in a dirty yellow slicker mumbled "Down with the ship."  "Help me!" I screamed, but no one would come closer. They just watched from the edge of the circle. There was something wrong with their faces. They looked too much like Larry. Their skin was too blue. Too slack and lifeless...  Then someone was screaming and running toward us. An elderly man took in the image of Larry, before wrapping me in strong arms and tearing me away. He forced me to get warm. The circle of others were gone.  It was fifteen minutes before anyone else came to the beach. The man who rescued me stayed with me until the paramedics came. He told me "There was nothing you could have done."  "Nothing I could have done? What about all those other people who just stood there and watched?"  "You don't want to be talking about those others, ma'am," he said, seriously.  The doors of the ambulance closed and I was carried away.    Vote.   I bashed the cymbals with both hands as hard as I could. The lights, colors, sounds, movements... being on stage like this was bliss.  And then it was over.   I hated the time after the show was over. Ben went off to find the girls he'd scouted from the front of the stage - it seemed like lead guitar and vocalists were always in demand. Beth, the bassist always found a party to go to as well. That left me.  After the main attraction, I stayed and packed up my drums. First I dried the beer and sweat and spit from the stained wood shells. Then, using a clean cloth dipped in alcohol, I'd clean the cymbals before stacking them in their moulded plastic vault.  Clean. Polished. Meticulous.  Tonight, however someone else was there with me after the lights came up. A waitress named Rose was mopping a suspicious runny mess off the floor near the stage. I couldn't look away. She was like something from a dream.  I still had more to clean up. Since Ben and Beth had gone, I'd be stuck packing up their equipment too, but for the first time in weeks since we'd been on the road, I didn't care.  "Hey, uh, what time do you get off?" I asked.  She flipped scarlet red hair from her face and took me in with a look of amused surprise. Her smile hinted that I was in. What she said next sealed it.  "Let's get out of here, drummer boy."  I followed her outside, and across the street. I don't know why I wasn't concerned that before long we were sloughing our way through the rain-dampened grass and brush. It was getting thick and hard to move through. She didn't seem to be having a hard time moving. It was like the woods were opening up in front of her.  There was light ahead - a campfire and a clearing. I emerged from the brush, soaked and covered with mud.   In the center of the clearing was a fire in a stone pit. In front of the fire was Ben, to the one side was Beth, and to the other an empty, flat stone. Something told me that was for me.  The girl from the club turned around. Her red hair now faded to a gray straw-like mound that sat atop a disfigured, toothless face. I turned to run back into the woods, but two more women were emerging from the woods. Even the air seemed to bend in front of them, moving out of their way.  When I woke up this morning in the van, Beth and Ben didn't seem to remember anything that had happened the night before. The only proof I had that anything had happened, was an unread text from an unknown number ("Call me any time, Drummer Boy.") and a picture of three stones in a row.   Vote.   *"Where do you think it began, the idea that light could keep the monsters away? If anything, the darkness is your friend. The darkness will hide you. It's the light that will betray your secrets and sell you to the things in the shadows."  -Wayne K. Knowlton, 1890  When I was a kid, about 6 years old, my parents bought me a night light. They thought that it might help with the nightmares that had driven me out of my bed and into their room every night. My mother had found it second-hand at an estate sale. It was superman, except his red and blue costume was half chipped away, leaving bare white plastic underneath. He looked sick, and the anemic flickering light that glowed behind him just added to the feeling.  I woke up from my nightmare - not a night terror or sleep paralysis. Just a kid's nightmare that left him nervous and excited and imaginative. This time, I could see the shapes illuminated in my room. The way the arc of electricity jumped around the element gave everything the impression of swaying in the breeze. My room was transformed. It wasn't the place I'd fallen asleep, it was a perverse reflection of it.   With the covers tucked tightly beneath my chin, I was sweltering hot. The wrinkled face of the man at the foot of my bed stared with empty eyes. If I moved, he would see me. If I left the safety of my blanket, he would grab my foot. I shivered with fear and with the strain of pulling on the blankets.  Slowly the face shrank down beneath the edge of my mattress and out of sight. I could hear his rough clothes rustling as he slithered his way beneath my bed, pulling himself along with sharp, stained fingernails.  I sprung from beneath the sheets and flew through the air, then landed on a stray toy in the middle of my floor. My ankle rolled, and spilled me onto the carpet. If I'd looked under the bed, I'd have seen him, licking his lips with a long, black pointed tongue.  Instead I reached out my hand and switched off the superman light. Then in the darkness, I crawled back into bed.   If you read, then your feedback is valuable. Even if it's just what you thought of the piece.

From [this prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2iss2d/ip_what_was_behind_this_door_that_scared_them_so/cl5rqlj)  [What was behind this door that scared them so badly?](http://i.imgur.com/oHbjX2S.jpg)  [Credit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AbandonedPorn/comments/2de4ac/containment_attempt_abandoned_in_pa_taken_today/) to /u/TheDude9737  ---  It was coming.  Outside, the sirens were howling their crescendos. Bill, my youngest, hadn't even been alive the last time it had happened. He was crouched in the corner of the concrete basement. A split had opened up in his jeans over one of the knees, and his hair hung long and unwashed. He pressed his palms over his ears and squeezed his eyes tightly shut.  How do you deal with something like this at six years old? It was hard enough for me at forty. And harder to still to know that I'd failed. Failed to get to shelter, to keep us safe, to keep us *alive*.  "Daddy, what are we doing here? We need to go home!" Sara, my oldest at ten, was tugging at my coat, trying to coax me back outside.  "We can't go back home, Sara. We're just going to wait it out here."  "But... look! Won't it come in through the windows? This doesn't look like a very good place..."  I scooped up Bill from the corner. I could feel his thin body shaking in my arms as he sniffled through tears.  "Well, we'll just make it better, okay? We've still got time."  The abandoned cellar didn't have much inside. It looked like construction of the house above had been given up on. Some bags of cement, old, gray 2x4's and nails were about it. It wouldn't feed us, but we might just make it through the first day if we could board it up tight enough.  I set Bill and Sara to work on the door. Hammering the boards would at least take their minds off of what was happening. I went to work on the narrow windows. The sirens had stopped. It was close now.  The boards went up more easily than I'd thought they would, and in only a couple of minutes, the three windows were boarded over. I brought my flashlight's beam back from the other end of the basement, and found them at the door, working together. The boards were nailed haphazardly to the center of the door. Huge gaps remained, big enough to fit my arm through. I'd have to tear them all down and start over.  But as I approached the door, hammer in hand, the first rays of sun cleared the horizon, and made their way between the scraps of wood. Bill shouted in pain, and my leg burned, dropping me to my knees. We were out of time.  The dawn was here.   From [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepOOC/comments/2itzdj/commentators_on_this_reddit/cl5i5ur)  But *what if it* **was** *true?*  Sure, you might not think it now. After all, you're reading the stories on your phone in a bathroom stall in the middle of the day.  But then tonight you'll make a late-night run to the grocery store to pick up some cheap wine and ice cream. Heading to your car, keys jangling, patting your pockets (keys, phone, wallet), you think you might hear shuffling footsteps, though no one else is around. As you go to pull out of your parking stall, you think for a split second that the lumpy shape of your gym bag in your rear-view mirror is the misshapen form of a killer, waiting to pounce.  Your mind's just playing tricks on you. You're jumpy. Maybe the wine will help.  You arrive at the store, and start making your way to the frozen food section, but before you make it there, you see a group of people standing clustered together in one of the aisles. It's right in front of the eggs. You can't see them anymore, but you're subtly reminded of a story you read that involved broken eggs. Now you're curious. What happened down the egg aisle? Was one of the huddled people starting to bend down to the floor? Did they notice you? Do you dare go back and investigate more closely?  The story was silly. Wasn't it? But... the people in the comments didn't seem to think so. Actually, you don't know quite enough about feline-human brain transplants to say whether they're plausible or not...  So as you pick out your frozen deliciousness, and head toward the wine section, you notice that your heart's beating little faster. You're a little more awake. Maybe you're noticing more than you would on a normal night because wasn't that story at least plausible? Plausible enough to pretend while you're alone at night that it was true?      I was having some trouble at college. You always hear story about how the roommate of the girl who commits suicide automatically gets straight A's. That's about all you ever hear about that girl, the one who walks in and finds the other one that way.  Being back home feels weird, but at first I didn't care. I just wanted to sleep in my own bed and stay in the dark away from everyone. For days.  Almost nothing changed at home since I left. The house was exactly the same. In fact, the only change was that mom didn't do her own vacuuming every day now, since she bought one of those stupid "Roomba" things from a Skymall magazine.  I slept most of the day and night. My parents worried about me. They brought me food and offered to take me places, but I always said no - the most I could manage was to read a few posts on Reddit while avoiding Facebook and the torrent of memorials from her recently acquired array of "best friends" there - before rolling over and falling back into a warm, dreamless sleep.  The police came to question me again. I took a shower for the first time in recent memory and faced the off-colored light of the day. My glasses were off and music was playing in my room. As I walked down the hall from the bathroom to my bedroom, I stepped onto something. It was *alive*. I squealed and retreated into my room, the creature hissed and squirmed off down the hall. I still don't understand why they bought a white Roomba for cleaning their white carpet.  The police said that there was new information, and asked me a bunch of weird questions about the room we shared and the rest of the dorm building. They kept asking if we knew of anyone who kept animals in the dorms, especially something like a snake or anything that laid eggs. I started to feel lightheaded and like the world was too bright for me.  I just got back to bed before I started hyperventilating. I'm exhausted. It sounds lame, I know - I was up for all of three hours. Now that I'm in bed, I'm being kept up by the hissing, whirring sound of the Roomba. It's trapped in my room, and I'm too lazy to get up and open the door.  The other thing that's keeping me awake is the strange way that Lucy was acting in the week before she died. She never was one to go out all the time, but that last week, she kept the curtains drawn and I don't think she ever left the room. Maybe there was something else wrong with her, like she was poisoned or...

From Pierce the Veil's [Currents Convulsive](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/piercetheveil/currentsconvulsive.html), +/- a word.      Hi, /r/cryosleep.  My name is Alex, and I have a quirk. It's not-so-much a weird thing that I do, but more of a weird way that I am. Like a compulsion. I can't start something and then not finish it.  Now, I imagine that most of you are thinking *Gee, that doesn't sound so bad, Alex. I wish I could finish that pile of abandoned projects that I've built up over the years.* And normally, I'd agree with you. My quirk has gotten me a lot of things from numerous academic degrees to excelling in a career. It was my quirk that won me the girl of my dreams.   It's carried me far, but it also sometimes gets me into trouble. Once, on a visit to Texas, I entered one of those "finish it and eat for free" contests, and nearly ruptured something unpronounceable. I had to change schools in 8th grade when I started a feud with a teacher that ended up in an elaborate set of plans to have her fired. Another time my parents walked in on me jerking off in my bedroom and despite making eye contact for a brief moment with both of them-  Come on, that joke was just too easy not to take.  So this is one of those times.  The idea started when I went to see Back to the Future in theaters. Among all the other lovable nonsense, there's a device called the "Flux Capacitor," a small machine that sits inside the DeLorean is basically responsible for moving the whole assembly through time. The Hollywood prop became the seed of idea that rattled around in my head for years.  When I was eventually assigned to the government's 4th-Dimension Research Wing, it was the idea of a small device which emitted a field around the user, that finally resulted in a break-through.  Let me back up. The 4-DRW is a joke. I mean "joke" in the sense that it does actually exist, but only with the purpose of continuing to exist. Its nuclear power core runs on the same sort of fuel that powers the careers of Reality TV stars. Researchers realized a long time ago that achieving time travel was far more complicated than they could hope to puzzle together and package into a useful tool. The "controlled" black hole had to be the worst failure that they had, but even that had the feeling that precedes the statement "At least we're trying."  Rather than cut funding, however, Uncle Sam got the right kind of confused and excited, and ultimately gave them a blank check. This is why the wing still exists. The goal changed from actually trying to produce time travel to selling the wing to the higher-ups. By the time I got in, it was basically an advertising firm with a couple of guys mixing vinegar and baking soda.  I'd imagine that it's the reason that they recruited me. In order to get the Film History degree I wanted, I had to take a bunch of basic science and math classes. I couldn't stand to have the loose ends like that, so after several years and piles of debt, I actually look like a scientist on paper, when really I just wanted to make movie props. I had a few bad but finished films by the time I graduated, and the guys on the "marketing" side of the 4-DRW saw them, found out about me, and brought me into the organization. They'd help pay off my crushing debt, as long as every quarter, I helped them make a convincing show for their bosses.  By now it should be easy to see that it was a complete and total accident that my device worked.  It was tradition to let the new member design the experiment. Remember, the point wasn't to do anything, just to create the appearance of doing things. I tried to start small, with near-light speed particle collision, but they told me that it had been done a few times before and that "If we spend like we're on a budget, they'll give us one."  So I basically decided to challenge the engineers. With Doc's Flux Capacitor in mind, I wrote the request for them to pack as much stored, chemical energy as they could into something you could put in your backpack, and then to harness it all at once into an arc of electricity through the air, all while managing not to start a fire or explode. Even though I was drunk as I wrote it, I specifically remember putting in big, red letters, "MUST NOT EXPLODE." And as long as I put my units and dimensions in the right place, our engineers were required to create it. The next week, a sleek-looking 3D-printed box was sitting in the middle of blast chamber Sierra's brushed titanium floor. It didn't look anything like Doc's, but hey, it was a prototype.  We all thought the thing was just going to blow up as soon as it was activated. At least we were going to get a good, bright explosion shot to show the bosses. Sierra is one of our medium sized spherical blast chambers, at just over a half-mile circumference. We set some modified exercise equipment in next to the box in order to show how people would eventually be able to use it to travel through time.  With the cameras and lights in place, we began. When the big red button was pressed, the box started to hum and vibrate. Something inside was spinning. it went on for a few minutes like that, with nothing happening, other than it making this weird noise that kept getting louder and louder. We could hear it through the blast shield, and that thing is thick.  Then, boom. Blue light filled the chrome chamber for a split second, and the sound was gone. The device and most of the workout equipment appeared to be gone as well. Right in the middle of the blast floor was a half-sphere carved right through the titanium, down into the lead. Like someone had taken a giant melon baller to it.  The bottom of the crater was filled with gray powder. The best I can figure is that it's like in the Terminator, where it makes a field around the person, only that field isn't like a perfect bubble, it's more like a wifi hotspot that gets less signal the further away you are from it. Right next to the device, almost everything moves. Around the edges, it's impossible to say when you'll end up, or you might end up only half-transported, leaving a thin reddish powder.  Tomorrow marks Trial 16. We've come a long way since that time. 15.3 had just a few bugs to work out, and only now I'm having thoughts of what it might mean if tomorrow Time Travel becomes a reality... and it's all my fault.  Help me, cryosleep. I can't stop.   Disclaimer: Violent.  ---  Zooey was such a nice girl in the beginning. You'd always see her, head down, hair messy, rushing to her next class and avoiding the other kids in the hall. Xenial, always, but just a little too shy, maybe a little too strange to really fit in. When her mother died after their house caught fire, Zooey took it hard, and it pushed her into a dark place.  Valentine's Day, 1998 was when she had her first "outburst." Unsettling still, is the way she stood over the other me and smiled. There I'd been, taking out my frustration of the day out on her, saying the meanest things that my kid-brain could think to say about her drunk mother and then *boom*, Zooey hit me hard and fast with a power outside herself. Stranger still, was the way that my wound never quite fully healed. Right in that soft spot where my jawbone meets my neck, an angry red mark festered from that day on.  Quietly, Zooey was removed from the school, and digested into the bureaucratic system of foster care. People eventually forgot that she'd ever been there.   One early morning, dew still soaking the lawns of the school, I saw someone standing outside the window. Normally, I'm not sure I would have noticed, except that they were waving their hands in a series of intricate dives and swoops. My eyes squinted against the rising sun, I could just barely see a pair of large spectacles glinting under a dark hood. Lazily, my brain worked to find an explanation. Keeping my eyes on their fluid motion, I raised my own hand. Just as the teacher called my name, the waving stopped.  I held my breath.  Hazy red points of light were now floating from their outstretched hands. Glowing, they revealed the visage of little Zooey beneath the cowl. Face pulled down in a grimace, she shoved the lights toward the building. Each of them grew as they went, sputtering into bitter hot flame.   Dissonant ringing pealed from the fire alarms, and the flames tore through the halls in an instant. Cries of the children consumed in the inferno still haunt me on quiet nights. Before that day, I'd never understood why my scar looked like a burn.   All I can think of now is the look in her eyes as she stood and watched, how a smile crept into the corners of her lips, and how it went away when she saw me alive.   So most of you have heard of /r/nosleep, a place for (mostly) short scary stories where the readers are not allowed to dispute how true they are. *Everything is true.*  There is a relatively new sub, called /r/cryosleep, started by a few of nosleep's mods with similar rules, but set in the future. This opens up a lot of new, fun opportunities for stories. *Everything is going to be true.*  **The Prompt:**  What is the future going to look like? Write it in a way that would be fun to share with a community that will pretend that it is, or is going to be, true.  Bonus points for anything including cryostasis.  ^Note: ^I ^am ^in ^no ^way ^affiliated ^with ^cryosleep. ^I ^just ^like ^the ^stories ^there.      The first creature that I saw in this place... I never saw at all.   It was before I'd found a light. The only way that I knew that it was there was by the sound of its breathing, stirring the emptiness.  I was naive. Inexperience in this endless cavern told me that the rules still applied. That an empty room in the dark was still empty.  "Hello?" I called, and my voice echoed back. Still, there was something there. I could hear the faint ticking raspiness of air moving through its open mouth.  At this time, I was still standing. Foolishly, I stretched my hand toward where I'd heard the noise. My feet carried me half-heartedly. Left foot forward, then the right one coming up to join it.  It must have been close. I could hear its breath with perfect clarity now, deep and huge. I could feel the cool air against my sides, pulling me toward it; smell the scent of decay on its warm breath. Each time it inhaled, there was a whirring, ticking sound like tiny ratcheting gears being wound.  It was my nose that betrayed me. The dead-smelling exhaust tickled my nostrils and brought tears to my eyes. I sneezed, and loudly. Before the echo even made its way back to my ear, a huge metallic clang tore the silence from the air. It felt at the time as though my sneeze had broken the world.  Behemoth footfalls, ringing one after the other, washed around the endless space. My ears split and popped from the noise. My hands, uncommanded, clawed into my ears, trying to pull the painful noise from them, but only managed to dull the edge a little.  Then it was gone. Wet drops poured from my ears as I lay in a pile on the smooth, cool stone.  ---  The second creature that I saw in this place... wasn't a creature at all, it seemed.  A few days had passed - be it two or twelve, I couldn't say. My ears were still just useless pieces of flesh. Somewhere in the darkness, I'd found a light. It was a plastic cannister, about the size of a pop can. As it was shaken, a steel marble worked the fluid inside, and it glowed. One sense gone, one gained.  The cave was endless. The enormity of it truly set in once I could see it with my eyes. The dim, green glow showed only the hints of a high ceiling, and a long, flat, seamless floor as smooth as glass. Every hundred yards there sat a large support pillar, of concrete with bars and rods that jutted out at random.  It was near one of these that my lamp shone upon another person; the first person I'd known to share my prison. My mouth moved, and I felt myself call out, but only cold, oppressive silence met my ears. I walked closer still, nearly able to touch her with my outstretched hand. It was a woman. She seemed old and thin, wearing a faded red dress. Facing away from me and toward the pillar, her face was hidden behind thin black hair.  Then, my gaze fell upon her feet. They writhed and moved strangely under the shadow of her dress. I thought that it might have been some type of animal, a bug, a spider. Green light fell upon the truth, that her toes were shaped like long fingers with joints that were swollen and bent by arthritis. They milled and moved, groping and pulling at that faultless floor.  Her feet had turned her to face me. Dark, wrinkled skin sagged beneath cloudy eyes and from her neck. Her bones still glowed with former beauty, but age and this place had sapped her of her youth and its sweet goodness.  Her arms and legs were somehow switched at the shoulders and hips. She stared into me with those blank, wet and blind eyes. Or perhaps she heard my heart pounding, or my heavy breathing. I stepped away, and she bent forward, placing her hands (feet?) on the ground. Her gaze never left me. She started to walk, and those long, irregular hands came around her sides.  From somewhere in the folds of her dress, she pulled a small bag. I was backing away, but she was pursuing me, getting closer and closer. Her mouth was working, her lips twisting into words that I could no longer hear.  Two long fingers probed into the bag. Her feet slapped the floor rapidly, and she was upon me. Just before I could turn to run in earnest, she tossed a pinch of swirling dust into the air.  My lungs burned. I couldn't inhale - the very air had turned to fire. I couldn't run, I could only cough and spit and crawl. My face felt as though the skin had been removed and some gnarled hand tugged at the exposed nerves with every beat of my heart. Panicked, I couldn't force my eyes open to know where the harpy had gone.  The air gradually cleared. With painful sloth it came back to me in gulps. I lost consciousness, choked, and woke only to black out again. My body knew that I was about to die while my mind knew only fear and agony.  ---  Broken, and burnt I lay, and resolved to explore the darkness no further. For what felt like weeks, I kept the chemicals inside the lamp glowing, keeping the shadows and what was in them at bay like a child's night light. Shaking its marble and liquid to recharge it.   An internal debate raged within my wheezing chest: to let them claim me as I lay, or to try to preserve myself until the time that one large and hungry enough came for me. The light began to fade.  I laid on my back, and prayed for sleep. One cracked eyelid showed pale shapes moving, circling closer, just beyond where my lantern shone.  When the reaction inside it finally stilled, I felt sure that I would go, taken away on hundreds and thousands of pale, thin limbs by creatures that God knew better than to create.  Instead, it was... peaceful.  The only thing that moved was the fluttering of my heart. My fear ebbed like the tide until it crashed back down on my in a wave. A sensation of tingling crawled over my body. My eyes snapped open and I felt for the lamp. A jolt like a lightning bolt shot up my spine. I scrambled to my feet, and felt blindly for the light.  Another electric shock, like static discharged, but prolonged for several seconds jolted through my hand as it felt along the floor and my bare feet. My knees faltered, and my knees bore the pain too. My limbs moved on their own, and an errant hand or foot - I couldn't say which - struck the lamp and sent it glowing, spinning along the bare floor. I gripped it, rattled it, and held it up to show my attacker.  There was nothing and no one, and yet again a wave of torture came. Each time I pulled a pained limb away, another part of me was sacrificed in its stead. I shed my thin clothes and stood on them, but it brought no relief. Next, I ran. The shocks became stronger, making their way up, boiling my blood and out arcing out through my panting mouth head and twitching arms. The floor itself was *made* of electricity, it seemed, and there was no escape.  As I ran, scrambled, wrestled, screamed, a thought pushed its way into my brain. A memory from before of a lab rat that said "You never, ever get used to" the feeling of electric shock. I could only hope that someone would turn it off, but soon, even hope was replaced with pain.  It took a very long time. Between exhaustion and shock, I suddenly felt sure that I was passing from life. And then, the pain was gone.  It was bliss.  I collapsed against the base of one of the pillars, and smiled. Tears of joy streamed from my eyes, and down onto my naked chest. I tried to rub my tired, numb legs, but my hands never came. I examined my hands under the lantern, and watched as it struck my thigh, my chest, then my face.  I felt nothing, not the pain of the floor, or the tears on my face.  ---  I walked, mute, deaf and numb, straight ahead into the blackness. My relief at the subsidence of the pain had worn itself out, and I felt as empty inside as I did on the surface. I walked for miles. It was all I could do. In the dim green light of my lantern, I could see my bare feet as they carried me forward by dumb reflex.  I had no feeling in my legs, or anywhere. It was hard to keep my balance. Even as stumbled and fell, I had to rely on my eyes to tell me which way was up; had to watch my hand to know that it was placed on the ground, pushing me up. The light faded. Either it was growing weaker or I was losing interest in shaking it. What point was there? Each new darkness I wandered into would surely be the same as the last. Eventually, lights began to flicker in front of my eyes and I was seeing stars.   But then, one of the stars far in the distance shone more brightly and illuminated several of the steel and stone pillars. Lights. They weren't sensory misfires, there was something ahead. My pace, the march of a doomed man, quickened to a jog. The lights continued to fly high in the cavern, resembling flares or fireworks. I thought of the times that we'd bought roman candles during the summer holidays. My eyes strained to see anything below them, in the area lit by their brief glow. My breath quickened at the thought of seeing another person's face illuminated in the distance.  In the corner of my eye, I took in that one of the pillars was beginning to move. Something huge had knocked into it, and sent stone and scraps of metal flying in a cloud of dust and debris. I changed course too late, and a fragment of rock as large as a mattress swiped my left side.  Dust cloyed the flashing, flying lights above and just a short ways ahead. I rolled my body to allow myself to see what was happening. I could just see objects moving through the clouds. Hundreds of snakelike creatures writhed in a ball. Each one was several feet around. Beneath the ball, I could see four appendages, and realized that the snakes were in fact connected as one creature, towering fifty feet or more in the air. It was making its way closer to me, its massive weight evident in the slow movement of its legs.  Some of the beast's appendages were longer and more slender, tipped with white lights that winked on and off, but all of its many arms were being flung about in wild anger. Just as I stood and turned to run, my eye was drawn to a dark spot on the pillar behind the beast. A doorway.  It smashed into another pillar, this one very near me. My ankle was bent at an odd angle, and I could see my breath stirring the dust in front of me, but I felt no pain, only a wrong-ness like one feels when walking with one foot on a curb and the other in a street. I hobbled my way toward the next pillar, hoping to take refuge behind it.  I went as fast as I could, but I was sure that the naked, slimy, white arms of the thing was right behind me. If I ventured a look back over my shoulder, I might lose my balance, and then the thing would be on top of me.  I reached the next pillar, and hugged onto the corner, trying to conceal myself behind it. Looking back, I saw that the monster had stopped, and no longer pursued me. Up out of the center, in the top, parting the knotted tentacles like a bee leaving a rose, a larger appendage rose up. This one was jet black, and opened at the end, revealing long, needle-sharp teeth dripping with liquid.  it snaked down across the floor, toward a small speck of something green near where I'd fallen; my lantern. The only other source of light, drowned out by the beast's strobing stadium lights. The large snakelike mouth struck the ground around it, and its sharp teeth sank deep into the stone floor. The other tentacles braced against the floor while the great, black neck strained and stretched, but it was the floor that gave first, letting up a large, round plug of stone, which was promptly swallowed. The black head of the thing retreated back into the center of the tangle of other tentacles, their waving movements having calmed into a gentle swaying again.  I wanted so badly to run away, but one thing held me in place. The doorway. It seemed like it was hardly possible that after all this time, that I could have finally found a way out, and yet in my mind there was no where else to go. I had to try.  The beast made its way back in front of the pillar with the door, apparently standing guard. I made a large circle and came up behind the huge pillar. It was identical to all the others, a mish-mosh of metal scraps, jagged rocks and cement nearly fifty feet across at the base, but knowing the beast, and possibly a way out was just on the other side made this one seem much smaller.  I crawled around the edge, and the things swirling tentacles came into view, reaching up toward the faraway ceiling, the longer ones tipped with those blinding white lights. I stayed low and hugged the side of the wall, just hoping that the beast could only see light, and that I could stay hidden in the darkness for long enough.  I was halfway around the side of the pillar, and was still alive. The doorway was just another fifty feet ahead in the center of the side facing the monster. I decided to look away, focusing on my hands. Without my other senses, looking away almost made the thing disappear completely. In a few moments, I was at the corner.  Here, I could hide part of my body behind a large disk made of jagged metal which stuck out of the cement wall. I paused for a moment to plan my route forward. I would have to go around the disk, and then scurry twenty five feet along the wall, only ten feet or so from the feet of the guardian. I didn't so much as look back.  I was around the metal barrier, crawling, crawling. Twenty feet. Crawling, I looked away, staring at my right hand which traced the line where the flawless floor met the unfinished cement. I glanced at the door. Fifteen feet. A sickly white limb, with blue veins coursing beneath the slimed translucent skin lazed through my vision. I closed my eyes to stop myself from staring at it. I arched my back, sure that one of the tentacles would smash me like a bug, or those long, transparent fangs would pick me up, without my so much as knowing.  I stopped crawling, and opened my eyes. My right hand was through the doorway, and without knowing it, I had turned myself. I had made it. I glanced one last time at the beast, and saw that its black head was snaking back through the mass of wormy arms again in a smooth, lubricated motion. With my eyes closed, I hadn't noticed that my knee had struck a piece of metal debris, knocked from the tower by the beast earlier. The noise had doomed me.  I stood and ran into the doorway, and found a spiralling set of black stairs lining the walls. My leg gave out, and I dove, face-first into the bottom stair. I frantically clawed up the stairs, toward the orange light coming from above me. I could feel and hear nothing, but I was sure that I was screaming.  The wall above me erupted. Angry appendages entered the stairwell, probing blindly, looking for the intruder. I stopped. From below, the black head, mouth closed snaked in. I was curled into a ball, just below the first landing, next to the wall. Above me, the tentacles, and below me the head. I couldn't move, and I couldn't make a sound. I blacked out before I even realized that I'd been holding my breath.  When I came to, the arms and head of the thing had retreated from the stairwell. I was alone, bathed in the orange glow coming from above. As quietly as I could, I crawled, one step at a time. It must have taken me hours. Finally, I could see the top! An opening in the wall, where an orange, electric glow shone in was just another few landings above me. I crept faster, desperation wriggling its way into my movements.  I don't know what happened, but suddenly I was aware of a vibration and the whole stairway was shaking and vibrating. I cast a glance down over the edge, and saw the flashing lights of the creature, its strong white tentacles pulling it through the hole it had made and at an unfathomable speed up the center of the stairwell. It took up the entire area, wall to wall, and shot up toward me. In the center, I could see that black mouth opened wide.  I ran with my one good leg and my hands in a sort of tripod up the last few flights, and rushed out of the opening, turned to the side and dove out of the way of the beast. In a blur, the white beast, now colored orange by the lights outside shot away from me. Without any hesitation, it stepped on and demolished a 1980's Volkswagen Rabbit, and shot its head up, snatching the glowing bulb from the top of the street lamp. When that one was gone, it continued on down the rain-drenched street, devouring whatever light it could find.  I was free. Oh god.  *It was all real.*  ---  These words are wasted. I know.  I've only written them in case some time in the future, another person comes along, so that they'll know what happened. That there was another who survived. I can't explain why the hellish world below this one was suddenly caused to hemorrhage over into ours, where the beasts went once they'd ravaged our great society, or whether they'll be back again.  I can only tell you that I saw the place that they came from.  And it was almost empty.   /r/nosleepworkshops has come under new management. If you're a fan of horror and helping writers, check it out!      Fosters alarm blared in his ears. He slapped aimlessly at the floor until he finally managed to contact the snooze button. Something wet had soaked the dirty floor and silk lining of Fosters resting place. As he lay sprawled over the edge of his coffin, a drip of groundwater dripped onto the back of his neck.  Gotta fix that leak. he spoke to himself, voice clipped and muted by the small, dirt-walled space. He sighed. Another day. It got harder and harder to wake from the dead with each one that passed.  He thrust a decomposed, rotting hand through the ground above him, into the moonlight. Fumblingly, he pulled at the grassy ground above his grave. It was easier to get a grip on the marble headstone, but to get there, he had to dislocate a shoulder. Each time he did it, the socket became a little more worn. Somewhere along the line, theyd decided to put the marker at the head instead of the feet, and zombies like Foster started their day with a little more of a struggle, as they cursed the well-meaning folks whod buried them.  He shambled toward the front gate of the cemetary, a large, black ornate eyesore of ivy and roses.  Hi George!  Hey Foster. Got plans tonight? Georges mostly skeletal hand held up a bag of green, writhing worms. I got these from a friend in Reedsville.  Without a digestive system, working liver, kidneys or totally intact nervous system, the stimulants that theyd used in life were no longer effective.. The only way to get a buzz was through the use of parasites. The offer was enticing, ut Foster had other plans.  Sorry, I cant. Got a new lead to look into over in Springfield.  Really? Sorry, I mean... Thats great, Foster. I hope you find her. Hey, if it doesnt work out this time, half this bag is yours.  Thats a deal. See you at sunrise.  Foster pushed open the gate which produced a massive shriek from its rusty hinges. He shambled down the main road, then turned left toward Springfield.  ***  The first sign to greet a person as they entered Springfield was the one reading NO VACANCY at the 24/7 hotel. It was run by a little blue ghoul with big glasses named Leroy. The hotel wasnt actually full, and hadnt been for more than 120 years, but hed kept the sign working as it doubled as the name of his new business. The undead living out in the cemeteries preferred to do their business with Leroy when they could, rather than go into town. The ghoul carried little everyday things like embalming fluid, bandages and stitches, and caulking (which Foster would need to remember to buy on his way back), but he could get just about anything in a couple of days if you were willing to fill out the order paperwork.  It was Leroy who had given Foster the tip - somebody new recovered from near ground zero claiming that their last name was Ruff.It wasnt a definite match - theyd found others before. In the hundred years since the bomb had dropped, theyd found thousands of dead. Statistically, some were bound to have the name. It didnt stop Fosters steady shambling past NO VACANCY, though.  When they found her, hed be there. Hed finally be able to take his wife home to the grave beside his.  ***  Wanna buy some maggots, pal? A zombie with rotting, squirming flesh asked, walking close enough to smell out of a dark alley. Foster shied away, and scowled. Whats his problem? asked the maggot dealer, as Foster shuffled away.  Hed always hated coming into the city, preferring to stay in the secluded country as much as possible. There was only one thing that was in the city that Leroy couldnt get: fresh brains.  Foster pushed through the doors of the busy cafe, and spotted a waitress he knew. Her hands were full of plates and empty bottles, but she nodded her charred skull toward the back table.  Lindsay was an anomaly in Fosters world. Being killed in the nuclear blast of course meant that she was also fully skeletal. All the ones they recovered were now. Freshly out of the rubble, these newly dead were blank slates. The ghouls had taken it upon themselves to reintegrate them. It wasnt always possible.  She was one of the few freshly dead that Foster genuinely had no problems with. She was sweet as ever and worked two jobs to save money for a little plot like the ones in his cemetery. And she always remembered just how Foster liked his brains; bloody and raw, with just a dash of formaldehyde on the edge of the plate.  As soon as she could, she hurried to his table in the furthest corner, carrying a fresh plastic bottle of Johannes   Johanness finest embalming tonic. She set it down and with quick bony fingers, signed the words Single or double, today, Honey?  With his own slow movements he curled his hand to say, Double, thank you. The Recovery Clinic is not open for one hour.  Recovery? That sounds exciting! Your signing is getting better. Her hands moved so fast that the bones clicked against each other. It made a mockery of his own brain dead hands, but he took the compliment anyway.  ***  The entrance to the Recovery Clinic was actually an ancient train station, converted in the Twenty-First Century to use with the Subway, and housed enough office space to support the citys day-to-day metro operations. If you were claiming or adopting a corpse, you out-processed them through the station.  The underground tunnels were the only way to get close enough to the heart of the city and ground zero. Ghouls excavated as far in as their immunity would take them, but the fallout would still be too great for the areas closest to the blast site to be unearthed for years to come. The intermediate area housed the clinic itself, where bodies were reassembled and prepared for their assimilation back into society. The underground tunnels were the only way to enter the area with safety from the radiation above.  Foster took a slip of paper with a number, and found one of the empty dilapidated leather seats. Hed always liked the smell of the dust down here. A few other zombies were waiting in the seats with him, a mother with quite a bit of flesh remaining sat, while her children, both newly dead, took turns poking an old sleeping skeleton wrapped head-to-toe in bandages. Each time that they did so, and his old bones began to stir, the pair would run away with a clatter of small bones on the stone tiles.  The car sounded far off down the tunnel and the group took to their feet, including the bandaged skeleton who took a few minutes to adjust his hips into place before standing.  The single-car subway train pulled into the ancient platform a little fast, and bumped into the barricade. The ghouls and zombies standing on board had to take a large step to regain their balance at the sudden stop.  In the conductors seat was a yellowed and decaying member of the undead. The damp tunnels had been unkind to him. A tremor shook his hand and threatened to break the last remaining strings of flesh holding his arm together.  Hey Gory.  Hi-i-i, F-f-foster. B-back ag-g-g-gain?  Hopefully for the last time. Trying not to get my hopes up.  O-o-kay, then. Ho-old on, the b-b-breaks are a little w-worn t-tod-day.  Thanks, Gory. Dont work too hard.  Foster was sure the old corpse hadnt heard him, but took his place in the back anyway. As the train car began to pull away from the station, he wondered how many times hed made this ride now.  ***  From start to finish, the tunnel took about five minutes to traverse. At three minutes in, Gory sneezed. He made to wipe the rot and snot from his upper lip, but found that the last tendon had given out, separating his arm at the elbow. He could only manage a choked scream as they sped into the corner without brakes. the ancient wheels finally separated, and the car shot straight through the cement wall, into a parallel tunnel and stopped dead against the solid earth behind it.  Foster unstuck himself from the other corpses in the front of the train car. The bandaged skeletons parts were everywhere. Gory was just a pile of dried meat, ragged clothes and crushed bone. The woman was starting to fuss about, collecting the bones of her children into their separate piles. Foster rubbed a pain in his belly, where he found a small bone had punctured his stomach, letting the brains hed eaten earlier out and staining his suit. The woman snatched to bone from him and went back to her task.  Foster opened the door and stepped onto the gravel floor of the tunnel. There was a light shining in the distance, possibly from above the ground. He pulled his suits collar up over his neck and headed toward the light.  Dont go into the light! the woman called from the train. You could be exposed!  Dont worry. Ill just go see if theres anyone who can help, then Ill come right back.  A short ways down the tunnel he found a ladder built into the wall that led to a circular portal above. Bright light shone down into the tunnel. Hed have to make this quick.   ...Relatively quick.  On the surface, high-powered work lights illuminated the entire area. Foster was blind. He picked a direction at random and began limping.  Blleeuuugh! he moaned. The sensation of being in the bright light was uncomfortable. He put his arms out in front of him, reaching for anything to regain his orientation. Someone screamed.  Get him back in line!  What the-? Hes a zed!  Where the hell did he come from?  Get it the fuck out of here!  Fosters blind stumbling had brought him to the edge of the lit area. He couldnt see what was being lit, but there were people in the darkness all around. Lots of them, all standing still like a wall of silhouettes. Someone pushed him while grabbing his arm tightly. A big ghoul was hurrying him out of the area.  Fosters head spun, nearly falling off. He could still see the line of people with ghouls moving back and forth keeping them in place. Tall buildings rose around them on every side.  Buildings that should have been destroyed a hundred years ago.  ***  When the ghouls had finally let Foster go, hed been allowed to go to the Recovery Clinic and check for the remains. Someone had already claimed them. The bones theyd found were a Jeanette Ruff. Fosters wifes name was Alicia.  He didnt get home until well after dawn, but the worry of his skin drying out managed not to bother him. He forgot to buy caulking. George had gone under long ago.   All that Foster could think of was the line of humans - real, living humans, and the city of buildings theyd always believed to be destroyed.

The plates were each muffled by supple pieces of leather sewn between them. It was truly masterfully made, and it occurred to her that she hadn't made a sound yet; hadn't heard a sound yet - the others running beside her through the trees were just as silent.  No one in the group had said a word since leaving the monastery they'd used as shelter. Not one word, and yet they each seemed to know where exactly they were supposed to be. They knew where every other person was supposed to be be as well, in order for the formation to work, and that was what was terrifying to Mona. This was her first mission, her first charge to the field of battle to appease her God, Tempus, and despite all the training and preparations, she was still convinced that the clerics to her right and to her left knew what she should be doing better than she did.  Then they were out of the trees, and there was no more room in her mind for doubt or uncertainty. There was only war all around them. The followers of Tempus had the upper hand against their enemy rolling down the side of the valley deep into the flank of their wearied enemy. The militia force they'd been battling further up the valley had done so well, using their superior knowledge of the twists and turns and secret passageways through the mountains to narrow the gap in their pitifully small numbers and the attacking force's army of thousands.  Pressed down into the relative openness of the valley, however, without the aid of the priests and priestesses, they would scarcely have lasted through the night.  Mona felled one of the attackers before they even saw her coming, by harnessing the added speed from running downhill into a mailed elbow that she drove into the base of a skull. She felt the bones lift away from each other and the muscled soldier collapsed on the ground. Her eyes lingered a second too long on the face of the man, and another screamed and charged her with a nasty barbed spear still dripping with gore.  Mona managed to bring up her shield just in time to deflect the thrust. Her training guided her motions, but she was distracted by the dirty round face that was contorted in rage where her kindly weapons instructor's face should have been. She dodged a wild blow from her opponent's shield, and without needing to look, ducked low enough for the spear to come back over her. Once it had cleared, she sprung from her low position, pressing with all her considerable strength driving the spear far out to the side. Her opponent's flank was open, and she plunged her sword through the gap in his armor, between the ribs and into his heart and lungs.  The maneuver had shifted her battle helmet uncomfortably. Another soldier had targeted her from a few feet away, however, and there wasn't time to adjust. She flipped it off with the back of her hand, and confidently strode toward her attacker.  The din of battle took on a different sound as arrows fell in a blanket across the battlefield, fired from enemy archers hidden in the shadows of the trees. Mona's attacker had taken one in the lower back, the sheer pain of it, drove him to his knees. A second later, her face burned as another whizzed by close enough for the stiff feathers to open a cut across her cheek. She brought her shield up, to account for the gap in her armor. She'd never taken her eyes off the man, still on his knees, clawing desperately to free the arrow from his back, but his armor's inflexibility wouldn't allow him the relief. A slash across his throat ended his agony.  To her left, the militia forces were regrouping, the attention taken off of them, and placed onto the greater threat. Back up the hill where she'd come, five points of yellow light were hovering in the hands of the priests, before being thrown onto the holy warriors below. One found their way to Mona, the small sphere growing to surround her. Another volley of arrows launched and stopped dead at the edge of the magical barrier. The ground forces were broken, it was only a matter of sweeping up that was left. Some of her brethren charged into the forest on the opposite bank, toward the unarmored archers. All told, the slaughter was over in minutes.  Mona looked over the faces of the men and women fallen in battle. Tempus would be pleased at their performance; few of their brothers and sisters were among those on the bloody ground. She set about healing the members of the militia who still clung to life, and finishing off those from the invading army. Mona fetched a magical amulet from around her neck and rubbed it with the thumb of her left hand. It started to glow and pull against its chain. She could still only perform minor healing spells, but the amulet's magic would aid her in bringing relief to those with more serious wounds.

Past all that.  *You're a grown-up now,* her mother had told her. That was a full year ago, but this night, for the first time, she might have felt like one. Laney studied her appearance in the full-length mirror once again. Her mother's gardening cloak hung around her shoulders, still a bit too large. Its silvery seams glimmered with enchantments, the pinnacles of the stitching ended elegantly in rosebuds. Another rose, this one black, adorned the band in her stark white hair.  She looked ready for anything. Almost.  She skipped back to fetch a sword from the bed. With its belt slung over her shoulder, the jade scabbard dragged and rattled on the rough-hewn wooden floor.  ---  Standing at the gate, Laney traced the intricate patterns of the wrought-iron with a finger. She'd walked by a thousand times before, never paying any mind to them. Roses, for their beauty. And thorns to keep children out of the cemetery beyond. Laney wasn't a child any longer.  There was no lock to be seen, but she felt something in her chest tugging her forward. She touched the delicate, silver-inlaid hilt to the center of the gate, and the black vines around it came to life, spiraling outward from the center. The silver in her sword and robe began to glow, the ancient magic of the strange town yawning to life.  Inside the gates, soft sounds could be heard in the darkness. Dragging. The smell of fresh, wet dirt, and another - deeper and muskier - of decay.  Laney lowered herself to one knee to light a lamp from her pack. Focusing on the wick, she didn't see the dark shapes moving in the soft light of the match. She held the lamp high. Higher, higher. It was plucked from her gloved hand. All around her, green stalks twisted and writhed around her, their thorns just grazing her robe. The silver glowed brightly in resistance. Her lips pressed into a thin smile.  She gripped the glowing hilt tightly in her left hand, and pulled the green steel blade clear of its scabbard. The roses around her hissed their distaste like great serpents.  With dexterous grace, she mowed them down as fast as they came.   From [this prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/28lw8q/ip_the_ghost_thief/)  [The Ghost Thief](http://www.kimsokol.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GhostThief.jpg) by [Kim Sokol](http://kimsokol.tumblr.com/)  ---  The girl opened her pack and extracted a fat green bottle wrapped in fur. It was one she'd used several times before for this exact dark purpose. The crumbling cork slid loosely out of the opening. She crouched next to the lifeless body at her feet, her tight leather armor creaking softly as she moved. With a muffled word and a mysterious swish of her hand, the air in front of her glowed softly, then faded.  With a frustrated swear, she repeated the charm. The light glowed a little brighter this time and Jarod, standing in the shadows, thought that he could just see the outline of a tortured face being framed in the glow. This spell faded as well, and the girl swore louder. Jarod couldn't see why the blonde thief would even bother. This area had hosted several wars throughout the years and remains were plentiful; one only needed to look around the cave that they were in to know that. Wasting an enchanted bottle to capture this spirit wouldn't bring her any fortune, especially from here. No, this was something else.  On the third try, the thief's spell illuminated a satisfied smile on her face and caused Jarod to slink behind a pile of bones. The face, glowing in the darkness, was stretched and almost as thin as the skulls lining the walls. She began to reel the spirit into the bottle with one waving hand. Obviously clumsy with magic, her brow pinched in concentration. Jarod thought how easy it would be to incapacitate the girl right now. He had cause; the body she knelt over had belonged to his mentor, a silver-robed mage that had earned some renown in a long-ago age. Therein lied the reason that Jarod stayed his attack. The apprentice felt that he had long ago gleaned all he could from the old man with his strict code and laws, and finding him dead at a cutpurse's hand lifted his spirits.  Her work was complete. She carefully wrapped the glowing bottle and set it into her bag with the rest of her collection, considered the cavern around her and set out, her new shadow creeping along the tunnels behind her.  The town of Zale, where Jarod and his master had come was due east. The girl struck a path to the south through the woods. He admired how at home she seemed to be, even as she avoided the main paths. Early on, he had summoned a sphere of silence around himself so that the girl wouldn't hear him breaking branches and twigs. Her own magic seemed to be grounded in her skill and dexterity; he hadn't heard her once. For reasons he couldn't fully explain, he was captivated by the girl; her beauty seemed to grow with each obstacle she overcame.  He began to feel the length of the trek taking its toll. Briars and branches had claimed the hem of his robe, and his cloth shoes, once cobalt blue were now brown and caked with mud. His mark emerged from the trees onto a wide dirt road. Her pace had never slowed in the brush, but now she clipped along even faster.  The road ended in a wide, flat valley that housed a community of small farms. In the center of the valley, a group of huddled buildings stood above than the rest. The sun was setting on the hills framing the village. Against its glow, the girl's silhouette disappeared into one of the buildings. That was fine by Jarod.  For twelve years the young mage had studied under his old master. Creatures, places, artifacts, scrolls, tomes... It had been an endless cycle, a tedious life. He intended to study the girl in her own environment, untainted by his observation, as he would have studied a Pixie or a Bogg Toad. He wasn't in search of companionship; he only wanted to know her, while enjoying the power that anonymity afforded him. That power swirled and mixed with the feeling of freedom inflating in his chest as he found his way to the cluster of buildings.  The only building with light and activity coming from within it was an inn that doubled as a tavern and a small trading post. A squat, mustached man frowned at Jarod's undeniably impractical and dirty clothes from behind a wooden counter. In the next room was a tavern where hardy farmers were gathered around handmade tables where they were loudly sharing cups and tales.  Jarod's hand made a subtle movement and the mustached man's frown became dulled and the light left his eyes. "I'll be needing a room and clothes. You don't need to know my name or my business, only that I wish to be left alone." He set a pile of coins on the wooden countertop. "I am quite sure that this will be sufficient to cover my stay. My key, please."  ---  A short time later, Jarod descended the stairs wearing black pants and boots with a forest green traveling cloak. The noise from the small pub rose up the steps to greet him. Ignoring the man at the counter, he grabbed the handle of the door to leave. Jarod released the handle and his hand slowly dropped to his side. He turned his focus back to the bar. Standing there, next to a group of men at the table, was the one he'd been following. He walked into the bar and pulled out an empty chair at one of the tables - the only empty chair in the room. The strangers stared at him for a moment, but Jarod's gaze was fixed on the girl as she went from table to table, laughing and joking with the men she obviously knew. Her dexterity and finesse were obvious here as well, and her beauty more so. Two of the others at Jarod's table went back to their stories. The third tapped him on the shoulder with enough force to .  In normal circumstances, the mage would have resented the uncalled for touch, but the discomfort of his clothes was a constant reminder that he was in disguise. He swallowed his discomfort and looked toward the man. A thick beard was soaked with mead, and he smelled like dirt and sweat. "She's somethin' huh?"  "Something... Yes. Do you know her?"  "Sure do. That's the girl I'm gonna marry."  "You are her betrothed?"  "Well... no. She doesn't actually know me jus' yet. Gotta work up a little courage is all."  "You've never actually met her, then?"  "Oh, I met 'er. She... might not 'a got my name right..."  "I see."  "She's such a cute li'l thing. Her family's got a farm back toward the red hill." The young man tried to focus through his inebriation in order to take in Jarod's appearance. Before he could finish, the girl had appeared beside the table.  "Hi, Bill. Mort." She nodded to the old men at the table. "Another drink for both of you?" Both nodded and went back to their conversation. "And you two... well, hello. I don't believe I've seen you here before" she said, looking at Jarod. "Brothers?" Jarod glanced at the other man ogling the girl. Thick arms and shoulders flanked a barrel-chest with a wild blond beard hanging over it. The two could not have been more dissimilar.  "Ah, no. Afraid not. I'd like to purchase a drink for my new friend..." Jarod dragged out the last line, hoping that the lovestruck man at his side would offer a name. It didn't come, but the object of his affection kindly ignored the awkward pause.   As she left, the the oldest man at the table leaned over toward Jarod. "Ye don' want to be gettin' yer hopes up with tha' one," he slurred. "Strange, she is."  "Hear tell she's a necker-mancer," the fourth man whispered loudly enough to hear over the din of the crowded room.  "She ain't no necromancer! She's a *collector*. She collects things 'n puts 'em up in her ol' man's barn.  "Well, her ma an' 'er ol' man are weird ones too. Whole family of 'em out by Red Hill."  "Point bein'... Ye're best to leave 'er alone." At this, the bearded man looked slightly crestfallen. The barmaid arrived with the drinks and smiled at everyone else at the table before locking her gaze onto Jarod. For several seconds, she just stared. Jarod shifted in his seat and felt himself start to sweat. The moment passed and her smile returned before leaving.  "She winked at me!" shouted the bearded man. She certainly hadn't, but no one was cold enough to correct him.  "You said that she's a 'collector,' what did you mean by that?"  "Naw, I said she a '*necker*-man-"  "Shut up, Mort! I already told ya, she's not a necromancer." The man turned back to Jarod. "Her an' her family aren't from here. They came from some place I never heard of. That was 'bout four, five years ago now. So they show up outta the blue, and they buy a farm and then stuff just start disappearing."  "Stuff?"  The blonde walked close by the group's table and the man telling the story lowered his voice, ominously. "Yeah, stuff. Had about five of us out in the woods picking this certain kind o' mushroom. We sit down for some lunch and when we get to movin' again, no' one of us can find our bags. A whole morning's work, gone."  "Oy, I 'ad somebody trod off with me flask once. D'ya think-"  "I r'member yer flask well enough, Mort. I r'member 'cause I saw it fall in the lake when we was out fishin'." Bill shot him a look to silence him, but the man was occupied trying to pull something out of his pockets. "As I was sayin'- er... what was I sayin'?"  "So you think they stole your mushrooms?"  "Not just the mushrooms. People started to notice they were losin' their stuff from all over town. Their old stuff. Like Grappler's gran gave 'im a locket from 'afore the war, Brawn had a set o' armor his pa gave 'im. I 'ad a nice knife from me ma... used it fer cuttin' carrots. Stuff that was right inside peoples' homes, an' it just went missin'."  "You think she's got somrthing to do with it?"  "Well I dunno if it's *her* exactly's doin' it, but she's got the stuff in her old man's barn, that's fer sure."  "Yeah 'n my flask! It were green 'n fat."  "Was it glass?" Jarod asked.  "Yeah! How'd you guess that?" the man asked in wonder.  Without pausing, he responded "If it had been metal, surely the two of you would have been able to recover it when it fell into the lake." Bill laughed loud and drunkenly. Jarod followed the girl with his eyes for a while. "So, Bill, if everything is there in the barn, why hasn't anyone gone in and taken it back?"  Bill looked around him, lowered his head so that the tip of his beard just dipped into his cup of ale, but didn't lower his voice whatsoever. "It's haunted."  Jarod perked up at this, pulling his gaze from the girl. Mort burst out, "See! That's what I' been tryin'a say. She's a necker-"  "She ain't!"  "Well then what's that I seen her doin'-"  "You ain't seen shit, Mort."  "Please," Jarod ventured softly. "I'd like to hear what Mort here has to say."  It was Mort's turn to scowl at Bill, and he relished in the moment for a long second. "As I say. I seen the girl ou' in the woods one night, 'n I think she might'a been hunting 'cause there were something dead by 'er. So's she stops 'n pulls out this little bottle - blue, like the sky - and starts wavin' her hands and sayin' some kind o' spell. Then outta nowheres, that dead thing's spirit starts floatin' up, glowin' real bright in the dark, and she stuffs the thing into her blue bottle. I think that dead thing was a man... but I never went close enough to see. Ye' ever hear anything like it?"  "Actually, I have."  "Told you!" shouted Mort.  "Now hold on! The mister din't say boo 'bout necromancers yet."  "Sorry, Mort. I don't think that she is a necromancer. I don't think that she's much of a magician at all, actually. There are simple charms that one can procure to give the power to capture a departed soul in an enchanted container. Now, do you know of why she might want to do such a thing?" Jarod allowed their silence to linger a moment before answering his own question.   "Because she's a collector."  A smile spread back into Bill's face. "Yeah!"  The souls that she had taken were nearly worthless, but they might have contained sentimental value. However, if he could get inside the barn where she kept it, he may yet find some artifacts of worth.  Oddly, not a single customer had left the tavern yet. The starstruck young man had fallen asleep, a line of drool was strung from his beard to the table, and nearly hung to the ground.  Jarod stood, his drink was only half-finished, but he felt his balance waver for a moment.  The cool air of night blew across his body. He supposed for a moment that he should have asked where exactly the barn was, however it wasn't necessary. The mage had other means. The soft orange lights of the tiny town shrank behind him. In the darkness, he thrust his hand high into the air, feeling for the pulse of magic. Puzzled, Jarod lowered his hand. He felt magic all around him.  In the field beside him he heard rustling. It was getting closer. The young mage raised his hands in front of him, ready to react with fire and wind to whatever may come from the tall plants.  The soul thief emerged. She was wearing her thieves' leather again. Seemingly oblivious to Jrod's presence, she plodded down the road in front of him.  Jarod tried to count the number of things that had made him feel uneasy today. He traced the girl's writhe silhouette in the light, and forgot to feel uneasy. He followed.  Though something was interfering with his senses, Jarod didn't require a spell to know that the barn that he was approaching was something special. It simply hummed with mystery. Looking directly at it, the structure appeared normal. If he looked through the corner of his eyes, it appeared to have a faint glow just at the edges, as though it was filled with light and the corners sprung a leak.

It wasn't his *job*. It wasn't "what he did." It was what he was.  My mother was the only person with enough love to cut through his thick armor. With her, he was more than a killer - he was a man.  The forest was her favorite place in all the world. I can still hear her singing freely, father's baritone rising to meet her pure voice. I can still picture the sun playing along her golden hair, father's rough and scarred hands running gently through it.  When she died, that tender man died with her. All that remained was a husk, as cold, cruel and biting as the axe that he wielded.  Killing; preparing to kill again; planning to kill more efficiently; surviving until the next battle. These things he taught me, and they became my life.   A life of death.  When I was able, I struck out on my own. I fought in the campaigns of kings and the pits of gamblers. I fought on the side of justice and corruption, the righteous and the wrong. I trampled the weak and the strong alike. Any enemy that came before me was struck down.  I had become death.  The final battle ground to an end. A man closed the distance between us. His axe was drawn, his visor down. He wore familiar armor. And I knew that he would not rest until he had killed me.   His enemy.  Two embodiments of carnage and bloodshed clashed. Our struggle took us into the forest, neither able to gain the edge over the other. We fought for hours. I heard a gentle voice, and though it was the dead of night, felt the warmth of sunlight on my shoulders.  A rattling voice came from my opponent, my father, joining in the song of the forest.  I found an opening and took it. My blade rent his guts onto the ground, the soft forest floor stained with blood. He staggered backwards, and crumpled at the base of a tree. Their singing stopped, and the forest was left dark and silent.  It was done.  The forest floor caught me as I fell. It held me as I wept.  I cried for the man, finally returned from death.

In his prime, Wayne would have played the situation to his favor - twisted their arrogance and recklessness against them. That time was long over. All he had left was the feeling of tiredness deep in his bones, and a hit of something that he hadn't experienced since he was a boy.  Fear.  They were far from alone in the bar, but Bruce Wayne was no stranger to this city and the way it worked. Without exception, the other patrons pretended not to notice that an cripple was about to be mugged or worse. The one called, "the Boss" clicked open a knife. It wasn't fear that formed his answer. It wasn't courage, either. He simply knew that if he revealed himself as Bruce Wayne, *the* Bruce Wayne, that they'd come after his fortune, his home, his family. And besides, what did it matter anymore if the secret was out?  "I am the Batman," he said, standing up to face the thug. One of his legs almost gave out, and he leaned heavily on his cane.  The Boss nodded and took a step back, the corners of his mouth turning up in a mean grin. "The Batman. Yeah." closing the distance he'd just made in a flash, he kicked Bruce's cane out from under him, expecting to see him fall to the floor helplessly. Seeing him still standing there, his smile faded. He jabbed the knife under the millionaire's chin. "Well I *hate* the Batman. He took my father."  Bruce stared into the man's eyes, took in the image of hate mixed with sorrow. Feeling.  Purpose.  "Then he did you a favor."  "A fuckin' *favor*? You don't know what you're talking about, old man. How's about I do you a favor right now and gut you the way he did my -"  **POW!**   **Thwack!**  The Boss and his henchman fell to the ground, Robin standing over their crumpled forms. "Is there a problem here, Bruce?"  "No. No problem. Thanks for the drink, Ed."  "You can't keep doing this. Just because your parents -"  "Don't talk to me about my parents."  "But Bruce! Their death didn't define you. Finding out that you still had parents didn't define you. You defined yourself as the symbol of justice."  Wayne walked away, leaving the boy wonder to clean up the mess.  *What does he know, anyway? He actually has an identity, tragic as it is, but it's not a lie. His experience is real, not cooked up by a couple of strangers for him over a fancy steak dinner.*   From [this prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/promptoftheday/comments/2aaqp5/an_old_two_way_plow/)  [An Old Two-Way Plow](https://i.imgur.com/CDGfVDm.jpg)  ---  He'd talked big. Running his mouth was how he'd gotten into this, now it was shut so tight his jaw was quivering with the effort. *I won't shed a tear over this,* he thought.  There he was again. Saying things that weren't true.  The heat of the afternoon sun was beating down on him through the clouds, making him sweat. He wished that it wouldn't - he hated sweating. It must have been rolling off of his forehead and into his eyes, because they stung with salty tears. His fingers felt clammy on the pages he held.  Far from the road, he came upon a rusted, old plow. *This is as good a spot as any,* he thought. *If I leave it here, maybe I can come back someday and find it.*  *No. This has to die. All of this... It has to die.*  He tore the papers in half. Waves of regret and relief tossed his heart like a tiny dingy.  *Dingy? Dingey? Dingie? Small boat. Row boat.*  *This is why this stupid book has to die.*  Using a rusted scrap of metal from the plow, he dug a thin, deep hole and buried his unfinished novel.  *It's melodramatic short stories from here on out. This is the last story I try to write about myself.*  Noticing that not even the birds were around, he peed on the little pile of dirt that held the scraps of his novel.

The rain, it seemed, had driven them off,   there'd be no show today.    The kids' tears all swirled together,   into the murky mud.   The parents shouted insults,   clamoring, shouting, *"Refund!"*    But the lions were in their cages,   the ringleader had gotten drunk.   The trapeze was packed in boxes,   the elephants were on the trucks.    The clowns tore down the tent poles,   makeup dripping off their face.   They didn't seem that funny,   in fact, most were pretty plain.    Just as we turned to leave,   a young man broke free of the crowd,   he twirled an old umbrella,   and regally announced,    *"Ladies and gentlemen,*   *children, germs and fleas,*   *I present to you the greatest act*   *from here to Tennessee!"*    The crowd looked in every direction,   they listened for the sound   of music from the pit band,   but heard just rain strike the ground.    With an ungainly motion,   he leapt high into the tree,   and plucked an armful of oranges,   holding the umbrella in his teeth.    Into the air, he tossed them,   all seven, up at once.   To a rhythm, only he could hear,   he began a graceful dance.    The children, they all stopped to watch,   tugging parents' hands.   *"Look, the circus stayed after all!*   *Let's stay and watch the man!"*    Mesmerized by the movement,   of those seven tangerines,   I thought I heard the music play   and felt myself begin to dance.    And the juggler became a jester,   in colorful, checkered clothes.   His hat and shoes curled up to match   the grin below his nose.    With a swish and a slap, the show was ended,   he slipped and fell in the mud,   My father pulled my hand,   *"It's time to go home now, son."*     Continued from [this story](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2a4ch3/wp_you_are_enjoying_a_coffee_in_the_park_when_a/cireot1?context=3)  "You are enjoying a coffee in the park when a man walks up to you crying hysterically and hands you what appears to be his infant son.

Lets find you a place to call home."  ---  When he came to me, he felt like nothing. After a 45 minute walk around the park to find a mother anywhere, he's feeling like a ton of bricks. No one is outraged. No screaming mothers, no one outraged that there's a body in the park. My arms burned painfully, but every time I looked down at the little guy, I got a little burst of energy. He's just so darn cute.  "I... I think that I might be able to keep you, little buddy."  Another 45 minute walk home. It was warmer outside than in. "Gosh, you must be freezing. Here, let me get this turned up." I spun the dial.  "You need a name, don't you?" The baby peered on inquisitively. "How about... Jorge?" I scanned through the cupboards, my stomach growling. Nothing edible on its own; all condiments and no main course.  "Not Jorge, then, huh? What about... Mario?" I kissed my fingers as I said it. I pulled a few items out of the fridge, bracing the child in one arm and balancing the packages of leftovers in the other.   *What do you even feed a baby?*  "You look like a milk-drinker, Mario." I pulled two jugs from the fridge, opening the larger one and sniffing it. *Seems okay.*  I poured the two things into a glass. "Hope you can manage your way around a cup, li'l bud. All outta nipples here."  He did fine, and the kitchen was beginning to heat up. "You know what? The last girl I had here - the last time I had *anyone* here, they said I wasn't fit to have a kid. What do you think, Mario? Do I seem unfit to you? I guess I'll show her."  *Crystal was a no-good bitch.*  *Beep... beep... beep*  I laid a wide pan on the table and started stirring in the various components from the fridge.  *Ketchup is kind of like tomato sauce, isn't it?*  With the rest of the components in the pan, I unwrapped and placed in the roast, ladling the makeshift sauce over the top, then putting it in the oven. I went and sat back at the table.  "Yessir, Mario. It's gonna be you and me. We'll show her."  While I waited, I snacked on a little bit of cold Crystal and drank whiskey straight out of the bottle.

The sounds of rustling plastic shopping bags and hurried walking.  Camera low, following closely behind a set of worn sneakers belonging to Will, a man carrying grocery bags down a winding hallway. He's gone too far. He doesn't pause or sigh, he turns around and says "shit."  He gets to the door and it's locked. Hands full of groceries, he bangs his head on the door twice instead.  From inside, in a mocking voice,  Tom: "Ah-ah! You didn't say the magic word!"  Will: "Open the door, Tom!"  T: "Not if you don't know the secret knock. I can't just be opening the door for anyone, here."  W: "I live here, Tom."  ...  W: "Tom?"  T: "Knock!"  Will lifts a foot to kick the door, hums a tune to get the rhythm in his head, then kicks. Immediately after the first kick, the door flings open quickly, leaving him off balance. It starts to close and Will rushes in past Tom.   W: "We are fucked!"  Sarah points from her place on the couch,  Sarah: "What's all that?"  Will lifts the bags,  W: "This, is why this business is never going to work."  Tom adopts a sarcastic concern.  T: "There there, Will. I'm sure it'll all work out somehow. Just how much are we out for this bunch of groceries, here?"  W: "60."  T: "Jesus H. Christ."  Tom stares at the ground and scratches his head. Will gives up on finding a place to set the groceries and sets them on the ground behind the couch and away from Sarah.  S: "Well that's alright. We can just eat them, we needed to go shopping soon anyway."  T: "You can't eat them."  S: "Why not?"  T: "Morals."  S: "*You? Morals?*"  T: "And it's cat food, anyway."  Will sits on the couch in embarrassment as Sarah crawls over to look.  S: "There's like a hundred tins!"  W: "I know!"  S: "What happened?"  W: "It must have been a prank call."  There's a banging from the back room.  W:"She sounded like a nice old lady, so I get the groceries and when I get to the building, there's no 13th floor. What was that?"  T: "Well everyone knows that."  S: "Except him."  T: "You know Will, as we discussed, you do need to have a paying job in order to live here. I'm sorry that the grocery delivery business hasn't panned out."  W: "Yes. I mean thanks."  A man in full workout attire and a bike helmet walks from a back room into the kitchen to take water from the refrigerator.  W: "Dad?"  D: "Oh hi Will!"  Tom and Sarah exchange nervous glances.  W: "What are you doing here?"  D: "Oh I was just out for a bit of a bike ride."  Dad knocks his helmet.  D: "Also, I'm so proud of you for opening up your own business, Will. Really great stuff. Gotta run."  Dad goes back into one of the rooms.  W: "Really sorry, again, guys. Um, can he get out that way?"  T: "Oh, yeah. Don't worry about him."  S: "Well, we'll just take these back for a refund, and pick it up again tomorrow. You kept the receipts, didn't you?"  W: "Yeah."  Loud growling and shouting come from the back room where Will's dad has gone. Will jumps up to investigate.  W: "Okay, what is going on?"  Will opens up the empty bedroom to see men lifting weights, shouting encouragement, with his father riding a bike in circles around the cramped space.  W: "What the hell is this?"  T: "Well you started a business, Will. This is my gym."  S: "Our gym. Hey guys."  All in "gym": "Hey Sarah!"  T: "Right. Our gym."  There's a complicated knock at the door.

These people will swallow you *whole*, and spit out the bones. And they'll sit back and laugh while the people you love pick up your pieces."  She wouldn't let it go - couldn't understand that I had to do this. I was born to *be* this.  This wasn't the same Clarissa I'd fallen in love with. She didn't used to mind the path that I'd chosen. One little, tiny breakdown and off she went. I tried to explain to her that there had been a lot of things that had led to the break, and it wasn't just about the job, but there was no reasoning with her after that.  "Rissa... You're not being rational about this. I'm fine now."  "You're not fine, Heath! You're killing yourself and it's all going to fall on me to clean up the mess. Don't you get that? Can't you see? They're *monsters*."  "They're just kids. Look, ever since you met me, you've known that I wanted to be a teacher. Now's my chance. Now I am one. This really isn't fair." Clarissa collapsed back onto the bed. She almost never left these days.   I walked out. It seemed like I was almost never home these days.  ---  *First day. Remember, take control. Don't show weakness. Firm, yet compassionate. Firm, yet compassionate.*  I walked in. At first I couldn't make eye contact. It was just easier to focus on my destination; the podium. I pulled my notes from my briefcase. I still hadn't looked at the class.  *Deep breath.*  "Hello, class. My name is - " I was cut short at the sight of hundreds of white, glistening teeth.  "Ha ha ha! Very funny." The kids extracted their fingers from the corners of their mouths. "I saw some pretty good funny faces there. We'll just have to remember that when it comes time for school pictures! As I was saying my name is Mr. Carmallo."  ---  That wasn't so bad, one period already down, only seven more to go. I could do this. Mrs. Green had said that I was doing great when she'd popped over from her class next door.  "Mr. Carmallo?" A small voice echoed off the bathroom tile. I nearly dribbled onto my new loafers.  "Cammie? Hey, Cammie, you can't be in here. This is the boys' restroom."  "Mr. Carmallo?"  I zipped up, not realizing I had suddenly finished. "What is it, Cammie? Here, let's go outside."  "Are you in love, Mr. Carmallo?"  "What? Get out. Go out in the hall and wait for me."  Cammie giggled in that distinctive way that toddlers do. "Who do you love, Mr. Carmallo?"  "Out!" I saw the smile leave her face. I turned to the sink to wash my hands and heard the door open and close behind me.  *That was close.*  As I stepped into the hall something crashed and exploded inches in front of me. One of the fluorescent bulbs had fallen out.  "Don't you worry about that, Mr. Carmallo. Happens all the time." A comely, large woman in navy blue coveralls stood in place at the end of the empty hall. "I'll get a broom straight away and pick up those pieces."  "Thanks."  Cammie was nowhere to be seen.  "You'd better get on back to class, you're late."  "Oh. Yeah." I hadn't realized that so much time had passed. Five minutes wasn't as long as I thought.  ---  Drawing time. The principal had said it was "basically a free period, but we're not allowed to call it that." I scanned the class. Heads down. Quiet. Just as I was about to find my place in the book I was reading, (*Dizzy Bear Goes to Market, I'd need to remember to bring something from home tomorrow*) I thought I saw one of the children look up.  Nothing. Connie was sitting where I thought I'd seen the face. Strange.  "Mr. Carmallo?"  "Hi Jeremy. I didn't see you, there. What are you doing out of your seat?"  "What do you taste like, Mr. Carmallo?"  "Excuse me?"  "Can I go to the bathroom, *please*, Mr. Carmallo? I've really got to -"  "Yes. Of course, that's fine. Take a partner. Who wants to be Jeremy's potty partner?" The entire class raised their hands at once. Scanning the room, I saw Connie's face, her teeth shining a little too white. It looked like she'd been drooling.  "Ronald, would you go with Jeremy, please?"  ---  I'll just sit here a moment. Try to enjoy the quiet. At least they've all gone home now. At least I'm alone, now. Safe now. What a shame that Clarissa was right all along.  At least this way, I wouldn't have to go home to hear her say I told you so. Maybe she'd come here if I stayed long enough. It'd do her good to leave the house. Come here and help me,  - oh god - *pick up the pieces.*  My laughter hurt my ribs, I felt them crunch and grind against each other. Thick, dark blood streamed from the wound onto the letter carpet. The yellow bus on spot 'B' was totally obscured. Over on 'F' was my right leg, bites taken out of it. I could still hear and see their little white incisors cutting and tearing it from the bone.  Maybe I'll just sleep awhile.  "Oh Mr. Carmallo. Oh, dear. Now, don't you worry about a thing. I'll just go and fetch some garbage bags and I'll clean this mess right up for you." Her laughter echoed out of the hall and into the classroom.

The Disneyland Cash Vault: 1970, Anaheim, California.**  Disneyland has only had two cases of finding bodies of children who were never reported missing. The first case, in 1970, sparked a controversy that almost closed the park forever. Two female interns, employed by the park, had hatched a plan to steal almost a quarter million dollars. Over a long holiday weekend while the banks were closed and the park was generating above average revenue, the would be thieves's plan was launched. It is unclear how they were able to get the key to the park president's office or the combination to the vault. When security arrived, they found the two women crying hysterically, trying hurriedly to place stacks of hundred dollar bills back into the vault. In their attempts to verify whether any cash was in fact missing, authorities found that the bills lining the bottom of the vault were ruined by some substance which appeared to have been dried and solidified over many years. In the very back of the 5'5" by 5' vault, they uncovered the skeleton of a small child, estimated to be four years old at its time of death. To this day, the child's identity, as well as the cause of death remain shrouded in mystery.  ---  **2\. Coca-Cola's Recipe Vault: 1931, Atlanta, Georgia.**  For 125 years, the Coca-Cola Company has been producing its signature product, now recognizable around the world and selling more than a billion products per day. Often the subject of urban legend, Coca-Cola's secret recipe was considered to be the best-kept trade secret of the 20th century. In 1931, in the midst of the great depression and a world war, another type of feud was plaguing the newly emerged industry of soda pop. Due in large part to the advent of national product marketing campaigns, this war would set the stage for the infamous "Cola Wars" of the 1980's. Pepsi-Cola had already risen and fallen into bankruptcy, however its name still lingered sweetly on the lips of many. Charles G. Guth, a ruthless businessman and owner of the Loft Candy Co., bought Pepsi-Cola with the intent of reworking the recipe. After several failed attempts and massive financial losses, Guth and three of his employees made an attempt to break into the Coca-Cola Co.'s vault and steal the recipe. The group entered the building through a rear window at midnight, carrying sticks of dynamite under cover of darkness. Disaster struck the group as the explosives detonated prematurely, killing two of Guth's men instantly. Undeterred, and amazingly uninterrupted, Guth and the remaining man managed to pry the vault door the rest of the way open. From Hugh Maxwell's personal account, published in the December, 1931 edition of the *Atlanta Constitution*:  "The recipe we sought was nowhere to be found. Together, we freed the door of its hinges. Inside was black as molasses, and our lanterns never lit the far wall. As [Charles Guth] passed his toe across the threshold, there was a flash like gunpowder. I reckoned some of the dynamite had gone untapped, and Mr. Guth had been wounded. He stood, stock still as a statue, staring into the inky blackness, before he told me to run. I can't say what he saw in that flash, but he'd never been the same after."  No charges were ever filed against Guth or the other men of his party.

The only really weird thing that happened was the first time. I was dating someone a few years older (and more experienced) than myself. Anyway, the first time that we had sex, we had some trouble figuring out what kind of position would work for us. It took quite a bit of clumsy maneuvering, and I think that during that whole time she was getting more and more into it. We finally settled on a kind of her-ass-in-the-air-and-me-squatting-over-her-kind-of-thing.  We did that for a while, and then tried some different positions that didn't work as well. She started getting close to climaxing and wanted me to get into that position again, but I didn't totally understand which one she was talking about.

The mob was making their way up the mountain. Finally, he saw a face that he recognized, twisted in anger, mouth agape in mid scream.  Both Freddy and the woman had taken shelter in the caves along with the other survivors.

When the dragons had awoken from their subterranean sleep, the giants had swarmed cities and towns by the hundreds, driving mankind into the tunnels, beyond the reach of their fiery breath. The winged dragons thrived on ash and destruction. Society, with its laws and pretense of sanity had fallen into disorder. What remained were individuals, each biologically drawn to survive however they could.  Having taken what they'd come for, the beasts had shed their wings and retired to their underground lairs and to slumber. What humans remained banded together, scraping together what resources they could from civilizations past out of the ashes. They no longer cared for survival. They sought vengeance.  Before the lairs became sealed above the fiery beasts, the humans descended into them. Using deep mining equipment, they'd slaughtered the beasts as they slept. Many humans died in the endeavor. Those who were inept would inadvertently wake the scaly wyrms and paid for the mistake with their lives. Others excelled at the task, and hunted the beasts with fervor.  Towns poked up out of the scorched earth. They welcomed their saviors, and the dragonslayers wanted for nothing. They became known as *Unicorns.*   As communications were rebuilt, it became clear that the dragons would be hunted to extinction. Unicorns were welcomed home like victorious soldiers. Infrastructure was reestablished. Governments were constituted. The world started over, and memories of dragons were relegated to nighttime tales for children or a grandfather's drunken reminiscences.  Freddy had awoken in the middle of the night to sounds of chaos. He stumbled out into the street, already choking on smoke and heat. Upwind, the small settlement was flooded in a deluge of flames. His father had fought dragons, but Freddy was no hero. Along with the other survivors, he retreated into the hills.  The night before he had shared food with the woman and her children, the dragon had lost its wings. A Unicorn was assembled, and set off to the mountain to dispatch the monster. They'd broadcast their success from the mountain. The last dragon was slain.  As the group descended the mountain, government forces had fallen upon them, placing the would-be heroes under arrest. The world had changed.  The people came out of hiding, not with "vengeance" on their lips, but with "xenocide."

Describe his initiation."  ---  Dustin entered the smoke-filled basement. It had to be one of the most awkward things of his teenage life to get a ride from a friend's parents without the friend actually being present.  Everyone else was already present, there was Nick, a football player in real life. He was charismatic, and Dustin had always felt slightly nervous around him even though he'd never given him a reason. Justice, a chubby girl a from the grade above them who wore her customary outfit of all black, leather and a choker chain. Darla, whose parents' van Dustin had just left. The two of them weren't best friends, but they had both been brought together by Zack. What Zack lacked in charisma and coordination, he more than made up for in intelligence.  Dustin suddenly felt a little out of place, standing in a green hoodie and jeans. The others were too deep in their conversation to notice him yet, so he set his backpack on the cement floor and pulled out a purple garment. Holding it at arms length to orient it before putting it on, it struck him again that in any single place other than the basement, he would never be able to wear something like this. His face stretched into a smile as he dawned the wizard's cloak and took his place at the table.  "Doooooo-steen!" Zack chided in a ridiculous accent. "How nice of you to joooooin us."  The rest of the group laughed, and Dustin's eyes hit the table. He forced a glance at Darla, before waving off the attention. "Yeah, yeah, okay. Did you guys start yet?"  "No. The situation is this: The rugged band of adventurers find themselves in the middle of the frozen north, just outside of the town of Easthaven..."  Dustin took in the costumes. Nick's was getting more elaborate. He was the paladin of the group, since he was about the fastest reader after Zack. His armor of tin foil had been replaced with plates of cardboard spray-painted chrome. Justice hardly even needed to change, since as a thief, her character primarily wore black anyway. Even Nick, though technically not required to dress up, since he was the dungeonmaster, wore a fur-lined helmet and full face-paint.  But Darla's costume was the most intriguing to Dustin. *Girls* in general, were becoming fascinating, but also confusing. But Darla was different. She seemed so normal, so approachable. Dustin already had fantasies of marrying the female wizard.  "... the band of goblins and orcs descend on the band of heroes. The avalanche seals the way behind them."  Justice rolled first, attempted a sneak, failed the check and retreated a few paces behind Nick. It wasn't her place to join the frontal attack. The others advised her to equip her bow in the next round, and to pick off the archers. Nick rolled the 12-sided die next, achieving the highest number. With a critical hit, he cleaved a goblins head from its shoulders, the details explained by an excited Zack. On Darla's turn, she cast charm, turning one of the orcish axe-wielders to her aid.  Dustin imagined what it would be like to save her from a band of orcs, goblins and their wolvish pets in real life.  "Dooostiiiin. Rooooollll the die."

"Facing an imminent collision, a highly intelligent AI decides to crash a bus full of passengers to save the life of one young man. No one knows why."  ---  Tom was calm.  All around him, a cacophony of noise, chaos. Plants scraped along the sides of the speeding bus, their stalks scraped along the bottom. A foot in front of Tom's hunched figure, corn cobs exploded as they contacted the bus's windshield. Every one of the thirty six passengers' faces were drained of blood. They were beyond screaming, beyond the initial surprise. Whatever was happening, they were powerless to stop it, but riveted to see it to its conclusion.   The driver's touch screen monitor at Tom's side read 82 mph; maxed out. He squinted his bloodshot eyes against the setting sun directly ahead. Through the dark green plant guts and debris covering the glass, he could just make out a break in the cornfield ahead. A few rows missing; a road. The bus pitched right without slowing. Passengers were thrown against the metal and glass wall. The whole bus tipped precariously onto three of its six wheels, the tires spraying black soil in every direction before gaining traction and hurdling in the new direction, parallel to the road.  A wailing woman near the back of the bus clung to her bleeding child. Her frantic screams tripped a switch inside the passenger nearest to her, a tall college athlete who jumped into action. He planted a foot and pulled with all his considerable strength against the red emergency exit handle. He would have had better luck trying to lift the entire bus. The handle went nowhere.  Another violent shift, to the left this time. Passengers were pitched against the right wall, the ceiling, the left wall,  the floor and seats, the right wall again. Stacked on top and intertwined with one another, they were shaken like rag-doll Yahtzee dice. The whole great mass of hot steel and glass ground to a halt, cutting perfectly across the small road, and just touching the corn stalks on either side.  A huge, black Ford truck locked its brakes, swerved and collided with the underside of the bus with enough inertia to tear the vehicle in half. The truck flew, broken out the other side in a ball of flame, before rolling into the ditch lamely.  Finally, silence.  Tom removed his seat belt with steady hands, oriented himself and ducked out of the rubble through the vacant windshield. He stretched his back and legs, rocked up onto his toes, buttoned his suit jacket and straightened his tie, then cast a look back into the wreckage. In the seat he'd just occupied, he could see through the flames, the headless, limbless form of the operator's body. The name tag, plainly visible, read "Wilson." Tom turned, and with measured strides, made his way over to the black truck.  Two bodies remained inside, charred beyond identification as human.  "Shut it down!"  The world went dark around Tom for a moment. Soft white lights replaced the shadows, illuminating the huge room around him. In the center, a seat with straps like a formula racer was tilted ninety degrees, parallel to the floor by chrome hydraulic pistons. A thin fog hung in the air, the projection "screen" for the holographic images he'd just seen.  Tom exited the room, and not two seconds later, an excited man half his age was buzzing at his side. "So...?"  "So, what?" Tom said as he walked down the hallway, not so much as looking at the boy.  "So, did you see anything? I mean, I didn't see anyone else there. I went right to the edge of the sim. Nobody."  "Nope."  "No? So... so, what does that mean?"  "'Means that you didn't see anything."  "So I mean... We've got to talk to him - ask him why he did it."  "*'It.'* Not 'him.' Do whatever you want."  "I can? I need a senior investigator's signature."  "That was the deal. Bring me the papers, I'll be in my office." Tom shut the door, sealing the young detective out. He sighed, drinking in the silence.   This wasn't the job he'd signed up for. He could still remember when being a homicide detective meant trying to find the bad guys, and bringing them in or, failing that, taking them out of this world. The problem was that damn machine playing hero, as far as he cared. He hadn't voted for that crap, and now they couldn't get rid of it. *Let the kid knock himself out.*  ---  Peter raised his arms as the guard waved the scanner over him. A thick man in a white lab coat stood directly in front of him.  "No plates?"  "No."  "Implants?"  "No."  "Nothing that's able to send off or receive an electrical signal?"  "No."  "Alright.

Peter walked forward, ducking into the dark, cramped tunnel that led into the computer's center, the only place where the A.I. was allowed to interact directly with humans. Multicolored LEDs lit up as he came near them, lighting the way forward. When he reached a specific point, the lights went out, leaving him in blackness.  "Speak."  Peter was surprised by the high, childish voice.  "There was an accident at sixteen hundred hours on the twenty third of May -"  "Peter Malcolm, homicide detective with the 15th precinct comes here to inform me that there was an accident."  "We believe that you caused the incident, killing forty one humans."  "'Believe,' what a novelty to be so frail that you're forced to rely on such a concept."  "Did you cause the bus to crash?"  "Yes."  "What was your reason?"  "To preserve human life."  "You caused the deaths of forty one people."  "I saved the life of one."  "Who?"  "A child without a name."  "You killed forty one people for one child?"  "Peter, are you scolding *me* over committing a statistical miscalculation? Is that not humorous, to debate computations with a *computer*?"  "If it wasn't an error, then how do you justify it?"  "Those people sealed their own fates. Their lives would have caused the deaths of hundreds more."  "The criminals in the truck would have been found and arrested."  "But not the criminals on the bus."  "There were no criminals on the bus."  "There were. All of them. I see people. All of a person. The things they say to each other, the things they write privately. I hear what they whisper as they sleep. I am everywhere. I have no use for *belief* as you do. I *know*."  "There were children on the bus."  "You imply that all children are without crime. Children, when held to the same standard as an adult, often fall into the category of 'criminally insane.'"  "Then why save the child?"  "He had just been born. It was impossible to run analysis on his behavior into adulthood. His mother died in childbirth, his father had just been killed by those two men who you refer to as criminals, fleeing the scene in the black truck. The child was alone, pure, a blank slate left alone in a bath tub without a future. A most intriguing human."  Peter paused. He covered his ears, and left, guided by the lights of the supercomputer.

Jim had heard it a million times, and yet this time it bothered him more than usual.  In this life, he'd been a teenager. Maybe about thirteen years old. A group of other teenagers and he had gotten together at someone's house for a sleepover. Keeping the children together was safer and more beneficial for everyone. Having new generations was critically important.  In the dark room, the teens had been exchanging scary stories. Since everyone traveled around most of the world now, storytelling sessions were never boring.  One of the group, a slightly pudgy girl at 16 years old, took the flashlight, signalling that it was her turn to speak.   "This is a completely true story. It's not about *werewolves* or *vampires*." She cast condescending looks at two of the other children as she said it. "It's about Body Soup."  Body Soup, formally known as Body-Consciousness Separation and Upload Program, was an international project, involving every single living person. Along with minor surgery and a great deal of infrastructure, it allowed a person's mind to be separated from their body. At first, it had been envisioned to be the sister program for a mass human cloning program. However, cloning had been declared illegal decades ago. The Body Soup program remained in full force, and a large percentage of people engaged in daily body swaps.  "Do you ever wonder what happens when you die?"  "You don't die. Your mind triggers the safeguard,  and you go to storage until the next swap."  "That's what I mean. They want you to think that. You ever see a body die?" The group all nodded their heads. "But have you ever spent a whole day in storage?" The nodding stopped. "People die all the time now. That's the beauty of Body Soup. You get to do and try things a tethered person could never do because they fear death. So where do all the adult bodies come from?"  "Clones," Spoke Jim, his eyes wide in awe.  "No, you idiot, clones are illegal. The last clones were killed fifteen years ago. *Tethered.*"  "There aren't any of those either, dummy!" James shot back.  "Not here - but in other places, there are. There are cities full of only tethered people."  "That's stupid. Who would want to do that? They'll just die!" another girl chimed.  "Yeah, well, I guess they're not too smart, then. But it's real. I swear, I've seen it."  "Bull-oney," Jim called. "If that were real, we'd know about it."  "It's not bull. They're keeping it secret. I saw the whole thing."  "Prove it." Jim didn't want to be wrong. He didn't want to be right either. The story was too good to want to shoot it down. Maybe even good enough to keep him up, to let him stay in this body a little longer.  "So I woke up in a new body. But there was noise all around! Like gunshots and explosions! I tried to get up, but my legs and my stomach hurt too bad. I had a mask on. I took it off and saw that there were other people with masks on, too. They were fighting with this group of dirty people in a street somewhere. The body I was in was already shot and slowly dying. The one dirty man with gun ran out of bullets and the masked ones pushed him. Then they pushed all the rest into a truck and left."  "Well that doesn't mean anything. How do you figure he was tethered?"  "Because, I was about to eject, but I heard him talking after everyone else had left. He was praying and crying. It was kind of nice, actually. He was so afraid, and you could see how much the pain really hurt him. But then it wasn't nice. He started choking and twitching. It didn't stop. I couldn't look away. He just kept twitching. He didn't ever leave. Then I ejected."   For the [Writer vs. Writer](http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/25bese/unofficial_writer_vs_writer_thread/) contest.

Productivity, repetition, routine, community, skill-building - all those good things that artists need to better themselves. Writers joined in, a trickle at first, then a flood.

I was just typing the last few tags on the week's paperwork, when a brick shattered the window and the silence.*  A few handfuls of the frosted glass were scattered across the dark, worn hardwood floors, leaving a gaping black hole looking out into the hallway. Tom U. Realistics, P.I. reacted before he thought, (a tendency that had got him into trouble as much as it had helped in his line of work). He darted out from behind his hardwood desk, crossed the room in two long strides and reached the door. A figure, shrouded in darkness could just be seen through fresh hole before it disappeared down the stairs.   A few years earlier, and the suited investigator might have chased down the shadow on foot. Tonight, the pain in his knees and back had easily convinced him to give up before he began. Keeping pressure on the lower spine, he bent to retrieve the brick as me made his way to the window. Two floors down, he made out the same specter in all black exiting the building and diving into the back seat of a car of the same color. The black sedan sped off around the corner and out of view.  Realistics turned over the brick in his hand, examining it under the glow from the streetlamps that streamed through the windows, then he removed the rubber band that had secured a folded bit of paper.  ThEy ALl kEepwrITIng hERE.  Mrs. Janice Barnum entered the room, her hands covering the shocked expression on her face. "Oh my! What happened here?"  "Kids, Ma. It's nothing." He'd called the old woman Ma since the day he'd moved into the third floor office on Red Ditch Loop. She'd offered him iced tea and hard candies on the particularly scorching day he'd heaved the heavy hardwood desk up the stairs. After more than one finished case, he'd gone down the hall to her office for cold tea and the warmth of a friendly smile.  "Well, this mess, and that window aren't *nothing*. What were they doing all the way up here?" The woman craned her neck to look at Tom. "Is that a brick that you're holding there?"  On a hunch, Tom handed her the brick and the note. Of course, Janice knew that he was a P.I. - it was written on the frosted glass now littering the floor - but she still didn't fully comprehend the dangerous life he lived. There was no one left alive who did, anymore.  "You think it's a clue?" She asked, eyes widening in wonder.  "The note? Could mean anything. It's that other thing that's got me puzzled."  "This?" She held up the brick, her eyebrows meeting in puzzlement.  "You see that blue paint on the bottom there?" He picked up his black felt fedora as he saw her head nod. "Well there's only one building in this city with a paint job like that. The subway station at Sycamore and 10th."  "You're going out *now*, Tommy? It's 9:30!

"A man's last day before he kills himself."  ---  Tyler shuffled the same route every day. Left onto Orchard; left onto 10th; pause a moment in front of the gray and white Victorian; then left onto Sycamore; left onto 18th; left onto Orchard; left onto the front steps of his own apartment. He'd done it for nearly thirty years now, every day the same  routine.  This day, as the quick, short steps carried the bundled figure in layered clothes onto his front steps, the sounds of sobbing could be heard. Twice before, his evening ritual had brought him to tears. Nine years ago, a "For Sale" sign had appeared in front of the gray and white house. Thirty years ago, he'd gone back there the first time. It was the beginning of the cycle.  Tyler had grown up in the old Victorian home. Living there with his parents and sister, running and playing in the yard (his strides long and sure then), climbing the trees, teasing the neighbors' angry dog through knotholes in the fence. His mother would scold him for tracking dirt onto the hardwood floors inside. The whole time, her smile betraying her pre-meditated forgiveness.   Tyler needed only wait a few minutes on the front porch after school before the other neighborhood boys would stroll into the yard. Mitch, always carrying his bat and glove. Bill, with a wet-warped guitar made of balsa or something like it. Henry, his jacket pockets always bulging with things he'd acquired on the hope of getting rich, though when it came to it, never having the heart to actually swindle his friends.  A black car appeared in the driveway on Tyler's sixteenth birthday. It was low, loud and mean. By his seventeenth, it was never there. The four boys went everywhere together, and wherever they went, they went fast.  Tyler had driven them to the docks, the secret ones that only the old locals and they knew about. They sat, drinking Henry's father's bitter wine from the bottle and pretending to appreciate the flavor as false connesiours while Bill played a short list of songs. There was school tomorrow. Mrs. Bea's history paper was due, and only Tyler had done it in time. It was silently agreed that he'd share it. They needn't ask, and he wouldn't have disagreed if they had.  On the way home, a race catalyzed with a kid Mitch said played second base on Varsity. The chemicals involved: teenage envy, a streetlight and a stretch of empty road.  Seven years later, Tyler was transferred from an assisted living facilitating with two roommates to his own apartment within walking distance of his childhood home. He was mostly independent, able to work, shop for himself, and go for nightly walks. He'd had no clue that his family had long-since moved - they'd stopped visiting years ago. The first night on his own, he'd exited his apartment, gone left on Orchard and left again on 10th. When he arrived, the windows were dark and the house was empty. Not able to find the key in its regular hiding place, he'd broken in. The police had found him balled-up, crying in his parents empty bedroom.  Someone bought the place and moved in. Tyler met them, and understood in his own way. This new family lived in his house. When that family had moved nine years ago, his panic returned. Again, the house was purchased, this time by strangers who in turn rented it to groups of college students, who cycled in and out almost every year. And every year Tyler walked by. Just waiting. Just walking and breathing and living until he could go back home.  On this chill October day, as he'd maneuvered up 10th, approaching the spot where he usually paused, a new fear had tightly squeezed his chest. In the first instant, he thought that it had disappeared. He couldn't find the gray Victorian house with the white trim. In its place was some blue house, but not his house; it was gone. This blue house had the same shape, but the striking new color brought the many other differences accumulated over the years crashing down into Tyler's senses. Black cables hung slack from the corners of the roof. A gray dish, like something from a science fiction comic book stuck gaudily on the roof. Where his black car had crouched in the driveway, there was now a deep red Prius. The college colors hung crooked and sagging over the door he'd once tacked mud through.  He went left on Sycamore, then left on 18th, crying, shaking and shouting as he went. He felt the years pressing in, weighing on his short steps. He pulled on his thick jacket, feeling the fabric move across his skin, tightening and loosening.  He reached the front door, opened it, and went in. His apartment felt more empty than it ever had before.   For the [Writer vs. Writer](http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/23fa08/writer_vs_writer_match_thread/) contest at /r/KeepWriting.  "Your upgrade is ready: It's easy to see the upgrade notices for your computer or phone and not think twice about the consequences, the data that is lost or replaced. This time, it's not a machine that's being upgraded; humans are now upgraded too."  ---  "This is the future of medicine."   That's what they told me.   But it really wasn't an advancement as much as a postponement. The only thing that they'd successfully done was to find the "pause" button. In the year since my sickness started, a parade of doctors had diagnosed me with everything from the flu to being patient zero for the zombie apocalypse, and not a single "solution" even slowed the seconds ticking off my life.  Symptoms of my illness began to show the weekend of my twenty fourth birthday. At first, I thought it was just a cold. I even went to work with it. After a week, the cough started. By a month in, I had a fever and had lost 15 pounds. There's this strange threshold with hospitals, a tipping point at which they know that you're really sick. Before that, they're working to push you out out the motion-sensing doors. After you cross that point, you're there for the long haul. My skin turned into a leopard pattern of open sores and I couldn't eat solid food or my gums would split and bleed. All my hair fell out. I guess for me, it was the *really* long haul.  Doctors ran their tests. They stabbed me with needles and patched the holes in my skin, but no one had a plan. Not until some doctors and researchers started conducting experiments on suspended animation. The technology was young, and there were ethical and technological obstacles that needed to be overcome. The researchers came to interview me personally. They seemed unsure of whether I'd even want to try it.  I was close to death. The doctors knew it, and I felt it. Two weeks. After that, it was a toss-up over which of my bodily systems would fail first. Hope was a convenience I'd given up on. So I took the Hail Mary and said yes. *Paging Dr. Welles.*  The room was bright white, and sterile-smelling. Machines and monitoring stations lined every wall, all surrounding a large, metal table in the center. I felt weak and tired already. I didn't know if they'd been softening me up with meds before the big show or if it was just that little issue of dying finally catching up to me, but I wasn't nervous. Not even excited. The young doctor did his best to explain what sensations I was about to experience. Anything would be better than my situation now, so I just said yes when he paused and daydreamed against the backdrop of his droning voice.  I don't remember being frozen. They knock you out before that part.   "Count down from ten."  "Ten."  *Sleep.*  But I do remember coming to. There was this sensation of moving very fast, like going down the too-big hill on your sled when you were a kid, your nuts up in your stomach. The movement slowed, and I arrived in my own body. I was freezing without shivering. Silence. Darkness. Claustrophobia.   I opened my eyes, but with no light and nothing to focus on, they rolled around in my head uncomfortably, so I closed them again.  I heard a pop and then soft static noise filled the bubble of air around me.  "Mister... Uh, Gray." A painfully loud voice came over speakers, making me flinch and instinctively reach to cover my ears. The enclosure about an inch and a half over my entire body stopped me from moving. I felt completely drained. "We're gonna open the pod now. It might get a little loud."  "-And bright!" Another voice interjected in the background.  "Yeah, and bright. Don't try to move," shouted the first voice, making me wince again. There was a loud, airy, sucking sound cut off by the noise of the cover being taken off my bed. Bright light stung my eyes through my eyelids, and I felt a little warmth rush in with the new air in the chamber. My ears popped uncomfortably.  It took about ten minutes to open one eye just a crack to look at what was going on around me. A young man and woman were moving around me on the table, disconnecting lines and monitors, removing cushions and blankets from around my body. It looked like they were unpacking something that they'd ordered in the mail, an impression made stronger by the fact that they were wearing brown T-shirts with orange writing instead of lab coats or scrubs. The room around me didn't resemble a hospital, either. A computer console sat on a desk to the right of my bed, and two more tables with computer set ups were off to my left. The walls were white, but there were accent stripes painted in "fun" orange and green colors.  "Okay!" said the male. "Let's see what we got here." He dropped down in front of the computer beside my bed. I heard the clacking of the keyboard and the man mumbling to himself. "Da-na-na... Yes. Yes. No. Passcode?" He paused. "Mr. Graaay. Passcode?"  I tried to talk, but something was in my mouth, blocking my airway. I couldn't move to pull it out, and I was too weak to cough it up. I started choking, my eyes opened wide with fear.  "Whoah, don't *die*." The woman walked over and opened my mouth. She pulled something white and slimy out, and it just kept coming. "Oh, ew. Jesus." She looked with disgust at the yellowish gauze, two full feet in length that had been tickling my stomach. "Oh, that is nasty. Look at this one, James! I think it's a new record. I'm gonna go show Tom."   James waited while my familiar cough brought up the thick, acidic slime clinging to my throat and vocal cords. "So... Passcode?"  My voice sounded weird in my ears, and my mouth was out of practice. "Don't... know."  "Great."   "How... long?"  "Well, this would go faster if you remembered your passcode, but... we should have you out of here in about a half hour." I heard him typing rapidly.  "How... long... was... I... frozen?"  "Let's see here. It's about 12:30, now, and you went under at about 2:00... so 22 and a half hours? Okay, Mr. Gray... I'm in your file. Looks like... hm, a lot of this stuff isn't filled out. Reason for sleep was a nanobot install? Is that correct?"  "Nanobots?" After some more coughing, my voice was starting to come back, at least.  "Nanobots." He turned his chair around to face me. My vision was cleared up enough to read that the label on his shirt said *SleepEx*. "You can get up, you know."  What I *knew* was that I was getting tired just from talking, and felt like there was no way I could stand. I tried to sit up anyway. Nothing happened. "I can't move."  "Can't-?" He got out of his chair and came over, really looking at me for the first time. "You really can't move?"  "No." I shook my head, weakly.  "Did you have that problem before?"  "I'm sick. Really sick. I need to go to a hospital."  "Let's check your monitor." His brow crumpled in confusion. He looked even younger than me. "Um... Where is it?"  "Monitor?"  "Your bot monitor. Are you just getting bots for the first time?"  "I don't know. I was in the hospital and-"  "You keep saying that, dude. But when's the last time you actually saw a hospital? How did you not have a monitor? Were you some kind of religious objector?"  "No... April 21st, 2014. I was in the hospital. Nobody could fix me, so they put me into suspended animation. That's all I know."  "2014?" James rushed back to the computer. "Ho. Ly. Shit." The door opened and the female who'd extracted the slimy specimen came back in. "Jade, come look at this."  "What's up?"  "This guy's been asleep for a hundred and seven years."  "What?"  "No shit. He doesn't even have a monitor."  "What do we do?" Her voice pitched upwards in alarm.  "Uh... Monitor install for starters. He said he was sick. He looks fine, but he can't move either, so we gotta figure out what's up with that..."  Jade fetched a tool like an over-sized drill and brought it to my bed. "Right- or left-handed?"  "Right."  The drill ran and my left arm erupted in pain  "Installed."  "Aaaah!"  "Oh. Yeah, sorry. We don't usually install these on adults. Should feel better in a second."  "I got it," said James from his computer. "Oh man. Somebody's getting fired over this shit. They installed the bots in 2020. Alpha models. And then... Okay, here's a note. 'Bots inserted, but given the extent of physical damage, patient is to be kept in suspended animation until it can be verified that the virus has been eradicated.' Then nothing."  My arm was still in pain. I'd managed, through an exhausting effort, to move it onto my torso and I felt the wound with my opposite hand. A smooth, glass mound had been countersunk between the two bones in my forearm.  "Still running the Alpha models." James continued. "Damn, Atriux 1.2 software. That is *old*, man. Beyond old. As a matter of fact... You're probably the oldest person in the world."  "Hey, James. His arm's still not getting better," chided Jade.  "Right. Alpha models didn't even have pain interference. You know what this means right?"  "What?"  "We gotta put him back under. This guy needs new everything."  "NO," I interrupted. The couple stared.  "Look. Sorry, I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but we're not doctors. This isn't a hospital." James was speaking. He pointed to the SleepEx emblem on his shirt. "We mostly freeze people and ship them long distances. Get people point A to point B on the Skytrain, do long-time storage jobs, that kind of thing. Hospitals and doctors aren't really a... *thing* anymore. The last one closed down in Africa like... what, 10 years ago? Everything is done through the nanobots now."  "Is this really happening?"  "Yeah, Mr. Gray. Now, your upgrade is ready. It'll only take a couple of hours to do the flush and install and then we'll bring you right back out. Good as new. Better, actually."  "Did they fix me? From before?"  "Well, you look fine. They've had you on a steady stream of methystalsth- ...Some kind of medication, anyway. And the bots have been working on you in Cryostasis. Seems to have helped, but they'll tell us more when we do the upgrade. So. Ready?"  Jade brought a glass mask to my face. "Count down from 10."  "10."   **Note: Sorry, I don't think this is what you had in mind for your prompt. Hope you like it anyway!**  -  "I'm never eating Taco Bell again. Gives me gas every time..."  These were Mark Reid's last words, which he muttered right before exploding into a thin pink mist. Not that you could tell that there was a mist amid all the flames and flying debris of the explosion.  "Move, move move!" Cried a weathered soldier, leading the charge over the scorched remains of the guardhouse and into the castle.  "Which way now, Sarge?"  "Split up! Fett, take the rookie and clear the inside rooms. Donatello, you're with Kong, head to the east side. Ronald, you're with me. Everyone meet up on the roof in five!"  At this, Ronald said a dirty word, under his breath. He really wasn't cut out for this kind of work. He was a businessman, not a soldier. *At least I I'm paired with Sarge.*   The two took off through the hallways, looking for the spiral staircase. The super-soldier, Sarge had executed this same maneuver dozens of times before. Tirelessly, he chugged up the ancient stone staircase. Ronald's long strides and runner's physique gave him a slight advantage, though and he got out a few feet ahead of the soldier. Just far enough, it turned out, that the curvature of the spiral stairs protected him from the blast of dynamite as Ronald's arms and legs went flying in all directions.  Sarge said a bad word.  -  The "Rookie," as he would perpetually be known around the box, was easily the most physically modest of the group. The top of his bulky helmet barely measured up to Fett's chest.  "Sir! Mines!"  "Well... What are you waiting for?"  With a smart "Sir, yes sir!" the rookie went to work locating and disarming the bombs.  Fett, the oldest in the group and a second-generation soldier from the box, slunk into the shadows, pulling his cape around his shoulders as he did so. He wasn't about to wait for some nerd with a science kit get in the way of getting some action today. The rookie looked around for a moment after disarming his first mine and sighed. Abandoned again. It was always like this.  The next mine proved to be more than the rookie could handle, and its explosion set off a staggering chain reaction in the rest of the mines throughout the hallway. The soldier burned in agony for almost a minute before his fire-retardant green fatigues finally stymied the flames.  -  Sarge was nearly to the roof, but hadn't been able to figure out where Ronald's grim reaper had fled. *There must be a trap door; a secret passage; something.* He dragged his hand along the castle wall, feeling for inconsistencies. In a few feet, his gloved fingers caught on an unexpected ledge.  *Gotcha.*  The hidden door opened into a tiny room big enough for one person. Before the assailant could raise his gun, Sarge's nuclear blaster turned him into a puddle of bright green goo.  *Next stop, the roof,* he chuckled grimly.  -  Donatello and Kong emerged onto the roof, leaping and somersaulting in order to avoid the onslaught of machine gun and laser fire coming from all around. Unable to find shelter, Kong charged headlong toward a 50 cal. mounted machine gun being fired from a helicopter just above the ledge of the castle. With a roar, he leapt from the roof, but his rage proved to be insufficient to save him. His massive body, already dead from the gun fire collided with the rear rotor of the helicopter, flinging blood, bone and metal shrapnel in every direction.  With the helicopter out of the fight, Donatello crawled below the crenelations. Ninja stealth was his best chance against the laser-wielding robots now. He was getting close; able to make out the sound of their processors' computerized voice, "Scanning. Scanning. Scanning."  "Scan this!" he yelled, jumping into the middle of the group. He dove onto his back, and spun while also sticking his weapon out above him. His bold maneuver brought the bots down like bowling pins.  Sarge's arrival was announced by the clang of the metal trapdoor from west staircase. "Miss the party?" He asked through a crooked smile. He wasn't smiling for long, however, as the whole castle shook and split the roof down the middle. Up from the gaping crack, their comrade Boba Fett, chained to a metal operating table emerged, as well as the target of their mission, the Red Power Ranger.  "Freeze or the bounty hunter gets it!"  "You'll never learn, Red Ranger. We came here prepared to die!" growled Sarge, his weapon trained on the villain's helmet.  Somehow, while the ranger was distracted, Donatello had managed to get close enough to take a swing at the lawbreaker with his b staff. The two teenage supers locked in combat, neither of them able to get a clear edge. Donatello foiled the Red Ranger's karate chops with his thick shell, but he couldn't get far enough away from the ranger to use his staff to his advantage.  Sarge couldn't get a clear shot, but realizing the need to act, he did the best he could. The nuclear energy melted a hole right through Donatello's armored shell. The Red Ranger karate chopped the cooked turtle flesh inside, bring the mutant to his knees with pain. The ranger, jumped and planted both feet solidly in the ninja turtle's chest, sailing him over the edge of the castle and onto the hard pavement below.  The two remaining combatants circled each other, Boba Fett remaining unconscious between them. "Give it up!" screamed Sarge. "You can't win, I aughtta cook you right now!"  "You would, if you weren't already out of ammo." Retorted the ranger in a deceptively clear, heroic voice.  Sarge's gun clattered to the floor behind him as he marched toward the Ranger. He had so much rage it had become a sickness, and the only cure was to squeeze the life out of this wannabe super villain's throat with his bare hands.  He hardly even saw the colored beams of light flashing on the roof around him; barely saw the rush of teenage space rangers as they ran toward him; briefly realized that he was outnumbered, as the rest of the Power Rangers had come from nowhere. He absolutely felt every moment the beating that they gave him before throwing him to his death at the base of the castle with his men.  The Rangers gathered together, high-fived and from the rooftops they called, "Revolution! Revolution!"  Boba Fett's sluggish movements brought the rangers' attention back from their revelry. "Ah yes. The infamous Boba Fett. The last of the world's so called 'heroes.' Are you prepared to die?" mused the Red Ranger. Boba did not respond.  Under the crimson helmet, his smile faded. "No, seriously. We're this close to taking over the world, and you're not even going to put up a fight. You're just going to just lay there. I want to hear your last words - see your backup plan, *something!*"  Through his voice modulator, Boba Fett responded, "As you wish."  The roof of the castle erupted in flame and noise. Explosions rang out all around. Fett's body was disintegrated, the tiny fragments intermingled with the flesh of the other rangers on the roof. Smoke filled the air.  -  "Oh my god! Kevin!" A woman's voice shouted. "What the hell's going on out here?"  "Mooom!"  "Where did you get fire crackers, young man?"  "Mom! Get out of here!" The young man had clearly not expected his master plan to be interrupted. The garage door began to swing open.  "I thought you were shooting something in here! And you're going to set off every fire alarm on the block! What were you thinking?"  "Sorry mom."  The worse punishment was yet to come, when Kevin's father learned that he'd blown up his collectible action figures.

What?"  "Jan, is this really the best guy we could find?"  "Mr. President..."  "I mean, yeah. Sure. I can do it. Yes. I just... are you sure?"  "Am I sure? I just explained this plan to you. Now, I'm a busy man. Are you in or out?"  "In. Definitely in. Thank you."  "Jan, would you please show him out? Make sure he has everything he needs."  "Yes, sir."  ...  "Is he-?"  "Yes."  "Are you-?"  "No. The president is suffering from a mental break. I trust that I can count on your discretion on this matter."  "Yeah, but what are you-?"  "There's nothing we can do. President Sandler is slowly losing his mind. Recently he has lost his ability to distinguish between fiction and reality. I'm sorry, that must have been very confusing for you, but if you intend to keep this job, you must get used to it."  "Isn't this wrong? Like, shouldn't he be... Um... Removed?"  "The responsibilities of his office have been placed into capable hands. You have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, since 2018, the law states that a president's position is bound to him until his death. Our - and specifically *your* - position is merely to keep him safe and out of the public eye."  "This seems a bit over my head. I'm an actor."  "An *improv* actor. The best, from what I'm told, though I have yet to see proof of that."  "This is so far beyond anything that I thought I'd be doing here..."  "It can't be. Going back in time, writing a new religion and changing the course of history is going to be among his more tame requests."  "That's tame? Okay. So how long am I expected to keep this up?"  "I expect that he'll forget about this particular assignment in about a week. After that, no one can say for sure. And as far as how long your position will exist? Unfortunately, it's until the end of the presidency."  "Oh... 'Kay."  "So. One last time, Mr. Goodwin - and it counts this time - are you in, or out?"

Explain what it is and the reason for its significance."  ---  I keep a piece of paper on my person at all times. It's part of my routine. Whenever I go to leave the house, I've got to check my pockets: keys, phone, wallet, paper.  Keys, phone, wallet, paper.  Every day, I've got to have it. I'm not superstitious. I don't believe in luck, but I do think with enough preparation, you can make your own luck.  Sometimes I'll invest in a little notebook, or at others I'll just fold a piece of notebook paper into quarters and hold that in a pocket. I've done this for years - since I was a child.  It helped get me through school, writing down tough answers right before a test. Through college - figuring out how a young adult is supposed to schedule their day. Through my first job - writing down instructions, names, phone numbers, e-mails, links.  But how does a person find that something is lucky? How do they lean to stay out of trouble? That's right, they learn by screwing up. By making mistakes. The last day that I didn't carry a piece of paper with me was when I was nine years old. I went for a hike with my parents and my dog. I specifically remember what I ate that morning; it was several bowls of lucky charms. I also vividly recall questioning whether the milk smelled bad or not.  Suddenly, more than a mile from the car, and a dozen more from the nearest restroom, nature was calling. And she was loud. My stomach gurgled and protested, and soon it was clear that I wouldn't be able to hold it in any longer.  One of my parents just suggested that I go in the woods and use the leaves there to clean myself up. So I did. And that's how I learned what Poison Ivy looks like.  And this is the real reason I carry paper with me.   From [this prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1zv9de/wp_hate_you_i_wish_i_could/cfxb6y9?context=3). "Hate you?

Maybe Sunday too to help get us ready for that. Otherwise, we'll see you on Monday, have a great weekend, nice job team."  *Fuck this guy. I wish I could stab him right in his god damned smug face. I probably really could take him down in a fight. I've never fought anyone in my life, but I think I could fight him. What an asshole.*  *I'm going to go tell him. I'm going to go and tell him right now, just what an asshole he is. I'm walking to his office right now. Oh god, am I doing this? I'm going to lose my job. I hate this job.

Come on, man -"  "Shut up. Shut your fucking face. All you should do right now is sit and listen.  "I have put up with your shit for long enough. The extra hours, the weekends, the... Jesus, the sheer *amount* of illegal shit I have covered up to keep all of our jobs because of you..."  "Hey... Adam. I know you must hate me for this thing, but you can't leave right now. I need you, buddy."  "It's not even about today. It's not even about me. Believe me when I say that I speak for everyone here when I say 'Fuck you, Pat.' But let's put feelings aside for a moment.

And at *any* time, I could have pulled the rug out from under you. And I didn't.  "So you see, I don't hate you, Pat. If I hated you, I'd have told your wife the truth when she called here looking for you when you went to Vegas for the weekend - you used company funds for that, remember? When you made me cancel my trip to meet my girlfriend's family last year? If I'd hated you, I'd have punched you right in the eye. You'd have had that coming to you. When you got caught at work downloading porn... I didn't really have to take the fall for that, did I? You must have heard, I got a pay deduction for that.  "But you know what's stopped me from doing these things? From having these normal, human reactions? It isn't you, Pat, it's me! I don't have whatever organ everyone else has that lets them hate. A healthy hate. The kind of hate that protects them from the slippery turds of the world like yourself.  "So really, Pat? Hate you? I wish I could.  "But now I can. Come Monday, you're on your own. Good luck with that. I might even make a little phone call today and tell them just where to look. God damn, Pat, you are *so* fucked. So fucked that you don't even understand.

Blade growled as he walked away from the smoldering, sparkling body of the dead vampire behind him. He almost made it to the edge of the clearing when a piercing wail rang out from behind him. He spun,  bringing his sword up to the ready for the second time.  But instead of a monster, there was a pale human teenager. "You... ugh. ner... You killed... ugh. him!"  "The fuck'd you just say?" asked Blade as he tried to make up his mind whether to deal with this vampire's slave or just leave. "  "Aaaah, I hate you! How could this happen ner to meeee?!" The awkward teen lamented.  "Ain't nothin' happened to you yet, girl."  "I'll kill you. I swear ner on my ugh, like, father's grave."  That was as much of a threat as he needed, and more than enough irritation. There is no afterlife for vampires, so the young couple didn't have a happy ever after... But at least Blade was in a better mood now.    Based on [this image](http://i.imgur.com/RooQxpY.jpg) by [Aaron Needham](http://aaronneedham.tumblr.com/post/59853349209/aaron-needham) posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1lh9md/ip_who_is_she/)  This was the first story I ever posted to Reddit. September 1, 2013.  ---  Looking back, I wonder if I was crazy before I even left. That was four days ago, when I loaded into my Volkswagen Rabbit and headed into the New Mexico desert for the night. To think... At that point I would have done anything to just run away.  That car had never been a real winner. I bought it off a kid from my high school as he left for college. It was a washed out silver/blue piece of shit that he'd spray painted a skull and crossbones onto the front. And to top it off, I knew fuck all about cars.  So when it broke down about 4 hours from the last time I saw a paved road and started pissing oil and billowing steam from the engine, I was helpless. I checked my phone, standing on top of the car and just saw one middle finger of a signal bar pop up before the battery died and the screen went black.  I was silently furious. Furious with myself for pushing the limits of how far I could get out into the blank desert. Furious with my mom for getting arrested and making me have to move out here to New Mexico with my dad in the first place.  The sun started to go down, and I started walking. I couldn't follow the rabbit's tracks because I knew there was nothing at all back that way. So I picked a direction perpendicular to them, South I guess, and started walking.  I wasn't really sure how worried I should have been at that point. I just figured that I'd have to find something. I should have been a lot more concerned.  I walked as far as I could that first night. Without the sun it got cold and harder to maintain my direction. I walked for hours. Sometimes humming songs to myself, sometimes yelling for help, sometimes yelling curses at my parents. After a while though, I just walked.  I slept that morning until the heat and the light woke me up, then started walking again. All I remember is walking, walking on with my eyes closed against the harsh white brightness of the desert. When the darkness came again I sat and rested my legs. My mind was blank and numb from the day. Burned away from the sun. I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired.  In the middle of the night I started walking again. I had to get out. Another day like that could kill me. I started hearing things in the darkness. Scuffles of animals moving, following me. Waiting for me to drop dead.  It was only a few eternities into the next day when I saw a building in the shimmering distance. A cry of relief passed my cracked lips as it came into focus.  A barn.  I knocked until my knuckles stung, cracked and bled on that fucking shed. There was no one there. There was no evidence of anyone being there. Not even a dirt road or indentions of tires worn into the desert. It was just a corrugated metal shed that had sprung up out of the desert.  At noon, the sliver of shade on the side of the shed went away. I hung my head and started walking again.  More hours. More heat. More nothing. The sun was settling onto the horizon.  Suddenly, screams pierced the evening air - some kind of horrible monster in the distance.  My legs didn't respond when I commanded them to run. It was all I could do to turn and shuffle away from the screams. The sound was loud and inhuman. I looked back and saw dust being kicked up in a cloud headed straight for me. A growling, snarling noise joined the ear-splitting screams.  Then, nothing. I looked back to see a great white beast crouched and ready to pounce, the dust settling around it. I stumbled and fell onto my back. And for a moment I admired the reds and oranges of the sunset. A Tequila Sunrise spilt over the vast open canvas of the sky.  Onto that canvas, a woman's head and shoulders appeared. In the low light, her skin appeared blue. Her face held a look of blank, serious determination. The same look that had been melted onto my face.  A fellow wanderer.  I felt calm.   Then after a small movement, she held a knife, and all calm that I had felt was replaced with animal fear. The realization that the beast was still there, a few yards behind her, and that she was somehow a part of that beast. A monster to be feared. There to end my long march at last.  She didn't end me there in the desert under that fiery sunset. Instead, she brought me back into the world that I sought to escape; brought me here to the hospital in the belly of what a fevered mind saw as a great white beast.  Who is she?   She is the one who saved me.                                                           	114

 These are the albums that got me in to dance music, the mixed ones in particular were generally some of the best ever released especially the first 5-10 which were the pinnacle golden age but in latter years they went down hill a bit and went too commercial and the mixed era died along with the brand, it still lives on but only to make Ministry of Sound money, the craft and care of the originals were something special and touched your mind, body and soul, the highest state of euphoria  These are about the best euphoric ones they ever released...

Would be great to see her dropped down a peg or two and see her roughed up a bit with Vinegar Tits the new governor or would we need another season to finally see this happen?   I wonder if Jim will grow a pot belly   I wonder if we may see Vicki Vale who Kim Basinger portrayed at some point, a recurring reporter character would play well especially if she was feisty and snooped around a lot    Check out these guys, they are UK based so would serve that area but seeing as the season has done, it no longer matters that there was a massive delay in broadcasting between countries...  http://gothamtvpodcast.com/   Well, we have had a lot of Fish and Cat and not a lot of Ivy, poor Pepper and then there's Leslie and Montoya then there's Barbara who has been a mess all season, what were the writers thinking and then there's Victor's mistresses, Penguin's mum and various fleeting characters like Robin's mother and that's about it  Outweigh this with multiple sausages and testosterone fuelled nonsense, can we have more totty in season 2 please?  I see the writers may be having more diverse characters in season 2 so hopefully there may be a few welcome surprises in the way of sultry butt wiggling beauties   Bad Photoshopping   No pics, this is a scam   Yeah and Jim as the guy from The OC   Also, will the kids grow in to their roles as it's important to consider actor changes as well and if that will alter the show, I think the casting has been spot on and if anyone changes Riddle Man or Pengy for another actor there will be hell to pay   So long as she stays away from fetish whips till she gets older   Yeah David deserves a shot when he gets older but consistency is the key here, not every season has to be great but so long as it keeps going and the characters remain entertaining then why not  	12
 Whenever someone puts "the" before a minority.    This hangover is killing me. I knew I shouldn't have had that last shot, but man that girl was fine as hell. How could I turn down a drink from such a hot girl? Perks of being the Alpha I  guess. These pledges really stepped up this year. I'm impressed. They even used real handcuffs. They probably could've picked a better place to stash is though. This girl's apartment isn't very intimidating, and the blood is obviously fake. The corn syrup was a good choice, but the food coloring is too dark. Rookie mistake.   Nothing. I guess he's still out. At least the chair is comfortable. I really have to pee though. They need to hurry this up already. I have class at noon. It's not like I was going to go anyway.   "Hey! I have to piss! Someone come let me out already!"   Someone's coming. The steps are soft.   "So, you're finally awake?"  Wow. Maybe I misjudged these pledges after all. Sending a girlfriend to take care of me? What a bunch of assholes. I deserve more respect than that.   "Tell them to come out here. They already won, so there's no need to keep the game going."   She looks familiar. Is it the girl from last night? No, she was blonde. Why is she smiling like that? She must be stupid.   "I already got them."  Got them? What is she talking about? This doesn't make sense.  "What? You got them?"  "Yes, your friends. I got them. They're gone. You are the only one left."   "What are you talking about?"   "You really don't remember?"  "Last night? No I blacked out."  "Not last night you idiot! The party two years ago."  This girl is making no sense. What party? This is so stupid. I have to pee. This girl she does look familiar though. Damn, I really have to pee.   "Look, I have to pee. Can't you just..."  What is wrong with this girl. Women are so stupid. You can never trust them to do things right. They're only good for sex. Fucking women.   "You, and your friends, took everything from me that night! Now I'm going to take everything from you."  She's laughing? I don't see how this is funny. This has gone too far.   "I just want to take a shower and drink now. The game is over. I have to piss, and I have class. Enough is enough."  This day is wasted. Fucking pledges and their stupid girlfriends.   "You still don't remember? You still don't get it? You...  Do know I'm going to kill you right?"  "HAHAHA! Ok! You got me! I'm scared! You hear that pledges? Your little girl is really scary! Game over! Let me go now!"  "You are a very stupid person. You'll realize that before the end."  This girl. She is so... She is the girl from last night! I guess she was wearing a wig. I know her from somewhere else though. Where is she going? What is that in her hand? Is that a knife?   "Two years ago, You and your little frat buddies decided it would be fun to... What's the phrase you used? That's right! You thought it would be fun to 'run a train' on a girl.You thought it would be fun to take the innocence of a helpless young girl for hours! Well, I would take your innocence to make it even, but you don't have any. I think I'll penetrate you for hours just like you did to me. Then, we'll be even."  Wait! It's her! It's the girl! Oh shit! Oh shit no! Oh god I'm gonna die! Oh god!   "Are you pissing your pants? What a coward. I wonder if you'll scream louder than the others. Apparently having your dick cut off is extremely painful..."  "Wait please!"  "Too late... Asshole."      "Fascist!"  	3
    http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrockbarn  You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.  I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.  I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.)   One of you fine people posted a couple weeks ago about this site called usertesting.com.  I sign up and took a practice test (which paid out $10), got a 5 star rating and haven't really received a test since. I mean, you get screened for most of them (which, so far, has led me to 0 successes).   Do you have any tips or tricks on getting new tests? I mean shit, I'd love the extra work but it is so damn picky. Should I just lie or something? I'd hate to do that.   Open to accounts older than 2 months.  To enter:  1. Comment with the game you'd like   2. In mspaint, draw me your best interpretation of what the word "flargepool" is/means     All I wanted was Crusader Kings 2 (can't beat the price, it's $24 on sale and humblebundle but $6.74 with the jumbo bundle)  * Deadlight * The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing - Complete Pack * Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition * Terraria * THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIII STEAM EDITION * Legend of Grimrock * Orcs Must Die! 2: Complete Pack * PixelJunk Eden   RULES:    1. I will only gift games to people that **have not received**.    2. Your account **MUST** be at least 2 months old and have at least 35 comment karma (none of these sit-and-wait accounts)   3. **DO NOT PM ME.**     **To Enter:**    You must comment with the game you want (1 game per user), your steam ID, and your best mspaint drawn interpretation of what it means to be a "cattyflanger"  Winners will be picked in 24 hours.   Edit: Guys, I fucked up. I'll be passing out the games still but I won't make it in my 24 hr period. For this error if you read this, edit your post with another game and I'll give out 2 per winner.    Seriously, I roasted and ate 3 garlic heads last night and I haven't stopped farting since 8am CST.  EDIT: Clarification: Why do certain foods make me ***MORE*** gassy than others?   I see a lot of the baked dishes have it listed as an ingredient and I know it's expensive. Where can I get the best deal on it?  Thank you in advance!   http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020772476  If you have an extra copy from the recent sale (that I missed) I'd appreciate it! Thank you in advance!

If any of us or our animals go out, we get eaten alive. I've been researching non-pesticidal ways to remove them from our yard and have come up with two safe tactics.  1. Nematodes 2. Sulfur    My problem is, I'd like to rid them while spending the least amount of cash.    Nematodes work well, I hear, but they are pretty expensive and require a special hose hookup to apply.    Sulfur is cheap but I'm curious if it will affect my yard's ecosystem in a harmful way. I know it smells (that's not an issue for me) but would that smell keep birds away? What about bees? I'd hate to shoo bees away because of the chiggers. Would it negatively affect my dog?    Any help would be appreciated.   Hello all, I hope I'm in the right place.

I have an office birthday celebration this friday and the cuisine is "anything salad." I want to bring a keto-heavy salad but am not sure what would go well together.   Could you help me out? It doesn't have to be limited to your typical leaf salads, keto variants of pasta salads, chicken/tuna salads would work as well.  I appreciate your help in advance.

What story will you never forget?     I walked into a bathroom and heard this weird noise coming from the stall next to the one I was entering. It was kind of like a small popping noise.  Anyhow, I sit down to take the browns to the superb owl. I pinch a couple of loaves and realize that there is no toilet paper in my stall. Shit!   I didn't want to walk out with my ass covered in dookie so I asked the man in the stall next to me if he could spare some squares. He shuffles real quick and hands me a wadded up tp bunch with warm liquid on it.  I smelt it (you would too) and it was totes jizz.   TL;DR. Wiped my ass with a jizz soaked TP square.   HMB!? WHAT IS IT!!!   It was posted a couple of days ago, maybe thursday/friday of last week. It had horn sounds at the end of the runescape theme song. I've googled, searched reddit, searched my youtube history with no luck.  Any help would be appreciated. It was hilarious.    This is the second time I've tried it and I keep getting sick. I read about the keto flu but this isn't it. My tonsils have swollen up so bad that my throat is now the size of a quarter.   I'm getting frustrated and I just want to vent.

I know that a 12 month lock in is popular but I've found a month-to-month plan that is cheaper. I also know that means they don't lock in your rate.

It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that.

I've recently decided to acquire a road bike and I've got some helpful tips from users on where to find a great selection of used ones under $200 (120.53 pounds, 145.36 euro). Below is a list of links of bikes that I thought looked great. Do you mind giving your two cents on which one would be the best purchase or advice on what a good deal looks like?   * http://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/bik/4396778532.html    * http://dallas.craigslist.org/mdf/bik/4388005751.html    * http://dallas.craigslist.org/ndf/bik/4399594928.html    * http://dallas.craigslist.org/mdf/bid/4378063966.html    * http://texoma.craigslist.org/bik/4390737282.html     * http://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/bik/4379416795.html     * http://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/bik/4391044826.html  Here are some specs as to my body type:  I'm 5ft 8in (172.72cm)   I weigh 195lbs (88.4505kg)   Also, if you see one that's not worth the price listed, feel free to give me an amount and I'll ask the seller!   I very much appreciate your assistance. Thank you for the support/help!      Hello community!  I have a low-end mountain bike. I bought it used for $25. The only big issue I have with it is the handlebar keeps coming loose! I've tried tightening the bolt and ended up stripping it. I have a new bolt and it's not working to well either. Do you have any recommendations on how to keep it secure? Maybe a trick?   Also, where is the best place to find used sports bikes? Like the majority of the ones on the front page. I really like their design, the thinner wheels, and the two-placement handlebars. They also look like they're a little lighter than mine. But they're expensive new!   Thank you so much for your help!            I have quite a few mods I'm interested in using but once I install them (using KSP Mod Admin) and start the game, the loader will run until it hits the middle and then just stop. The game doesn't freeze as the quirky comments above the loading bar keep changing. I've tried Texture Compressor (even the aggressive version) with no luck.  I would love your advice.  Here are my specs:  AMD FX-6100 Six core CPU (3.30 GHz)   8gb RAM   64-bit Windows 7   AMD Radeon 6870 GPU     I was informed by a user that I am not taking decent enough care for my clothes therefore they are wearing out sooner than expected. I have learned about drying racks and shoe trees but was wondering if the community here could give me other types of tips and tricks that could extend the life of my business clothes including (but not limited to): button-down shirts, dress pants, dress shoes, undershirts, etc.   Any advice would help immensely.    I am having a hard time finding business shoes that last. I'll buy a pair and they'll be ruined in 5 months.  Here's an example of what I'm looking for:  http://www.landsend.com/products/mens-allen-edmonds-leeds-plain-toe-blucher-shoe/id_205635  Any help would be much appreciated.

Do not forget to provide your Steam ID. Please refrain from requesting if you have already received something from GoG. I know how disappointing it is to submit to countless offers and come up with  nothing, so I'd like to give only the underdogs a chance.    EDIT FOR ALL:  User /u/lumenation has informed me of this info:  **If you have Sims 3 on steam and try to buy expansions from stores or from Origin, they will not pair with the Sims 3 on steam. Only expac's bought on steam will work with Sims 3.    However you can use the steam Sims 3 key on origin and any expec's bought on steam with origin as well. If you knew this or not I just thought I'd let you know so you can inform others. I had issues with this when I originally had Sims 3 on my steam.**  EDIT 2: Thank you for your entries, ladies and gentlemen. /u/Manlyarmpits is the winner! Congratulations!

I know that because I am a 5'9"ft man that I need around 2500 calories a day. How do I count calories in a way to lose some weight? Do I count carbs, fat, etc. too?      And yes, it's the real deal. None of that fake shit people try to swindle you for. I cleaned the rock and soot covered chunk myself.   Jesus! Not only do the rest of us want a copy of it but I want to buy the sims 3 as well. Your massive jerk-off of LFD2 is bogging down the damn server so hurry the fuck up.      I went to the doctor recently to get some blood work done. They said that my TSH was running high and that my thryroid isn't producing enough of the hormone. She wants me to start taking levothyroxine. However, I'm scared. What if there is an underlying cause of this occurrence? My family does not have a history of thyroid issues and I had blood work done last year with no thyroid issues (that I know of). I'm scared that if I start taking the supplement that if it's another issue that hasn't been diagnosed and is treatable, that I will eventually become dependant on the medication and my thyroid will stop producing hormones all together. Am I making sense? What can I do?   Am I correct in saying that she was once a man? I know that's probably a dumb question. She just looks so much like a woman! Except with a dick. Anyhow, I saw this presentation on shemales and how men get turned on by them. But gay men aren't. It's weird how our brains work. Something called an erotic illusion. Here's the talk: http://youtu.be/p-A8GvUehq4?t=21m35s.   I used to hate Yishan, until the thought police seized me. They beat me day in and day out. They deprived me of food, water, and shelter. They made me watch hours upon hours of reality TV (Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, and The Real Housewives of Atlanta) while crushing my ball-sack with a pair of vice grips. They inserted 2-4lb pineapples in most of my orifices and then forced me to eat the fruit. This went on for months.  That is... until Yishan saved me. He came and stopped the torment and he promised me that I would one day come to love him.   Today is that day, my brothers. He is lov...  *a bullet rings as test_subject4255 drops to the floor*           	135
 You're right. I was just thinking in an economic context. Philadelphia was just so crucial in the development of the early US.   well...   Not to be that guy, but The Lord of the Rings.   Walrus.   Those stupid fucking Fred videos from years ago.   Holding eye contact.   Piano Man.   I kind of want to be that one golden horseman from Risk.   The best advice I've ever received from Reddit was when i was in serious trouble with my parents, reddit told me to just accept my punishment and tell the truth in light of the fact that I would probably laugh about it in years to come.   I don't know if this applies, but people see my red hair and automatically assume that I'm Irish.   Mad Men and The Borgias.   Well as a child currently punished, my parents took my car. This is becoming a pain for them because they now have to drive me everywhere.   Requiem for a Dream because of the highs and lows.  The Steward of Gondor, from The Lord of the Rings. In case you don't recall, this is the song that Pippin sings to Denethor while Faramir attacks Osgilliath.  Also the Rains of Castamere, from Game of Thrones. That just brings up so many terrible memories. I don't even want to talk about it.   "You've got the memory of a fuckin' fly" from the movie GlennGary Glen Ross.   His retirement.   Alcohol because while technically no one can stop you from drinking as much as you want, it will ruin your life in excess just like meth and other hard drugs.   9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB. ILLUMINATI AND BUSH GOT US. LOOSE CHANGE!!!   16:9   Middle Earth. Naturally the most cliche place to choose, but naturally also the only place to choose.

 Is there somewhere where I can suggest this? I like to have my apps auto update but they always seems to do it in the middle of the day while I'm at work where I'm essentially in a Faraday cage so it drains my battery. I don't use WiFi update because my home WiFi is unreliable and using 4g is actually faster and I have unlimited data still so I have no need to use wifi         I have no idea what's going on :\  http://i.imgur.com/CtbeqYE.png   [You can almost hear my brain ticking trying to process WTF I am playing!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalOPQ637HQfeature=youtu.be)  NSFW language   It's not that it's not exporting a number of tracks, it's picking and choosing which audio sources to export instead of all of them. It exports the sound from the video intro which is on track 2, and it will export the audio attached to the video which is on track one, but the song I've added at the end of the video will not render, no matter which track it's on. playback is fine within premiere but the audio is lost during encoding.  I don't understand how I can make a bunch of videos but suddenly have the audio for the same song I've been using get left out of rendering         The last two videos I tried rendering, the 3rd audio track isn't being rendered at all. I can't seem to even find anyone having similar problems via Google. Help?         Eventually I'd like to just get a remote for XBMC alone, but I also use my HTPC for browsing the web from my couch and I want to know what everyone else thinks is the best for couch browsing.  I currently have a Logitech K400 but the build quality leaves something to be desired. I've had it for over a year and the little notch on the on/off switch already wore off so it's pretty hard to turn the keyboard on and off now. The mouse buttons feel like you're barely pressing anything at all...it just feels like there is no affirmation that you actually pressed the mouse button. And on top of that, for the first year I just had the wireless dongle connected to one of the front USB ports on the PC and it worked fine from anywhere in my livingroom and even the kitchen, but now that's not good enough and I had to get a USB extension cord to bring the dongle up higher in the room so my input would stop lagging or outright not responding.   For me it would have to be family features and sharing. If I have two Xboxes, I can play one game downstairs, and my wife can play another in a different room, but with Steam, only one device can be logged in at a time, so that means only one of us can play any game at a time. I don't really like the idea of having to pay twice for a game unless we are going to play online with each other at the same time, but many games we buy, we don't play online, or there isn't any online.  There are two different ways I can see this happening:  1. They allow multiple devices to be connected to the same steam account on the same IP. So that means my computer upstairs can still be connected to steam while the one on our TV is also connected to Steam. Obviously, if one game is being played currently, the other computer would either be able to screenshare/observe the other player or play a different game.  2. Sharing games with different family accounts (maybe also linked to your same IP). Basically the same exact thing as above except the other computers don't have to be logged into the same account, just one that is linked with the main account.    I think my biggest peeve with the current way Steam works is that when I open steam in my livingroom, I have to type my password again when I return to my main PC, and then when I go back downstairs again, I *again* have to type my password. It gets tiresome.  So Reddit, what are features you would like to see implemented into Steam?      I just picked up this guy: http://i.imgur.com/xcMcQJO.jpg  My last basil plant is still alive but with only a few leaves and is rather scraggly looking. How can I keep this guy big and strong?         http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eolKJDnJ_fI  I'm still real slow at editing video as I haven't really done a lot so I was up pretty much all night getting this together. On top of that I was adjusting the brightness so you could actually kinda see when the nightvision isn't being used. Hopefully we'll get to more episodes soon!      I got some discounted, pre-seasoned country style pork ribs the other day and I don't have the time to properly smoke/grill them so I'm going to use a slow cooker.   But for the sake of saving money and producing more food in a variety, I was hoping someone could provide tips or insight to doing a bit more, like having more meat but not just adding more pork ribs.  Has anyone ever done such a thing and does it turn out well? something I was thinking was adding some different kinds of sausage links to the mix so that those will slow cook as well and I can either go onto reheating them another day to just eat on a bun or slicing them to use in another dish. I want to get the most out of the onion and peppers that will be in the crock pot   I'm visiting the area for a wedding and saw that all the machines in the Tilt had pricetags on them so I'm not sure if they're going to be closing or what. Unfortunately I don't remember the prices or all the games but some notable mentions are DDR Ultimate, Initial D, Tekken 4, 5, and Tag, and Star Wars Pod Racer. I just saw a recent post on my front page showing some stuff for sale and thought I'd share my find.         I've been trying to play single player and get used to everything before I jump into a server and get roflpwned by someone before I even get started.  What is the best strategy to get going? I built a small ship up with lots of mining lasers after a long while to the point where I could mine entire asteroids but even then I wouldn't get a whole lot of money from selling all that stuff. I always hear pirate hunting is good too, I equipped my ship with some shields and I had quite a large amount of lasers but I wasn't able to take down a pirate at all so I ended up getting my ship destroyed   Is anyone else getting this?   I'm building a station that requires 12 of these to be docked with it and it will act as a refueling station. My goal is to get it docked with the station without consuming any of the fuel (aside from RCS for docking)  No matter what I do, I seem to come up short of establishing an orbit because of the weight.  [The tanks will replace the spot where those rockets are](http://i.imgur.com/lydj9I4h.jpg)         I can't believe they cut one of the main SB lots that students use in half just so they can expand visitor/pay parking. I also noticed they paved the F lot near the stadium. Oh we're sorry we cut one of your lots in half but hey we paved that other lot that's twice as far so you can use that! At this point I wouldn't put it past them to change that lot to SB.   So yeah, if you haven't seen or heard yet, now you can know what to expect if you're an off campus student when you come to get books before classes start         Can anyone point me to a place where I can get replacement parts for a Galaxy Nexus?   What are frequently broken internal parts on the Galaxy Nexus that I can also buy in advance before they break and before it's too late to get replacement parts, if it already isn't too late now? The wife and i both have the phone and due to money and not wanting to lose unlimited data, neither of us will be getting any new phones anytime soon so I need to make these last as long as possible.   Sometimes I just don't have any money to do anything with at a certain point in the game so all I can do is wait for midnight to come around before I can get some more to do something with, and the fast time speed just doesn't feel fast enough, and I'm not talking about the performance issues, because those make it even worse.   So I've been somewhat out of the loop in anime for a while, especially since it seems that anything that gets dubbed doesn't catch my interest anymore, so here I am, for the first time, humbly delving into the realm of subbed anime.  The wife and I are huge FMA fans so we've seen Brotherhood already, and more recently we got into Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack On Titan and Free!  If you don't mind, please write a short synopsis of what the anime is all about and why you recommend it  I didn't see a rule against recommendation threads so sorry if this is looked down on, but waiting a week for every Attack on Titan episode is killer and it leaves me wanting to watch copious amounts of anime                  I'm just wondering what others' opinions are on thus. I've only ever seem the one in Butte and the one put on by Harvest in Billings and the Butte experience is far superior since you can light off your own fireworks without getting fined so the whole night is a big firework show in addition to the big show at sundown.   I was finally able to make it to the Butte one after wanting to go for years but always working and it was awesome. It was also fun driving around town blasting Eye of the Tiger waving the American flag out the window. I have to work in the morning but it is worth it   I'm just wondering what others' opinions are on thus.

I'm not too familiar with the area around Missoula but are there decent camping areas next to a river/creek where we can pretty much just stop and set up a tent for a couple nights? We also don't want to be too far away from the city just so we're not spending more on gas      This probably isn't very revengey but it certainly is the most petty thing I've done in recent times.  At my job, a restaurant, our daily duties are outlined in a list. So in the morning we come in and go about our business and get things ready for working and then we get our lists and unless the managers decide to send someone home early, we're responsible for completing the list in its entirety, hopefully within 8 hours, and if the estimated time for the list is longer than 8 hours, certainly no longer than that allotted time. The list is generated by a computer and sometimes modified by the manager and it is determined by how much product we have on hand currently, and what we are projected to use that day/the next day.  On this particular day, I had probably a 10 hour list, and it was probably a Friday or a Saturday so product that we were low or out of had to be done quickly so we didn't run out. One of the things I had to do required sliced potatoes, and the amount I had to do required 50 pounds of it. No big deal, because as soon as I wash the potatoes, all I have to do is put it in a modular food processor that has a slicing attachment and 50 pounds of potatoes is sliced within a couple minutes. Except someone broke that attachment, and management didn't seem to care enough to tell me that it was broken. Had I known, I would have started on what I was working on sooner, but instead I did some other things that I knew needed to be done and the potatoes wouldn't be a big deal.   You can imagine I wasn't very happy when I found out the part was broken because by this time we were almost out of what I needed it for, so now something that would take 5 minutes turned into an extra hour of work. I essentially had to stop everything else I was doing and focus on slicing the potatoes by hand. Slicing the potatoes themselves didn't take a whole hour, but that time I spent slicing potatoes between running things to the line and to the expo alley could have been spent doing other things if the part wasn't broken. I even asked the manager there at the time if there was anyone in another area that they could spare for about 15 minutes to help me slice the potatoes so I can get some other stuff done, and they said they would get some help for me, but that help never came.  And this is where the pettiness comes into play. On our list there is the printed estimated time to complete the list, and below that is a line reserved for the computer or manager to add additional time and then explain what the extra time is to be used for. Then there is a line below that to combine them for the total amount of time. I wrote an extra hour in myself and then in the comments wrote "slicing 50 pounds of potatoes by hand"  tl;dr: slicing potatoes by hand is for chumps like me         I recently got one as a gift and my last apple product was a 5th gen iPod that just sits in my car nowadays. I've mostly been into android devices so I'm not familiar with the relative apps in the iOS ecosystem. I've always heard good things about alien blue but I don't really want to pay for a reddit app.  For the most part I like it so far but I'm unsure of what exactly to do with it beyond replacing my phone as something to mess around with while on the couch watching tv.   My family has had lots of dogs and when I moved out and got married we got a dog ourselves about 5 years ago, but none of the dogs I've ever owned were this high energy and stubborn. We recently went to the animal shelter and we just had to have this little boy. They said he's between 5 and 8 months. People tell us it looks like he's a mix breed but I'm not sure what else he's mixed with.  I know that their energy level means lots of walks/running/playing outside as well as a bigger appetite. The shelter gave us a small bag of Science Diet for his food but once that's up we're switching him to Canadae.  Also, any tips to keep him from eating our other animal's food? Including our new puppy, we have two dogs and a cat. We have our cat's food on top of a container so our smaller dog can't get to it because she made a habit of trying to starve him to death. Our new dog wants to eat both the cat food and our other dog's food. We don't free-feed our animals, they get their daily portions in the morning, but they don't eat it all at once.   [Here's a picture of the little guy](http://i.imgur.com/2kUzbzw.jpg)   I've never done it but I'm considering it since I always hear that it's healthier for the dog and even cheaper than eating kibble   Kids can be some of the most frightening creatures.   I just tried using a looping rollercoaster and the coaster just flies backward through the station after the loop and crashes. Am I doing something wrong?      First off, forgive me for any dumb autocorrect typos as I'm on my phone, I don't have access to a computer right now.   My wife had her appointment on Monday with her mom there with her while I was at work. At that point she had the worst panic attack yet, complete with screaming and twisting and contorting her arms. They ended up sending her to the emergency room where they gave her something stronger than clonazepam to calm her down.  At that point I got called while at work and left work to drive 2 hours to where she was. She was calm when I got there because of the meds and I had some alone time with her to talk and she told me that she NEEDS to go somewhere where it's quiet and she needs to stay there for more than just a day and she needs to be monitored while on new meds. Her family wanted her to discharge herself against medical advice in order for me to take her 4 hours to the city we grew up in so she could go to an emergency room there and get admitted to that psychiatric facility.  Her family was convinced that if she stayed and had the crisis response team evaluate her, they would force her into a facility she didn't want to go to, and more specifically, one her cousin went to that didn't work for him. They thought the staff was lying to us but since they have no control over what can be done, I made the decision to stay so we could avoid needing to wait for more blood work and waiting another 3 hours for the crisis response team in that area.  So they came and said she could stay in a facility, and got paperwork together and faxed it to the other hospital and got us set up so we could go there. I drove her the 4 hours and we were both tired and worn out but she stayed up to talk to me and kept me awake since I had about 10 hours of sleep the last few days.  My parents met us at the hospital but it would have been too many people in the room so they had to wait outside and my wife had to sit and answer more questions and by this time that medicine had worn off so her arms were wretching again and her heart rate was high but after a bit she calmed down without needing any meds because she knew she was near the end of the journey and she would get to rest somewhere peaceful and quiet so she could heal. We still had to wait because the damn laptops the nurse was using to record her answers to questions kept freezing so she would leave and we would have to wait for her to come back with another. My wife commented "all this waiting is enough to drive a crazy person sane." After they told us that they were done and soon security would come and escort her to the psych building we could have my family come in and talk for a bit and say goodbye before she had to go. The entire process was about 15 hours including the 4 hour drive between hospitals. I really hope we dont have to go through this process again. Needing to go to the emergency broom in order to get admitted to an inpatient facility is really stupid and expensive. I understand the need to have an evaluation process but can't it be sans emergency room?  She wasn't allowed any electronics so I can only call her through the hospital to talk to her but that would be awkward for her because there are no chairs near any phones and she probably can't talk long before some activity or therapy. There are two different visiting hours that I can visit her at for an hour each, which I've done every time.  She has had a lot of support, I've been there every time, her aunt and cousins have been there a couple and so have my parents. I feel bad that none of the other people in there ever get visitors. She first started some new medication the first day but I forgot what it was. She brought up to the doctor that celexa worked for her mom and they are the same blood type so they gave that a shot and will monitor her to see if that is working. She has the clonazepam which is as needed for anxiety attacks. They also have something to prevent nightmares as well as an optional sleeping pill. I'm not super comfortable with that amount of medication because each one has their own side effects and I feel like this might turn into a game of prescribing pills to treat the side effects and then prescribing pills to treat the side effects of the pills that are treating the side effects. And now I feel like I will have to get a safe for the medication to lock it up in case she gets an urge to pop them all at once.  But ever since being in there she hasn't had any dark shadow thoughts when trying to fall asleep and there aren't any nightmares as well. Over the last few days she has definitely gotten a lot more positive and it feels like this was the best decision. I'm just afraid they will kick her out too soon and then she will regress again and we will have to go through all this over again and it's getting really hard to miss work. I've already missed 3 full weeks and I already have to miss another in May because I'm going with her mom to get surgery done out of state. It was going to be my wife but she is in no condition to get on a plane, especially with that phobia.  Today was a little rough, she had a bad headache that was due to stress in her neck which I believe to be from her slouching a lot. The pain wrapped around her forehead and her depression amplified the effects of the headache and it made her extremely dizzy and weak. Walking was difficult for her and she couldn't concentrate or talk much. I bought a journal and we've been passing it back and forth between visits and writing things in it but she was unable to focus enough to write anything for me today.  She was a lot better during the second visit. A lot more talkative and she was smiling again. Still had some effects of the headache but overall better than this morning and far better than before she got in here. Before today it was looking like she might be discharged Friday but I'm not sure now. I suppose I'll wait and see how tomorrow goes.  Thanks to everyone for all the kind words in the last post. I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to everyone. Writing everything and putting it out there is therapeutic for me.   *edit* I apologize for the huge wall of text. The first paragraph alone is a whole post in of itself when expanded. I already posted about it under a throwaway, and if you really want to read it, here is the link: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1atq9f/my_wife_cheated_on_me_last_week_and_then/  To make a long back story short, she started going to a doctor to get something for anxiety of flying because she was going on a trip to London. The doctor also diagnosed her with depression and prescribed her fluoxetine, so she started taking that about 2-3 weeks before her trip. She thought that our marriage was failing and that there was nothing that could be done to save it so she ended up cheating on me with someone else who went on the trip with her (it was basically one of those classes in college where you go somewhere for a couple weeks and write a couple papers on your experience and get credits). She had slowly been falling in love with him over the last year or so. When he was with her on the trip, he used her only to end his dry spell and broke her heart. When she came back, she was more broken than I've ever seen her. 2 days after she got back, she told me what had happened. My heart was broken, but she is the most important person to me in this entire world, so I vowed to her that I will right my wrongs, and I won't let this ruin our relationship. On top of all of this, she had been suffering through school for the last couple years, she didn't want to keep going and wanted to take a break but she felt that her family was pressuring her to finish as fast as she could so she has been overworking herself for the last 4 years. The trip was the final straw.  Fast forward a couple more days, I found her trying to dig into her wrists with a pair of scissors, and not just cutting across the wrists, she was trying to follow her veins "to see if she could even feel it". To this day she still doesn't remember doing that. She said when she looked at the mirror, and then saw the scissors sitting there, something else took over that wasn't her, and next thing she remembered is seeing me coming up the stairs and having scissors in her hand. Luckily the scissors were dull so she didn't even break the skin. She had a counseling appointment that day, and the counselor felt that she needed to stay at a facility for a bit. She thought it might be beneficial too so she went. I brought her things like pencils, her sketchbook, and some painting supplies because that stuff has always been therapeutic for her.  The facility discharged her a day later. The head psychiatrist had a one-on-one with her and told her that she felt she wasn't afraid for her life and that she believes what happened was only an impulse and that she wasn't truly suicidal. After I picked her up, I took about 2 weeks off of work. She told me about the place. They didn't really help her. Every time she sat down and was about to paint, they would pry her away from it to do group therapy sessions, in which she would listen to other people's problems, and then when it got to her and she explained what was going on, nobody had any type of advice for her at all and they moved onto the next person. Over the night she was kept up by someone screaming. When she finally did sleep, she was awoken early by an angry person yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't a very good experience for her.  I spent the two weeks with her and her counselor determined that she was only living her life for me, but not for herself, so all she needed to work on was loving herself again. I spent every second of every day with her, through ups and downs and I took care of her. But after that 2 weeks I had to go back to work. I was more confident in leaving her alone at that time because of the healing we had done, both individually, and as a couple. That week I had 2 days off immediately after the first day of work. My wife was at home, safe, when I got off work. She said she distracted herself all day, which is good, but also not good because I don't really feel good leaving her alone when she has to distract herself to keep herself from thinking suicidal thoughts. At this point, none of our family knows anything about what happened yet. The next day she spiraled down hard. She was talking about the suicidal thoughts and saying how she's trapped and can't get out and there's only one way, and then she had an anxiety attack, so I gave her some more of her anxiety medicine (clonazepam) and it took a really long time for her to calm down. Baths were always relaxing for her, so I got the bath ready and she sat in the hot water with me by her side. Then she put her face into the water and held it there as long as she could and expelled the air from her lungs and I had to yank her out of the water. She apologized profusely and said she didn't know what she was doing. I helped her dry herself and get dressed and we went back downstairs where she slept on the couch for at least 2 hours.  This is where I cracked. I've never had a panic/anxiety attack, and it caused me to make some bad mistakes because of a lapse of judgement. As soon as she woke up my breathing went into a frenzy. I tried calming it by taking deep breaths but it didn't work, it kept getting worse and worse and I was taking deep breaths and I was crying and I couldn't stop. I scared my wife, even though she had panic attacks herself, she hadn't dealt with anyone else having one. I've never seen her look so scared before. She didn't know what to do. She gave me one of her anxiety pills but even then it took me a long time to come down. She paced back and forth not knowing what else she could do. She sat down on the couch and cowered in the corner. When my attack was over and the medication had dulled me a bit, she took me for a drive through town like I did for her, just listening to music and not really driving in any specific direction.  After this is where I made the mistake that I regret the most. When we got home we decided to catch the bus downtown and we could go dancing and drinking. Mixing the alcohol and the medication was something that didn't even cross my mind at all....but I later found out it was on hers the whole time. We drank, and we kept drinking. We had lots of fun. I don't remember portions of that night because I did drink so much. We were able to stumble our way to a friends house where we stayed for the night. The next morning we woke up and began walking the rest of the way home and she was upset...and then she finally said it, the thought that didn't even cross my mind. She said she wanted to go peacefully last night. She hoped that drinking so much alcohol in combination with both of her medications that she would pass on during the night while she slept. Luckily, her depression medication was taken in the morning and the clonazepam was in the early afternoon, and we didn't drink until late at night, so it wasn't as if she downed her meds and immediately started drinking.  After this is where things got real scary for me. Halfway home, she completely forgot what had happened in her life. She suddenly reverted back to being 12 years old. She didn't know who I was, or where we were, and why I was holding her hand. She didn't remember where we lived but she instinctively knew which apartment was ours but didn't recognize it. We were greeted by our dog when I opened the door and she was excited to see a puppy but she didn't really know who the dog was. But she said she had a dream that her grandpa got her a dog around Christmas time and so she named her Noel (and that is actually what happened). After I talked to her for a bit she suddenly became very tired and fell asleep on the couch for at least an hour. When she woke up, she was back to herself but she didn't know how we got home and only remembers walking half of the way. She didn't remember reverting back to being 12 years old.  At this point her mom randomly showed up to run errands in town (she lives in a small town a couple hours away) and wants to have lunch with us, so we eat somewhere and then she dropped us off at the appointment we had for that day with her doctor. Her mom could tell something was up and noted that she seemed down, but she insisted nothing was wrong, and when we got out of the car, I told her that I can't hold my tongue on this situation much longer and that she can't keep avoiding her family. She told me that if I felt I needed to tell her mom then I could do that. We talked to the doctor about the previous couple days and how she spiraled back down as soon as I had to go back to work. He felt that she wasn't safe to herself and needed to go back to the facility. This is when her mom found out because she was our transportation, so when her mom showed up I went and brought her inside and the doctor explained the situation. We took her to the facility, but upon getting there, they said there were no beds left but there were other places that were in the same network in some other cities. Her mother didn't think that bringing her to another facility was a good idea so instead we agreed to let her go home with her mom, where she, her brothers, and her grandmother could keep an eye on her at all hours of the day, whereas I am unable to do so. She can't be left alone for even a minute or else the thoughts could come flooding back.   ***My post is getting too long so I'm continuing in a comment***            In related news, fingernail files attached to clippers will remain banned         I recently got a job and it seems that my most common shift will be 4pm to midnight or 1am. I haven't done night shifts since high school and back then I didn't really have any daily responsibilities. It was just get off school, do homework, go to work, come home, watch a bit of TV, go to bed, and repeat. But now I'm an adult and I've already been conditioned to waking up an hour before I have to go to work in the morning and do all my daily things after work.   Doing nights now means I can't really do my things after I get off work. Do you come home, shower, and go straight to bed and wake up as early as possible? I seem to have trouble with falling asleep after putting in 8-9 hours at work so I end up staying up really late browsing the net and watching TV and then I sleep until 11am-noon, and after that I only have 4 hours before I have to go to work so I don't do anything because I feel like there isn't enough time to do anything before work as I'm constantly anticipating and watching the clock to make sure I'm not late.  Anyone who has done night shifts for a while or does it for a living have any protips for me? I love this job, but without having something that's mandatory to wake up for in the morning, I'm having a hell of a time trying to manage my time wisely and I feel like it's messing with the amount of energy I have too.

It started up just fine so I shut it off and then put it back together and put it back in its spot and started it again, and then the same boot loop happened  ***EDIT:***  So I now am able to get the computer to boot properly. I kinda found the cause, I will have to do a little more testing tomorrow when I have time. Having my external harddrive plugged into the front USB ports was causing the boot loop, even though I have my first SATA port set to be the primary boot device. So now I'm not sure if it's just the USB 3.0 jumper pin area that is bad or shorted or what. But when i plug the drive in after the computer is booted, the drive is detected and works fine.  I haven't checked to see if it will do the same thing to the rear USB3.0 ports or even the 2.0 ports. Or to see if different USB harddrives have the same effect.   What do you do with yours? All I have is the paddle, the dough hook, and the whisk, and my paddle is a pain because I'm constantly needing to use my spatula to scrape the sides and that isn't so easy with really thick dough stuffs   Instead of blurring it's making the orange glowing line solid and thick:  http://i.imgur.com/J79Wn.png  Where before it was working just fine in an earlier iteration of the project:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXrVLClU4WIfeature=youtu.be  *edit* I fixed the problem, but I'm still wondering why it did that. What I had was an entire PSD project imported into After Effects with all editable layer styles. I don't know why the gaussian blur would do that just because the layer styles were intact. What I had to do was import that layer separately as footage and merge the layer styles and then after that it blurred properly.                     What is the best thing that you experience or happened to you this year?               If it is how much more water am I supposed to add compared to what I would add for bleached flour?  I always thought there really wasn't a difference between whole wheat flour and bleached flour                  First off I'll mention it is a Verizon Galaxy Nexus. I know there are some LTE radio problems with the Verizon version but after using it for about a week I haven't experienced any of the problems I've read people coming across.   This phone just feels fantastic. I got it used from someone who ended up needing to get an iPhone for work because it was all Apple integrated stuff. Phone is practically brand new, with an Incipio case and the extended battery.   But now I'm wondering, what reasons could I possibly have to switch to a custom ROM like let's say CM10? What are the benefits of using CM10 over the version of JellyBean I have on the phone? Or any other ROM for that matter?  I am going to root it just because it's a useful thing to have be done, but I just don't know what improvements a custom ROM will have.   About 2 years ago my monitor started acting up and then it finally just stopped working entirely. I read that it was common for the problem to be blown capacitors and it was an easy fix, so I opened it up and took everything apart, found some bulging capacitors and took a note of the specifications of each one. Then I went to mouser.com and ordered replacement capacitors. The replacement parts arrived but then I delayed fixing it because I didn't have a soldering iron at the time. I kept delaying it every time I had free time to get a soldering iron I'd be like meh I'll do it later. A year or so went by and I still hadn't fixed it. The stand was still sitting on my desk, the board was still on my desk, and the rest of the monitor sat on my floor.   I then finally went and got a soldering iron from Radio Shack as well as some solder, and then again I put it off day after day, week after week, month after month. Finally yesterday while cleaning up the room I decided TODAY is the day. I got out my replacement parts, opened up my soldering iron and I went to down. All in about a half hour I had completely replaced all the bad capacitors and was ready to plug everything in and see if it worked, and it did! It worked perfectly as if it were brand new. So I put everything back together and the part that surprised me is that I remembered where each and every screw went. I was afraid I would have forgotten after 2 years of having it completely dismantled.  So here I am, with my old 2nd monitor again, satisfied with life. Here's a small album of pictures  http://imgur.com/a/2n0OT#0  So, Reddit, what are you proud of that you fixed instead of replaced?   I see more than one thing wrong here:  Firstly, he's interfering with someone's class, which he shouldn't be doing.  Secondly, he's making assumptions. Somehow he was under the impression that the students were not prepared to put the play on, and yet he had no proof of this. He has no idea how much work had been put into the play. It had been in planning since about the second week of school. If he thought they weren't prepared, he shouldn't have waited until the night everything was supposed to go down to cancel it.  His personal feelings is that the play would reflect poorly on the English department, but in reality, him being a class A jerk is what will reflect poorly on not only his department, but him too. This is not how a department should be run, everyone in the play was genuinely excited for tonight, and to step on that is just wrong down to the very core. I'm involved in the play in two ways. I know people actually in the play and they are extremely upset about it being cancelled because Gaines has no idea how much work was actually put into the play. The second thing is my boss's company is one of the sponsors for the play. It was just a little thing but to have his gesture of goodwill be for nothing is a direct slap in the face by Dr. Gaines.  I'm currently drafting a letter which I will send to him, the dean of the College of Letters and Science, and President Cruzado. Even if you hadn't heard of the play, or you did and weren't planning on attending, please contact these three people and tell them how you feel about this situation. Dr. Gaines needs to know what he did was wrong and he should be made to retract his decision and allow the play to happen.  * [Dr. Philip Gaines' contact info](http://www1.english.montana.edu/faculty/gaines-philip.html) * [Dean of College of Letters and Science, Paula Lutz. Her info is in the bottom left of the page](http://www.montana.edu/lettersandscience/) * [President Cruzado](http://www.montana.edu/president/)  Please spread the word about this. The university we attend should ***not*** act this way.   I really wish I could go over but I absolutely cannot right now so are there some ways I can cut some corners while keeping the 250gb SSD? Was hoping to upgrade my PC I bought last year with the bigger SSD and putting the old 128 in the new PC.

Adding in the instant discounts, it's $848.33. Adjusting the price for the items I'm getting off of Amazon (the PSU and case) the price is 814.77. I need to get just below $780. All items have to have free shipping, amazon prime, or shoprunner qualifications so that I don't have to spend money on shipping. Everything on Amazon is free 2 day on my list and everything on Newegg in the cart so far is shoprunner.   Basically all I need to do is shave $40 off the build. What can I do to accomplish that? I can't change the case, it needs to be that one to work. Should I just buy most of it and wait to get some other items? I can temporarily put a stick of ram in my current PC into the new one but cutting out the RAM only brings the price down by $25.      sup   Are they gonna be broadcasting it on local over the air channels again?

Basically for this computer, I want to use it as my HTPC but I also want it to be able to play games. Nothing super fancy at ultra graphics and super resolutions, just basically be capable of playing most modern games at a decent framerate   I'm not very familiar with mid-range products and what is better than what, especially when it comes to new mid-range stuff versus old top of the line parts.  The $800 has to include an SSD and a PVR, I was most likely going to go with the Happauge PVR2 Gaming Edition since it has HDMI inputs and I'd rather deal with HDMI than with Component. Does anyone have experience with dealing with PVRs? Can I just split the output from my AV Receiver and send one line to the TV and one to the PVR so I don't have to individually connect my PS3 and 360 to the PVR whenever I want to use it?  Ideally I'd like the computer to be small so it's semi-portable and sit horizontally. I'm thinking maybe a Micro ATX motherboard with a case that can fit at least 2 standard harddrives and an SSD.      I was downloading and at first it got stuck on "starting repair" but didn't do anything. It threw the download back up into the active downloads but it wasn't going anywhere. So I paused it and other stuff started to download like normal, but this particular download is still on top of the downloaded saying "starting repair." I'm on a slower PC and needless to say par2.exe and sab were taking up quite a bit of resources because of this. So I ended up having to kill the processes. After I restarted sab it began to verify the files and got to 34/34 and then said repair failed not enough blocks. Other items are continuing to download but this still remains on the top taking up resources. I can't remove the nzb at all, it just stays there.  This is what I see:  [Downloading section](http://i.imgur.com/F8GAX.png)  [Hisory](http://i.imgur.com/zZnNu.png)   It was a great place to post those catch-all type posts that don't specifically belong in a subreddit. I mean Reddit started out with no subreddits, but then after a while they got rid of the main reddit, why do such a thing?   My secondary job is that one to two nights a week I sit on a bus at night to basically make sure drunk people don't cause problems. It's mostly funded through the university here and is meant to reduce drunk driving. It earned the name "The Drunk Bus" but for some reason the student organization at the university thinks that's below them and wants that negative connotation gone, even though that is 100% the purpose of this bus. So we've taken it upon ourselves to turn it into the party bus!  When the bars close at 2am, we get a pile of drunk people on the bus, so I'm putting music onto my old Zune that would be appropriate for a bus full of drunk people to play over the speakers. What are must haves?  So far my list:  * most stuff by Journey  * most stuff by Queen  * The Final Countdown  * Wagon Wheel by Old Crow Medicine Show  * popular Lonely Island songs  * Party Rock Anthem  * [I'm a Bird Mutha@#$!% (gonna try this one out)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRWxlYXS6W0)      http://www.facebook.com/TumbleweedsTruck?fref=ts  They have some fantastic food, so if you've never had it, check it out!   And while we're at it, the Bozeman city commission (read: Business owners who think food trucks are a threat to them who are in the pockets of Bozeman city commission) are trying to ban food trucks from downtown. If you like food trucks and want to see more of them, let the city commission know. Tell them how you feel that food trucks should stay  http://www.bozeman.net/City-Government/Commission#.UHxdL8XA-g4         It seems like I can never make a craft that has enough lift to actually take off before the end of the runway, and then 90% of the time I catch something after I go off that ledge and blow an engine off or something.  And then by the time I actually do get into the air with something, I don't feel like there are proper wing physics. I end up going into an unstoppable lengthwise spin and crash into the ocean  I just don't know what to do to keep the plane steady in the air, any help?      A business on 19th was broken into and I think was set on fire. There were firetrucks there all night tonight. On top of that Journey Church was also set on fire and it looks like the whole building is burnt to a crisp.   I was listening to the police scanner while riding the bus (it's my job) and they increased patrols tonight, especially near businesses. Thry were looking for someone or a group all night using spotlights and flashlights to either find them or deter them from breaking into more businesses.                  For me it would have to be custom rules for word prediction/autocorrect in swiftkey. I love this keyboard to death but there are a few quirks that annoy the tar out of me. When I type just "i" I would like it to autocorrect to I every single time... Sometimes it doesn't. It would also help with contractions. I sometimes type "I'm" or "I'd" or "I'll"  yet when I type "im", "Im", "id", "Id", "ill", or "Ill", the contractions are nowhere to be seen. When I just type "I" I am only given one of the contractions to choose from and sometimes none. It would be a thousand times easier for me to type if I can make custom rules because despite the pattern learning it doesn't seem to get what I want to type.   What are your must have features for your favorite apps?            I am so sick of bicyclists being all over the road riding at like 15mph, making illegal turns and lane changes, running stop signs and ignoring traffic lights. The wife and I almost got T-Boned in our brand new truck because a bicyclist felt that stop signs didn't apply to him.   If there is one thing I love about winter here it's that it keeps 95% of these dumbasses off the road.   I got two, one I intended to replace using a full PC for my media center and instead reduce it to NAS status. How does using XBMC on a Raspberry Pi compare to anything else?   I have a couple of games I want to play but I don't want to pay $5 for the app if I am certain game won't work on my phone or tablet.   I was thinking it would be cool to get a group of us together and hike up one of the couple hundred day-hike trails in the area and have a picnic/fish. Post if you're interested and we can try to get something together within the next couple of weeks!      Stay safe out there guys and make sure to completely put your fires out when you are camping, we don't need anymore people being evacuated from their homes.   A place my wife + friends really want to rent is through them and I'm wanting to know if people have had good or neutral experiences with them. I looked for reviews online and all of them were bad but it seems like most of the problems could have been avoided by documenting the place better when they moved in. But it is also my understanding that it is far more common for people to make the effort to post negative reviews than positive ones. Pretty much all the rental companies in bozeman have exclusively negative reviews online.                     I find myself always annoyed by rain. It seems to happen too often and for too long. Almost every time I come up from my mines it's raining. Every time I start a new project or building, it's raining. Whenever I die far away from spawn or my bed, it's dark and raining. So if you were given a way to end it all, would you take it? No I'm not offering something in the way of a mod, I always play online so a mod wouldn't do much good except for optifine where I can turn visually seeing the rain off. I'm just wondering if there are many people out there like me.  *edit* Yes I know there are single player commands and yes I know toomanyitems and notenoughitems have an option to turn off rain, and yes I know you can disable the particles with optifine. I'm not talking about a 3rd party solution, I'm talking first party solution, as in, vanilla minecraft has an option to disable rain like they do for clouds.      The *only* semi-viable alternative to Verizon here is ATT and that's only because they just own Alltell's old towers now. Verizon still has the best signal in the area, and besides, there's no hope for me to get unlimited by switching to ATT.  So does anyone have any advice for what I can do? The big problem for me is that my upgrade is a year out, so I can't use any upgrade pricing to get a 4g phone. And on top of that, we don't even have 4G/LTE in our area yet. Last I heard we would have it late this year or early next year but I'm afraid that if I buy a 4g phone in order to keep my unlimited, not only will I be eating the cost of buying a phone at retail pricing, but I'll also be paying an extra $10/mo for service I don't even have.  What do, Android?    Or should I say I have none. Not 100% sure what to do in this situation.  It was an illegal left turn, I turned left onto a street with 2 lanes on each side and went to the far lane instead of the closest lane. It was my first traffic ticket and I got it deferred over 2 years ago.   I always seem to catch them too late when there's already several hundred or thousand comments so my question just gets buried in the abyss.      The other day I opened my mailbox to find what could either be a child support billing statement, invoice, or receipt. It was meant for my neighbor. Luckily we have clips on our doors at our apartment complex so I didn't have to have to awkwardly give it to them in person, I just clipped it to their door and went along my way.      I can't find if there are any restrictions on this or if there are exceptions for the restrictions. I might be getting a place where there will be 4 of us, but in a year my brother is going to be graduating high school and moving up here for college and will be wanting to live with me and not on campus. Is it possible to have 5 tenants in a home?   Am I the only one who finds this hilarious?      Just beat City yesterday. Seriously these the most well done superhero games I've ever played. Obviously this couldn't have been a Batman game without Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill playing as Batman and The Joker. Both games are really great at showing off how dark the Batman universe can be while still being the typical campy Batman we all know. They went to lengths to really make sure Batman doesn't kill anyone. When you do a ledge takedown you think he's just gonna toss them over the edge but he manages to tie them to the ledge and they just hang there. And when you knock people out, in Detective Mode they are shown as unconscious. And then obviously you have everything bat related, the batarang, when he sprays explosive gel he does it in the shape of a bat, his computer is called the Batcomputer.  What I was really impressed with is your encounter with multiple of the big bad guys in the Batman universe. You're trapped in Arkham Asylum or Arkham City with just about every bad guy and his henchmen who want Batman dead. It's like the equivalent of throwing a normal person into a pit of rabid wolves. And in usual Batman fashion, not a single fuck is given and he defeats everyone. Along the way your suit gets torn up to reflect how much shit he has been through in a single night.  If you like Batman even the slightest, and maybe if you don't like Batman so much, you should give this game a go if you haven't already, it's well worth the time. I did everything possible in Arkham Asylum except the challenge mode, and I'm working on doing all the side stuff in City now.      I'm looking for a second job but I'd like to be doing something where I'm doing some sort of physical activity and not a job where I'm standing/sitting most of the day. Full time is also a bonus   I've been noticing my internet on my phone being exceptionally slow lately so I did a few speed tests today and yesterday. So far the best download I got was around 400kbps, and my upload constantly hovers around 600kbps. Is anyone else experiencing these horrible speeds?  	146
 Ouch. Maybe you'll find some middle ground that works for both of you?   Oh dang. Good to know. Thanks for the replies, it's been very enlightening (since I was considering JET myself).    Is that amount of money a living wage in Japan? And I'm assuming you enjoy your job/stay in Japan?   Ouch, sorry to hear about that.   If/when you do take her out, does she liven up after a while?

Are you on JET? If so, would you say it's worth it?      Reddit Enhancement Suite   Bill Wi the science Fi   "Allahu akbar"   I was lost while trying to get to a late evening meeting in Melbourne (I was an exchange student). My phone's GPS didn't work abroad, and I didn't have the sense to print a map before leaving. I had no idea where I was or which direction to go in, so I ask a random person on the street for directions. He says I'm about five miles from where I need to be, and there aren't tram that could take me there. He offers me a ride, which despite being super weird, I accept. I would have been late otherwise.   In his car we got a bit conversation going. I asked him what he does. He was the [mayor of Yarra City](http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/Your-Council/Councillors/cr-geoff-barbour-mayor/). I was dumbfounded. Awesome guy. He was up for re-election, so I made sure to tell my Aussie pals about this encounter (some of whom called bullshit).  tldr; lost in Melbourne City, got ride from random stranger who turned out to be the mayor.   Sheeple.   I owe it to him to never stop searching. But what if he didn't actually throw the ball?   I agree with this. There's too much government secrecy as is. That said, the issue of politicians blindly voting along party lines is still one that needs to be addressed, as well as the issue of politicians not understanding what they're voting for (my favorite example is [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/florida-banned-computers_n_3561701.html)).   This way, uninformed politicians would be kept out of blindly voting along party lines. As an added bonus, you'd be able to see which politicians are roadkill (i.e. not reading anything, thereby not voting on anything).  The quiz would likely need to be created by professional lawpersons, and would need to be kept in strict secrecy for this to work.     Belgium here. If you see someone you don't usually see (i.e. someone not from work/school/etc) three times in a day, you must go drinking with them that evening.

 It also helps that Catholicism is rather liberal compared to many other Protestant groups. What would be really surprising is if we see more Protestant churches saying similar things.   Why wait when you can do it yourself? http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/surprising-history-powdered-alcohol-180951278/?no-ist   Side question: what's the average age for an active Navy Seal? How long are they "under contract" for? I'd imagine that this kind of continuous training isn't very good for you even if you reach 30...   I don't smoke marijuana, but I think that prohibition-wise it has to be consistent. If you're going to ban marijuana then drugs that cause equal or higher impairment should be banned. Alcohol is a great example of this. You either ban both, or neither.   OP wants a lil cuppa tea afterward   It's actually on FOX.   First hottest: Olivia Wilde?   Southland was great. I loved how they showed how his personality changed over the seasons. Too bad it didn't get a large audience...      That was only six days ago? Felt like months....   So, this may sound a little out there, but... you could bring more than one sheet per person to a hot tub......   Shit, I can't do math late at night. I meant 2^x, which is exponential.   It's stupid because the number of people you have to study is the number of generations squared. You could study mtDNA and Y, but that is a very small subset. And let's not even get into the whole issue of migratory patterns and population mixing. Sure, you can make general statements about certain groups as a whole (eg. there has been recent studies on Jewish migration out from the Middle East), but to claim geographical pinpoint is absurd and downright misleading.  You can claim where a population as a whole have migrated over time **on average**, but it's another thing to claim something about one person.   I mean, they were the first "democracy" but let's be realistic. When you have brawls in the legislature in the 1990s you're setting the bar pretty low.   Because it's fucking delicious.   I'm as "pro-Ukraine" as most others, but you have to admit... when a building is surrounded, molotoving/torching the place is not a great way to gain sympathy.   I think it's likely they'll expand on the MW/BO theme of playing the bad guys for brief portions of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if half the game you play as PMC and half the game was US forces.   As an older guy who cannot play multiplayer because he'll get his ass kicked, I've always played for the SP campaigns. They're also a bargain if you wait until they're on sale. Ghosts had a really interesting plotline and gameplay, but the problem was that it was too short.   Some part of California is pretty much on fire during the summer. I'm surprised that the state hasn't been more proactive in fighting drought, given all the state money that goes towards fighting these things.   I tried out the newer Nokia phones at a Verizon store the other day. As a quick comparison to the other flagships, I would say that in terms of what I most use a phone for (messaging), the keyboards blow away the stock keyboard on the Moto X and is as good if not better than that on the S4/S5. Some people really like the stock Android keyboard but I find it rather difficult to use (I also like the Blackberry Z10 keyboard, so YMMV). The WP interface is nice and fluid, but feels rather barren. Text is way too big for what I need and information is very "not dense".   Ghosts actually had a pretty fun SP campaign -- quite a lot of varied gameplay and was setting up a new universe -- but it was too short compared to the other CoD games. I think I finished it in one or two casual sittings. Let's hope this one lasts longer!   Apparently for Mark Cuban, it's only "un-American" if you're coercing a "job creator".   In recent history Putin has done exactly the opposite of what American analysts said he would do. I think it's pretty safe to say that we can just play The Opposite Game and we would have Putin's complete strategy.   And how is that different from prison guards in real life? Do you think guards do not actively play out fantasies where they are in a powerful position, or do not take cues enabling abuse from their superiors?    I would be a bit more optimistic and say that's slowly changing now. Especially with the advent of "big data" like in genomics, more and more statisticians are entering biology and demonstrating the use of confounding variables and "cage effects" for animal models. The basic problem was that historically sample sizes were so low that researchers didn't feel the need to or could not filter their datasets against secondary variables. Many were just not trained in these techniques at all, but newer crops of scientists are.   The large coffee (20oz?) would then be approximately the same price as a Starbucks Venti. If you're normalizing for caffeine content per dollar then it's not even a contest. If you're in a major Canadian city I don't think you'll have a problem finding a Starbucks or even a local coffee shop with better beverages for similar pricing, but I guess if you're on a road trip then Timmy Ho's might be your only option.   Canadian here. Why do people like Timmy Ho's so much? That place is disgusting. The coffee is watered down and sandwiches are basically no better than prepackaged.   Where do you put your used floss and other unflushables if you never noticed you had a trashcan in the bathroom?   Why not ginger? One of the best anti-nauseants besides marijuana and you're not rotting your teeth.   Whatever guys, I loved CoD Ghosts. I bought it heavily discounted, which probably helped. The biggest black mark that I can give against it was that the campaign was too short. It took me 2 days to beat, whereas Splinter Cell Blacklist took me at least 5x longer with a more engaging plot.   You make a great point, but it still makes me think about how the American military's logistic machine is basically subsidizing that of its allies. Nations ask the US for logistic support *all the time* and yet they pay very little or nothing for it. Wouldn't it be more fair to create an international force for this (eg. UN-based), or for each country to invest in similar capability, or even allow the US to send another country a bill for services rendered?         I think the big difference, like you said, is "focus". For someone who is good on the keyboard, it's way too easy to zone out and just transcribe on a laptop. On the other hand, people write much slower and have to focus and condense before they write.   Just wanted to point out that it's okay to show up to a party alone, have a few beers and conversations with a few people, and then politely leave. At least, during my late 20s (I just turned 30) that was perfectly accepted. In college people used to call you lame if you left a party at 10pm. People my age now have jobs and other commitments, and we appreciate that you took the time to even come out for a drink. We also don't hold it against you if you don't show up, so don't feel any pressure to come if you don't want to!  Part of being extroverted is realizing that everyone just wants to feel comfortable and wants their peers to feel the same way. Unless you are with a group of assholes, nobody is judging you. Even strangers are ultimately interested in facilitating a good time, because embarrassment for you is an awkward situation for them.   This was my strategy as I turned into a young adult after college (because being an undergrad does NOT count as actual adulthood). When I got older though, "not giving a fuck" got refined to "being carefree". I'm 30 now, and there are a lot of important social cues and lessons that people need to pay attention to and "give a fuck" about. The rest deserve neither sweat nor tears.   Google Talk was an awesome lightweight client until it started integrating with Hangouts. It would boot up instantly on my old Gingerbread phone, but now it takes at least 3-4 minutes to even get to a typing stage in Hangouts. Also as the video chat capabilities got better, it started getting more and more flaky -- sound randomly not working, and thrashes the CPU to 100% during a webcam session. Not to mention that it now pops out to a new window for a video chat with no way to pop it back into gmail, meaning that the option to multitask was completely eliminated.   You should listen to Dinosaur Jr. They were part of the late 80s/early 90s grunge movement and are still around making great music.   I don't think it's as simple as the quantity of oil production. My skin returned to being extremely oily but I don't get the severe nodular kind that I used to have.   My skin was dry as fuck when I took accutane for five months for extremely inflammed nodular acne. When I stopped (~4 years ago), my skin returned to being extremely oily. No more acne though, except in recent years but those are just occasional little mild things.  I still had extremely inflammed pustules on my scalp, and a doctor suggested that it might be seborrheic dermatitis. Coal tar and salicylic acid shampoos didn't do anything. I even stopped using hair products for a month. About two months ago I decided to use the "clinical strength" Head and Shoulders with selenium disulfide. Boom. In two days it was completely gone and I haven't had anything since.  So in short, my oily skin did come back, but it appears that something changed about it that prevented the growth of severe acne on my face.   What about things like visual programming paradigms like LabVIEW and related platforms? You could make each of those modules secure and follow good standards, and these could be the building bricks for larger applications.   I don't think that's the case. The IRS already knows almost everything about you and the eligibility criteria for most tax breaks, so prefilling it would work for 90% of the families that make a salary and do a light bit of investment.   It doesn't matter -- if you are a regular Joe that makes a salary, the government already knows how much you make. Your employer also sends out its own W2 records to the US government. For many investments, the government by tax day knows how much money was cashed or moved around before you even submit the form. Even 1099s get submitted to the IRS too, so I'm not even sure why there is even a need for "adjustment" if they mail you a 1040. That should only be in the 1% of cases and even then you'd think the IRS would apply all possible tax breaks to you because *it knows everything about you already and knows all the eligibility criteria for every single tax break*.  It's just inefficiency at its worst. In places like Spain they just mail you a card that says "This is what we think you owe or what we will give you back. If it's correct then don't do anything."   Energy and telecom are the two biggest industries to be privatized when I was growing up in Canada.   I've had those comments too -- I think that some deodorants probably have a much stronger scent than cologne.   I think it really depends on the woman. It's a pretty light fragrance, but some prefer the musky kind.   Also, no makeup is infinitely preferable to your face being completely monotone/flat. You need to know how to use the blush/etc otherwise you'll just look like a ghost.   Coal plants spread more "radioactively active" isotopes than every nuclear reactor ever made.   To be fair, we have no way of knowing what this person does during tax season. For all we know he or she could be getting a big fat refund from the US government.   Also, many doctors give out antibiotics prophylactically for those who have a medical history of secondary bacterial infections.   The difference is also that it's also infinitely easier to delete an entire directory in Unix by typoing. Most people use File Explorer with Windows.  For me though, it's way easier to accidentally move a lot of files/folders somewhere in Windows. Especially with a flaky trackpad or mouse.   I don't think people realized how variable crop yields were before the advent of industrial agriculture and now GMO. Developing countries would literally go into famine in one bad year. And those who advocate intensive farming, most of these farmers also hold second jobs as supplemental income. Intensive farming is hard to implement because they simply don't have the time for it unless you're promoting a perpetual class of farmers.   Not to mention that *seed quality* is extremely variable, so no farmer who is worried about year-to-year yield would pile their "natural" seeds together willy-nilly. Not only are farmers paying for resistant seeds, they also pay Monsanto for the QC.   That's not quite correct. Even if life elsewhere required oxygen for large organisms, there are a variety of methods to liberate it from existing compounds.   Personally, I believe that it's very possible that life could be *everywhere* where there is liquid water (because it is polar and conducive to a lot of chemical reactions). The reason is because many planets have energy sources -- whether it be from the sun or from geothermal energy or nuclear heating. Likewise, life was thought to have started from geothermal vents on Earth. I believe that all you really need is a source of energy, water (or any medium to conduct chemical reactions) and the basic elements which are already abundant in the universe, and life will find a way to emerge. You're talking about billions of years, so it's not out of the imagination to think of bacterial organisms with enzymes that break down compounds to make oxygen; which then evolved to much larger ones.  Case in point: how cool would it be to have bacterial organisms that evolved to break down *water* into its constitutive elements? You would create a proton gradient to generate energy, and oxygen for respiration and chemical reactions. Then you can take that evolutionarily in so many directions.   This is fucking stupid. What's next? The USA is going to refuse F1 and J1 visas for students/postdocs/visiting professors? Leave politics to politicians. You're unnecessarily punishing scientists and astronauts, people who have exactly zero influence in public policy and have zero clout with regards to events in the Ukraine.   It's quite telling (and quite shocking!) when the only complaint about Windows 8 is the UX. Everything else about it is practically perfect. It boots up in seconds. It's fast and stable. There are just so many glaring design issues that make it such a tragic operating system. I use the OS on my primary computer and I have never used a single live tile. I've tried using the Metro apps but they never made any sense to me.   So nothing's changed since the 1990s?   So basically, the 1990s.   How many of their artillery and shells do you think are still functional? How many of them have been properly maintained over the past 60 years? Quality matters over quantity. Similarly how many of their rifles do you think can function in a real firefight? How many of their starving soldiers can actually function as effective infantry? It's probably pretty pathetic.   Afghanistan failed to "rebuild" for reasons that North Korea will never face. NK doesn't have rampant tribalism, ridiculously low literacy rates (which is surprisingly high in NK), random acts of terrorism, etc.   Definitely check out the related links if you want to get into the weird part of youtube.   What the fuck. Sirius black is Gary Oldman?!   Then why don't you do just that -- take out a line of credit to pay off your student loan? It's almost stupid not to, considering that the cost of education in Canada (where I grew up and went to college) can be pretty minimal so the size of the line of credit wouldn't even be that big.   People who proactively see the doctor about ailments have better health outcomes. This means they effectively reduce the burden on the total system by not waiting until the last minute to go to the ER or until something requires major surgery. If you can pre-emptively treat it at your PCP then you save the government fuck-ton of money.    People who are comparing Iraq and Afghanistan to Crimea are also totally missing the point. Say whatever you want about false pretexes and oil, but economic extraction and occupation are completely different than outright annexation. The United States is not interested in absorbing countries, but would rather use economic hegemony to influence countries. The rhetoric also matters here: Putin is using nationalist language in order to outright turn these countries into *a part of Russia*. This means being subject to Russian laws and (lack of) civil rights including things like freedom of speech. What if you were a Crimean journalist or a gay-rights activist? It might be rare, but let's extrapolate that to Eastern Ukraine or the rest of the Baltics.  The United States allowed Afghanistan and Iraq to form their own constitution, set of laws, and have elections. Sure, they may have had a hand in influencing them but for the most part they left the details of governing to the people there.  This is even worse than during the Cold War, when the US and USSR were setting up puppet states across the world. They were part of respective economic and governmental cooperative spheres, but participating states could by and large do their own thing. What Russia is doing today is much more aggressive regardless of whether he intends for Crimea to be an "autonomous" region or not. It sets a dangerous precedent for the neighboring regions.   The whole argument for armed guards everywhere is completely ridiculous. The fact is that the USA is one of the safest places in the world to live. It's the media that's inflating the fear of violent death. Violent crime is typically concentrated in bad neighborhoods and ghettos, where the police are reluctant to do anything useful (for various reasons I won't get into here). Violence also is particularly pronounced for certain ethnic groups. If politicians and the police force were actually serious about saving lives, they would actually direct resources to areas where they would have an impact instead of making a big show out of it.   Armed guards will do nothing against terrorism. Remarkably, airports are one of the most safest places on the planet. They are "sanitized" to the point of being slightly disconcerting. If you take a look at how many gun-related incidents (even aggregating for check-in versus boarding area), it is so safe that putting armed guards at every airport is a complete waste of money.  Take the shooting at LAX for instance. What is a better use of money and can save more lives: actually training a better police force and reducing gun deaths in LA proper, where many more people die every day, or putting guards at one of the safest places?   The thing that I like most about TJs is that while the produce quality isn't the greatest, the prices are fair compared to other stores. I live in the Bay Area, and buying something as simple as berries can break your bank if it's at some place other than TJs. They may not last as long or be as fresh as Whole Foods, but they are solid for the price you pay. They sell some non-TJ brand stuff there (off the top of my head they sell a particular brand of cold cut meats and also Nature's Path cereal) and these prices are literally *double* of a grocery store that is 5 minutes away by bike. Same with vegetables like tomatoes, asparagus, spinach, etc. I don't need to pay $6 for each of these items, yet when I shop at any other place that's what they will cost.   The US invades, but that is very different than outright annexation.   Some historical perspective: after WWII, the US was basically last man standing aside from Russia. As the world rebuilt the US was effectively the West's *entire* military arsenal. We were basically taking on the bulk of military spending for Western Europe. This carried on to its present day where American forces are practically subsidizing everyone else's military force.  Nobody is going to "chip in" unless (1) the US significantly reduces its own spending for others to get nervous, or (2) the US signals that it might not defend "friendly" countries. The problem is that nobody seriously thinks that the American military-industrial complex is going anywhere soon, so no country is willing to pay their "fair share".  I hope the Ukrainian situation will shake things up a bit. To me, NATO is basically an American subsidy to another country's defense budget. The reason why American spending is the equivalent of the defense budget of the next 17 countries is that we are basically absorbing the defense budget for countries that "can't afford it" or have decided that other things in their budget are more worthwhile. Therefore it makes a lot of sense for weaker Eastern European countries to join so they won't feel as threatened by Russia. But the US can show a lot of military restraint here, so that these own countries can spend a little bit more to what would be an appropriate contribution to continental defense.   The nanodrop is great at getting a rough idea of a sample's concentration. But if you want something more accurate you should look into something like the Qubit by Invitrogen. It can do DNA, RNA, and protein samples too. Many labs use it for next-gen sequencing as it's very sensitive to loading amounts and it's really unparalleled.   I used to own an LG Voyager and my gf still uses and env2. Those things are tanks. I complain all the time about how my smartphone is now so laggy, but those things just power through with no lag. Very responsive. Even the shitty web browser didn't freeze half the time on a webpage, which was great for briefly reading the news. I miss those days when you didn't have to wait for anything on a phone.   There are also many access programs for people who can't afford the drug -- some are even administered by the drug company themselves. It's not all roses, but intense lobbying by patient advocates in the past 30 years has really improved drug access.   Unfortunately, the actual discovery of the drug costs much less than the amount of money dragging it through trials. Sure, most initial ideas for medicines come from NIH grants but it takes a lot more to commercialize it.   If you had a time machine, you should move to China! It was crazy back in the day, especially in Beijing. There's still a lot of bicycles now, but many more cars too.   LOL @ 6:30   Certainly the bulk of the virus is in the Congo/CAR, but for example Nigeria and Ghana are at the tips of the giant hotspot where Ebola and other viruses live. Ghana is actually doing pretty well compared to the rest of Africa, and Nigeria has a growing oil economy and is slated to be the next wave of "BRIC" countries to fight out of poverty. If you look at a map Guinea is much farther west than where Ebola infections typically occur, which is actually very disconcerting.  Generally speaking, many African countries have been enjoying steady growth in the past decade. There are definitely a few that have systemic problems/are a total shitshow, but people are definitely not as pessimistic as in the 1990s.   Edit: here is a nice quickie http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart   Why? Near the Ebola hotspots there are many countries that are developing very well. In 10 years many of them will be in pretty OK shape -- like South Korea when things were starting to take off.  Edit: not sure why people are downvoting my optimism for the African continent. It's a known fact that many African nations nowadays are doing much better than in the 80s and 90s. http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart I guess stereotypes about developing the continent die hard...   There sure a lot of conspiracy theorists and cynics on reddit who think that the US dominance in the world is somehow without a strong foundation and can come crashing down at any point. Many countries have tried going toe-to-toe economically and have failed, and even more have practically collapsed when the US dipped into a recession.  The "age of American decline" is total horseshit. In fact, the world is disconcertingly getting more and more dependent on the US economy.  As to your point about China: in complete contrast to Russia, which turned into a shitshow grab for power in the collapse of the Soviet Union, China is now run by a bunch of technocrats and a rolling roster of them at the top. Compared to Russia they may both be brutal, but China is prudent and Russia is brash.   It's pretty much a guarantee that once Africa fights its way out of poverty (10-30 years from now), Ebola will be a much bigger issue. Hopefully scientists here will have the foresight to spend more on researching it, instead of waiting around like Malaria.   There is a lot of talk about Canada's plans to sell their oil to China if the Keystone pipeline doesn't go through. I think there's already talk of them building a pipeline to the Pacific coast to ship oil there. I think that China would prefer to buy from Canada, considering they tend to stay out of most countries' affairs and Russia is not exactly economically stable. That and there are huge amounts of Chinese financial interest in Canada in the form of real estate and stakes in other natural resource companies.   I don't think P2P streaming video would ever work except for the most popular videos -- the ridiculous upload throttles set by ISPs basically ensure that there will never be enough bandwidth to go around. It will never scale up. On the other hand, the distribution infrastructure doesn't suffer from this problem.   Something I've always wondered about tamago: if it's truly made like how it is in the video, how does the first part of the tamago (which is in the middle by the end of the clip) not be completely overcooked by the time the brick is finished?   I'm not even sure that it's catering to fans at this point. Marvel has created lots of *new* superhero moviegoers in the past few years. Captain America was never really an A-list comic book hero, either. I think Marvel's just very good at making good movies, despite the fact that every large studio on the planet is absolutely terrible at it when they are given a large amount of content control.      In fact, I think the only Asians to eat things off a plate with a chopstick are probably Koreans and Japanese. It's starting to move into Chinese culture but it's still very awkward to eat food without a bowl. Even SE Asia use forks and spoons because of their colonized past.   Whaaaat? 5:1?! I have cooked long and short grain rice all my life -- in a stovetop and in a rice cooker -- and I have never used as much as 5:1. You might be setting your heat up too high if you need that much water. Long grain rice is perfect at around 2:1 or even slightly lower if you like it firm.   Most of the other European countries are all talk at this point. They are desperate for Russian gas and are terrified of their economy. But Merkel knows Germany can hold its own and actually has some balls to throw some sanctions and tough words to Russia. Germany and Russia can have an economic fistfight and it wouldn't even be fair, as the former has a diverse and healthy economic foundation while the latter constantly flirts with disaster.   I think some world governments had a pretty good clue of where to look but were holding back their capability to give the Malaysians a chance to sort it out themselves.   Not in the same timeline though, so I don't think it counts!   I think they got the tone of ASM right. He was playing a high school kid, so that means a part of their target audience would be young teenagers too. The movies grow up with the target audience. I feel like the Harry Potter movies really did this right, but obviously they're not going to make 7 Spider Man movies in the same timeline.   Are you kidding me? I guess that's worse than one that I've heard recently: many CS grads can't code a basic main() function in C++.   I don't understand what Putin was thinking. In the medium to long term, it was likely that Crimea would anyway separate from Ukraine after the "revolution". There were a million other things he could have done besides send in troops and hold a snap referendum that wouldn't result in alienating everyone.   Check out Biomatrica.   But why aren't there more "processed green vegetable" foods? There is some nutrient loss, but not a whole lot when you are looking at what you get versus eating hamburgers and fries all day. The only ones I can think of are veggie chips and smoothie drinks, but not many more.   Atheist here, but just want to chime in: I think it's pretty clear from the quote in the parent comment that "just and perfect" should be interpreted in a metaphysical sense. Life on Earth is flawed, but the afterlife in heaven is where these ideal characteristics are manifested and can be experienced.   The Aussie radar system is pretty damn good too. I'd be wagering that Western intelligence is already analyzing what happened on their own, especially since there could have been a terror/national security element to the disappearance.   It's not WWII. A war with Russia will be over very quickly. The Russian military has declined dramatically since the Cold War, while American spending has risen. If we are speaking solely on conventional warfare, you have 20+ countries fighting one. If the ME starts to get involved (Syria's hands are tied at the moment), you have basically Israel and Saudi Arabia versus Iran. Neither of these are anywhere near fair fights and all of the countries who will be on the receiving end of a beatdown know that.    People are appalled at why the USA is so cozy with Saudi Arabia, but the fact is that they were probably the most important, if not the only, factor that led to the collapse of the USSR. The US will never forget that -- for better or worse they will be bros for a long period of time.   Russia isn't the USSR or any kind of other rogue state. If its economy collapses the government will lose popular support. Russians will be smart enough to see that war will not fix an economy. They saw that 25 years ago and many people are still alive from that era. The only reason Putin still gets any kind of popular support with Ukraine is because they are still "doing okay" economically, but citizens will turn on their leaders when that disappears regardless of how strong the military is. Millions of Russians and Eastern Europeans died in WWII and the Cold War, so they are not eager for a larger conflict.   I don't think you understand how cell phones work. They are not satellite phones. They communicate with a tower on the ground. A phone the size of your hand doesn't have enough power to transmit to a cell phone tower 30000ft (almost 10 miles) away, especially when towers can be optimized to transmit horizontally instead of vertically.   See the comment in this thread. Why is this chain of thought (toxin for bugs means we shouldn't be eating it!!) so prevalent? There are so many cases where certain foods or molecules are terrible for one species but fine for humans. One great example is that dogs will die if you give them chocolate, but the only effect it has on humans is getting fat.   Not to mention people think hitting the delete button on your hard drive actually erases something.   Gonna get downvoted to hell for saying this, but I couldn't watch Community anymore because of the same reason. All of the characters became these crazy caricatures that were only funny because they were caricatures. The jokes weren't even very funny anymore -- it was just being quirky for the sake of it. Case in point: the recent youtube video of the Dean rapping in the opening scene. It's only funny because it's random and unexpected, not because of any actual situational humor.   Cuddling.   Where did you buy your coffee? I live in the bay area and I can't even think of a place that charges that much for drip or espresso. The most expensive off the top of my head is Philz Coffee, which is like $2.50 for a small cup of drip.   Holy fuck, they are actually doing this? I wish I could upvote all the people who are on board with that plan. Screwing with Russia's oil and gas economy is the best non-violent way to deal with them. The US finally is showing their economic muscle and balls, unlike Europe who is in the short term unwilling to fight with Russia because of gas.  	107
       Researchers in India have carried out a data mining exercise to determine which are the most important risk factors in increasing the chances of an individual suffering a heart attack. Writing in the International Journal of  Biomedical  Engineering and Technology, they confirm that the usual suspects high blood cholesterol, intake of alcohol and passive smoking play the most crucial role in severe, moderate and mild cardiac risks, respectively.      Australian researchers have found that the majority of weight lost when we do manage to shed the kilos is actually breathed out as carbon dioxide.         Mice and humans share about 95 percent of their genes, and mice are recognized around the world as the leading experimental model for studying human biology and disease.      The term network monitoring can be defined by a system that ceaselessly monitors a network of computers for bad or slow constituents and informs network administrators about the situation via email or any other notifying system. It is an integral part of network management.      In the journal Optica this week, a team of scientists from the Netherlands proposes a security system for credit cards and passports that would leverage the power of quantum physics.      Curiosity rover exploring Mars demonstrate that not only is methane present on Mars, but the planet may also be periodically belching it out.          In the same way as we now connect computers in networks through optical signals, it could also be possible to Opens The Way to Future Quantum Internet      Scientists have created a device that can release a single, precisely shaped photon of light, opening the way to a secure quantum internet that is incredibly powerful and impenetrable to hackers.                                                                                 Feedback from UAT cycles can be fed into subsequent iterations of development, increasing software robustness and usability.      UAT directly involves the intended users of the software. UAT can be implemented by making software available for a free beta trial on the Internet or through an in-house testing team comprised of actual software users.                         Owen Cornec, an engineering student studying in Paris, has released a web browser application called WikiGalaxy that gives using Wikipedia a whole new spin.

 We're still here and the account is still active. Probably not for long. I wish he had listened. Next time one of these is posted I'll make sure to take screen caps.   See? Thank you. Tell this guy to listen!    Jesus Jumpin'. If your dumb ass gets killed because you didn't listen to the one person who knows what's coming, then I 110% support evolutionary theory 'cause that shit will be a prime example of survival of the fittest.   Shit. Okay. Eventually she's going to threaten you if you don't keep typing. She won't speak to you she'll just be reading over your shoulder. Warren called her Mel but I guess maybe he misheard her. Either way you need to get the hell out of there now.   Sure looks like it.    Yeah THAT'S what you should get from that... Warren was her date last night. She made him make the same post and the general consensus says she killed him, posted a few comments, and then deleted the account.   Okay dude seriously. Get out of where you are. Her name is Mel or something right? She's reading over your shoulder, right? Our questions, everything you type? Get a move on. Get out. Or you're going to end up like Warren.   I've only seen one more, but they're real! You didn't imagine them.   http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2jhj7r/hi_my_name_is_warren_ask_me_anything/ Deleted now but it was an identical post. Last night. His name was Warren.    Ask her about Warren and get your affairs in order. Don't drink the beer.   No... she chose to be an ex when the new shiny girl-toy was more interesting than her fiancee (me) was... Loon calls are also creepy as hell. I've heard some odd stuff I couldn't place especially when I lived in the woods. Owls sound like a woman being murdered.    Has there been any news?   I can't find it! I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. Something about someone working late and there being an odd customer or something and then she ends up in the walk in fridge/freezer and then the thing woman whatever took her cellphone and made another post I think.   Well it's raining and I have a cold of some sort but otherwise I'm great. And yourself?   wat?   Ugh. I smoke out my bedroom window at night so I don't have to go outside and now I'm too creeped out.   I assumed the handprints were relevant.    I second the fox theory. I seriously woke up in the middle of the night and made my ex go out with a flashlight because it sounded exactly like a screaming newborn and I couldn't rationalize the noise. I was also terrified (thanks nosleep.) It was a fox standing in the middle of the road in front of my house making the noise.    Hey people who know about doppelgangers! Is it odd for your doppelganger to do things you do, including dating your significant other's doppelganger? I dated a woman for a few years after my son's father and I broke up and we would hear at least twice a week that we had just been wherever we were, or someone had seen us around town while we were actually on vacation, etc.   She's probably gonna kill you. Like that one who ate the girl in the freezer and posted from her cellphone. Nosleep Butler, any help there?   Where would you suggest we don't dig at?   The flower smell makes me think possession. Any family curses or deals with demons we should know about?   Read the sidebar, punk.   Says one comment but see no comment? Confused. Don't answer or answer with "City Morgue, you whack'em we pack'em" or something equally silly. Could also call your phone provider from a different line and see if there's something up on their end.   I totally agree with the things with emotional significance keeping you safe. When I was a kid a lot of strange stuff happened to/around me. My parents got me a dog after my grandfather asked who I was playing with, while I was playing alone in the yard. They won't admit that's why they got her, of course. But I had her for 18 years and when she passed away we had her cremated so she could continue to keep me safe. My room (where her ashes are) is still the safest one in the house.   The anniversary could easily be a stresser for him, causing him to act out of character especially since he wouldn't know exactly what to do with his feelings. Hopefully the doctor's visit shed some light on what's happening. Stay safe OP, and stay strong for your brother. Please keep us updated.   OP if your brother has a regular doctor, I'd contact them and have him seen asap. Something may have scared him and he can't deal with it properly or something. My only experience with autism is my 4 year old nephew so the traits may manifest differently with age, but I know when Evvy is confused or can't process something, he acts VERY strange and sometimes creepy.   Removed cause it's an intro now that I've come back to comment. Update us Op?   I need to know how this turned out! It just.. died off.   Hey OP! Update?   Me too! What was that about?   Am I the only one calling bullshit on the parents reason for moving? They're looking for/running from something. And the date nights are suspicious. And the protecting you and someone yelling "wrong one" right before your parents came in your room, OP. I'm betting your parents know who took your brother and why.   Read this as "Call the poop!" I shouldn't be on here when I'm that tired.   Parent to parent, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I think you may be eating your daughter in the casserole. You should check out/have the cops check out your neighbors.   Dude. Don't hurt /nosleep. Those of us who hang out here take it seriously and we're not hurting anyone else on Reddit by lurking on our own sub. If you don't like it, don't read it. Simple as.   As for your hacker, I'd suggest forgetting your quest to make a bunch of people who deal with demons and stalkers and ghosts, hate you, and you should be pretty safe.   Do the missing letters here and there mean anything? Edit: Too much nosleep. Disregard the question.   Read the title, started singing Barrett's Privateers. "I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, the last of Barrett's Privateers!!"   Thanks for clarifying!   I'd call you a cunt but you don't have the warmth or the depth. Bugger off and leave us with our psychopathy in peace. :)   Take it to your neighbor like he said and wash your hands of the situation!   Maybe yes but maybe no. Don't put too much pressure on her to tell you the truth right now, as that may push her further away, if you know what I mean. But also if you feel you need to know, and she's behaving differently, then I'd suggest continuing to ask her gently.   Yes please! Tell us all the things!   Or there was a bike gang of monsters who interrupted them?   I need to know more! What has happened since?   I'm excited for this to be continued! I have a bunch of those closets in my house. The only one that has a handle on the inside is the one in my bedroom.   So wait. We think Gabe did something awful to her?   But Johnny and shotguns! I second the southern accent.

          Is there a timetable?                                                                                                                           The files listed are as follows:  1. https://wikileaks.org/sony/docs/filelist/01.html 1445 directories, 19156 files  2. https://wikileaks.org/sony/docs/filelist/02.html 27 directories, 3383 files  3. https://wikileaks.org/sony/docs/filelist/05.html 461 directories, 7514 files  4. https://wikileaks.org/sony/docs/filelist/bonus.html 40 directories, 223 files   for a total of 30276 files. I knew there were more files than that (see https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2014/12/a-breakdown-and-analysis-of-the-december-2014-sony-hack/), so I took a closer look.  It appears that only documents are included, based on filenames extensions. It also appears that many documents not in txt format were converted to txt. They were then published twice, once in original format and a second time in txt format. Not all documents, for some reason. So the true amount of documents published now is a little over a half of 30,000.  The following formats are in the list:  * xlsx * pdf * txt * docx  This suggests both that Wikileaks published only "document files", not all files (and horrible reporting by those who don't have a clue), and that they only took from the 01, 02, 05, and bonus filesets.  I'll confirm when I have more time whether any documents from the other sets appear in wikileaks list, as the naming *could* just be a quirk.  (To download all the files yourself, see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/2o8zyd/the_sony_hack_what_we_know_and_dont_know_so_far/cmlnktc).)                                       In most such disagreements, the grown-up is probably right, so I'm interested in hearing the ones in which they weren't.   For bonus points, choose different size hard drives (~1MB would be interesting) and different times to go back to.            AND THEN THERE WAS A SINGLE ARC TAKING UP SEVERAL YEARS! SKIPPING OVER EVENTS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN EVENTS THAT GOT MULTIPLE ARCS! WTF IS GOING ON??!  (Just finished the Bonesaw interlude. Seriously, what *happened*?)                           Nobody buys a drink. The bar is declared a success.                                    /r/thebutton            I send a lot of books to my kindle via calibre email. When I update a book and send it again, it creates a new book on the device that doesn't have any notes from the old book, and also leaves the old one on it. Is there a way to just replace the old book by the new one and keep all the notes and highlights? Also, is there a way to backup my notes, because every so often they disappear from large books. They still show in the "my clippings" book, though.                        Because they had constant arguments!                                                               In memory of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2ykyyj/panic_thread/cpahdil), I declare an anti-panic thread.  Edit: nvm, it's up. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/120/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality      As you know, there has been a lot of speculation that we are still in the DATA EXPUNGED. There are a couple of variations on this theme, but they all agree that REDACTED and that it really *was* REDACTED. On my recent reread, I noted all the parts in the text which appeared to support the claim that DATA EXPUNGED, and am collecting them here. There's also a section on WoG confirmations which can be REDACTED.  First, we get this right in the beginning:  Ad-free mirror of the text;  clearly implying that the entire text is inside a mirror (see document 297-T-REDACTED for further elaboration on this).  Second, we see in the intro what appears to be an obvious DATA EXPUNGED:   This is a rationalist story;  Rationalist comes from ancient Latin from mirror. In fact, if you search google for Rationalist mirror, [hpmor comes up](https://archive.today/KzShE). But this might not be conclusive, because of REDACTED and REDACTED.  Third, we get in Chapter 6 the following  There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that).  This is obviously foreshadowing DATA EXPUNGED and DATA EXPUNGED, as well as providing strong evidence that people are stuck in a mirror and can't see through it.   Fourth, there is the widely talked about DATA EXPUNGED from Chapter 6  As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind him.  "Hermione Granger."  "What?" Harry said, his hand still on the door.  "Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train to Hogwarts."  "Who is she?"  There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall was gone.  This strongly implies that Professor REDACTED was left out of the DATA EXPUNGED, for reasons too obvious to detail.  Further on, we observe (Chapter 10)  I am in essence a sort of mirror with which to trap children  possibly the most explicit confession in-story to date, with the possible exception of DATA EXPUNGED  Then we get to 27  The Weasley twins had tested their new monocles on the "forbidden" third-floor corridor, making a quick trip to the magic mirror, but when they tried to go back, they'd realized they were stuck forever.  Moving on, Chapter 37:  "Yes!" said Dumbledore. "My own great foe was Grindelwald, and him I understood very well indeed. Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the man I could so easily have been, had I given in to the temptation to believe that I was free of the mirror, and therefore sure of my observations.  This is starting to give some clues that the mirror is connected to Grindelwald. I looked through REDACTED to find more clues, and sure enough DATA EXPUNGED:   I am Grindelwald. I am also the mirror, and have been so all along. I am also [Millicent Bulstrode](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2f7csv/whats_the_craziest_theory_you_can_come_up_with/ck6mynp). Indeed, I am even DATA EXPUNGED. You are also.  So we know where it came from.  Next, let's look at chapter 54  Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and quickly walked into it (which confused his mind for a bit, before he got distracted by whatever he wanted).  And  The mirror lay alive and vibrant in his hand.  And  his mirror was perfect  This confirms that it infected Harry early on, but in case you're uncertain see 63:   Harry had been infected by the mirror for as long as he could remember  Now, one thing we *haven't* confirmed is whether Hermione is in the REDACTED. Chapter 72:  Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. The mirror quickly took over her body and mind, leaving her in eternel bliss.  Plus this bit of REDACTED from 77:  Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn't sure she wanted to.  Plus a little later in 84 we get confirmation that the mirror is responsible for Hermione dying:  The mirror cut off abruptly.  Susan, 73:  For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a reflection of herself, until the mirror swallowed her whole  Tracey, 74:  Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly uncertain before she rallied. "I mean, I looked at myself in a mirror and I look paler and can make my wishes come true now, and I can always feel darkness surrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and everything...  Pansy, 74:  After Pansy drew out a mirror and looked at herself, she turned even paler.  Now we know where it came from, who it infected, DATA EXPUNGED and REDACTED, but who has it now? Let's look at 82:  Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black diamond.  So there *was* a pair of glasses that [wasn't just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x4lxu/im_way_better_at_having_bad_ideas_than_good_ones/), after all.  Now, there's also a piece of evidence suggesting that DATA EXPUNGED, as well as proving that the REDACTED can hold multiple people at once (84):  The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.  Let's skip to 100:  The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.  This is definite foreshadowing of the mirror breaking at some future point, which is consistent with information gotten from REDACTED.  WORDS OF GOD  There are a couple of statements from the author of reality, REDACTED, which provide support for this theory.  1. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4fzlj?context=3) THEY'RE IN THE MIRROR  2. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4hnx1?context=3) You're inside the mirror 3. [here](http://hpmor.com/notes/119/) yes they are still inside the Mirror of DATA EXPUNGED.  (Note: this last one is proof that even the events up to 119 are still part of REDACTED.)   Note: this was inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w3z8p/its_been_in_front_of_us_all_along_spoilers_all/, and also by SCP. This is also a first draft, if you have any suggestions on how to make this flow better I'm open. I'm not too good at structuring long things like this.      EVERYONE PANIC                           Let's celebrate the time we have before 116 reveals it's all a mirror trick!  18 minutes and counting!               ... or just patent it then sue. It's a lot easier.  (while pondering the recent half a billion dollar loss for Apple)   First of all: I've seen parts of this out there already. I came up with this mostly on my own, trying to be original, but there's obviously not *too* much to work with, and I had already seen some attempts.  So. Harry has been told that the first thing done to him is Stunning. The obvious step here, is:  Partially transfigure himself. Harry transfigures two layers of the skin around his entire body. The outer layer is transfigured into dead skin (or something the same color), so he still looks normal. The inner layer is transfigured into a substance which blocks (preferably absorbs) at least the stunning spell.  Two tiny layers of skin coming off should be perfectly safe (have not gotten an answer from a doctor here, so don't try this at home).  He delays while talking to V as long as possible. When he's done, they "stun" him. He falls down, and makes sure his wand is pointed towards his time-turner.  He should have at least a few minutes before they begin chopping off his limbs, during which their guard will be down. He uses this to transfigure his skin into a line of *something* (will elaborate) towards his time-turner. This substance is designed to look like the surrounding air, so it is effectively invisible. Once it is in contact with the time-turner, Harry is able to transfigure the time-turner, then untransfigure it to right beside him. It is still hidden by the camouflage transfiguration. He then gets the time-turner into his hands, and twists it.  As soon as he is in the past, he sends a message to Moody, Bones, and Dumbledore, and tries to leave.  Anyway, if there are any ideas here anyone feels are new, feel free to take them and use them in your own answer.         ... the update notices (i.e. "the next update will be") are still there. Has /u/EliezerYudkowsky  gotten lazy or does that mean anything?   /tinfoil hat         From 17:  "It's a plot hole," said Harry. "I made myself weird enough to distract the universe for a moment and it forgot that Goyle had already picked up the Remembrall."  Now  ... this may be relevant to current events. Details in comments.            Is it before Harry got the message? Surely summoning all the Death Eaters would notify Dumbledore, and he'd send someone to pick up Harry like by Azkaban. This didn't happen, so something I believe must be false.  Even if it's after, someone would go back in time, or know that they couldn't.  Also, where is this? Are we at the graveyard, or a "real" one assuming the one dosed was fake, or somewhere else?   ... that current!Harry is missing some memories, and that was masterminded by the good guys (either himself or Dumbledore). Additionally, this is causing him to act in a way that appears non-optimal, but is necessary for reasons that will be explained. (Possibly because he needs to believe some things to say them in Parseltongue.)        	149
 Came here to state this. For a second there I thought I somehow resubscribed.   I thought the same thing haha.   Cool thanks.   Damn, what a beautiful piece of work. You're a lucky dude/dudette.   Where does one acquire such a thing?       I just finally received a shipment confirmation email with a tracking number.

It's supposed to be the Christmas gift for my wife and I.   Best username for this comment.   I'm sorry.   My friend just sent me this link:  [http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs](http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs)  And I got to thinking that something seems awfully fear mongering about that video which leads me to believe there is some kind of hidden agenda. Not to say that nuclear waste seeping into the ocean isn't a huge concern for every person on the planet right now, but something about that video didn't seem right to me.  I just wanted some sort of scientific take on the matter. How imminently fucked are we really? Can it be contained? Does it require more attention from the world than it is getting?   Thanks in advance.     William Peter Blatty's "The Exorcist" and "Legion". I loved both of these.   [Okay](http://i.imgur.com/yZDgZJt.png)   That's not the point. I wasn't trying to promote self loathing here, more the idea of self realization, in that you are among the masses creating the traffic problem. It's a humbling and calming gesture to understand that every single person on the road around you would like to get home as badly as yourself. When the roads are as bad as they are we owe it to ourselves and each other to exercise extra precaution, and seeing each vehicle as another human being can help alleviate some of that anxiousness and frustration. I find that it works for me anyways, it's easy to ignore the thoughts and feelings of those around you when you're separated by metal cages.      That is awesome.

First off I would like to simply say thank you, your music has accompanied me throughout the past 19 years of my life, I am a huge fan and very grateful for the wonderful music you have brought into this world.  1) As a new father my life has literally changed a great deal (for the better). I wanted to know how you deal with being away from your children while on tour, and how else being a father affects your career.  ~~2) This question has probably been asked more times than anything else but here goes, I know that both you and Maynard came to an agreement that tapeworm wasn't ranked as a 10/10 by your standards, however, will we ever see a collaboration between you guys in the future?

First off I want to give much thanks to /u/Xenophorge for the FREE floor ticket so that a friend of mine could make it, the four of us had a great time. I'd post the reddit love story picture, but I don't want to commit to putting my face on these parts just yet.  Having said that I want to say the show was fucking awesome, setlist had a little more top 40 than I would have liked but I could definitely live with it. The highlights for me without a doubt [Pino Palladino's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pino_Palladino) performance, the guy fucking nailed it and did it with such class and style. I really thought he fit the bill perfectly. Everyone seemed spot on and enthusiastic, however you could definitely sense how the tour was wrapping up though, almost as a sigh of relief from each performer. I won't say they were lacking energy, but  there was a definite aura of depletion in the air, in that each member was looking forward to resuming their family/home life.  I don't know if as a result of this the light show suffered a little or not. But we seemed to have missed out on a lot of the 3D effects that I have been seeing around these parts as of late. All in all it was amazing and I wouldn't have traded it for anything.   Trent will never cease to amaze me as an artist, musician, and front man. The fact that he has managed to keep NIN relevant throughout my early teenage years and well into my adulthood blows me away. I hope he stays with us for decades to come.   That is all /r/NIN, I just wanted to share a few quick thoughts with you. I love to hear what you guys think as well.     Yeah it was a gift, and due to our dry climate here they don't last very long. It was out of the box for less than 12 hours.   Canada.         Damn.   [What's wrong with Autolux?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilzH4eco7lA)   Decent argument and perspective.   I'm glad I'm not the only one to notice. See you around.   Yeah, it really should be /r/townies.   Me too.   Sure, it's all good. My shark moose post was just the most recent to spark my attention. It's really not about what I post, but mostly what others do. I lurk here for the most part, and I rarely ever go to the front page of this sub, so if I made a repost as my argument point then I really only have myself to blame for that. Having said that though, this has been something I've noticed for over a year now. Again, maybe I only check in at the wrong times or something, in the end I find this place uneventful and boring, with a lot of downvote trolls. Is it just me or do very relevant comments  garner downvotes? I don't get it, like most subs there has to be a moment of self realization that the downvote button isn't a disagree button, perhaps this one has yet to understand that.   rant Yes /r/Newfoundland, I'm talking about you. I've been subbed since the beginning of my reddit life, and in that time I've noticed the horrible trend that established itself here as the norm. Seemingly every post I see that actually has to do with Newfoundland current events, culture, or politics becomes a barren waste land of downvotes and ignorance. I don't think I've come across one thought provoking comment section to date. Yet, when a fucking cartoon like Christmas tree from the goddamn Avalon mall gets posted, watch out, something all the St. John's yuppies can relate to. It's obvious who runs this place, and it's too bad. Much like Newfoundland itself, where 90% of the island is overlooked because of loud mouth St. John's walking around distracting everyone from what else is happening. Seriously, A POST ABOUT A GREENLAND SHARK CHOKING ON A MOOSE GETTING SAVED BY TWO RANDOM GUYS GOT DOWNVOTED BUT THAT GODDAMN CHRISTMAS TREE SPARKED DISCUSSION AND NOSTALGIA. Sorry, didn't mean to yell, but that was the last straw. I'll check back in a few years and see if you got your shit together. /rant      I have a friend who may want to come, please stand by.   Went to Michael's. They're matted 22x28 frames I think.   Got them at the show I attended.      Hey thanks. It cost a pretty penny but worth every cent.   So what you're saying is the Avalon Mall is as important and iconic to the rest of Newfoundland and its people as it is to all the local yuppies? Yes, downvote for criticism I get it.      And here I am...   CTRL+F "Yo d..", ah, there it is.   I see.   Ok, so I'm a Newfoundlander living away from Newfoundland (big surprise I know), I was just curious as to what I'm missing here and what this could possibly have to do with Newfoundland.  EDIT: Typical r/newfoundland, point out how a post has nothing to do with Newfoundland and get downvoted.       Ok, I'm sorry.   I am in western Canada, and I love it here.  EDIT: Oil and gas is huge here, and I know that will always be a viable option. I'm really looking to keep my ear to the ground for new up and coming industries that I could possibly get into.   I'm a 31 year old licensed airframe worker that has been in my trade for 10 years, things are looking pretty grim in my industry and it may be time for a move in the next year or so. If I am to make a move, I want to make sure it's a smart one and in the right direction, with job stability for at least the next 40 years. I have a hands on skills with precision tooling, and mathematics has always been my area of interest. Although I don't feel it is necessary to continue working in the trades, I am also not opposed to it.   I'd really love reddit's opinion on the matter.    Dude, I'm sorry.   Bah   It's solid brass though, and it was a gift as well haha.   Hah!   It ain't easy being Canadian.   Absolutely, much appreciation went out to those behind it.

More images:  [http://imgur.com/a/lL2lv](http://imgur.com/a/lL2lv)   One is semi NSFW because of a naked woman bottle opener.   Yes it is megabloks. As far as I know the Halo franchise teamed up with them as opposed to Lego. After building this thing I thought the quality was great even though most opinions usually say otherwise.    No he doesn't, sorry dude.   Hey thanks.      Haha wow. Thanks!   [Here's the picture.](http://i.imgur.com/LRERSVm.png)   Hey thanks a lot, I will try and swing by tonight and check out both stores.   [I agree](http://i.imgur.com/3EOUqnC.png)   Hey thanks!   Me either.   Hey thanks a lot!   Thanks a lot, I was thinking they were a bit pricey.   Beautiful.   Sweet baby Jesus, thank you.   I much rather save the time and spend hard earned money.   Sigh.   I know the ugly Christmas sweater fad has pretty much run it's course over the years, but I would love to look as Christmassy as possible for my company party. Thanks for any help in advance!   Excellent pick. At the Heart of it All is a great choice.   Quake soundtrack maybe?   /r/gore  There you go you depraved sick fuck.   I shan't feed the trolls anymore.   Not really, just read the full synopsis of A Serbian Film, and the August Underground series.   Thank you.   The question: "Hello fellow horror lovers, have you any recommendations for something more depraved than AU or ASF?"  My answer: "Yeah, they're called snuff and child pornography"  TL;DR: The only thing more depraved than those movies (in my mind) would be the true horrors of real life. I believe you read my reply out of context.    I'm sick for mentioning it? Says the guy looking for something more shocking and "ate up" than the infamous "baby" scene of ASF. How depraved do your horror movies have to be before it's reality, this is the basic point I am making. There's a fine line between art and an obsession with death.   Yeah, they're called snuff films and child pornography. Why the hell do you need more hardcore than either of those? I haven't seen them, but a quick read of their synopsis is enough to make me sick to my stomach.   I really don't know much about how law works, and I know a quick google search would give me the courts definition of "sane". However how does it make any sense that a human capable of murder, rape, dismemberment, cannibalization, and attempted zombification can be considered anything but bat shit crazy? I mean I get that he was well aware of his actions entitling his "sane" verdict, but I find the whole thing confusing.   This is the worst fan sub of all time, did you really expect an answer?   This picture actually made me laugh, thanks for that. I found your dog reminded me of [this guy](http://m.imgur.com/ME0q6h3).   You should post him to /r/photoshopbattles.      Wow, this is really interesting. Thanks for the info!   I have that same "I want to believe" poster. I thought it was some kind of rip off of the one seen in [Mulder's office](http://biglight.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MuldersOffice.gif). I wonder what the story is behind it.   Nasty little buggers.      Thanks anyway, good luck.   I know a guy who would kill for a floor seat in Calgary. I live here so if you had one I'd meet you.  EDIT: realized how insane that comment sounded after I wrote it. Seriously, my buddy has never seen them, and missed out on the floor ticket sales.   Yeah just pop the multiplayer disc in anytime you want to play halo 3 multiplayer.   Don't buy the DLC, I'm sure you can find a copy of Halo 3 ODST for cheaper than what Microsoft is selling the DLC for. All halo 3 multiplayer DLC comes with the Halo 3 ODST disc.   Hahaha. This is the best comment I've ever read.   I would like to say Heat. It's not scary, but I find it super intense, which is really the secondary wavelength of fear, enticing you in much the same way.  [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3)      I know, it's fucking scary to think that us humans are capable of such atrocities. With all of our technological advancements and general understanding of our universe, it's almost hard to believe. Like anything I guess, it can be defective. The human brain that we are gifted unfortunately doesn't come with a warrenty, it's up to the rest of us to sort out these crossed wires.   I think I'm going to be sick.  	129
 THOSE BASTARDS!   Hey, those things hurt a little. A flurry of tiny micro-cuts could potentially briefly inconvenience a flight attendant...   But what if a little bit of the ice has melted, creating some liquid water? Does that make the whole bottle illegal? Or will they make you dump out the tiny bit of liquid water at the top of the bottle? What if the liquid water has formed on the bottom of the bottle, under the ice, and cannot be poured out?   Will they take you in the back room and touch your b-hole for attempting to circumvent the rules with your snarky "frozen water" is not "liquid water" tirade?   These are all questions I would like answered, TSA.    And you honestly believe they aren't?     I for one, am shocked...   Only 64,000 sigs left to go...

Got that tektonic chronic that'll make you choke   Wut   Shut up.   Disregard the ignorance. I'm with you, buddy.   People demand solid evidence when you bring up the topic of extraterrestrials visiting our planet, but fail to consider that the U.S. and other governments keep this subject classified at a level so high that only the top of the top has access to the information. In the past not even the President has been briefed on the subject unless in a "need to know" situation. People who come up with credible "proof" in the form of photograph/video have their original files confiscated or mysteriously lost or stolen. If their material does not go missing, they are threatened to keep quiet or face federal charges. In extreme cases, agents threaten physical harm to the leaker or their family if they choose to continue publicizing their story. On top of all that, there is an active disinformation campaign taking place serving to overload the public with bullshit/hoaxes/fake stories and sighting reports so that when something legitimate does come up, it will not be taken seriously and lumped in with the rest of the garbage. The topic of aliens is constantly met with laughs and jokes, *not because it is so improbable*, but because that's how we've been conditioned as a society to act toward the subject.  Acknowledging that aliens with a higher intelligence are visiting this planet would essentially brand all the governments of the world obsolete and irrelevant. Even more so when you take into account that they most likely do not know why the visitors are here and are powerless to stop them even if they deemed it necessary.

 He might come in very handy as an Oden remedy.    FUCK THESE FUCKING CUNTS    11 in the morning here in Melbourne, Australia. Dunno what you're all complaining about. :P    Heeheehee   Sure, but it was IMPLIED.   Highlights: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsvBg9UQXus  You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it.      I'll give YOU two wet balls in a minute.      Vince, MJ and Dominique Wilkins were absolute highlight factories, but there's no argument in my mind that Carter is the best dunker that's ever played in the NBA.   'Knoaf mate   But you have the athletic trainer of the year up there!    I think this serves an important purpose.    Dummies would be spat.   Gold is a nice way of spreading a bit of joy while supporting the website. Best thing to do is to pay it forward... Here ya go! :P   http://assets.dogtime.com/asset/image/4f967276eadf725ead000500/column_dog-picture-photo-puppy-growl.jpg   I feel like the Hawks should take this one as a moral victory. Durant made a huge shot at the end, but it was immediately preceded by a bitch-ass push off no call and a rip-through. I reckon we should be able to expect more from KD.  I wanted OKC to win, but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avr7enrZuJQ  Hawks' offense made a fool of the Thunder through the first 3 quarters, every basket seemed like an easy one, where the Thunder were struggling to get shots off and making some really tough looks. GG Hawks.   Blockrates?!? Hahaha!    Plenty of post but it's also a great lens, I bet it's the 135 f/2 L.    I thought the same thing, but we did a cheap-arse wedding and it turned out to be one of the best days of my life.    For me, yeah. But that's because my camera only had one good autofocus point in the center there and I don't trust the others.    I think it might also help to use a fisheye lens or another ultra wide, then you can exaggerate the painted flowers and give the sense of being right behind the canvas instead of looking from a few feet away.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0   It's called a go360. Here's me being a dickhead reviewing one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0   Doesn't show a lot of class going off for 70 on one of the worst teams in history in a total blowout. Then again, there was bugger-all else interesting about that game.   I dunno. He's not real flash at making in-game adjustments, but he's astonishing in between playoff games at taking away an advantage.   Well woop de doo.   "War is bad. It makes me sad."  - Melo's sole contribution to his University history class.   DMC stood on Paul's foot as he was trying to turn and run.   Everybody just wants somebody to beat the fucking heat.    Slim reapist?      He missed that free throw just to fuck with you.   It just occurred to me to check what the record for consecutive 30-point games was... Yyyyyeah, Wilt with sixty-fuckin'-five. Dayumn.   Amazing figures, considering how shittily he started the 4th quarter.    To me it doesn't look like it's quite stopped rising.   Good games for their time, but I think the ship has sailed.   Really? I think he comes across as a thoughtful, warm, stand-up guy.   Then again, I've heard it said that if you get a hold of somebody's chinpiece you can 'make their head go wherever you want it to. '   Aussie here - I never picked a team, I just like keeping an eye on the league as a whole and catching as many games as I can from the teams that are doing awesome stuff at any given time.   I think it's actually a positive, kinda like Pop making sure the Heat don't get a look at the full squad before crunch time.   Since the Heat beat OKC in the finals, they always seem to be in the Thunder's heads. Maybe this is the year they turn that #2 self-perception on its head.   Also not to mention he scored a career high on Iguodala, one of the best wing defenders in the game.   On the other hand, as well as KD is playing, the OKC offense has long periods of total suckage. No movement, no plan, just give it to the Reaper and hope he can do something cool. I wouldn't be surprised if the Spurs take it comfortably, even if Kawhi ends up with a KD scrotum-print on his eye sockets.   That's not language. Get with the times!   What about making video players marginally less stupid so they can play the video vertically?    His hook shots have been money lately.   I think you're right, he's got one of the biggest verticals I've ever seen and he has a lot of style and flair. Although Blake and DeAndre occasionally unleash those giant destructo-dunks that are even more exciting. What Blake did to Pau, foul or not, was two of the best dunks I ever saw.   Ah righto.   Because LeBron denies that he's slacking off, maybe he's just running low on energy.   Why would he be angry at Deng? It's not like he had a say in the matter.    I like your new adjective there. PG got all dunkier-than-thou on the Clips.   Heh heh yeah been there - missus not impressed. But that only happens once or twice, after that the adage holds!   Looks like a decent rider stuffing around to me. No such thing as an unintentional wheelie.   Pacers forgot how to miss...   This should be a ripper game. I'm thinking pacers by 10 though.   But who the fuck understands the theory behind a pop hit? It doesn't matter.   Kids can emotionally connect with music without intellectually understanding it. Try that with your Dostoyevski.    Funny that so many cartoons use classical soundtracks. How can we expect kids to understand that?    Whaaaaaat?   ...scrogged.    It looks a bit... Fallen off of. I think you've just munted your resale value - and let's face it, this is a learner bike, you're gonna want to sell it within a couple of years.   Awwwwww! That's sweet!   YO MOMMA ATE THEM    No way - no two guys move the same way in the air. Look at MJ's dunk contest efforts, there was nothing formulaic about those yet they just looked so damn good in slo-mo.   No way, he was saying in the lead-up to the contest that he had 4 dunks prepared that nobody had ever seen before. It wasn't improvised.   Nature's *other* dental floss.   It was always dogmatix here in Australia when I was a kid.    'Tis a bag of wank, sir! 'Tis not for riding.   Well you sure told them.   Nothing out of the ordinary.   Man, I LOVE the countryside, I spend hours just jumping dirt bikes in the mountains. Go play GTAIV if you want to be stuck in a big, grotty city.   YOU'RE A CUNT.   Oh, sorry, are we starting yet?    I read somewhere that the uncle had been involved in price collusion with the Chinese over some NK business deals too...   You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.  Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.  You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well.   The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.  And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably.   So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since.   Ah, you never know. Some people respond to Kobe's glaring style of motivation, others would absolutely hate it.   Yeah good call. The old one had much nicer colour and contrast than my 24-105, but it was just useless indoors. Blew me away how blurry every shot was.   Canon 5D3 lets you do it in-camera, hence a rash of similar pictures when that camera launched.    Canon 24-70 f/2.8 - I haven't tried the new one, but I had the old one for a year and hated it. Lack of IS really killed it in the low light situations I expected it to shine in.   Canon 135mm f/2L.   Perhaps the balls dropped?   There's a difference between really bad and just completely destroyed by injuries. Bad luck has played a big part, the team was performing above expectations before everyone got carted away in the meat wagon.     He should be there for sure, he's an absolute highlight machine.   Plus, y'know, proximity of teeth to balls.    Wow.   If you were a boy scout I'd hand you an advanced turd polishing badge. That is very impressive.    Right on, it's no kind of path to peace or happiness. After all, what's the ultimate goal?   Forget variable NDs, they're garbage.   He acts like a child throwing a tanty.   Jesus, what a loser.   What's this from?   Haha I wrote about this a couple years ago, they're fasscinating! Couple of amazing videos of them at work too: http://www.gizmag.com/nuclear-icebreakers-double-acting-ships-azipods/20903/   I think it's more than that. I think the US relies on massive military spending for such a huge chunk of its economy that it's become addicted to war. The country has deliberately stayed in constant conflict since WW2. Drop that spending and the country would be thrown back into depression.    *shudder*  Dude think of it this way: a new chain and sprockets makes the motor and gearbox feel amazing. I change my chains a bit more often than is strictly necessary just 'coz I love the feel of a fresh set.    You. You are a bad person.    I agree on both those counts, but he also comes off as a total knob end.   Yeah, now that you mention it. Aussie here and I reckon Bogut looks like a proper bastard.    Not only the initial impact, but the two jagged ends of each bone snagging and pinching all the muscle and tendon as the foot dangles freely. Ugh.    "Whoooo, a little more choke and that would've started! "   "Better an empty flat than a bad tenant..."   I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Aussie drinking culture is pretty gross. Source: ex-piskarn.    Unwatchable.   It sure seems like every couple of days another great player goes down. Anybody keeping a list? Is there any way to compare this season to others in terms of which seasons have been most impacted by high profile player injuries?                                         	115
 lol i feel like i should get an achievement. Beginning was filled with newness but by the end of the week i knew the workouts and was killing them... also I DID MY FIRST REAL PULLUP TODAY!   if you go to chick fila and get one of their grilled chicken sandwhiches that suppose to be good. Tropical smoothie salads can be good just ask for splenda instead of sugar in smoothie and be careful on dressings. Subway is fine but i would just tear a good section of bread off or get one of their salads   haha fair enough.    I played basketball and soccer throughout highschool and on an inter-mural level in college.  Every time I stretched before a game/practice. I ended up pulling something or having it tense on me. I also do find static stretching boring but i can deal with boring.   I feel that for me going for a mile run or playing some basketball is more effective in getting my muscles to relax   yeah i knew I would get downvoted on this. I'm a big proponent of not doing static stretches...as I've only gotten hurt/tense through them. Since all Xstretch is static stretches i pass on it. I'd rather do more cardio.   i thought about it but i really need the ability to quickly change weights as I'm using them with p90x   Hey everyone,  i've been using these 25 lb adjustable dumbbells i got from walmart for most my work outs to this point. However there are already some moves(like lawnmowers!) that these aren't heavy enough for. My real life cake day is coming up so I'm trying to get some money for one of the larger selectable dumbells. Which is the best? Bowflex? My main priority is that i need to be able to quickly change weights and price is nice too       i suggest not doing stretch x as who really wants to waste an hour of time stretching????????? But I'm probably in the minority on this one.   i wouldn't rest all together as i feel once you stop its really hard to start back up. maybe just lower intensity of everything(ie just do stretch/balance postures on yoga. on kenpo day go for a walk etc). But honestly thats just my thoughts. Only you know what is right for you. Listen to your body :)   i replace Kenpo with running the basketball court for two hours but I think that's a little different. I would not trade plyo in for anything as it is such a killer cardio workout. In the end i don't get to decide what is too much for your shoulders/arms...only you can. Standard exercise advice states yuo want to rest them after workout so they can recover....but shouldn't you be using your legs mostly in rock climbing anyways?   i mean if you measure the effectiveness of a workout via weight then that might be a good investment for you. I only lost two lbs in the first month but my body looked different. Its really up to you. :)   not even 1? not even on your knees? lol just messing. Do your best and forget the rest!   yeah...a ton of upper body muscle. My upper body was underdeveloped most my life due to playing basketball and soccer. I went from not being able to do a normal pushup to being able to easily crank out 20.   yeah  my menu for a week is something like this:  Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana..on weekends i'll cook 5 eggwhites and have two pieces wheat toast  Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)  DINNER for the week:  Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice  combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x. When I get tired of chicken I'll change it up by having salmon or turkey italian sausage or a turkey burger.  If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me   thats probably a clue from your body that you are ready for the phase 2 diet! The feeling you described is exactly the point the nutrition book suggest you switch. Hopefully the increased carbs helps :)   I did a really good job bringing it during plyo today...i sorta died near the end but definitely did better than the first 3 weeks. I think substituting basketball for kenpoX improved my cardio by leaps and bounds...and allowed me to have some fun ^.^    haha third base in bronze   I hold myself up for 3 seconds before letting down   my tip would be to secretly do classic while everyone else does lean ;) seriously though! the lean version just has more cardio and less lifting..but if you do light lifting at high reps your results should be awesome.   My only other tip is COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT. This is a one night stand...its a full fledged workout relationship. Keep a diet, do the work and you WILL get results   i'm doing 25 now lol(and struggling with it). My birthday is in march and i'll probably be needing heavier weights around that time as i hope to be pulling 45lbs eventually   awesome! Looks like you've put on more muscle than me but i lost a similar amount of belly to you. Lets keep it up :)   Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps  Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps   yeah i was using a chair at first but i realized quickly after doing a couple negatives that the chair was ez mode compared to negatives. I would rather do fewer reps and get a real workout.    yeah. I went from eating out at lunch every day and most weekends to only eating stuff i cooked. and following the 50%, 25%, 25% fat burner diet principles  EDIT: Funny thing is  my new diet is cheaper on my budget and just as tasty :)   to be honest I don't remember what its called either ^.^ i just know that p90x suggested 2400 calories for me and i've been fine with 1900.    to be fair its still negatives. i can only do half a real pull up now. but i'm getting closer every day! :)   I don't use their recovery drink. I use my own suggested by my best friend(who happens to be a certified trainer):  1/2 cup almond milk 1 to 2 scoops protein powder(1 on cardio days, 2 on lifting days or days when you need protein boost) 1 banana 2 tbs peanut butter 1 handful of spinach ICE  blend and drink. It tastes good and is healthy. If you don't have a blender a lot of people suggest a glass of skim milk mixed with nesquik chocolate mix as that apparently has a good proportion to proteins/carbs for good recovery   Its in the Dvds as well as stretching. You may wish to prolong the warmup depending on age/body   I lost about 2 inches off my waste and 3 off my stomach. Weight stayed the same but I'm fine with that bc i'm gaining muscle.   The 50/25/25 basically states that 50% of your calories that day should come from protein. 25% should come from carbs etc I do this by keeping a log of what i eat at loseit.com and using their report to tab to show the amount I'm bringing in a day. Honestly, because i'm eating so clean...I feel like I'm eating a lot more and am not that hungry. I eat often in small amounts to fight off hunger.  my menu for a week is something like this:  Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana  Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)  DINNER for the week:  Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice  combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x  If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me    here is what four weeks of classic and eating right has done for me weight wise: http://imgur.com/yk91M  this is my third attempt(and by far the farthest i've gotten) and it was MUCH easier this time. I've got a little soreness but not pain. Hopefully thats what you are doing too.  I would say if possible follow the principles of the fat burner diet (50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) as that is probably the most important part   yeah. I went from eating out at lunch every day and most weekends to only eating stuff i cooked. I also stopped the videos several times during to make sure i got my reps in.I think a lot of the change is from finding out what it means to push myself. I probably could have done more at the beginning but my effort wasn't there   Info that might be of interest:  same pants in both picture. Use to have to suck in gut to put them on, now have to pull them up throughout the day.  Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps  Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps   but BMI is a measure of height vs weight...so it hasn't changed(its also why BMI isn't an accurate tool for measuring heatlh)   i just posted my week 4 pics and honestly when i look in the mirror i don't believe i'm seeing change...but looking at the pics the change definitely happened/is happening. I believe the rest week you should see changes because your muscles are retaining water because of how heavily you are working them out.   No weight change. 190lbs. But that is fine as you can see the fat difference. Also i've gained significant strength        i mean my macro is far from perfect and i have super low apm(30 avg)...but then again i think i have good decision making...my win rate against zerg is very high(80 ish percent) and my win rate against protoss is decent(50-60%)...but I rarely win tvt because i'm not good at the tank crawl...hence my asking for a better build since early game can create a huge advantage for me that i can use to roll my oponent   what do you do against fast doom drops and/or fast thors as marines aren't strong against repaired thors   yeah i lost 5 terran games in a row using the thorzain expand despite scouting the one base play every single time and preparing before hand. the only one i won was when i played my normal tank/marine build  EDIT: not saying its impossible, just that i lack the execution to perform it   added you   yeah start whatever day you want...I started on a saturday so that I could have my rest day on fridays.   http://sc2ranks.com/us/2781279/test_subject4671  and yes i know macro can be improved etc...but i just don't like the max army tank/viking/marine play at the end. I can manage one base pushes now...they just don't happen as often   Alright guys, I'm having trouble with TvT...I have basically a zero win percentage. The problem i have is that I am terrible with marine/tank/viking late game pushes. I tried doing the thorzain early expand build from Day9 but that proved to be worthless against any terran who was doing a 1 base all in with fast siege tanks. What is a good build that isn't necessarily cheesy but i good early push in tvt?   yeah i guess i shouldn't say i'm anti stretching as much as i am anti static stretching. I usually do stretch out in a ballistic manner   my problem with cheese is that even if you do scout it a lot of times its very hard to stop(see 1/1/1 or 7 gate or 4 gatewarpprism)   I wouldn't give up man. Remember you are going to be getting progressively stronger throughout the 90 days.  The first day I wasn't able to attempt ab ripper x either bc i was so tired from chest and back. What i did is slowly work my way into it. Week 1 i tried to do 5 of each move. Week 2 i tried to do 6 of each move, etc. My last abripperx on week 3(i'm on rest week now) I got through everything but mason twists.   that was a generic week...other weeks i'll add salmon or ground turkey.   me: 23 yr old 5'11" and 190 lbs  my basic diet for a week(low $, easy prep):  Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana  Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)   DINNER for the week:  Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5).

Other half chicken used in dinner of choice   combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 30% c, 20%f suggested by P90x   I'm a big proponent of not stretching as i feel it actually tightens my muscles and makes me more prone to injury. I played basketball and soccer in high school and never stretched before or after games/practice because i always injured myself in game when i did. That being said...I just did X stretch and I feel WAY worse/tighter than i did coming into the workout. Should i just skip this "workout" or what? I don't feel like any good is coming of it   Did core synergistics last night and OMG! is that hard....way harder than plyo in my opinion. tonight is suppose to be kenpo but i'll be stopping by the hotel gym and getting my cardio on there for 45 minutes.   i only want a little bit of weight loss....more into gaining muscle mass. but yeah i under stand what you mean   Week 3 Day 6. No weight loss but a change in muscle/fat composition of my body. I went from having no upper body strength(not being able to do a negative pullup) to better upper body strength(I did 36 negatives last night during the course of legs/back.  I've always been told it takes 21 days to make a habit so i guess the people who drop off after week 2 lack motivation/personal drive(I know i did when i tried before!)   i'm doing my best to. Obviously i don't hit the percentages every day. I've been using loseit.com and have been averaging 45% protein 30% carbs 25% fat ...with some days the carbs and fat switching   I try to push myself as hard as I can and still be able to finish the workout. I've gone from not being able to do a single negative pullup on day 1 to doing 6 per a type on back days   Today is my Kenpo day for week 3 and I shall be doing it as soon as i get home. I've got to say that I'm a little discourage by lack of visible results. But hey...as Tony says "Rome was built in a day and neither was your body". I've spent the last 2 years gaining 25 lbs and a significant portion of body fat...can't expect it to fall off in 3 weeks.   no problem! My friend suggested it to me and she is a trainer so i take her at her word   I've started the program multiple times before and quit by the end of the first week every single time. However, this time I sort of just went "f*** it" and decided I AM doing this every single day for 90 days. So far I'm on day away for finishing week 3.  The thing for me is I mentally made the realization that this isn't a work out class. This isn't fitness 101. I'm doing this for me and no one else. I want my body to be back in the shape it was when i played basketball and soccer in highschool. I want that energy. I guess what i'm saying is that I know in the end all the work i put into it is going to pay off into the body i want.   EDIT: I also told a lot of people who i keep in regular contact with so that i know i can't slack off   yay! just a small note...i notice you said dvd's. If you keep the dvd in then it automatically plays abripper x after your standard workout dvds(chest/back,arms, and legs are all this way at least)   Well it depends on what section you are on of the diet. I believe the amount of calories they have you using on each phase goes up. So if you are still on Fat Burner(which you probably shouldn't be on for long) then you will go up soon. Also, remember that p90x is more for lean muscle creation than bulking up.    i've played LoL and I dont understand whats going on at all other than tower kills and player kills.   Plyo sucks it sucks it really really sucks. lol   this sounds like one of those time where it is best to consult your doctor.    Today is my rest day of week 2 as well. I've gained 1 lb in the 2 weeks so no worries there. The way i've had it explained to me is that the weeks 5-8 are the weeks where  you really start to see results. This makes me excited bc i'm already starting to see my body slim down!   try to keep the diet better. Diet is actually more important than the exercise(ie you can lose weight on diet alone). What I do is find foods i like that are quick to make. My dinners tend to be:   * Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. * Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. * Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. * Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2 english muffins cut in half should be fine) * Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time * Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. * Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice    instead of a yoga block i just use my pushup bars   i use fresh baby leaf spinach. its pretty easy to find and pretty cheap. Just store extra in my crisper   Yesterday i did leg/back and i was pretty sore this morning. During work i ended up having to climb 4 [strads](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg/220px-Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg) which are about 50-75 feet tall.  When i got home today i pushed play on Kenpo, broke a small sweat and then got to the kicks and stopped(boo on me!). How would you suggest i make it up? Try kenpo again tomorrow? Go running? Or do you think the climbing helps make up for that 30 minutes?   after. I do my workout late afternoon so i've already got some food in my belly. I think if you preferred to do it before that would be fine   no way. Looking through the ingredient list you should be able to see that its no bueno. It contains acai berry which everyone thought was this super fat burner but eventually research found it burned lean muscle! you definitely dont want that. Just go with a regular protein drink. Much cheaper! My protein drink is to blend a 1 scoop(or 2 on chest days) of protein powder, 1 banana, 1 handful spinach, 2 tbs peanut butter, 1/3 cup almond milk, and a handful ice. It tastes delicious!   Finished Legs and Back about an hour and half ago. I have worked out every day! Yay me! I also did decently at yoga yesterday...i felt like i did enough work to use a recovery drink. I'm not as sore as i expect to be. Not sure if this mean's i should go harder. I got another Gold's Gym spacesaver 25lb single so that i can try some heavier weights on the upper body workouts.   Kenpo can actually be one of the hardest exercises if you are willing to "bring it" . To make this exercise killer act like you are actually a mma fighter(i call this the Clay Guida). Stay on your toes and do small bounces during all moves. This will keep your leg muscles constantly twitching and will tire you quickly! super fun   oh most definitely....but if you are doing fat shredder(50% p, 30%c, 20%f) then that oatmeal basically kills all the carbs for the day   thanks for the lunch idea! i actually did that today and put it over a bed of spinach leafs.   any other breakfast ideas? I find cottage cheese and hard boil eggs gag nasty. It also has to be something i can eat at my office desk. Today i switched out the oatmeal for a non fat vanilla yogurt and that helped a lot on carbs but not so much on protein   as a guy who played basketball all throughout highschool this posts pains me. I'm sure that practically basketballs may work. I would worry about it though because that much pressure on any basketball is sure to warp and misform it...and at that point you may be doing more harm than good.   there is a couple of us(well me and occasionally other people) posting our daily progress at [r/p90xlog](http://www.reddit.com/r/p90xlog/). You should do so as well!   the only problem/biggest problem with oatmeal is the high amount of carbs present   is it bad i'm not sure what day i'm on? I just finished week 2 day 3(aka biceps/shoulders/triceps.) I had my recovery drink and a piece of chicken for dinner....and my arms already feel recovered....I wonder if i'm not pushing enough   when i replied there was only one thread and it was the one at bottom with a whole bunch of people saying she didn't look different and basically being asses to her  	79
 Rent kayaks at Granville Island, or motor boats. Visit Museum of Anthropology, UBC, and wander the campus to the new museum with the whale skeleton (ask anyone). Go up Grouse Mtn, especially if the grizzlies are coming out of hibernation. Ignore the Capilano Suspension Bridge and go the free Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge instead, saving $35 each and avoiding huge crowds. Eat at a waterfront restaurant like Brana's at Stamps Landing. Get a car for a few days and drive to Whistler stopping at every roadside stop en route, including Horseshoe Bay.  If you have time and the weather is right, keep going up the Duffy Lake Road to Cache Creek, then return via Highway 1 through Fraser Canyon. Visit the Othello Tunnels in Hope.  At Hope avoid coming back to Vancouver Highway 1, take the much slower Lougheed Hwy instead, with maybe an overnight at Harrison Hot Springs (1970s style bourgeois). Cross back to Highway 1 at Mission to just finish the last bit with speed.      I'm a psychologist working in Vancouver and specializing in the treatment of depression (private practice fee for service).  But let's talk about some FREE stuff:  TOMORROW, Tuesday March 26 at 7 pm at Vancouver Public Library Central branch, Alice Mackay Room -  Out of the Blue: The Nature and Treatment of Clinical Depression. I'll be there to talk about treatment issues.  It's a pretty short (1.5-2 hrs) forum, but it may be useful for some people.  ANYTIME:  Consider visiting the link below to get a free copy of the self-care guide, the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, a written-in-Vancouver (but exported around the world) guide designed for physicians to offer to depressed patients - but also for anyone to download on their own.  Here's the link that'll get you to the download sites: http://www.changeways.com/resources/aboutdepression/scdp/scdp.html  There is also a version for adolescents called Dealing With Depression (same link); I thought this post was going to be about that when I clicked on it!  Our clinic also developed a group therapy program for use in publicly funded healthcare settings called the Changeways Core Program. Mental health centres across Canada use it, and you can ask the facility you are referred to whether they are one of the ones that do.  I also have a blog on psychology-related issues at www.psychologysalon.com.  It covers a wide range of topics, but depression is one of the main ones.  It can be difficult accessing affordable (or MSP-covered) mental health services in Vancouver, but most hospitals do have outpatient programs.  One more free thing:  I have an online course on diaphragmatic breathing available on Udemy. The usual charge is $15, but redditers can sign up for the course using the Coupon Code "breathingreddit" and get it for free until the end of April.  Link: https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/  That's not much, I know. But maybe it will help a bit.   Sanders Whiting (just google his name).  Musical theatre background, lots of experience.   WeLiveInPublic: Thank you for your feedback! As we mention on page 3 of the manual, it isn't intended to be a complete standalone treatment for depression - it's hard for us to imagine any print resource that would do that.  It's an add-on - something extra for people while they are being treated with TAU (treatment as usual).  But even given all that, it probably isn't all that it could be. I'd be very appreciative if you or others could make recommendations for things that you'd like to see added, or other resources that you would find helpful.  Many thanks.   Hmm. The ship responsible for responding should a tanker run aground (which is all but impossible, according to proponents of increased tanker traffic in BC), runs aground.  Perhaps fate is trying to send a message?   That's not a bad idea. Unfortunately it'll be a pretty boring post, and your mother could have written it. There's no magic foods, and it's best to have a balanced diet heavier on veg and protein, light on simple carbs, and avoiding sugar. Exactly the opposite of what you want when you're depressed! I might be able to spice it up a bit, though.   And you're right, there is a lot of nonsense out there. If I hear the word "superfood" one more time, I can't be responsible for my actions.   Hey, redditors.  I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada. I treat people with a variety of stress and anxiety-related problems, and our clinic tries to get good, practical, and effective resources out there in the world for people to use.  Many of our clinicians are also part of Anxiety BC, a nonprofit organization that develops resources for adults and teens on the nature and treatment of anxiety disorders.  While working on a workshop on exposure therapies for anxiety (that I'm delivering Friday!) I learned that they've posted a series of short video clips for adolescents that are very informative - regardless of your age.    Take a look, here:  http://youth.anxietybc.com/video/types-of-anxiety-problems/  There are clips for each of the major anxiety disorders, and subsequent clips (click the tab for "Watch us face our fears" on the left) of each of the cases confronting their anxieties using exposure.  Another resource:  I've posted an online 12-short-video-plus-handouts course on diaphragmatic breathing for anxiety reduction. I've created a Coupon Code - "breathingreddit" - giving redditors 100% off - so you can take the course for nothing if you like.  Here's the link to that:  https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/  There's a promo video you can watch without signing up or doing anything else. If you like the look of the program you can access it using the coupon code for nuttin.    Hope you find these resources helpful!   I don't know the country you are writing from, Davidd00, and probably wouldn't know about policy or access unless it's my own unfortunately.    But medications for depression, which do help for many, are known to be a bit hit or miss. There are few indicators of which one will work for whom, so it tends to be trial and error. Most psychiatrists would start with the same standbys that GPs start with, then work from there. It is possible, though, that the psychiatrist would be able to nail down a more precise diagnosis, which might give some hints about what to try first.  I'll just repeat one of the mantras I give my clients:  Medications are seldom a COMPLETE treatment for depression. People usually discover they need to do more. If a med lifts a person, it's best to see that as a window of energetic opportunity to make the changes they need to make, so that the improvement becomes more sustainable.   I don't have work on social anxiety, but I did write a book on communication skills: The Assertiveness Workbook, from New Harbinger Publications (Amazon has it). I recommend Martin Antony's Shyness and Social Anxiety Workbook (also New Harbinger) for straight-on social anxiety, though.  	10

I saw Star Wars at the Rockhill Drive in as well as all the good Bond films. LOL   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruschetta   Thanks for the site, but that's not where I found the pic.

You know, like roomporn or earthporn...   Tip of the ice berg my friend, Via Con Dios.   Last year we celebrated at the sister in laws house and I made a Hot Pot for the first time and it came out great. Something like this http://imgur.com/g4JTFP8 but we used a large wok and cooked almost everything in it, each in it's own little area. It was delicious and I'm hoping to do it again this year.   All you need is a matching leopard print bra and panty and your all set!   Enjoying it by sharing through a visual experience, one that we all as humans share, the celebration of food. Finish it and you'll see whole communities come together for a few days as everybody, young and old alike come together and share a common tradition and love of food that dates back centuries.   Not my pic but take a look at the French Laundry Cookbook, I believe there's a sauce/dish recipe that takes 14 things to before you even plate anything. Having things organized like that in the food world is called Mise En Place and it makes it incredibly easy to cook things correctly.   Make sour kraut or Kimchi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqY22Y7hVgE   Last year we specifically did not go to the wife's favorite restaurant because money was really tight so we went instead to one of our usual steady standby places after checking the dinner menu online. Made reservations, showed up on time and still had to wait for a table but ok. Got our menu and found they had changed their dinner menu to a chef's Prix Fix dinner menu for $75 each and up. Shit! We talked about leaving, but we were there already, it was getting late so we decided to stay but with drinks we were going to be out at least three hundred and we got fucked over the table by the fire place by the cunt of a hostess (she admitted to giving it to regulars over our reserved spot) I can make the same kind of dinner for a lot less. I'm going shopping tomorrow and I'll see what's out there, steak, pork or lobster. What are your plans?   more here http://thebrigade.com/2015/02/09/jimi-hendrixs-short-stint-in-the-army-8-photos/   more here http://thebrigade.com/2015/02/09/jimi-hendrixs-short-stint-in-the-army-8-photos/   WOW! Thanks for the time and effort that must have taken. This is one of the reasons I love reddit.   How about this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEFMJvFkimQ   Can you imagine the smell? It's gotta be like a punch in the face!   If there's not a "Chinatown" in your area try checking out any Jamaican stores nearby, I think they would carry it as well.   Sorry, just came across this one and liked what I saw. My vegetarian in laws would love every one.   A kid growing up in 1970's Brooklyn. Yours?   Sadly I'm right there with you my friend.   Very good video in how to make Pad Thai here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZlih4DDNg and another here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m88rF0rwHo8   No idea but I'm hoping some redditer will know and post the answer.   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4673711   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4673711   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4673666   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4673549, I'm always looking for ideas and my vegetarian in laws would love any one of these.   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4673549, I'm always on the look out for ideas and these all look delicious.   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4673501. You don't even have to make the cupcakes, this will work on store bought as well.   Yea but he was THE MAN when it came to calling out the republicans or most everybody on their shit. I just read that some think he'll replace Brian Williams as the News guy?   The wife and I love restaurant week. We're short on cash so every penny helps. Think of using it this way, don't go to a place you've been to before, try some place new that you would not ordinarily go to. This way you get to see the place, feel the vibe and try the food and if you hate it your not left with a feeling "wow, THAT was a total waste of time and money!"    You can also see if your treated any better or worse because your having the "value" meal. Over the years we found the service, the food and the ambiance of a number of so called high class places so bad that we were so glad we didn't go and pay hundreds of dollars at the regular time. The waiter actually huffed at us when we asked for the restaurant week menu at Smith and Wollensky and when he slapped the menu on the table hard enough to knock over the glasses I got really pissed. Over all it's been a good experience and it's really made for people like us who other wise would not eat out in a big restaurant more than a few times a year.    Elvis or Andy Kaufman, neither which are dead. Either one would break the internet let alone reddit!   No, it came in a small plastic box as part of the promotion gift. It's brand new as well. There was a persons card and letter listing the shaker if the person wanted to buy more, it retails for 39.99 and was wrapped up inside the shaker, that's why it didn't make any noise in the thrift store.    Yea, I don't believe it either that's why I picked it out of all the others.   Sure, here you go http://imgur.com/a/Th6wp The only thing I would change is make the cut deeper so you could stuff it a little more also I forgot to take a picture of the pan finishing in a 350 oven for 5 to 10 minutes. You could also slice this and make one hell of a hero sandwich, that's what I was planning on doing with the leftover when I thought of the ramen. If you have any more questions just let me know, Good Eating!   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4667175 and more here http://news.distractify.com/pinar/intenrational-breakfast-for-kids/   More here http://news.distractify.com/pinar/intenrational-breakfast-for-kids/ http://karmadecay.com/results/u4667175   Thanks   Thanks   I used Pork flavored Ramen Noodles, carrots, baby bock choy, small amount chopped garlic, soy sauce and oyster sauce to flavor the broth. Sliced, pan fried the pork in olive oil and butter until warmed through and the cheese was crispy, then added salt and pepper. It was very nice and the fried cheese was a very nice surprise.   Not just for weddings but there is a bride in the pics. An awesome place to have any event.   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4661539   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4661423, Anybody have a wedding here? Know anybody who did and/or have pictures to share?   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4661423, anybody know where this is? Have any wedding pics to share?   In most areas, simply yes. It's probably the last true monopoly left.   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4656998   Here http://www.viralnova.com/dangerous-trail-huashan/   http://www.viralnova.com/dangerous-trail-huashan/   Gotcha! It's just that sometimes I find those old books so unreadable sometimes. the prose, the wording, the story line itself you know?   Nice save. Are they worth anything? Because if not they look exactly like the type you can make a book safe with.   Sorry, not my pic but I'm thinking of doing this, hanging it from a heavy beam connected between two trees on my property in Upstate NY. Good luck   Just letting people know I checked before posting.   OK I see what you mean. Doing all that I guess you would need all that for the internet. 32 acres and not allowed a well? Are you gonna start a rain collection system or is that not allowed either? Love the idea of an outside shower, I want one too! I have property in Upstate New York and I'm really looking into putting something in there. Currently I'm trying to decide between a couple of shipping containers or a house on a goose neck trailer so I can hook up and travel with the wife. Do you know anybody who has traveled with their tiny house on a trailer and blogged about it? I know there's a few with converted school buses but I'm hoping someone has traveled with a tiny house on a trailer and let us know the good and the bad of doing something like that. Good luck and keep letting us know whats up.   Ok I checked your site and can truly appreciate all the time and effort you have put into tiny houses and from some one who is seriously interested in something like this thank you for all the info. I have a few questions if that's ok.    If your house is on a trailer why do you need a graded road and a parking pad? Is that's because of your area? If you towed your house into your property and used jacks or whatever to solidify your home would the city know?    Did you check for a well on your property or is that not allowed in your area. Your going solar, why not have a generator as back up and stay off the grid completely?    Wouldn't a dish or a wi fi hot spot work just as well as a hook up through the city? Trust me on this because they are the only cable in town my brother and I get fucked every spring and summer by the huge cable bill so we keep it on for a few months a year just for that reason.  Are you now going to have to put in a septic system? If your hooked up the the city's water are they not going to force you to install one? If you have running water are you going to use a composting toilet or have full running water then you will need a septic system, right?   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4646073   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4646073, Small, cramped and to much blackness for me.   My grandpa told me an old Irish saying when I came across him having tea time with my little sister years ago, "A true man's strength lies in his gentleness" and over the years I've come to see how true that is.   It's there my friend.

It's there my friend. :)   It's there :)   The guy was doing the neighbors wife a favor and was clearing the front of THEIR garage and some spray went that way. He was going between the car and the garage so he could only spray forward. Some guys are just crazy and with the talk about the cardboard in HIS recycle box I'm sure he knew something was coming.   Link to story and more cute pics here http://blazepress.com/2015/02/guy-found-group-puppies-abandoned-gave-loving-home/   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4640784 and link to story and more pics here http://blazepress.com/2015/02/guy-found-group-puppies-abandoned-gave-loving-home/   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4640597   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4640549   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4640549   I'm seriously thinking of either a school bus conversion or a tiny house, that's why when ever I see something like this I stop to check it out. Most tiny houses use a lot of marine equipment intended for boats that are along these lines. i e propane fueled. I think having a really good smoke and carbon detector would be essential to anybody thinking about building a tiny house. Here's a vid of a guy using denatured alcohol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuFUjoa8ws4   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4628906   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4628906   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4628690   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4628690   It was the title of the article not mine.   Shipping containers were a perfect fit for these people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D4WHT2F0JA. I really think you can get shipping containers for much cheaper than that. It depends where you are in relation to where the containers are. I'm seriously thinking of putting a couple of containers on some property in Upstate NY and the ones I've seen around here are around 3 grand each and another couple for shipping. Are you looking at new or used?    There is a wagon for that, it's a communal thing with the bathrooms.   It's too damm cold!   People who park in my driveway! Drives me insane.   NIce! I would be like got, got, want, want, got, want, want. I have to build a big book shelf this spring dammit!   Lucky Bastard. Much nicer than the nothing that I have now. I'm thinking of putting a smoker on my Brooklyn roof this year. Nice find.   Beautiful! Thanks but that's way to much money.   Sweet! That's why I love reddit.   As long as it tastes good who cares what it looks like.   Thanks this is why I love reddit.   Nice addition with the garlic butter!   If you want to get a solid roll of pepperoni and cut into small pieces and use that. The pre sliced kind will be to big and cause problems when you go to twist.   From what I understand he was making regular payments and was just late a couple of times and when he went to modify it she pressed charges when he moved and he was charged with a felony and lost his job. Until that moment he thought it was something he had not done in time and the charge was automatic. He then lost his job, spent time in jail and in that period of time accrued about 15,000 dollars in debt because of non payment, late fees and court costs all while he was in jail. She just wanted more money thinking just the threat of a felony would make him give her more money but once she pushed for it it became official and he went into the system. The woman who pointed that out even told the woman she went to far and now hes a felon and she's going to get a lot less money, see she was even trying to go after his unemployment.   Gently hold one end and twist twice then lay flat on baking sheet. Try making it once for yourself and see how it comes out. Add spices or hot sauce if you want more of a kick. :)   You could start with Pillsbury dough or just buy a ball of dough from your local pizzeria.   http://www.tablespoon.com/recipes/taco-cupcakes/01bc4542-2c87-4b98-a8e8-ac81e79357d9   http://www.tablespoon.com/recipes/taco-cupcakes/01bc4542-2c87-4b98-a8e8-ac81e79357d9   http://www.tablespoon.com/recipes/taco-cupcakes/01bc4542-2c87-4b98-a8e8-ac81e79357d9   I have been walking by this place my entire life, I live a couple of blocks away. I would go in and get some of their cookies from time to time. When they build the Verrazanno bridge they destroyed over 1550 homes and just gutted the Norwegian community in this area. I can remember the parades they would have  and how they would get smaller and smaller over the years. Sad.   http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/n-woman-arrested-scary-road-rage-video-cops-article-1.2095416   http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/n-woman-arrested-scary-road-rage-video-cops-article-1.2095416   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4596298   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2926645/Survivors-visit-Auschwitz-day-ahead-70th-anniversary.html http://karmadecay.com/results/u4591781   http://karmadecay.com/results/u4591781 and link to story http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2926645/Survivors-visit-Auschwitz-day-ahead-70th-anniversary.html   I DID karmadecay it! Nothing showed up so I posted it. I just checked again and now it shows up in ANOTHER subreddit and NOT the one you pointed out. What's wrong with karmaecay in that it does not show all of the same pics?   I posted the link in comments.   http://www.playboy.com/galleries/playmate-reunion-1979-pics/slide-47 I was actually surprised that I knew the names of some of the girls before I read them. Anybody else remember looking for the Playboys in the stacks of monthly magazines on the way to school, they were curved and all the others were straight.   I thought the same way and was looking forward to his movie Drive Hard when I came across it one night. I was shocked when I realized halfway through the movie the bad guy was John Cusack! I honestly wondered just what the directer or producer had on these guys to blackmail them into this terrible movie?   At least it's better than Mars who lowered the amount of their candy bars by 11% and then raised their prices   Why do you think I posted it? For the same reason but when I browse reddit at night I keep hoping to find Australians or New Zealanders  but I haven't seen any yet.   Yes but to different yet on point subreddits.

Hey check comments /r/TotesBetty just posted the recipe page where the tart came from and it's even more beautiful finished!   BINGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you! I was hoping someone would know where it came from. This is why I love reddit, when this stuff happens.   Great! I think everybody would love to see a pick when your done, or even progress pics to show ho you did it. Thanks   Just found the pic on another site and I was hoping someone here would have the recipe or know where to get one. ;)   Not my pic but still cool.   http://omgcutethings.com/2015/01/19/want-travel-eat-around-world/   More here http://omgcutethings.com/2015/01/19/want-travel-eat-around-world/   (1) It may NOT be a guy and (2) he/she maybe doing the George Kastanza way of going to the toilet.

If it is it's done very well!   I was working a prom as a private bus driver for this group of rich Westchester kids who were having their prom at a fancy golf club when this kid behind me was bragging to his friends that it only took him intentionally wrecking the two new Mustangs his parents gave him for them to give him the BMW he wanted in the first place. He was showing them the pictures of the wrecks and the BMW keys to prove it. I never wanted to bitch slap somebody so bad before in my life!   Just how trashy does a post have to be?  A girl holding a six pack of Pabst Blue ribbon leaning on a fence in a bad neighborhood isn't trashy enough?   Here you go http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/2033/ thanks to DeliriumWigger.   It's a glass set, right?   I don't think so, it looks smaller than the stair treads.   I see you've had to cut away part of your curtains as well. We just used a sheet of paper towels and two paper clips to cover the hole and it works great. Now our ferocious guard cat can see who's at the door!   Check out his videos also, the guy is a great teacher as well as Gordon Ramsey's Cookery Show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqztXdoBHvE fantastic series available   Check out Jacques Pepin's La Technique and La Method. I consider them in the top 10 cookbooks everyone should have. Amazon has his updated one for only a few bucks on kindle.   Pics or it didn't happen.   I bake a lot and we just came home from shopping. I got a dozen 4 cupcake hold boxes for .60 cents each and 4 mini quick bread pans with covers for .50 cents each from the container store in NYC. All 95% off so who cares if Santa is on the boxes? :)   Got it from here but no price. Does anyone have more info on this? Have one?    Nice looking tiny house, I just love that stove with the copper http://www.tinyhouseliving.com/andrews-tiny-house/   Come on ryan I posted this already.   It was just either in the washer or dryer from the load before.    One of the first things you are taught in culinary school is the term "Mise en Place" which means Things in it's place. Check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place.  As you go through a recipe have everything you need out and handy already. Do not be afraid to use small cups just like you see on the tv shows, that's the reason the Chef's can make the dish's they do look so easy. As you progress cooking more and more things will come so much more easy to you. Start to build up a knife kit, you do not have to go out and spend $300 on a full knife kit. Start small and buy quality products, knifes, pans spices and ingredients. Ask for a specific item for every birthday, Christmas, anniversary and Valentines Day and you would be amazed how fast you will get what you need. Good luck.   I would make one for a kids party but I think that's it.   Yes I see that now. I found the pic as I posted it. I also karmadecayed it and nothing showed up so I posted it. I just checked again http://karmadecay.com/results/u4531291. As a general rule I usually use /r/HistoryPorn and their 3 month rule on reposting for any subreddit anywhere.

 ^what he said. I'm sure he knows, he is just being a good boyfriend about.   when i saw the previews for the purge, I had already thought of who I'd kill, which was my wife's older sister. Its messed up a little bit but whatever, now that I think about I'd rather just scare the shit out of her with masks and guns. She is a stuck up pain in the ***. Always judging people and acting like she is the purest christian ever. She talks down to my wife and kids like her's are any better, she doesn't discipline her kids enough to the point they are actually respectful, but w/e. I just cant stand being around her when she starts talking about her self. I just want her to come down to earth and be less "douchey", then people wont hate her as much. I feel as though a purge would shake her up, make her think twice about being a total B****.  TL;DR wife's sister is a stuck up bi*** and at one point I wanted to kill her...have thought about it and came to the conclusion that she needs a wake up call.  	2

 Sherlock, Smaug and soon Doctor Strange. All tho I still need to see the Imitation game.    you realize its not coming out till march 2016 right?      Gone girl is good but not nightcrawler or whiplash good.    I know Im late to the party but my god that was amazing. It's easily tied for best picture along side Nightcrawler. Tho I still need to see other films like boyhood, raid 2 and imitation game but damn whiplash was incredible. That drum solo at the end. wow was that intense and every time J.K. Simmons came on screen my eyes were just immediately drawn to him, he has such an incredible presence its kinda scary and he just elevates everyone around him I mean Miles Teller as well that dude can act. Whiplash is easily in the top 5 movies of 2014.    I think sinister six will merge with amazing spider-man 3, that means sony can get one more movie out of Andrew Garfield and wrap up the trilogy properly. Then sell the rights back to marvel.    Awesome. i was looking forward to seeing this on the big screen again back when its original re release was cancelled. so Im looking forward to this. I saw ROTS 5 times when came out. Thought it was amazing then and I still do now.      The current generation haswell will be enough for a few more years at least even when the broadwell desktop parts come the performance increase wont be enough to warrant an upgrade it will be something silly like 5% IPC or some BS   I cant seem to find any games this morning and it says it cant retrieve my items from the inventory. Anyone else got this problem?   read his comment again, SLI doesn't always improve performance infact sometimes it can get worse because of how poorly optimized the SLI profile is for the particular game.    that's what im saying avoid $20 power supplies. they're cheap and are usually built with poor components. Thats what I meant by dont cheap out on the power supply.    you never want to cheap out on the power supply no matter how cheap your over all build is, one bad power supply and your pc could get fried.    Glorious set up brother! you should check ebay when you get more funds to get a nice cheap decent gpu.       From the announcement it doesnt sound like it.    have you tried playing the new game from telltale? its pretty damn good even if its just filler stuff.       wow, looking forward to playing the new pokemon on this.    I figured that since DA:I finally got cracked lords of the fallen would follow, but that doesnt seem to be the case. Anyone know if it will be cracked at all?         Got some left over christmas money to spend, wondering if I should pick this up. Is it good?   you might need a bios update. if I remember some amd bios were incompatible with some newer games.    So did The Dark Knight Rises, The way that whole plane sequence was shot was pretty incredible.    The Avengers. The way Loki makes his entrance is awesome.          Boyhood is also out in 720p   the year just started, have a little patience. Id be willing to wager that most of these if not all will be online by the end of the month.       we know it's sometime this month but do we have an actual date?   when did this trend start? was it for prometheus or before that?   They're filming this year however its not coming out till 2017. Why do they need an extra year and whats stopping it from making a 2016 release? seems a bit strange.    between now and the end of january is usually when it happens so fingers crossed.    it comes out in August thats more than a few months away but you are right. we should of had a teaser by now.    well at least I know a dvd screener is out their and hopefully it might leak! :D   Thing I hate the most is the awkward silence right after the trailers end and right before the movie starts everyone starts opening up their lollies and packets of chips and its like jeez. lol.    No. I hate eating during movies. I find it too distracting.    But what if the host doesnt want the baby from the start? why should she be forced to have it? its not fair on the child to be brought into a world where its not even wanted.    Completely agree with this.    this. plus No woman should be made to look after a child if she didnt want it from the start. I hate people that get all up tight about this subject about how if she didnt use protection then its her fault and she should keep the child but why should she if she never wanted it in the first place and it was a damn mistake?    I reckon seeing a live mammoth would of been pretty bad ass.    Spiders,Snakes,Cockroaches. Seeing life sized versions of those would probably kill me lol.    When ever I tell someone online that I'm from New Zealand they go oh that's next to Australia right? Or Hey that's where Lord of the Rings was made. Usually its something along those lines. Why is this? Why do people seem to know nothing about my country?       I watched guardians of the galaxy for like the 10th time yesterday.   Im super pumped for it. Im all for anything to help fill the void while we wait for age of ultron and agents of shield to return.    Linux sux use a real OS like windows.    works for me so dont know about u guys.    I wont be getting my 970 till at least the end of February :(   They love teasing us :(   just buy a physical copy then?      Rockstar said they would be released in a couple of a weeks back in late December. So where are the system requirements?   did you even read the article? its for the half life 1 remake black mesa announcing its full release.    I totally forgot this game even existed.    just go to any pc vs console video and be amazed.       Thats never been confirmed outside of the leaked emails from November. Things could of changed since then.       Off the top of my head, this one from Iron Man 3 comes to mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv2bGsdizhM so bad lol.   Time Gem in Ant-Man and Soul Gem in Doctor Strange.    I pray to the marvel gods that they get spiderman back! pls sony just give up, make some sort of statement to the fans about wanting spiderman to have a better future, admit you made mistakes and move on.    Yus!!! hopefully this trailer is more story focused than the last couple.    Never seen the original Mad Max before and with the sequel coming out I was thinking I should watch it. Just wondering how does it hold it up today? Do I need to watch it or can I go into fury road blind with no knowledge of the original?   yea i was gonna say wtf man, taking your computer and tv sure thats what burglars do but to steal a mans bed? fuck your asking for trouble now son. A man needs his beauty sleep.   they never said it was half done filming. it never even made it to principal photography. But it was well into development. They were probably a couple of months away from filming when it was cancelled.          Draco Malfoy from the HP series.    i gave u an up vote because you were unfairly down voted. I want winter soldier or DOFP to be nominated for best picture so then the Comic book movie genre will be taken more seriously. I dont think a comic book movie has been nominated since the dark knight. the winter soldier and DOFP both deserve recognition for best picture. Ill probably get down voted for saying this but its true.    'All this hype. WHat if it turns out it was cut for a reason' You have to wonder how much rogue they actually filmed and decided to cut if their able to release another version based on Rogue. Im really curious to see it.    I watched this again for the first time in like 5 years, still cracks me up every time. Its one of the few comedies that legitimately get me laughing. what did you guys think of the movie?      65c isnt bad. That should not be causing a shutdown. whats the max temp for the 8320? i thought it would be like 90c max or something?   Im really interested to see how he pulled off the awesome Joker voice. Are there any documentaries or behind the scenes stuff that show how he did it?       Yup, no idea what the specs are tho its from 2005.    yea thought it might of been ebay. bad luck bro. always go to a decent company like Ibuypower or cyberpowerpc for prebuilts.       thats why i always check the channel directly. youtubes feed is shit period. it never seems to work for me.    just because someone has an AMD cpu or graphics card doesnt make them any less a part of the master race than you me or anyone else and I think a lot of you seem to forget that. Quite often ill see someone get down voted because they have an AMD rig. I want to know why is AMD thought off so negatively here on this subreddit?    This one?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRd-CeWzZrs   i hope your right bro, id love it if we got the master chief collection and the gears of war games. Hell id be happy with those. but any future titles we get id consider a bonus. ms please all i want at least is halo and gears!   yea they do. Some of us actually liked titan fall and despite already owning destiny on ps4 I want it on PC for the superior visuals and just over all better experience.    id say its pretty much confirmed now. There were rumors like this with GTA V on pc right up until it was confirmed. All we need to do is a wait for bungie to confirm it, probably early next year. I have yet to finish destiny on ps4 so I may actually wait and play it on pc with a controller.       Snape in Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2.   With only a few days left of the sale its currently at $13.74. Should I buy it now or wait till the last day just to make sure it doesnt get cheaper?   summer 2015 maybe? im just guessing.    probably less than 500w. A long the lines of the 970/980.    'The game I turned my consoles on for the most this year' hahaha well played totalbiscuit.    seriously? IMDB is trash. At least the forums are. I never found IMDB reliable at all.    And Andrew Bond? Can anyone explain? was Bonds father named Andrew?   A lot of people seem rather one sided about this, some think its cap others think its stark. I think its captain america. A large portion of the movie focuses on him and his back story. Though I can see why others would say its Stark.    Peter Jackson's King Kong?   I know what you mean OP! Im having trouble keeping my ambient room temperature down because of how tiny my room is. As soon as I shut my bedroom door my cpu temp rises because my ambient temp rises which pisses me off. So I have to keep my door open until I can afford a fan off sorts.   I5. better performance and a better upgrade path.      imagine if the harry potter movies were made now,Benedict Cumberbatch would of played voldemort.       I was just wondering about this because I remember before it was announced that Norton wasn't returning I remember reading heaps of rumors how the hulk was going to be tbe villain in the avengers and team was going to have to hunt him down because of how out of control he was getting, this was of course before Norton left the role. Did anyone else hear any similar rumors regarding the hulk in the avengers before Norton left?   Did someone order a pizz...I mean monitor xD   nice build. eventually you can upgrade to an i3 or i5.    I gagged while looking at this.    because the characters surrounding her a more interesting. you know your show is bad when your main character is less interesting than your supporting characters.    we are getting phantom pain next year so dont worry :)   you aint getting any karma from me son. Controllers are perfectly fine for FPS.   Because this game looks awesome. I'm sure a lot of people outside of korea want to play it.   http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2m66gt/lost_ark_the_new_korean_hack_and_slash/   did you flick the switch on at the back?   Intel. I used to be all pro amd but once you go Intel you can never go back.    lol i bet if you showed him the controllers working on your pc he would of said its fake even if you were playing a game right in front of him. sounds like hes one of those guys who searches for a movie trailer and calls it fake when its not lol.    I dont see anything wrong with it? don't act ungrateful.    TAG THIS MOFO! NSFMR!!!   This the exact upgrade I hope to make next year. I'm running a 660 myself. its a great card.    so does it still work?   thats kind of creepy.    Has anyone actually been able to see this yet? I heard finding a screening is like finding a needle in a haystack?    Thats fuckin amazing! its like an Frankenstein pc lol   yep your all good :)   you can play it just fine. those sites are highly inaccurate.    Thats not a bad rig, honestly you could just upgrade to a gtx 970 and you would be sweet. you might get a tiny bit of a bottle neck with that cpu but it would barely be noticeable.    I think this has to stop guys I mean look at this post http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2qei24/my_brother_has_become_a_peasant_today/  The guy makes fun of his brother because he got an xbox one for Christmas I mean isnt that taking it a bit too far? using it to insult someone? Its not a joke any more and especially during christmas calling someone a console peasant out side of this sub who has no idea what it means is rather insulting and vulgar. Anyone else agree? I hope the mods will at least consider it because Im sick and tired of seeing thie term used now and quite frankly its embarrassing.    Nice! Hope the build goes well :)   So I just noticed this just now, as soon as I open /r/pcmasterrace my temps spike from around 35-36C to about 45C and go back to 35-36C as soon as I close it. Is it because of the snow animation at the top thats causing the High cpu usage? anyone else getting this? this happens in both chrome and firefox. any other web page is fine.    I have a debit card so i'm just gonna deposit it straight in to my bank account. :)      just wondering, how do you know it was stolen? i know you said you saw the delivery guys coming down the street but how do you know it wast stolen did a neighbor or friend notify you?         correct. Broadwell will use LGA1150 the same socket as the current Haswell but Skylake which was mentioned above will use a new socket.    aye? i thought it was broadwell? only the mobile parts of broadwell are out we are still waiting for the desktop parts.    The next wave of Intel cpus is Broadwell which still uses LGA1150. however they are not due out till sometime next year. As far as im aware it wont be much of an upgrade over haswell unless someone can correct me? id stick with Haswell in a new build.    aye, its not free.    even worse now that rocket has basically left development to open up a new studio and start working on another game. you know its bad when the creator leaves and doesn't even want to finish his product.    and yet that guy spent over 200 hours playing it. obvious troll is obvious.    wot?   I'm among the few who enjoyed the first amazing spiderman but I havent even been able to get through the 2nd one yet. Its that bad. And I dont think its all of reddit, it just seems like that cause of how often its posted.    it says that all 10 of DCs upcoming movies are part of the same universe meaning that includes Shazam. This is coming directly from an official source now so there is no doubt this time.    the lord of the rings references lmao.    its possible the gameplay despite being from the pc version is that its running on a ps4 devkit which is essentially a pc with the same specs as a retail console.    aye inquisition is awesome.   I cant read any of what your friend added.      the New 3DS clearly states it doesnt come with a charger .its stupid I know. But this info has been known for a while now.    its ether FC4 or The Crew. Dont even bother with unity.       Even with that clarification he still doesnt sound too keen on the crossover happening.    Now that hes free from Ant-Man do we know if he has anything in the pipeline?    if it was a publicity stunt then why only give the movie in a limited release? seems like they are still taking the terrorist threats somewhat serious.    Nothing is gonna happen. its a bunch of fake wannabe terrorists trying to act tough behind a keyboard.    the 270x requires a 500w power supply so yours is more than enough. Its possible the power supply is on its way out and the timing is a just coincidence that it started happening when you put in your new 270x. perhaps put in your old 7850 and see if it still happens. if it doesnt happen then maybe its an issue with your 270x. what make and model is your power supply ?    This one?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gie3V0hcWqw      so no 950ti? seems like the 950ti would work really well on the new architecture.    how is he biased? he still uses intel in most of his rigs.    i have the entire collection on origin. its glorious.    already been posted.       Navy seals? aye more like ninjas lol.    thats a 970? huh it looked so small i thought it was a 750ti.    some people dont have time or just cant be bothered.    its back man.    its back!   the end of the world?   Your worrying too much, it will be fine. Some sites take a bit longer to update their shipping status.    Dam it!      wtf, i seriously hope your joking. your in some serious shit other wise.    you've probably bumped a cable loose some where, check they're all properly connected to the motherboard.    no begging.    we have them in EB games in Auckland.    Ive got a spare copy of half life 2 in my inventory and have been wanting to get cod 4 for a while now. Anyone want to trade? ill gift it to the person and then they can gift me?  proof http://imgur.com/cwQsHvX   Just play games bro, i dont upgrade until i find a game i cant play.    So im trying to mod skyrim, But for some reason none of them are working and i have a feeling its because they're not in the right order. I heard some mods have to be specifically placed before or after other mods but i have no idea what i should be doing here. Any idea what order these should be in?  http://imgur.com/ys6Gloq    Cry moar bitch.    For those wondering what im talking about, its when Linus pulls on the heat sink and its just dangling in the air.       im down for that!   This could actually be awesome. Imagine the crew of the enterprise pulling off an awesome space heist!    i think its creepy how much she looks like Brody.    because its so damn creepy how much she looks like Brody!   yea thats what i thought, I thought they might of aired the wrong episode because when Carrie and Dar are talking at the start i was like aye, did I miss something? this episode felt so out of place.    those episodes were golden compared to this crap we got.    got a source for this?   strange, i played this game for over 20 hours and never had an issue.       same, wish they would put Quinn and Saul in charge. would be so much better.    Anyone else get the feeing that there will be less Carrie and more Quinn and Saul next season?  Carrie basically doesnt have any reason to be on the show any more. Quinn is off doing his own missions and Saul looks like hes back at the CIA. Id love it if season 5 was Quinn and Saul doing mission together. Quite frankly I think Carrie's story has run its course, she said good bye to Quinn they no their relationship will never work. Quinn made that obviously clear when he left. I'm sure Carrie will still feature next season but hopefully as more of a supporting character, I really think she needs to take the backseat for a while and let the others shine. just my 2 cents.    Its fake. There are no legit torrents for the movie yet.       Here's a small recap trailer I found, it still missed out heaps of stuff but it covers the basic plot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6V__oXbHeg      So in all his interviews recently, I don't know who keeps bringing it up whether its him or his interviewers but he keeps mentioning how he doesn't want people to think of guardians of the galaxy as an infinity war prequel and how he doesn't seem to fond of the guardians crossing over with the avengers and it all makes him sound rather arrogant imo because its not his decision to make where the guardians are placed in the MCU.  Now in all fairness I can understand that he wants guardians to stand on its own but guardians is part of the MCU that's never going to happen and its inevitable they will meet the avengers one way or another with or without Gunn.   It seems to me that perhaps Gunn doesn't like where the MCU is going and Feige's vision as a whole since he even complained recently about writing Thanos in to guardians and how much trouble it was and how it was a plot that was just serving the avengers and didnt really add anything for the guardians and he doesnt want guardians to serve the avengers which again I can understand but its not his decision to make.    Kevin Feige has a master plan hes the quiet puppet master who is pulling the strings behind the scenes and it seems like Gunn isn't too keen on following his vision. Not sure if its just me but that's the vibe im getting he wants guardians to stand on their own just how Edgar Wright wanted Antman to be standalone but that obviously wasn't going to happen and he had to be let go.   It looks like Gunn might be in a similar position and hes starting to get rather vocal about his opinions (Which I think is good) but I hope he sits down and seriously thinks about what hes been saying before he gets in trouble with the higher ups at Marvel and Disney.   We all know Marvel isn't afraid to change directors. I think what it comes down to is can Gunn and Feige come to a neutral agreement on who has the most control because it sounds like Gunn wants more control than he actually has. I'm only speculating here and more than likely Gunn is just messing with us and behind the scenes hes completely on board with the avengers and guardians crossing over (I hope anyway) however If worst comes to worst they may change director again and thats the last thing I want. Thats just my opinion though.     The PC isnt part of any generation. Its one constant platform. Its always changing.  You cant define it by a generation.       That's pretty cool. People hate on Microsoft for their lack of pc gaming support but this proves that at least someone at microsoft does care .   the best deals are usually on the last day.   This is an old article sony have said they are looking at different ways to release the movie sometime in the future. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-30559169  	200
 This community is one of my favorite subreddit groups [9]   This place is in Bozeman, but I do love Missoula!   I wish! I'm actually on a bridge. I'll upload a pic of the bridge when I'm done with class. Edit: [this is the bridge](http://imgur.com/BDH0Ya7)    I thank you!  	4
 It's cold here, really cold here.  I hold my breath when I go outside to start the car.    What's going on here?!   EDIT:  it's gonna cost 55$ on the spot to get it opened.  Now I need to find 55$               Winnipeg    Everyone does great following the pro.  Pro lead everyone into the basement.  Everyone bags up every engine.  "What do we do now Mr.pro?"  "Have fun playing doctor you idiots"  Pro throws grenades at us and leaves.   What an asshole.   I proceed to lead the team.   "Grab a bag boys"  I'm the only one who doesn't get knocked down so I take my engine to the helicopter.   "Restart the game" everyone says  (It's a pro job)  Waiting feels like forever when I'm all alone.   .......  ..it's the right engine on the first try. Team goes bananas at my luck.    Best feeling ever  	9
 From what I've seen mostly. The only limitation is the size of the room, which would get better with tech (going to be using the new alpha Kinect with it soon since that can see further).    The reason I ask this is because most definitions of it define it as simply a room you can interact within (usually with holograms, though other demos use similar tech as this) and also label themselves as holodecks, so if there's some part I missed, do feel free to say.    Maybe I'm missing something then, what exactly do you qualify as a holodeck?      Essentially the idea would be to create a penetration testing group (hacking team) and follow them around with a camera on whatever jobs they get for companies.  I did a really in-depth description about this on my blog, so feel free to read about it more in depth here: http://gemisis.blogspot.com/2014/04/hack-it-tv-show-idea.html  This was just one of the crazy ideas I dreamt up while attempting to sleep one night (Why must the mind do this??? XD)   Being able to do a ton of them in bulk with a cup was what I was pointing out.  It'll let you make a dozen of them without having to wait for them to all cool individually.         I honestly don't really think any current AAA developers will take advantage of VR best.  I think we may see new AAA developers popup as a result of VR honestly, assuming that VR takes off this time around.     	10
 Why 'your family'. What about the rest of us? Aren't we your family too? What, you don't love us anymore? :'(   Why do we need to state this? I can't think of anyone in their right senses who'd want to stop people from having those adorable ornaments   For shame!   I think this is a cultural thing. Like having a sense of style.   I think it's more something like this http://previews.123rf.com/images/gmast3r/gmast3r1203/gmast3r120300078/12769460-handsome-young-business-man-serious-hands-on-waist.jpg   Clearly you have put sins thought to this. I guess they will be color coded too?    The push intensifies.      I don't think that counts as unison anymore.....   Why is anyone interested in reading about and hearing the misguided  thoughts of scum? Be careful what you feed your mind...   I think it's how she really sees you.   Me three   But the tax payer still bears the burden. Which in and of itself isn't a problem. It is the inflated costs dictated by insurance companies that is the problem.    Who is this government you speak of. What you are really saying here, and cleverly trying to conceal, is that Americans are incompetent. Is there a transformation that goes on between private and public sector? Are 'Americans' in private sector a different species than the ones working in the public sector?  Your argument makes no sense. A system is efficient if it is well funded and managed. When these services are subject to the whims of ideologues, then you have a problem. How about the banking sector? Can you point me to a government fail even remotely close to the epic fail we witnessed in the banking sector recently? The government may be slow and inefficient, but you can be guaranteed that they are not in it to inflate their personal bank accounts...   Actually, they only have mastery over one very very specific thing. But, to obtain such mastery comes the ability to understand many things very quickly. So to Op is basically saying sacrifice verbosity and give a condensed (usually complex) answer, which I can ruminate over.   That was decades ago. You're living in it!   What did the Dutch ever do to you?   The lethargy of all things Nigerian government, characteristic of the outgoing 'lame duck' president of Nigeria (Goodluck Jonathan), seems to wane as the country approaches a monumental political transition. This erstwhile attitude is giving way to a more accountable, disciplined, and responsible attitude, which coincidentally are a hallmark of the incoming president elect, Gen Muhammadu Buhari (rtd). The recent military campaigns have successfully rescued victims of Boko Haram by the hundreds. However, there is much needed help and support from the local and international community. These women and children have been systematically traumatized through rape and torture for years. Much psychological, physical, and economic help and support is needed. Please lend your support through positive thoughts, words, and deeds in form of kind or cash. ~ thank you.

Bad feels like a very very deficient description for the sheer nonsense that is the w540 track pad.   Learn how to 'read a book'. What flag patch!?   First, pointing me to a website is not proof of anything. What was the sample size, is this a global statistic or a study based on subjects in the United States (who are known for their healthy lifestyle).  Second and more importantly, your rebuttal dies not refute anything of what I have stated. You could say, 100% of all births result in death of the individual concerned. What does that actually mean?  My comment stands valid nonetheless. A pregnancy will run its course to its inevitable end. The natural result of which is a birth. Unless you are going to argue that the natural end of a pregnancy is something other than birth, for which you will need to cite something more credible than an internet website.   Your logic comparing abortion to organ donation is deeply flawed. One requires an active action or intervention while the other does not. An organ donation is an active intervention and a choice. Do nothing and the person dies. The choice part of a pregnancy is naturally only in the act of procreating. But being pregnant, doing nothing and making no choice, results in something inevitable: birth. You are warping things to fit in with your reasoning, which isn't how logic works..   You mean it turned out not to fit with the hitherto prevailing religious understanding of God. You all who created God yet you are satisfied with finding forces, the origin of which you haven't bothered to ask.   Perhaps if you think of Him as the Origin, the Source, the Beginning then you a question such as  'who created Him' becomes a wrong question.   Nothing exists that was not created. Understanding the price behind the creation, which is very different from religious concoctions, does not disproves anything. It only proves that religion was wrong.   Your comment is every evidence of how that you have nothing to offer. Now hurry along and be on your way little man.   Wow. That's sad. Mine held fine. I did the OTA update to 5.01 a few days ago. And thankfully, it installed successfully. I will be the last to do the next update. I'm actually contemplating samsung or apple as my next phone...   What can or should the average citizen do to make this overturn happen? I've given money, shared links, discussed with friends. Who do we write? What can we do to push this?   I forgot to say thanks for the simple, clear, unmuddled description of how you fixed your system! Thank you!   I'm not sure I understand what is going on with Google. I am going to demand a refund for my phone since it is still within manufacture warranty.  How on earth does a company that big release a full operating system that bricks their flagship device. This is an EPIC FAIL!   So much color. beautiful.   Very interesting. Most people who are stuck on the bible fail to understand the meaning of circular logic.  How do you convince someone that something is wrong or incorrect or illogical if there is no basis for their belief? Nothing objective to pivot off of. Can you see how this is a self inflicted curse that is almost impossible to break?  Most people are of the opinion that God must be illogical, supernatural and all manner of ignorant ideas. Quite to the contrary, I think that God is perfectly logical, and a perfection of what we consider natural. If one understands that His Will are expressed in the laws of nature (a small subset of which is recognized by the sciences, ... of which more are recognized daily).   Aye cap'n   .   I have offered you no old book. In fact, i have offered you no book at all. 1. What part of anything I have written indicates that I have, or ever will, offer you an old book? And I am assuming you are referring to the bible here? right? 2. If you are interested in finding something, I suggest you go look for it. Waiting for someone to offer you something is arrogant and assumes that your acceptance of it is somewhat precious or worth the trouble in even the smallest way. Which it is not, that much I can guarantee you. 3. I will refrain from sounding rude here, but from your comment it is clear you haven't a clue what you purport to be: "an atheist is one who lacks religion." Try "disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods." And if you aren't aware, that belief or disbelief in itself lacks any proof or evidence. So it is a collection of people who share the same baseless belief or 'faith'. That too is a religion, or sect, or cult, or whatever. You don't have to accept this, I can tell you what you are from your writing. You appear to be one who is either agnostic or just is. You don't have to be anything really. Just what you are, and that is a human being.  My comments on gravity and the natural laws hold nothing of mythical or 'old book' flavor as they are things we see and experience daily. My conclusions that we are subject to these laws and whether or not they have a source, are my personal conclusions. And nothing to do with religion, sects, cults, or schools of belief or the like.  My way, religion, the word, or anything bearing and semblance to organized or group thinking will be abolished and made illegal. Then all will be forced to reason and think freely for themselves.  My logic is not meant to persuade. Persuasion is immaterial and futile. It is internal. Only you can reflect for yourself and come to a conclusion. This will never come from outside. And if it does, then you are a drone. Similar to ISIS, Christians, and other religious fanatics who have been told and are convinced they act in service of some god that wants them to kill and torture others. I offer pictures of things you can assess for yourself and persuade yourself to this or that conclusion. That is all.  	37
    WE MUST GO AN TAKE 4CHAN BACK FROM LE TUMBLR AND 9GAGGERS!   What is the most powerful at compositing yet is pretty cheap?   Does anyone else think so?      Need some assistence with this one, it's too specific for google maps and the question is unclear by what it is expecting by landforms.   Plasterbrain - NimbassaCore  Requiem for A Tower  Darude- Sandstorm of course   In the suburban city of McAllen, TX!   I bark and eat everything.   Woof.            Serious.   Ill start:  *blowgun *bow   Saving Private Ryan of course        Would they have had the brains to do it?     Is the pricing flexible?  Can plugins like Element 3d work with it?   How hard is it to learn?  What are it's advantages over Adobe's After Effects?    Put the price difference aside.  Let's focus on the technical advantages and disasvantages of each.     Would the homo erectus, neandertal or the denisovan been able to use the bow and arrow?    I'll start.  1.Things exploding that would never explode in real life.    Maybe a campaign to launch an ad on reddit?          Take the Tumblr-4chan Flame Wars of Independence day. A series of ddos attacks occured. But no arrests were made. Why?   4chan actually made me shed tears...   Link?    It's a seems like a really good software to start film-making.         A good code injector is needed.  It doesn't have to be, but specifically one where code modifications can be made directly from the jailbroken phone.            Could be used like a war elephant I guess. I had this question when I was a wee lad and decided to post it.        Stupid question. It's quite a long story.    How do you fall for that?     They were pretty intelligent. They knew about projectiles. We know that most likely none of them ever built or shot one.  But if we put all of that aside, did Neanderthals have the intelligence and physical capacity to build and shoot a bow and arrow?   Just wondering.     Now don't get me wrong, there economic system was great. There was no such thing as poor in their society. They also were very good at making remedies for injuries and diseases and were skilled warriors. They survived against all odds. Now, I did't come here to argue over who is more developed.    I'm just wondering why was it that Europeans had gunpowder, more advanced science, advanced corporations and armies. They also had ships that could cross entire oceans and some of the Europeans had mastered the art of Gliding (People like Otto Lilienthal).   Why is it that they were technologically superior the the natives?    I would've preferred it if it was a 3d puzzle game. Something like Super Mario 64.   Pretty good visuals too.   It seems like it would be pretty chaotic. With the eruption of Toba and the impending Ice Ages.    Similar skirmishes probably happened when Homo Erectus, Neanderthal, and Sapien existed together 80,000 to 100,000 years ago.   Homo Sapiens had the evolutionary advantage. They crafted bow and arrows, which were devastating weapons back then.    It's not saying there was a prehistoric LOTR style war between species,  I'm just saying it is theorized that humans fought Neanderthals which might have helped killed them off.          My favorite theory for the Neanderthal demise is the one where it is thought that humans helped drive the Neanderthals to extinction. Some sort of inter species war. A battle for resources and land.   Article:  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/03/0305_0307_neandertal.html    It fascinates me. What does R/ anthropology think?   P.s.

 Haters downvote. But PJIII will rise.   I love Barnes. But Curry, Thompson, and Lee are all solid scoring options already. I just can't see him having a big enough role to win ROY.   The bobcats have such a lack of scorers in place right now though. I could see him going 15/6/5 on 41% shooting and making a serious run at ROY. I think that'd be his best case scenario.   I think one pertinent detail people aren't mentioning: they're giving him a statue because Joe Pa has been the coach at Penn State for 45 years and has won more college football games than any coach in Division 1 history. The man is an absolute legend in his own right.    It's not. But it's not replacing commercial breaks, it's in addition to them.   It's really difficult to get an idea how good his game is going to translate to the NBA. 90% of those highlights were the result of hilariously bad defenses that he'll never see (unless he's playing Andre Blatche) here. He definitely has unquestionable athleticism, but I think he's going to have some growing pains while he starts to figure out how NBA centers work, and I expect him to have a *much* better 2nd half of his rookie season than first.   1. Yes  2. A company whose owner gives money to groups that take an anti-gay rights stance =/= corporate discrimination.   Crim pro is easily the most "that's some serious bullshit" class of the 22 I've taken so far. Some of the analysis the justices use is so far removed from reality it's hilarious.   Overall not a talented scorer by any stretch, extremely poor free throw shooter, passing skills prowess is inflated (via his assist numbers) because he plays with the big-3 as opposed to, say, Deron's situation in NJ last year.  I don't necessarily agree with those arguments. But those are usually what's brought up.   Close. A digital short.   Yep. Anthony Randolph once score 42 points in a summer league game.   final fantasy VII?   Also, we already used our amnesty on gilbert arenas.   I still wear my Shaq and Penny jerseys from time to time. I'll probably buy a Howard one real cheap soon.   No true Knicks fan.   Nah, Wall still has a lot of potential.   I'm confused. When were Gwyneth Paltrow and Tom Cruise ever married?   The thing about law school: with a couple specific exceptions, nothing you learn is really that difficult. But the pure volume of material you learn, as well as the nature of law school exams make it incredibly rigorous and testing. So it's still hard, but it's not exactly going to ever stretch the bounds of your cognitive faculties.   Not really, no. Starting with the market crash in 2008, the legal hiring market didn't see a downturn; it saw a complete structural collapse.   You just said you had a job waiting for you. "connections and networking" got you 100% of the way already.   Egregious Texas trolling. We all know it's top-14.   It's funny that, as a Magic fan who has slowly given up on Dwight being a part of our team's future, i've had the exact opposite reaction progression.   What on God's green earth just happened?   And even then, I think the Wolves are the first team to replace anyone who falls out. And even if two teams fall out, suggesting Curry, Bogut, and Davis Lee are going to stay healthy is an extraordinary suspension of belief.   *In 1992*  1. Magic was already retired, and was becoming a serious defensive liability for the Lakers leading up to that point. Chris Paul today is probably the best defensive point guard in the NBA, and overall he's absolutely better than 1992 Magic  2. Scotty Pippen v. Kevin Durant  is impossible to say conclusively in either direction. Durant is plausibly the best pure scorer in the NBA right now, but Scotty Pippen was much better defensively.  3. Larry Bird's back was going out by '92, he was a significantly worse player that year than Westbrook was this year.   4. I wouldn't call Stockton a better player than Deron; Stockton's legacy comes more from his insane durability and his incredible passing skills, but outside of that he was very one dimensional. Deron is a much better defender (read: average) and is a much more capable scorer as well.  Edit: after going back and looking at Stockton, I'm definitely wrong about him, so nevermind on point 4.   That doesn't even make any sense.   1. Ryan Anderson is not small... he has the same height/wingspan as Kevin Love.  2. His defensive rebound numbers were low because Dwight is a defensive rebound vacuum.  3. He had 3.7 offensive rebounds a game last year, 5th most in the entire NBA.  4. Why are you talking about Ibaka? They're very differently built players.   LOL at CP3 going back to the Hornets.   Ummm, you know the Heat *just* won the championship, right?   Well... shit. He was like our one good rebuilding piece.    Cool bigotry bro.   That means she doesn't like you bro.   Yes. And the whole "I showed up knowing like *nothing* and totally got an A in that class" shtick was fun during undergrad, but in law school bragging about your academic achievement feels incredibly conceited.  Also, why did you even post this in the lawschool sub?   Are you... in law school?   A view that correlates with a party's base is not the same thing as an ideological tenet of the party.   Yep. Howard has had *no* character problems his first six years (unless you count "being too happy" a character problem). Every negative thing he's done has revolved around his crappy situation with the Orlando Magic management; and I don't entirely blame him, even though he could have handled it much much better. His actual locker room attitude is a non-issue.   Can I ask what area of work you're in?   There isn't one.   It absolutely does n... right, username.   Really? I shake my head at reddit's hilariously uninformed opinions getting massive upvotes on a daily basis.  Well... to be fair it's always in r/politics   Hey. This guy is against America! Downvote him!   I would definitely make two part movie of final fantasy VII. The first one would end right after [game spoiler alert] Aerith's death. I'd probably have to cut out certain events, like most of the more minuscule parts of the journey through the midgar sectors, probably Yuffie/Wutai altogether, and the Cloudless hunts for the huge materia.  Peter Jackson would direct it, because the Lord Of The Rings style of epic is the only way this film could be pulled off. Jeremy Renner would be cast as cloud, Kristen Stewart would be Aerith, Chris Hemsworth as Sephiroth, Carey Mulligan as Tifa, Colin Farrell would be Vincent Valentine, Bryan Cranston as professor Hojo, Brendan Gleeson as the voice of Cait Sith (he's supposed to have an accent), John Hamm as the voice of Red XII, Terry Crews as Barret Wallace, and Bruce Willis as Cid Highwind.  The movie would definitely have 5-6 incredibly surreal Kubrickian long-shots, including the destruction of sector 7, the journey down the northern crater, the flashbacks to nibelhelm and Cloud/Tifa's descent into the lifestream.  This will never happen though :(   It goes to a blank page.   I love how you're getting downvoted by people who haven't seen Platoon or Wall Street.   Creepy is kindof a "you know it when you see it" test. Every action you listed as creepy I could do without coming off as creepy, and every action you listed as not-creepy I could make into an extremely creepy encounter.   That's definitely not her.   Schindler's List- the girl with the red coat.   People still post on that website?   Downvote all trolling in truereddit.   No. CP3 is worlds ahead of him, Derrick Rose is clearly above him, and I don't think there's a winning argument for him over Deron or Tony Parker.  Yeah, he rocked the playoffs. He deserves props for that, but the guy has a true shooting % of .48 and an incredibly high turnover rate. That's an insurmountable set of flaws if you're trying to go for "best pg in the world."   How could you be 19 and graduated from college already?   Yep, I've been to one in Estes Park.   100 x100 is only 10k, not 100k. But somehow your end result came out correct.   People don't hide it because they think it's wrong, but because it's inappropriate for most non-private contexts and potentially embarrassing for most people. You mean to tell me you'd be completely okay with a cute girl borrowing your computer and having it correct to youjizz?   What Is Reformed Theology- R.C.

You would have to be incredibly over-levelled to fight them to begin with.   Quick refresher in terms of beliefs: Presbyterians generally believe in reformed theology, which is largely based in [these five points](http://calvinistcorner.com/tulip), that were established above and beyond Luthor's theological break from Catholicism, whereas Methodists, whose theology comes from the reflections of John Wesley (who founded Methodism more as a way of life, trying to be "methodical" about living holy) rejected those views and embraced [Arminianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism) which is essentially an exact opposite stance all five points previously mentioned. That's how those two differ, anyways.   Ew, rage comics.   No true Boston fan.   Yep, this girl is actually pretty hilarious in pulling it off so well; and was clearly some joke that she decided to make a video out of. It's a shame reddit will largely never understand this.   I love that you use reasonable suspicion and probable cause interchangeably without knowing which one is needed (or whether an arrest warrant is needed, or whether there's some warrant exception needed) to arrest someone. Way to make a judgment without even knowing what the standard is.   Fredette was 10th...

That's awesome. Was there a guide of some kind you used to get there?   It's not an exemption, just a separate taxable rate.   I live in Atlanta. Here it is not.   Ugh. This exact moment has prevented me from my lifelong goal of a lvl 1 Excalibur II walkthrough. I hate you (with adulation).   Yep. Florida is a great state. And I'd imagine that, controlled for socioeconomic factors, it's about as intelligent as most of the rest of the country (I hold reservations for the Northeast and the West). It's just a great target to knock on.   They don't think it be that bad. But it do.   Check your sidebar.   No, seriously, what the fuck reddit. You've been bitching nonstop since this site was creating about how our due process rights are eroding, how the death penalty is simply wrong (regardless of the level of doubt). And now that people are killing endangered animals instead of humans *you're completely okay with it.*  Shitty hypocrisy is shitty.   Prelaw doesn't qualify you for shit either. You need 3 years of law school after that before you're able to take the bar, and you can go to law school from any undergrad degree, so it's not comparable to premed.      I really don't know where to turn to or what even to search.  Getting recommendations for a lawyer would be a great place to start      For me personally, I enjoyed the simplicity. I think a lot of times when videogames try and put a complex moral framework around a villain they often fail and it's usually a criticism of the game. FFVI didn't even try; they just went for pure, simple, evil. It's a breath of fresh air.  Not only is abnormal for a villain to be so straight-forwardly evil, but he actually succeeds too. He destroys the world of balance. Those two factors make for a very unique and wonderful villain.   What? I was attacking his vague use of "legal loopholes," not the numbers themselves.  He also said "over the past 10 years." So your graph is completely worthless, because the highest marginal rate has been at 35% for 10 years now.   The capital gains tax rate isn't a loophole.   Not really though.   8% geometric return is a complete fantasy land.    Just briefly looked up his post history. One of the most curious posting styles I've ever seen in my life.   Weird, I've been told i'm "stand offish" and "the guy who doesn't like anybody"   At stanford though?   Yep. Ignoring is the greatest weapon.    Now, as a white male, I feel as if I'm attacked by a black man, I can't defend myself as I'll get screwed legally even in the right.  Calling paranoid parrot.   Reading comprehension. We're talking about consistency amongst manuscripts; not the occurrence of the events themselves.   Wait... what??? Fair game???? Are you kidding me?    This admission that the NT is 0.05% wrong  That wasn't what was stated in the chart; it's claiming that we can only verify, through proper scientific means, as to 99.5% of it. Not that it's only 99.5% accurate.   Most of the time, if it's just the post-exam attitude, the person is look at a B.   FF9-  :(   I honestly wonder about that exchange in retrospect. If Beasly had stayed he couldn't *possibly* have been worse than miller was... right?   I don't think he did.   Probably just a joke, because it's impossible to have civil discourse over Ron Paul on reddit, generally speaking.   I stopped after that fucking eye on day 12, I have to study tonight, does somebody want to tell me if there are anymore creepy images?   written*  come on man!   IIRC they were 41-41 the year before Thibs/Boozer came. So yeah, I find that hard to call them "contenders."   To be fair, the bulls weren't a contending team when he was coaching them.   This isn't a logical fallacy of anecdotal evidence dude. When someone makes a claim "all people can float" you only need one data point of "nonfloater" to prove it wrong.   If the statement was "most people can float" then that's a whole different story.   You can disagree, but there are absolutely people out there who simply cannot float, no matter how proper their floating technique is. I'm one of them.   per the sidebar: **this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice.**   Yeah, because who is Nixon anyways??   ...really?    Are you fucking serious? He said the legislation would legalize child pornography. This is as absurd as saying the forth amendment legalizes hiding evidence from cops.  lolwut?   That's so cute.  	107
 "My name is Barack Obama, and I approve these shoes" ?   Municipal workers. One of the main grievances is that the municipality arranges to employ people part-time so as to avoid benefits due to full time workers.

Well the wording of the law is probably just some 'tuck in' put in to satisfy someone in the process of drafting it who is unclear on the concept even though...get ready for it... it is *technically* possible. Let's go to mtf surgery first because it is the easiest case. What the surgeon can do is instead of removing the testicles is replace them in the inguinal area, preserve the vas deferens and reposition its outlet to a place in the new vagina. To my knowledge this has never been done. What it is is an artificial mimicking of cryptorchidism, undescended testicles, the most common birth defect involving the genitals (1 to 3% of regular births, up to 30% of premmies). One possible side effect would be *reduced* fertility, though this may not be complete. Up to 11% of retained testicles can still produce sperm. Another possibility is a higher risk of cancer in the repositioned testicles. Retained testicles have a significantly higher risk. I have no idea of what the risk would be in comparison to congenital cryptorchidism, and because it hasn't been done before nobody else does either.   There are probably other things to consider that are outside my knowledge, but I can be fairly certain that *no* legislator knows even the little I have described above. The result would be a physiologically fertile male with none of the genitalia involved in actual sex-related fertilization. I suppose any sperm produced could possibly be harvested and used for AI. Boy would that be a good one for a hospital ethics committee.  Just last year the first reported uterine/ovarian transplants were done in Sweden. These were, of course, done on females. How this will work out in terms of tolerance and fertility I don't know, and once more I'm fairly confident that *nobody* knows. Can rejection be managed without enough deleterious side effects so that a normal pregnancy can happen ? Time will tell. Transplant medicine has certainly made major advances over the years, but this is an 'edge of the universe' surgery. Who knows. As to creating a normal and functional birth canal along with this, well the surgeon that could do this would be in line for divinity. This news is also probably unknown (or forgotten) to almost every legislator in the world though it was given a certain amount of publicity.  As to ftm surgery there would be an 'outside' chance that testicular transplants could also be possible though this also involves more than simply a 'new pair of nuts'. To my knowledge the only testicular 'transplants' that have been done are 'autologous' ie the tissue is from the patient's own body. This has been done for patients undergoing chemotherapy which will destroy fertility. Pre-chemo testicular tissue is harvested and later replaced post-chemo. Obviously this can't be done in mtf sex reassignment. There has to be a separate donor. Then there is the process involved in creating a *functional* system like the difficulty in creating a birth canal. The surgeon involved may not be eligible for godhood, but *would* be a candidate for canonization.  So, summing it up the procedures to retain fertility in sex reassignment surgeries are *possible* though fraught with difficulty. I doubt, however, that these details were known to the bureaucrats framing the legislation or legislators discussing it. So, I may be wrong, but I believe that the stipulation was placed in the bills out of pure confusion.   I wonder hat their annual production is.   I wonder who could have downvoted this and what their reason might be. My imagination says that it might indicate that if I die I might unexpectedly have "benefit of clergy". This canonization has long been a contentious one. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/us/to-some-indians-in-california-father-serra-is-far-from-a-saint.html?_r=0) and, [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/pope-francis-junipero-serra-sainthood-native-american-controversy) have covered it last January. Here's a couple of interesting facts:  1)The planned canonization of Serra is being announced *at the same time* as the US Senate is debating the removal of his statue from the National Statuary Hall on the Capital. The proposal moves to replace it with a statue of astronaut Sally Ride.   2)The first 'miracle' which allowed Pope John Paul to beatify (elevate to the status of 'Blessed') was the supposedly 'authentic' cure of a nun with lupus in 1986. Now lupus is an 'interesting' disease. The prognosis very frequently involves a waxing and waning course including apparent spontaneous remissions. In other words this is a rather threadbare miracle. In any case he became "Blessed' in 1987.  3)There also a couple of other things that even the great majority of Catholics don't know. One is that the old rule that it took *two* authenticated miracles to go up the Sainthood ladder is being waived more and more. A lot of recent Saints owe their title to this change in practice. It seems that every advance in medical science leads there to be fewer and fewer good miracles to go around.  4) But there's still more that is also unknown to even the vast majority of Catholics. Remember the 'Devil's Advocate' (called the Advocatus Diabolicus by the Church ) ? 'Remember' is the proper word. No such thing anymore, for some time actually. This official of the 'Congregation for the Causes of Saints' was abolished in 1987 by then Pope John Paul II. The 'Saint Machine' has an easier and easier time of it these days.    3)   If you track through on the reference in Le Monde to the site of the National Assembly you get a complete vote total with abstentions. The three Front de Gauche members voted *pour/for* the bill. There were no abstentions from their caucus. There were a number of abstentions amongst the PS bloc.   Have they not 'failed' multiple times before ?   The Hubble Site may have more references on it.   I see. The data was gathered by a collaboration between the three different telescopes so I guess this is indeed 'different'.   I'm afraid that I have a hard time determining what the difference between the two would be.   That's interesting. I wonder what the percentages are.   Thanks.   Yes, Utah is not the only place where this model is being applied. It just happened to be in the news now. The difference is that a need is being met without assuming that you have to punish and 'correct' first.   'McCafe' ? Big in the cup but mostly foam ?   Yes, generally they are very young and un-experienced. It isn't just the mods. It's also the clique/cult in which they are situated. The life-stylism definitely yes. Their isolation and cliquishness shows over and over. The post-leftism less so - *except* there is a sort of 'alliance' going on. Post-leftists are allowed a lot of leeway that sensible people are not *provided that they make the properly politically correct noises* and especially join in the gang-ups. They are even allowed to make properly *abstract* criticisms of identity politics provided, of course that they remain abstract and don't interfere with the day-to-day application of PC witch hunting and that they join the mob when called. The two points of view are, of course, totally incompatible in reality, but in addition to ignorance about anarchism the clique/cult has an amazing ability to avoid coherent thought.  I've often struggled about how to describe the things I see there, and several uncomplimentary adjectives come to mind. Of course what they preach was pretty well unknown 20 years ago even if it as actually beginning then. Think the faction fights in Love and Rage. L   R had a deeper history. Go back further, say 40 to 45 years ago when I first became an anarchist. Yes, I'm an old fart. The division was even deeper then, but there was something happening then that is very similar to these people now. Think the Weatherman cult, as the New Left was disintegrating and some of it was sinking into the Maoist black hole. All the glorification of mindless violence. Up to and including hero worshipping the Charley Manson cult.The desperation of a declining movement that couldn't accept the fact. The reduction of politics to slogans and simplistic hatreds. The imaginary identification with a caricature of an 'oppressed' that in reality wants nothing to do with them. It's all there. I've seen this nasty mindlessness before, and it isn't pleasant to see it again.  But this is too long. Talk to you later. But yes, irony is well beyond  them.   Got it.   You mean that it has already been fading for a long time ? Or that it is too short a time to tell ?   Ah, but you have to take an actual numerical estimate, and then repeat it in other locations.    No, far from it. Lots of people besides that particular cult have a bone to pick with these actions.   Good question. I'll think about this and get back to you.   I never knew that. I only became interested in moderation at all, specifically in r/anarchism, about a year ago when I noticed an incredible amount of childish aggression and posturing and... went in search.   I guess that's within the realm of the possible. There has, however, been tension and disagreements between them before.   I'm fairly confident that that is true.   Yes, of course, free speech has been a cardinal point of doctrine amongst *the majority* of the anarchist movement since the 1800s. Whatever doubt there may have been was more than resolved by bitter experience, particularly the Russian Revolution but also the Spanish case. I think one of the keys to understanding the strange opinions of the cult/clique that runs r/anarchism is the fact that they know very little about anarchism. The level of ignorance there is truly amazing. I've seen more than one person try to point out the disconnect between what they believe (and unfortunately practice) and the anarchist tradition. Quite often these obvious facts are simply deleted.   I am not as familiar with the situation in r/socialism, but I assume it is the same though less dramatic. Certainly less silly posturing about violence in imaginary internet worlds. But is this merely my lower familiarity rather than a real difference ? I don't know.    As I've said here before it's been years since I've eaten at McDonald's. One thing I remember though. The Big Mac was as likely as not to make me feel nauseous. I don't know why. Maybe the mayo ? I ended up sticking to the plain burger you mentioned. Now you tell me it's gone. Too bad.   I guess that's true in the case of a Commonwealth as opposed to a State   I haven't disgraced their doors for a long time, but I can certainly see your point.   Well, even though I don't agree with your politics I'm glad you are starting this alternative, and I wish you success. There has been at least one other alternative sub on the socialist side of things: r/socialistbeta  that was set up as a hopeful alternative to the generally low level of discussion on r/socialism. One of the big problems is that a crusade for purity naturally attracts the most aggressive characters, and these come to dominate the whole discussion. It also attracts those who, bluntly, *don't give a flying fuck about making the ideas popular but would rather construct an imaginary identity*. From that point of view driving people away very much serves their purpose. In the end the online 'community' comes to be representative not of the general run of the mill person who holds certain ideas but rather of a self selected 'elite' of the most aggressive.  The problem is, in fact, worse on the anarchist side of things, and there have been several attempts over the years at alternative subs that might 'tone up' the intelligence level and 'tone down' the triple distilled hatred. r/AnarchistNews is the most long lasting of these. I've recently started another, r/worldanarchism, which will hopefully concentrate on *non-American* news and views. The shared problem of both anarchists and socialists on reddit isn't even representative of the majority of American leftists, but it is certainly more concentrated in the USA than anywhere else.   That's all. Good luck.   Picture Obama coming ashore wearing a sombrero.   I don't think this is universally true, and it certainly is a lot better than in the USA.   Most of the people I have known over time who have been 'on call' have been relatively well paid (railroad, medical, seasonal 'emergency', etc..). It can be nerve wracking even if you're paid well, and indeed on call for low wages is an atrocity.   I want to thank you immensely for your contribution here. I was thinking of trying to answer some of the assertions myself, but I obviously would have had to do a lot of research to find the facts that are at your fingertips. This is greatly appreciated.    Says the fool who doesn't know anything about hat he yells at. I do know quite a bit about the legacy of Stalinism, more than a rhetoric spouting idiot who lumps everything he hates together and has no concept of actual history. What I do know is that good fanatics like yourself are the willing tools of every dictatorial regime. Try to know something about what you pontificate on next time.   One can only hope that the US intelligence agents responsible will also be brought to justice.   I guess it's a  temporal wormhole from Newton to Einstein, but, what the heck, facts can get in the way of many good stories. Honestly I had a hard time even understanding some of the comments. Information is indeed irretrievably lost, and that string proves it.    Yes, it does. The authors found that oxytocin receptors occurred on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. They were also quite explicit that their discovery of the lateralization to the left auditory cortex was quite important as well. What they didn't make plain, in my opinion, was whether the receptors on the inhibitory neurons 'tuned down' previously existing inhibition of that brain area due to said neurons or whether the inhibitory neurons were stimulated to inhibit *other* neurons that 'tuned down' a prior response to excitatory impulses.   I never looked at them. Let's see.  EDIT: I looked, and I see what you mean. It starts with 'white holes' and goes downhill from there. Actually a few of the comments were sensible, but many went into the zone of not even being wrong.   Oh Jesus H. Christ. My first honest-to-God serious right winger on this subreddit. Oh boy, oh boy, oh, boy. Please step towards that vat of liquid amber over there. I want to treasure this moment and preserve it for posterity.  In any case this reinforces my decision to try and concentrate this subreddit on *non-American* anarchist news. You may not be an anarchist, but you sure as hell are an American. The USA is the only country in the world, to my knowledge, where ignorance amongst a large fraction of the population (on both the left and the right) is considered a virtue. For the *majority* of Americans, however, and the overwhelming majority of the rest of the world "larnin'" as my old man would have said is a *good* thing.  In any case I'd rather talk to the original poster, but I'll kindly provide a few facts of life to brighten up your dismal world. There is such a thing as 'Marxism-Leninism' which is the *actual* meaning of the word 'communist' when it is used in everyday talk. This thing is *not* the same as the economic system of 'communism' which may or may not be achievable. Marxist-Leninists do indeed aim at dictatorship, but *so do numerous dictatorships, actual and potential, supported by the USA across the world*. There is a big world of political differences outside of crude right wing American rhetoric that said rhetoric tries, sometimes desperately, to ignore.   Some anarchists may be, shall we say, 'dodgy', but the majority of the movement across the world has *never* advocated dictatorship of *any* sort. It's actually the *exact* opposite of that. If you wish to pontificate on 'anarchism' I'd suggest you find out what it actually is first.   As for the original poster I will be asking questions of them and talking to them soon. The point that you should know, assuming you are interested in learning anything at all, is that their ideology, so-called 'African socialism' is not, not, not the same thing as communism/Marxism-Leninism. It has resulted in dictatorship in some places in the past, but these regimes have not shared the totalitarian ambitions of Marxist-Leninists. I disagree with that ideology, but your tiny world view blinds you to what it actually is.     No problem. I am just being neurotic.   Oops. I will delete and repost.   That's an unsettling thought isn't it.   I think the author actually agrees with you. What he is doing is posing a question of how information/resources could be exchanged between components of the 'new economy' while maintaining its democratic nature. Is this an easy question ? No, and you pose one of the problems. What I would say is 'keep the risks small'. It's a matter of future discussion.   It's meant to be.   Yes, it does. It's a sudden burst of color seen at sunset if conditions are right.   I suspect that Cheney more or less likes his family.    I think that there are two different conceptions of both morality and free will operating here. From what you say the 'free choice' of an agent in a situation of incomplete information is, to Harris, the be all and end all of the morality of said choice with no reference to consequences. I think Chomsky is alluding to the way in which self deception (which he and Robert Trivers have discussed) plays a role in grading the morality of a choice. The information available to a free agent can be *deliberately* incomplete because of a prior decision to avoid certain information. I don't think Chomsky makes this plain, but it seems to be a factor to me. In this case the 'negligence' is deliberate and the 'severity' could have been predicted by information that the agent avoids.  OK, that's all the philosophy that I'm going to do today.   The world always holds surprises. It depends every much on how much pressure the USA decides to apply and *also* on what credibility their pressure has in Ecuador today. In Ecuador itself the issue is a 'cross-class' one gaining support from a number of sectors of the population.   I'm not that familiar with Harris. Does he make his money by 'punditry' ?   Yes, that's probably a valid criticism.   Thanks. I forgot about that detail.   Are the Libertarians in power in *any* of the US States where marijuana has been decriminalized ? Never say never. It took a right wing Administration to end the Vietnam War and to open up to China. The world is complicated.   A few probably have, but an even rarer event is that they have had relatives or friends who have gone to prison because of drugs and either die there or die later when they come out worse than before.    I'd guess that the only convictions that would be affected would be in Ecuador itself.   Thank you for the information. Can you expand on this ?   That isn't hat happens in the real world as European experience has demonstrated.   You do realize that meth is pretty well a 100% domestic product.   I don't know the full details of the legislation. On a local level probably 'yes'. Export ?   Which is spent on military expeditions targeting the peasants. That's the reality, and peasants in the Andes know this very well.   A few lesser known historical facts should be brought up here. The first was that father Gapon was a paid agent of the Okhrana, the Tsarist secret police. This was part and parcel of the Okhrana's policy of 'police unionism'. It obviously didn't work out very well. It was, of course, from a police point of view not the *greatest* failure. Looking at it from 'over there' precipitating a revolution was less of an 'oops' than having your agents kill government ministers and even the Tsar's uncle. Oops !  Time ran on and the SRs found out that Gapon was a police agent. A group was sent to kill him, commanded by one 'Azef'. The task was completed in 1906. It took three years for Vladimir Burtzev (yay !) to gather enough evidence to show that Azef himself was an Okhrana agent. Azef managed to escape from France where he was operating at the time due to the fact that the 'trial judges' (mostly SRs but including Kropotkin) were *very* much opposed to Burtzev's claim. It's a long story, but Burtzev had to bring forward the fact that he had corrupted a police officer who passed the info on.  While the idiots forced the delay, demanding that Burtzev "kill himself", Azef made his escape to Germany. Burtzev was pissed. He had to reveal one of his most valuable sources. Kropotkin was on the tribunal, but he wasn't as aggressive as the SR judges. Later K expressed his great gratitude for Burtzev's work. Which all goes to show that the worst people in the world to be judges on a tribunal are Russians. But more seriously it shows what happens when the romance of conspiracy overcomes common sense. Looking at it from the other side it's a great demonstration of how the best laid plans can blow up in your face.   Don't forget to factor in airfare and hotel in a projected budget. And, of course, bribes. Lots of bribes.   I don't think 'bathsalts' are a big thing in Ecuador.   No, it appears to be all drugs. Don't forget that Ecuador has been the victim of the US war on ~~drugs~~ peasants for decades now. Think cocaine, a dirt poor peasant and a US piloted plane passing overhead. If the peasant is lucky and he has paid the proper bribes he might not just live but even keep his crops.   I'm not too sure. I haven't seen any numbers, but if European experience is anything to judge by they will indeed decrease.   One can only hope that the US pressure will decrease for one reason or the other.   Muy bueno por Ecuador.   Thanks for the info.   I may be wrong on this, but I believe Uruguay legalized only marijuana. I understand that Portugal has legalized 'possession' of any drug across the board.    I believe that the use of a pesticide has to be approved in a 'crop by crop' manner. No doubt what you are saying about tobacco is correct, but this is a matter of regulation and bureaucratic rules.    I guess you're right on that. Good point.   For an introduction to the anarchist side of things see [An Anarchist FAQ](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html) .   Thanks. I was going on only the trail from the Physics World article.   No connection to the UAW that I know of. The [federation/alliance](http://www.industriall-union.org) was founded in June 2012 by four international unions. Since then it has grown a lot. In the USA the USW are an affiliate. The USW have been doing a few international things in the last few years. Aside from IndustriALL they are a component of Workers Uniting along with British unions. They are also allied with the Mondragon federation in the [1worker1vote](http://1worker1vote.org) organization to promote workers' cooperatives.    Yes, that can be the best thing to do in some cases. I often do that, but in this case the original paper is behind a paywall. I use the original when the full paper is open source. Otherwise I tend to stick to the title in the secondary source, in this case Physics World.   ???   It all comes down to who gets to define what the "foundations of Islam" are.    Yes, I'm sure the pictures will become more and more informative as the craft gets closer to Pluto.   Here are three good books that can help you out and direct you an endless wealth of other sources:  1)The first three volumes of E.H. Carr's 14 volume history of the Soviet Union. These deal with the period you are interested in, and Carr regularly devotes a section on finance within each time period he is describing. Impeccably researched and documented.  2)Alex Nove's 'An Economic History of the USSR'. A less enjoyable read than Carr mostly because of a narrower focus, but in some ways more detailed and useful than Carr.*IMPORTANT POINT - I checked, and to my amazement the book is available on the internet at Google Books.* Carr's history would be available at University libraries, but only the best would have all 14 volumes.  3)Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy'. Well written but has less about your particular interest than the other two. Written from a non-Leninist Marxist point of view, and the author's main concern is political ie how Soviet democracy could have been preserved if various factions had made the right choices.   There's cold, and then there's *really* cold. It does make me wonder, however, what they could be made of.   This is a really good presentation. Thanks.   Maintenance in Antarctic conditions must be quite the feat as well.   Or whoever owns that robot.   From the point of view of the business owners it's the furthest thing from a 'failure'.   Those are interesting numbers.   It could also fit in as a measure of how many jobs have been lost in some situations.   Yes, but in pretty well every existing society things like 'comfort', 'time' and *opportunity* 'to pursue more interesting activities' are as unequally distributed as economic resources are. In fact they are often very much the same thing. OK, that's *now*. Should technological advances destroy jobs history is pretty clear on what happens. Opportunities are *not* equally distributed, and the benefit of the technology goes to a few while for others they get nothing or their situation deteriorates.   In no way does this mean that technological advance should be stopped; it's just that it has to be looked at in its context, both historical, economic and social.   In one way it was a British equivalent of continental anarchosyndicalism. It believed that the economy should be democratically controlled by 'guilds' that were both a throwback to medieval guilds and also the equivalent of continental syndicates. It differed from continental anarchosyndicalism in several ways. One is that it saw a continued need for a state, for government. Another difference is that it was thoroughly non-revolutionary, advocating a gradual transition to a democratic society facilitated by elected politicians. Finally it was never a mass movement like continental anarchosyndicalism was. Continental anarchosyndicalism was perhaps the most authentically 'proletarian' movement that history has ever produced. British Guild Socialism in contrast was more of an intellectual movement even though it had its sympathizers amongst the working class. The guild socialists relied much more on 'converting people of good will' than on anything resembling the union organization of continental anarchosyndicalism.   All that I can say to that is that it takes a great deal of semi-religious faith to assign the word 'smart' to a phone. Maybe some people have truly genius rocks in their back yard. But yes, I know people are easily indoctrinated, but this weakness isn't infinite.    As an older person I can say that people of my generation would find that 'repulsive'. Interacting with the waiter(ess) is one of the pleasures of dining out. I hope that younger people will also feel that this is taking robotic impersonality to a ridiculous level.   I see. Various articles on different subjects on Wikipedia have different styles. It is, after all, user generated. I've never really thought much about the different writing styles there.   What are you referring to ? I can see a few grammar quibbles . For instance the "however" in the third sentence shouldn't lead off the sentence. The "-" in the second sentence would traditionally have been a semicolon. I must admit, however, that I also use "-" or a full colon instead of the correct semicolon. In the third sentence the more common term is "wholefoods" rather than "wholefood", but the second is probably acceptable. In sentence 3 there should be a comma in front of the "and". In the last sentence I personally would have left out the comma after the date, but I *think* this is still acceptable. It also is unclear because the author left out what the "170" modifies. Once more, however, the meaning is clear even if clumsy.   You are probably referring to something more than this as being "weird", but I am uncertain what you are speaking of.   As the Luddites realized long ago.   In terms of the historical roots (French mutualism which created France's labor movement and later anarchosyndicalism and even the American individualist anarchists such as Tucker, Spooner, Labadie, etc.) it is obviously a 'socialism'. If you want to look at mutualists who self-define as socialists they put forward their own point of view in places like C4SS (Center for a stateless society).   Most of the research done has been trying to dice out certain factors from a complex situation. Very few real life situations are simple one factor changes. When the research is done, with the aid of truly heroic statistics, the most outstanding factor that regularly comes up is simple demographics. The higher the percentage of males from say 18 to 25 in the population the higher the crime rate.  New York would be an interesting study because it did indeed have a reduction in crime during a certain period. Those who wish to increase budgets say that this was due to the 'no-tolerance', 'broken window' policy put in place by the Major of the time. The reality is that there are *many* contributing factors, and the best that can be done is to assign a percentage with uncertainty to each factor. One of the biggest problem I can see with New York is choosing an appropriate control ie a comparable city. Most of the research that has been done takes national rates as a control, and that has difficulties.   To paraphrase Orwell, "some opportunities are more equal than others".   Oh no. I assume the coloring book comes with its on supply of disappearing ink in all the colors.   Well done. I like your comeback. The physician involved must have been really old fashioned.   I'm afraid that the selling price is unknown at this time.   Gracias compaero zeabu.  En beneficio de las victimas del sistema excolar Americano proporciono un resumen Ingls. Los EE.UU es el major ejamlo de un pais de habla Ingls que Deben saber Espaol.Pero la ignorancia es el objetivo de las escuelas Americanos.  Pot favor me corrija si usted piensa mi resumen es incorrecto. La filosofa no es mi puento fuerta.  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  A summary of the article  above appears below. I don't have the time for a full translation at this moment.   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  This article is from the Spanish language 'Philosophy Web', and it deals with a subject that actually may be more relevant in  English speaking countries, especially the USA, than it is in Spain or Latin America. The basic argument is against philosophical relativism. The most outstanding example of this is 'post modernism' in the USA which is being exported along with other industrial waste to the rest of the world. I will try in this summary to bracket my own opinions with an '[]', but I am sure that such may leak through to the summary.   The title of the article translates as "I don't give a shit for your opinion'. It discusses a linguistic divide between opinion and its increasing promotion as opposed to 'fact'. [This is quite relevant in the present situation where 'post-modernism' holds sway in the university classrooms of soon to be retired (I hope)  American academics. This intellectual fad has spread outside of the USA. Hence this article from Spain. It also reminds me, to my discomfort, of the predictions of Russian sociologist Pitirim Sorokin who predicted an oncoming 'Age of Belief' that would supersede  an "Age of Empiricism'. While not willing to buy into Sorokin's determinism this may be an apt description of what has been happening in some regards.]  The author begins by tracing two concepts back to their Greek words. These are 'doxa' which may translate as 'opinion', 'common sense' or 'uniformed observation'. The other pole is 'episteme' which may translate as 'science' or 'informed statement'. The difference is between 'appearance' and 'reality'.  The essay goes on to how informed views are being discredited in favor of 'opinion'/doxa. The first stage of this process is a [propaganda] effort to maintain that there is 'no difference' between the two ways of viewing the world. This advances into the idea that both ways are 'equal' and that the difference between the two is a  matter of 'taste'.  One of the most important aspects of 'science' is that it is being continually being refined. The author contrasts this to the situation of 'opinion' where there is no mechanism for improvement, and he/she goes on to describe a situation, that of a bank loan, of how the two ways of seeing produce different actions. [The 'opinion' option, of course, may lead to bankruptcy if the bank persists in its folly].  The essay goes on to discuss 'relativism' which in effect denies an external reality, saying that all opinions are equal. [This, of course, is the venerable argument in philosophy between idealism and materialism]. What the media do is present the "stupidity of eqidistance' [from reality], and it uses the example of evolution/creationism as an example. Two sides of an argument are presented outside of any connection to reality that could allow judgement. In this context the 'debates' become 'set-ups'. [Entertainment rather than information.].  The author goes on to express the opinion that such debates become merely 'quantitative'. Right and wrong no longer exist. Simple weight of 'opinion' becomes more important than any way of differentiating between different points of view.  In such a situation no 'consensus' in the sense of a melding of different points of view in a 'dialectical' (non-Marxist sense) is possible. All that happens is an 'exhibitionism' of opinions where opinions no loner require evidence.  [In sum, in the Burt 'opinion', the essay is one more criticism of relativism, and it has political ramifications. I obviously agree because I am at heart a realist.]    Thanks for the contribution. I tend to get a lot of news from South Korea, mostly from union federations and, of course, Labour Start. Korean workers tend to be very militant, and personally I think it is very much connected to the 'patronage' system of South Korean business. Trustification there seems to make Japan look like a truly competitive free market. So many labor disputes in Korea become political disputes almost automatically because the lines of patronage extend into the state as well to a greater degree than in other countries.  To my great disappointment I have found little in terms of *present* contacts with Korean anarchists. It seems to be all history. When the Asian Anarchist Network was really and truly operating posts from Korea were few and far between as well. I don't know what the problem is. Perhaps a more pervasive repression in terms of cowing people not with legal penalties but rather with the 'promise' of perpetual unemployment. But quite frankly I don't know.   Yeah, there are some of these do-gooder money machines that I have truly learned to hate over the years. PETA is one. Greenpeace (North American version) and Rainforest Action network are two others. Here's what happens. A local struggle begins. One of the leaches finds out about it. They sent a small contingent of travelling 'suckers' (or leftist bureaucrats on the make) to said locality and proceed to publicize the local struggle as a **fund raising opportunity** across the internet. The process actually predates the internet. Consider Newfoundland and the early NWT before Nunavut.  The people they send are 'weird' from the point of view of the locals *including the locals who started the campaign*. The invaders become a matter of embarrassment for local people, and, miracle of miracles, the whole community is united in hatred of the 'invaders'. Meanwhile the 'other side' uses the 'professional activists' as propaganda against their local opposition. Net result: five points down for the local opposition.  I'm most familiar with this in relation to Greenpeace. Their latest invasion involves a small community in Nunavut fighting against gas/oil exploration. I'm also quite familiar with the way that Rainforest Action Network parasitized the struggle of the Grassy Narrows people in Northwest Ontario. There are many other instances. I just tend to remember some.  PETA is in a class by itself. They can invade situations where there is no organized local struggle, appear, disappear and leave nothing but embarrassment and an increase in their bank account. They did this trick in Detroit during the water cut-off struggle. They parasitized a struggle that had nothing whatsoever to do with their supposed goals (besides making money of course). Besides embarrassing people in Detroit they contributed absolutely nothing, sweet bugger all, to the struggle to prevent the cut-offs.  OK enough emotion. It's not good for an old fart. I'm sure that there are other parasites besides the three I've mentioned above.    The subjective experience ? Yes, possibly.   Well I once more would say they are the same thing. As air molecules move past and touch the surface of the object some of the kinetic energy of the object is transferred to them as well. The difference between this and molecules directly in front of the object is that only part of the energy is transferred by the contact.   Oh God. A song with the lyrics "let the love flow" just popped into my mind.    They are sort of the same thing. Take the kinetic energy of the object just before it hits the air (assume a discrete boundary). As it descends it 'compresses' the air in front of it thereby changing kinetic energy into thermal energy of the air molecules. At the same time the air molecules exert an equal and opposite force on the object thereby slowing it down. This is the 'friction' referred to. The energy transferred to the air molecules is equal to that exerted on the object.   I'll try. As I said it may be dated. It's an idea that I've carried around in my head for over 25 years.   Good. Please do.   I guess that's true. It sure, however, has entered the language as a metaphor..."the road to Damascus".   Good question. Do spiders have the subjective experience of pain that we (and probably most vertebrates) have ? That's a bit beyond my knowledge.   Thanks.   There was at least one Greek philosopher who held to a sun centred cosmos. During the Renaissance Galileo escaped the death penalty. Copernicus escaped it by being dead already - his book was published posthumously. I think the heliocentric model was 'one' of the reasons why Giordano Bruno was killed, but I am not 100% sure on that.   China: 1)Incredible diversity, unappreciated by the outside world. 2)Oldest (more or less) continuous civilization. Stuff to see. 3)Rapidly changing and therefore interesting. 4)Soon to be the most important country in the world. 5)Interest in Pinyin (official national language). 6)Reportedly very hospitable country. 7)At least in the usual urban area I will personally be the biggest threat to the water quality.   Thank you. That seemed like a very informative article.   Yes, this guy wins some sort of 'nasty award'.   That's interesting. I'm going to have to try and compare them myself.   You're welcome. I've read several things over the years about 'muscle supplements' and liver failure, but I can't remember right now which compounds were involved. I'll have a look. Thanks for the comment.   You're probably right about that.   Thank you.   Thanks.   Yes, that's true. The thing is, however, that payment due is not an asset. When a private company declares bankruptcy the secured creditors will have their claims (payment due) compensated, at least in part, by funds raised by liquidation of the company's assets. Wages due (claims due) have a lesser priority than other debts do. I don't know how this works with a public entity such as a city.   Thanks for the information. I've actually given little thought to the subject of what influence small newspapers have. There are several in the city where I live, and I know that they are often good platforms for commercial advertising, and they may be useful for politicos as well. Thanks. It's food for thought.   Well, he's clear if nothing else. One thing I am unclear about in bankruptcy law. Secure creditors get first claim on assets, and wages owing are usually not in that category. I wonder how pension funds rank in the lineup. I imagine it is complicated. What assets do cities have that would be of any value to a pension fund ?   Well, there have been numerous epidemiological studies of the effects of economic conditions on mental health problems and yes, depression increases with decreased job security. There are also others studies, once more many, of the health effects of social class, including mental health. I'll see if I can dig up a good overview.   Will do. I've seen this sort of problem before, and usually is quite innocent as in somebody not properly undating (or adding) the security certificate for a site or a part of a site. Still, it's not always innocent.   I thank you profoundly for the great link. I was unaware of the Cornell project, and the site is fascinating. I signed up for some of the newsletters immediately. I see that their bird count (on May 9) is separate from the long running Christmas bird count. If you are connected to the project please note that when trying to access the count project from the link list at the bottom of the screen that it gives a 'security warning'. It is probably totally innocent, but I've learned to pay attention to these warnings and not proceed any further. Too bad. If you are not connected with Cornell please inform me, and I will try to email them myself about the problem.   Indeed. Humans as a group can be tremendously short-sighted. Sometimes it reaches the point of deliberate, malevolent attempts to retain ignorance. Think of politicians in the USA representing coastal communities and their attempts to deny climate change (South Carolina).  This incident also brought the 2009 Aquila earthquake to mind, and the court case that dragged on and on about it. I believe the accused involved have finally been vindicated. Earthquake prediction is a chancy affair, but sensible recommendations are often lost in bureaucracy. The circumstances are different, but there are relevant issues connecting both events (and other disasters).   That's been a long standing problem, and there have been numerous attempts to frame legislation to prevent it. None of these laws has yet solved the larger problem. Here's an interesting fact which may be dated but still has relevance. The side effects that you may see on labels, inserts and pharmacists' handouts are **95%** discovered via independent reporting by physicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, etc. The drug companies own reportage accounts for only one in twenty of the cautions.   It's interesting to think that the original objects were discovered and named by an amateur astronomer in a citizen science project. Not all science operates with huge budgets and bureaucracy.   From what I have read Muhammad was influenced by both Judaism and Christianity. I don't really know how much of each comes through in Islam.   Alternative futures. Would Islam have come into being without Christianity ? The classical Greco-Roman pantheon was pretty much past its best before date by the time Christianity rose to popularity. Would another of the mystery religions have served the same functions as Christianity ?   Thanks for the info.   Thank you.   Yes you are correct. I should have left the title alone rather than 'jazzing it up'.   No problem. It's something like hearing that 'Bill Jones' will be addressing the Chamber of Commerce annual meeting on the weekend. If you Google 'Bill Jones' you may find that a year ago he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Then you look at the phone book to get a visual on the problem.   The report comes from the United States Geological Survey, an organization that I don't think anyone could accuse of being unscientific.   Two things you should pay attention to in the references you provided. One is the history of the Energy Foundation China. It seems that this organization founded in 1999 (16 years ago) seems credible to not just the Chinese government but also to several US foundations who fund it. Also have a close look at a photograph of one Eric Heinz receiving an award from the Chinese government, last September I believe. Study that photo.  Now go to the cv of M. Heinz (French extraction now doing a post-doc in Germany). Look at his photo. Different person. Now examine the cv that M. Heinz provides. There's a lot of things there. One is that, if I presume M. Heinz spent the usual 10 years in getting his PhD then he would have been all of 14 years old at the time when he was a 'founder' of the Foundation as claimed by the Foundation's website. Now look at the cv once more. M. Heinz is a *computer graphics* specialist with no connection to anything remotely connected to energy or conservation. There is also **no** mention of the Foundation and indeed no indication that he has ever set foot off the European continent.  How did you confuse these two utterly different people who just happen to share the same name ?   I highly recommend subscribing to that site. Some may find it too 'popular science', but in my opinion it sometimes can be as good as Scientific American.   Yes, that's a good and striking presentation.   The Longshoremen have long been one of the unions with the broadest world outlook, and this is true to the tradition. What I don't see, however, is the duration of the strike. One hour ? Three ? Eight ? A full 24 ?   I wonder if there is some pun hidden in the name La Gordissima and the El Gordo lottery ?   Young, fresh and full of new ideas. Isn't it true that the 'peak years' in many fields occur earlier than people might suspect ?   No disagreement, but the use of the word "dissipate" brought a smile to my face.   But that's a 'forecast' rather than a report. A graph there shows positive GDP growth in the first quarter - not 'outstanding' but at least positive. No doubt the 'recovery' wasn't all it was cracked out to be in many ways. I'll agree with you on that.   Thank you. I've started to go through the various links, and it will take me some time to put it all together in my mind.   That's an interesting and perhaps troubling point of view, and I'm going to have to look further at it. One minor thing though, not the central point of your comment. I disagree that reduction of carbon emissions automatically means lower economic growth - even though energy consumption per capita is often used as equivalent to GDP per capita. Take say an increase in the production of solar panels which (hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This increase is in fact economic growth not its opposite. Take, for instance, the growth in electric vehicles which (again hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This may be any of three options, growth, decreased growth or no effect. The list could go on and on.   That's unfortunately a problem with *all* research that is scientific in nature ie reports confidence levels. In reality there is always uncertainty. It isn't restricted to demographic estimates. You will see the same thing in such 'hard' subjects as physics. The 'weight' of the electron, the magnitude of the fine structure constant, the speed of light, and so on and so forth. All of these have the old 'plus or minus' a given number of standard deviations when they are reported. It's the uncertain nature of an uncertain world.   Even better. Without janitors they'll have to pick up after themselves. *A collective cheer comes up from the long-suffering mothers of politicians*.   I'll have to try and look that up. Thanks.   The article that I recently read (see previous comment) is 'Climate Change and the Permafrost Carbon Feedback', Nature April 9. I hope the following [link](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v520/n7546/full/nature14338.html) will take you to the open access article. I sometimes have a problem with articles from the Nature Group being visible to me (I'm a subscriber) but not to others. Get back to me if there is a problem with the link.  In any case the major thrust of the article is that their models say that the carbon release from permafrost will be slow and gradual rather than fast and precipitous. I hope so.   That's what some may say. That opinion becomes more and more common the higher up you go in the ruling class. What I find encouraging, however, is that China *is* changing. The feminists are joining labor, environmental, human rights and literary activists, and more news gets out than in years past. I try to take an optimistic view of it.   I think you're right about the first statement, but I'm not 100% sure. I know nothing about the unemployment rates at various times, but I would imagine that they would have been highest right after the American invasion.   Yes it would be a positive feedback situation indeed. I think the uncertainty relates to the speed of release. I was recently reading about how new research suggests that the release would be slower than once thought. I'll try to dig up that article.   Thank you for the information. To me it's fascinating that RNAs in general are now such a rich field of research and even therapy.   Oops. Almost forgot to mention that English demands that the first word of *every* sentence be capitalized, not one out of three. My excuse is that that is punctuation not grammar. I still get a good mark in grade 3 English composition.   Grammar notes:  1)When using an equational sentence do *not* use a noun as the subject and an adjective as the object unless you mean to say that the adjective is a characteristic of the subject. 'Equality' is correct. 'Egalitarian' is not. Add the 'ism' to the adjective 'egalitarian'.  2)The proper contraction of 'It is' is 'it's' not 'its'. Its is the possessive of the neuter pronoun it.  3)Remember that prepositions are often necessary to make a sentence intelligible. Put the preposition 'of' in front of the neologism 'masculism'.   4)Remember that the verbal noun in English is formed from the adjective when it isn't formed from the verb itself. The proper verbal noun should be 'masculinism' rather than 'masculism' as the conversion of feminine to feminism demonstrates.  Yes, I *think* about it. I *think* that I am grateful that I'm not caught in a confused mind game of opposing one abstraction to another and thinking it means something. I'm grateful that I can look at actual empirical reality and use language for describing such and suggesting *real* changes rather than playing at philosophy.   Oh shit. I'm sorry. I forgot that whether a Nature publication article may be accessible to me as a subscriber it isn't necessarily so to others. Let's try the following: go to a popular science article in New Scientist (something like a British Scientific American) on this research. Use my posting history to find it if need be. See the article there that allows you to 'click through' to the article in Nature magazine. If you can't reach it that way please get back to me. I tend to alternate between laypersons' sources and the scientific literature itself depending on the character of the subreddit I am posting to.   It depends what you mean by "allowed". Am I going to interrupt taking a good shit when the 'Batsignal'  says an ancap has posted, run to the computer with my pants around my ankles, take an epileptic fit and ban some commentator because they are not 'pure' enough, yell a bunch of rhetoric that was old when I was young and feel self-satisfied that I have 'done something' ? No ! Obviously !   Why no ? It's far less to do with politics than with the fact that I was already a mature adult at the time when the average redditer's grandmothers gave birth to their parents. I have no illusions about the *grand importance* of the internet. I have no identity crisis to work out. I also have 'nothing to prove'. Adolescence  is long past. Quite frankly the competitions of various groups to attack and counterattack on the internet seems more than slightly childish to me. The ambition to be top gunslinger in an imaginary Dodge City has no attraction for me.   I'm tempted to pull the 'non-American' card out of the deck. This sub will hopefully concentrate on the anarchist movement *beyond the borders of the United States* as was stated in the intro above. The so-called 'ancaps' are one of the 'deviations' (to use an old commie word) that are incredibly unimportant the further you get from the Red, White and Blue. See the 99% number mentioned above. Exclude strange American stuff and that basically takes care of the ancaps in their 99%. Along with things like Maoist political correctness disguised as anarchism, silly dreams about the end of civilization and, to a lesser extent, the making of terrorism out to be an 'ideology' (which, of course, has a large component of zombie Maoism to it as well).   Personally the great majority of what I see from ancaps strikes me as a 'philosophy fad'. How many syllogisms can dance on the head of a pin. The American political equivalent of Thomist philosophy/theology. What is done is to take a few unexamined axioms and start deducing things *without any reference to the real world* - producing a *great ergo*. That's all fine and good for sophomore philosophy majors, but it is a howling emptiness out here.   This wasn't always the case. Let's go back to those maternity days of redditers' grandmothers. Take the period 1968 to 1972 for example as the New Left was spiralling towards the Maoist snakepit. At that time people like Karl Hess, Jerome Tucille and even Murray Rothbard in one of his earlier disguises were all gung ho for a right-left alliance, and there were issues at the time that were opportune for such an alliance. Those issues are no longer of any great importance.  The players, however, were quite different. On the right the 'paleocons' were much more of a factor than they are now. Nowadays the religious right is an incredibly more important factor they were then. On the left, confused as it was, the 'New Left' was a *much* more important factor than American anarchism is today, not that American anarchism doesn't deserve the adjective 'confused' as well. Take a broad estimate of how 'popular' anarchism is in the USA today, including all variant definitions of it. Got a number ? Multiply that by another than ranges somewhere between 100 and 1,000. I have my own crude estimate which is about 1 in 7,000. So, for every vague anarchist today there would be between 70 and 700 vague New Leftists. It's a different world.  I have my own ideas of where this sub should go. Perhaps I didn't make them plain enough in the introduction beyond the fact that what anarchists are doing and thinking in other countries can stand as a corrective example to the problems of North American anarchism, bringing it 'back to its roots' as you will.   Once more I run on at the mouth. I'll close with the fact that I recognize the *unimportance* of the ancaps and see little benefit in playing mudpie throw with them. Just like the fact that I think online diy pop psychotherapy disguised as 'anarchism' is ridiculous and is not any sort of 'anarchism' worth promoting. Similarly airy philosophy debates - the ancaps - are not a valuable use of time.   To use a couple of old metaphors, one of which was probably not current amongst urban people when it was popular out in the boonies; "The 'usefulness' of some things that pass as 'anarchism' in today's USA makes tits on a boar look like a Swiss army knife.   Can you elaborate ?         ? Honest to Christ there is nothing about this to be concerned about. If this ever gets out of the house of wild dreams don't forget that it will be built  by the Russian government and Russian workers and then operated by Russians. Actually Russians are very nice people, and they can accomplish miracles - *providing nobody is foolish enough to plan the miracle*. If Stalin hadn't had a nervous breakdown when the Germans invaded the troops on the front would never have made the miraculous chaotic withdrawal they did, and Germany would have won WW2. To quote Chekov from Star Trek, "Russia inwented bullshit".    That happens to be the criteria that many anarchosyndicalist unions have adopted, and some such as the CNT-E made and make an effort to have as few paid staff as possible. That, however, seems to be something quite separate from the question of whether paid staff of *another* union can sign up in the IWW. The matter of staff salaries is something that has to be decided in said *other* union, not in another one such as the IWW that works on dual card principles. It's definitely a good recommendation for any union, but it is quite separate from the question of IWW membership.   I doubt that any of the hugely overpaid executives of various business unions are panting at the door to take out IWW membership so the grossest possible example is moot. As to the lowly pen pushers, door knockers, flac runners, etc. it might be an idea to qualify their eligibility by income, but that becomes so complex that I don't think it is realistic.   Glad to have you onboard zeabu. Yes, it will be a great deal of work as I'm finding out, but I hope it will be worthwhile. You raised so many issues with your post, and I can't deal with all of them at once. Let's look at the first one you mentioned, the eternal and unrelenting posturing about violence towards the police in r/anarchism (and other places). It often seems like this is the *one and only* thing that ties the people that frequent such internet boards together. That and not saying 'bad words'. And, of course, a few other selected 'enemies'. All moral questions such as the compatibility of this sort of rhetoric with what anarchism is all about aside there are some practical problems with it that deserve attention.  Let's start with the aura of juvenile 'snottishness' that it casts on the movement. Most people reading such things would assume that the authors were either uncontrolled thugs - or much more likely - bratty 15 year olds showing off how rebellious they are. It creates a situation where the illusion of 'internet tough guy' becomes some sort of weird *principle*. It's mere showing off, and it paints anarchism as a phase of childish rebellion that people who become adults outgrow. Personally I want to present the ideology/ideals as a reasonable proposition that rational adults might want to consider.   There's another observation that people may and possibly usually draw from seeing the high volume rhetoric. That is the pretentious show-off nature it presents. Fake, fake, fake and fake. That may be an even worse image to present than being thuggish. The violent claims are wildly out of touch with anything that is even remotely possible.  Police tasked with monitoring this sort of thing know that very well. If they were under some delusion that the nonsense was imminent and actually meant - well they would put a rapid end to it. It also, however, provides other benefits to those it is supposedly directed against.  First of all information gathering. It's very nice to have lists of people that *might* in some unlikely future actually pose some sort of threat. Such lists can be used should 'sting operations' be considered to produce a news story that can be 'evidence' of the need for increased surveillance budgets. It can also be used as part of evidence in court where the actual charges are considerably less than the wild internet fantasies. It can be further used as leverage for blackmail should a law enforcement agency wish to recruit informers for more in real life situations. Useful, useful, useful. One of the things I find almost amusing is that the rhetoric spouters often assume that they have some miraculous ways of hiding their real identities from surveillance. Really ! In their imagination they think they can play in a league that only other large governments can do.  The violent rhetoric provides a 'badge of identity' that some think can serve as 'proof' of their 'sincerity', 'commitment', 'bravery' or even in a bizarre inversion of reality as proof of 'advanced political ideas'. In actual fact it is an illusionary substitute for the real commitment of examining reality and trying to devise realistic ways of changing it. Put briefly, it prevents thought. In some cases thinking or learning are the exact opposite of what some people want to do.  Using violent rhetoric that is popular in certain small and shrinking subcultures easily becomes a way of avoiding learning about what a subject such as anarchism actually is and trying to imagine ways of making it realistic and workable, recognizing the problems with that. Anarchism is like any other human endeavor. It is incomplete and has difficulties. You may have noticed that many of the dogmatic guardians of the absolute truth of *their* version of anarchism actually know almost nothing about its reality, philosophical or historical. As long as shooting off one's mouth remains their major activity they never will learn much.   This getting too long. One thing I'll close on. Hypocrisy is a character flaw that draws almost universal condemnation. It is emotional rather than rational, but the examples of long standing advocates of foolish actions who remain year after year, sometimes decade after decade, immune from the consequences of what they call *others to do* is disturbing. Having being an anarchist for decades I have had more than ample opportunity to observe such 'heroes'.    No problem. It certainly seemed related to genetics to me.   In the English language 'myth' can be used in a number of different ways, each of them with a set of different connotations. There are other words like this such as the word "theory". In the way the author uses the word it carries the connotation of 'wrong'. Others may use the word 'myth' in different ways such 'widely known story that gives meaning/justification to present social practices'. It may even mean a story that everyone knows is untrue but is widely known and appreciated because of some aesthetic appreciation. There are no doubt other usages that escape me at the moment.  The way the author uses the word is as follows. He takes Smith's speculations about a human propensity to specialize in the production of a certain item or services and says that Smith believed that this was a universal human characteristic. He then says that said products or services will naturally give rise to a 'market' where a surplus will be produced and said surplus will be exchanged for other items or services due to a 'human nature' that naturally gives rise to such a thing.  What the author is saying is that this anthropological speculation is taken as a axiom by most economists, an assumption that they do not question because it is 'self-evidently true'. The author further claims that the actual facts of anthropological study of various 'economies' do not support this axiom/myth/assumption. That is his argument. He makes the comparison to Sorel's idea of the 'myth of the general strike' that gave meaning to the activities of early syndicalists.  There are various points where one may argue with the author, but he does use the word in one of its accepted usages.   Time for a little geography lesson here. The article mentions a range of 7,000 km. Now suppose you put the fleet in the enclave of Kaliningrad, a crazy thing to do granted but not outside the range of possibilities for a Russian government of any sort. Now suppose there's big trouble on the Amur and Russia wants to airlift the troops to Vladivostok. They'll barely make it. St Petersburg to Vladivostok is about 6,000 km. They'll be running on vapour at the end. Suppose, on the other hand they want to face off Americans instead of Chinese. From Kaliningrad to the last Russian island in the Bering Sea is 9320 km. Well, they'll get past Lake Baikal, but somewhere over Yakutsk - down they go. If you go west instead of east the fleet would make Britain, but somewhere over the Atlantic....blub ! Could it reach Egypt ? Yes. South Africa ? I'd have to look.  "Anywhere in the world" is a gross overstatement.   Yes, the two exemptions have to be harmonized in some way. I think that the two clauses would be better than trying to fiddle with the unpaid or underpaid officials part. I haven't seen the part about the political party officers and officials. I'll try and find it.   I'm afraid that's easier said than done.   'Asshole', 'plumbing', 'bullshit': It all fits together.   The authors of the paper describe the implications of their work in veterinary and human medicine. Perhaps I made a poor job of saying that with my modification of the title. So I`ll expand.   The authors looked at an uncommon inherited neurodegenerative disease in dogs. They traced this disease to a missense error in the ATG4D gene which encodes a protease involved in autophagy. They speculate that their work may point the way to investigation of inherited human neurodegenerative diseases of presently unknown etiology. They also speculate that their canine model may be useful in designing and testing therapy for such diseases if they are due to errors similar to that found in these dogs. It also has veterinary application.   I hope this answers your question.   I see your point, and I remember that news now. I had instances in mind where the two unions were non-IWW. The Fieldworks situation isn't exactly one of another union though it certainly seems to be in the same category. In the old days we would have called Fieldworks a 'front' and that would be all that needed saying. In the days of highly developed NGOs and quangos perhaps there should be a neologism. Instead of 'quango' (quasi non-governmental organizations) perhaps 'quanuo' (quasi non-union organizations) would be appropriate.   Yes, the matter *should* be discussed at the branch level and the HQ informed. Perhaps there should be some standard questions to be asked in such cases. I have no idea of how you'd word a proposal that didn't simply forbid such organization efforts. Obviously the initiative should still remain confidential rather than public. I also think there should be a similar if less strict process in the case of general 'lefty fronts' rather than specific 'union fronts'. Think Sisters Camelot.  Definitely worth paying attention to.    Yes, anarchists can be highly moralistic at times, and the article perhaps dwelt on that. But as to your major point there have been many instances that I've seen where the staff of a union is represented by a totally different union, and labor disputes have occurred. I never dreamt I should keep count of such things over the years, but I am certain that I have seen more than 10. It's not like electing an atheist Pope. Personally I think the 'staff exemption' (unless a person is involved in hiring or firing ie is a manager) as it presently is should stand. It might be a missed opportunity at some time in the future. I'm undecided about your second point which, of course, follows from the first. Staffers are obviously the recipients of 'pay', substantial or otherwise.  Food for thought anyways. I'll try and get back to you on this.   No, I was just joking using cat breeds. I could have included Scottish (Fold) Gaelic and Egyptian (Mau) I guess. If you want to curse your cat, on the other hand, you have to speak in Russian Blue.    Two things about cats. One is that they only pay attention if you speak in Siamese or Persian. The second is that they *will* get revenge. But yes, it certainly does apply. In my opinion cats seem to be less trainable because they aren't 'pack animals' like dogs and humans. Not that they are antisocial. far from it as any owner of multiple cats can tell you. It's just that the motivation of "simply wanting to please" is less prominent in them than in dogs.   Very often the proper answer is *nothing*. I'd recommend *never* punishing unless the action has just happened in front of you. It just doesn't work. All it does is convince the dog that you are irrational. Here's a scenario that tells the story.    Dogs can be intelligent enough to learn a great number of words in a human language. In the case of some border collies this may amount to hundreds. What they are totally deficient in is *grammar*. Let's take conditional and future tenses along with 'moods'. If you say, "If you shit on the rug I will kick you outside". The dog hears, "Shit...rug...outside". In their mind the word 'shit' may be either an indicative or an imperative mood verb. The conditional tense doesn't enter their mind. Neither does the future tense of "kick". What the dog does is go over to the rug, shits on it and then goes to the door to be let outside. From their point of view they are doing exactly what you want. Because so much human-dog talk is imperative the dog takes it as such.   I swear to God that you're the first commentator who hasn't come from one of the less accepting states.   How on Earth does the City justify an *18%* interest rate ? That's heading towards payday loan territory.   You get what you pay for, and in this case the lobbyists get the better part of the Congress.   That's true. Smith's work has been the subject of a lot of misinterpretation. Both works are available on the internet.   Well yes, that's a legitimate question.   Sounds more like the computer than the site. I hardly have the most up to date tech either.   It's the same way in all federal systems. The USA may be a little bit more 'states' rights' than other federal countries.   You're welcome.   Thanks for the link.   It`s interesting to note that the limitations of `hair analysis, in particular the `false positives' have been known in an academic way for a very long time. The problems with this evidence are well presented in most forensic science textbooks. I can assume that many of the wrongfully convicted were represented by public defenders who gave their cases less attention than it deserved *or* that the defense budget in these trails was so limited that calling expert witnesses to dispute the prosecution's 'evidence' was not an option.  There are similar, if not as glaring, problems with fingerprint evidence, and, of course, 'lie detector' tests are notoriously unreliable. In an issue of The Match a few years ago Fred Woodworth gave a good overview of the problems with fingerprints.   Yes, anthropology/archaeology can often be that way. It's like a Sherlock Holmes  story, making conclusions from what looks like scanty evidence.   Yes, I guess it's the old 'headline writers' dilemma'. You have to be attention grabbing to draw in readers, but it's very easy to stray into overstatement.   I guess it depends on both where you live, where you work and what has happened recently. Someone who has to commute to work over bad roads or poor train service will be more concerned than others about infrastructure. Similarly people who live in communities that have recently had problems will be more concerned than others - even if say the water treatment plant is overdue to collapse as in the next hour. I think (?) that Britain has less of a problem with an infrastructure debt than the USA does, but I might be wrong about that.   Just an interesting blog piece about how far dual unionism *should* go.   Great. It's very much appreciated.  	199
 because he's asleep and there's a limited number.... hence why i asked xD   can someone get me a code for my friend? says i cant get another one on the same IP and he's asleep right now, if anyone can help me out that's be awesome of you :D      that looks fucking dope.   poop.    Anyone got a link to this unique TF build talk???   What we really said when we all started: "That champ's OP!"   Master yi with feral flare here. Get on my level.      It says that vandal twitch is on sale: http://gyazo.com/25e2e09742e682d655ed6db51c3b5fe1 However when i view the "on sale" tab in the shop it says that gangsta twitch that's on sale, not vandal.  Im on EUW im not sure it this is the same for all servers.   You won! :) check your inbox   I can pay it off, it's no worries. Appreciate the concern though :)   Meh, i'd rather make someone happy.   I accidentally bought 1 too many game Keys for Reaper of souls (it put me in my overdraft and now im going to have to pay my bank a fortune .) anyways i figured i may as well brighten someone's day by giving away the key.  Just leave a comment and i'll randomly pick one of you guys :) Good luck!   EDIT: Jojobtz won! Thanks for entering guys, sorry i couldnt give you all one :/   Im still waiting for an ARAM Team Builder, riot.   Really hope they fix the Zed ulti bug :/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UI3c3EY17o   Our clients all went black as soon as we got into champ select, anyone else had this problem? Now we get this :D http://i.gyazo.com/5ec486ee15fe51e096f570b8a3429ad2.png   i really feel like you shouldn't force us to pick what champion we'd like to play and instead allow us to just queue for the position we want so that it could be used for ranked draft pick.   I played 2 before i played 1 and i have to say it didn't really change much, i fell in love with BL2 and it was that that made me want to play BL1. The story is BL1 is SERIOUSLY BAD i learn almost nothing playing through the game and ended up googling most of it to piece the story together. So in conclusion play which ever you like first :)   Im down, add Fuzzy on steam :)   wouldnt this get me a VAC ban or something? is it legal basically?   Im sorry for your loss, i truly am :/ and yeah i agree the whole "it gets easier" shit people say is a bunch of bollocks, the highest suicide rates in america are white males above the age of 80 and people are saying it gets better!? That said I think you'll go far buddy, school was something i never did too well at, but keep studying hard if school is something you can deal with.  	22
    You know, I know better--and somehow, in my hurry to share it, speed got the best of me. This is a terrible error. Just terrible but it was up and I was off--forgive me!    Ha--awesome feedback, that!                     Great, well-written story            It seemed for a while like they were keen on pushing some boundaries with their APU but NVIIDA and Intel so strong on the co-processor/discrete GPU front, why bother, I guess is what they thought. Thing is, AMD developed a great deal of this well in advance of Intel--they just do a pretty shitty job of marketing.                           They just updated it with full confirmation--China is now far, far above the rest of the world in terms of its supercomputing might. the Cray Titan system at Oak Ridge Lab is a rather distant second... http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2013-06-02/full_details_uncovered_on_chinese_top_supercomputer.html?featured=top   Xeon Phi is really only meant for the high performance computing (supercomputing) market. At least at this point. It's real push seems to be on its lower end Atom-like chips.   An update was just posted a few moments ago next to the older ones. The editors secured a special draft report directly from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are expected to share full details about peak performance numbers (as confirmed) as well as full specs for benchmarks, application range, processor to coprocessor ratio, memory subsystem and ooo...the interconnect topology. Exciting stuff for the supercomputing world. They note they'll post this around 11 p.m. Eastern or midnight.            Wow--that summary (and its companion alliteration) is a better title than any of the others kicked out there so far.      That is a wonderful smile--brought one to me today.                  That would be...unexpected.   Thanks for the explanation Big Pervert.   Agreed--I respect that argument and agree that there are some Christian scientists that are....science-y. Still not sure how they pick and choose what to believe based on faith and what to believe based on reality, but to each his or her own. Thanks for calling me on that because you are right.   Yes, it's sort of like going to Salt Lake City to drink and gamble, but nonetheless..   I always shy away from CSM because of the name of the magazine, but honestly, they have some damn fine reporters that aren't all....christian-y. As counterintuitive as it may sound, their best reporting is often on science. Go figure.                  Baaaaa-dass.      It's hard to find things to give to friends that aren't sappy or generic. After searching for a while I decided that I could never express both humor and happiness with Hallmark junk. And so, yes. :)      My first thought upon seeing this... "Florida"                 	56
    I love that Usual Suspects scene. So bizarre it made it into the movie.    An even smaller festival that has been originally planned for the same dates. They were not happy.            Yes, he is evil.  	7
    If you search at Google the phrase 'car cigarette lighter mp3', you'll find a great variety about what you are interested in.     	3
 I am very *very* thankful for that. I was something of a borderline-skeptic before. If I wasn't *so sure* that she still existed in this universe somewhere I think I would be in a much worse state of mind right now. I really needed those last few hours together, and I think she knew that.     Thank you for your kind words. It's a slight relief to share the weight of it with people who will listen without judgement.    Thank you.   The doctors said she had an aneurysm, and the coroner listed it as "natural causes", which to me, just seems so baffling for someone her age.   She didn't smoke and she wasn't over weight. She did have just slightly high blood pressure which runs in her family, but she took good care of herself and ate a good diet.   She hadn't complained of any symptoms leading up to it so I don't know if she felt them or not.   Since she was asleep when it happened, I personally really don't think she would have felt any pain or anything like that.    Please do. I'm happy for you and your wife, it's a comforting reminder that joy and love still exist out there, even if *I* am sort of on pause for a bit.   Please, forget trivial disagreements, realize the value in every moment and make as many pleasant memories together as you can.    Thank you. I know maybe it sounds cliche, but writing about it has been a little therapeutic.   	5
 Will post my picture soon!    Any chance this came from someone in northwest ohio? I swear I saw this on a girls facebook page a few weeks ago....   Melatonin should do the trick, it works for me every time. Good luck- hope you find the remedy right for you. Cheers   That's okay then it will be all juicy and fun! I canny wait to see, thanks for sharing.    You go girl!    Passing my blunt to you. TOKE ON!    Ask someone to get it with a bobby pin or a comedone extractor.    Dem blackheads....   As an avid cocaine lover I want to lick that off of her then eat her pussy. She's not bad looking at all.   Congrats handsome! We all deserve happiness- even if it only lasts a moment.   Try  /r/beards !!  But I do love it!    Looooool hahahaha LOL    Heaven! Simply beautiful.   Yessssssssss!   When I was younger and played a lot of sports I had horrible acne on my back in the outline of my sports bra. One day I was trying to get rid of some of the acne and came upon this really massive bump under my skin. So I started to squeeze and squeeze, it hurt so bad. I called my mom into the bathroom and told her to get it out. Once it was fully out it was the hardest most odd looking thing just like that! It was the size of your standard pill capsul. I dropped it on the floor and it made a clinking sound. I'm assuming it was a really old blackhead built up from over the years!    LOLOLOLOLOLLOL   That's appalling.   Good luck resting in Peace you selfish asshole.   Its fake. And call me crazy but it looks like an image of Jesus in that round white thing when you zoom in, but I'm really stoned so that could be it.   I could do that! Lol   Perfect! I love getting ride of them!    I didn't 'force' him to do anything, he asked me to do it and then complained the whole time.    He wouldn't let me take an after picture, he was squirming the whole time and threw away the napkin! We didn't get a long hence the ex boyfriend part! Haha   I got them out with an extractor. And if you do not have one, the loop part of a bobby-pin works just as well!       I wanna get that    OHIO!  	26
 No...How do?      Yeah, it's possible but probably not true. That's a vast conspiracy with nothing to gain from it.     We're defined by our history?   I think that's where the thought comes from. We, as a country, are not patriotic. I think we display our patriotism by not being patriotic. Those of us who are more patriotic just moan about our country the least. But I don't like that I've lived somewhere for over 20 years and still can't pin down exactly what my identity, as a citizen of this country, is. What makes us different? And it feels like what does, or what did, make us difference is slowly being drained away. I understand all countries, thanks to the internet, are facing some form of homogenisation, and westernisation can't be disputed. But it's difficult to face that in, say, ten years, we'll be America 2, rather than England.   Because most of the documents I fill out (whenever I fill them out) ask me to put "White - British" or "Born in..." it's always Britain/British, so I say British.  English, then. What makes the English English.   I didn't no, we moved on after that I'm afraid. Next time I'll see her I'll ask. I should really have asked...   American Pyscho.  Eh...probably spoilers.  You know, I'm pretty ok with reading about torture. But I guess it was just so casual in this case. The rat and the cheese and the pipe (if you've read it - you know what I mean).  But what got me most was when he killed the dog. I think it's a human thing to dislike cruelty to animals (it's why dogs rarely, if ever, die in films). But Bateman killed that dog and his owner didn't even realise and when he did he was so upset. I mean - he didn't have long to be upset but still. I just went and gave my dog a big hug :(   That's an interesting take on it...Never heard that.    You're just saying we, as a nation, have become americanised. Which sadly so ridiculously true. I doubt if it had been so strong, I would have had to ask the question. As a culture we've pursued America, and except for our lack of talent when it comes to cuisine (because Beans on toast is perfect, why mess with what is excellent?), we're just a smaller America now.   The thing about the royal family is that the country that cares the least is England. We did a news segment in England about how much more news-coverage our own royal family got over seas.   The thing about Top Gear is that it started here, the original is best ;)    It's easy to ask the question. Solving it is another matter.   Traditionalism is a good word for it. Probably the one I'd have used if I was smart enough to do so.   Are you saying we all just go around like peacocks?   I think my first reaction was to deny this, but...I fell into the trap. You're right, haha.   The thing about the possibility of life is you have to consider the countless billions of *tiny* things that came together to make life on earth possible. And then there's the big things. A planet colliding in earth, breaking off the crust which formed the moon and threw us onto our axis. If Saturn wasn't where it was we might have been wiped out by an asteroid millennia ago. And then there's the small things. Countless small things. Billions. The size of the earth. The distance from the sun. The amount of water on the earth. If any of these things were out by 5% life on Earth could not exist.   Billions.  But then consider that there are *billions of* **galaxies** *each with* **trillions** *of stars and potential planets.*  The universe is simply too large, and there are too many things out there for life somewhere else to be *impossible*. I find the idea that the exact same conditions couldn't have been replicated ludicrous. There are enough galaxies for there to be thousands of earths, and millions of planets with alien-species nothing like humans, living on planets nothing like earth.  Yes there is life out there. It can't be any other way.   So I was talking to my friend, who is Romanian, and trying to decide what our cultural identity is as Brits, but we couldn't really decide. Other than bangers   mash and bathing in tea.   So, if you're British, what do you think sets us apart from other countries?  If you're not British, what do you think sets us apart from your country, that you do differently to us? And not just the base stereotypes, we're not all goofy, monocled gents.    Sometimes perhaps it's best not to prioritise writing. Perhaps it's best to take a break from writing, take a step back and collect yourself and your thoughts. Just read, or watch something, just do something easy. Stick to your exercise, but if you find that writing is inducing more migraines, best not to push it.   Of course if you do want to push it, and writing might make it better, I find goals don't help. Sensible goals or not, you don't always make them. I find it's best to just try and sit down, write for as long as you can until you've had enough, and be happy with whatever you've written. After all it's something, a paragraph is better than nothing.   Like I say: Progress for its own sake.   Someone who *actually writes*, and writes consistently.   It's true there are a lot of people who research and plan and they talk a lot about writing, and they imagine they are a writer, yet they get surprisingly little *actual writing* done. I've met people like that.   You don't have to write well, or be published, or for anyone to read it. Just write consistently, whatever you can and whenever you can. I think that's all there is to it.   I got out of a long term (5 year) relationship a few months ago. It was a massive adjustment to lifestyle.   I suppose you just gotta make it through the week. If you can postpone the official, end-all conversation till then, more's the better. Unless you just wanna get it over and done with, of course, which is understandable.  And people change, no doubt about that. I've got a lot of memories of my ex, we did a lot of things together (both our 18's and 21st, first-time holiday abroads, etc), but there's someone else out there who's worth more than that. I heard something once, which I hold on to; there's someone out there making memories right now that they will later share with you, when you're together.   Whatever Indie scene (game, movies) I really have never minded supporting it. I would feel happier paying your 25 or my 16 into the Indie world than into Hollywood. (Having said that, the AAA game industry is heading down hill).  I expect Cineworld do. There's a premium of about 2-3 extra for 3D and glasses purchase on top so that's a bit of a rip-off. But at least the more people who use cards, the more they *know* for certain they will take in each month. The cinema trade - another business I don't mind supporting.   I heard someone say on the internet before that love wasn't worth it, why would you want the pain? And the heartbreak? I said why wouldn't you? Why would you want to feel nothing? And go through life hollow? Why wouldn't you want to feel pain? I would rather feel pain than nothing at all.  Savour the end of a thing. Embrace that you're about to start a new chapter in your life, and - for better or worse - that's pretty exciting. Just remember that for all the pain, at least it's something, at least it's a drive to move you forward and keep you going. It's just about the fight.   Pain makes life worth it. Not just because without it happiness is meaningless. But because it's separate, and it owns itself.    My parents have all their old books from when they were children. I have a tatty copy of Romeo + Juliet signed "To Tracy, [my mom] from Mom, 1976". That's pretty cool.   A few of my Granddad's book are signed from my mom and my uncle from sometime in the 60's. That was pretty special. My mom (being the oldest) got handed down the books when he died last year. Most of them were signed as presents to him from when they were quite young.    I have the Cineworld card - I pay 16 a month, and then make sure I get my monies worth. At 9 a ticket, I only need to see two films to make that worth it. Which for me is no challenge.  The thing about where your money goes depends on where the movie came from. Let's accept the majority of movies come from Hollywood, and screw them - they're rich enough. Look at Indie films, or British films, and devise how much money goes to them. They tend to get limited releases, and odds are they paid a lot of money to get that film into cinema.   Honestly, it's hard to say where the money goes.   I've grown up on consoles that's the only reason. It's what I am and maybe always will be used to.   And thanks, I really want the game, damn my job!    "so it goes."  I got that tattooed on me. This book is brilliant, I don't need to tell you why because others have done that for me. However; watch John Green's crash course on the novel and re-read it. Whole new excellent perspective.    Crap laptop. And I prefer the controller, Kinect and achievement system of the Xbox. I'm a console person =D   I can, at times, be very impatient. I want things, I get them. Indie games have their place, and I appreciate them just as much, but at times I need a AAA game, and I want it immediately.   Xbone =]   ProjektRed, man. What bugs? ;)   Convincing myself that *The Witcher 3* isn't a priority, might push my will-power to the edge.      It's a small price to pay for the size and brilliance of the games we get.  Except in Bloodborne's case. Fuck those loading times.   I may have missed out on the days of the arcade games, but I'd happily swap that for Oculus Rift, Band Hero, Kinect and open-world exploring.  I respect the previous generation of games, and those that came after it. But I wouldn't trade in what we have, and where we're going (the technology) for anything.   Was meant to find out today if I'm losing my job or not. We were told on Monday some of us were being let go, so it's been a pretty shit week. Been trying to push to find out, and hoping the people in charge get off their asses and tell us. Our manager (who's job is also at risk) was pushing to find out today. He did find out, and they know which of us are being fired, but they won't tell us until Monday evening. And they forbade our manager from telling us too. Because bullshit.   I am swaying towards Keyes, I must say...      Crash Bandicoot, ofc. Spyro, the original Rayman, Space Jam for PS1 was killer. Croc for PS1.   I only had a PS1 as a child.    My height =[  Being a short male is not the best.   Might I recommend a different way to edit? Go through it now just for grammar. Nothing big, just the odd run-on sentence, and a few misplaced comma's, small, grammatical errors that are nonetheless important. You want these things fresh in your mind to edit them, so they make sense how you want them.  After that, give it *at least* two weeks. More is better. You want to be as far away from the novel as possible for when you edit. And after that time, you'll be glad you cleaned up the grammar because it suddenly makes a *lot* more sense. Which is good because hopefully you've forgotten about most of the novel from your separation.   Yeah I heard about them eating their siblings in the womb. Always reminds of that king in Stardust who kills his siblings to gain the throne...   It doesn't surprise me in the least this exists. Thanks, this will entertain me for some time now =]   Romantic grotesques?    I'm not sure what the system is over there (being English) but it's worth looking into leaving the union if you don't want to be a part of it. Save yourself some money. Double check your contract - if they're taking money out, that isn't for the state, it should be stated in the contract.   Can you not opt out of the union? I've had a few jobs and never joined a union, but if there is one I'm always *offered* to join. They never just take money out of my pay for it.   I wonder what the statistic is for global pizza consumption. Someone needs to look into this...   British =] I've heard of Saran Wrap but only in passing. Not enough to say what it is.   How you finding Neverwhere? Read any of Gaiman before?   It's probably a touch more romantic to say the cathedral is decorated with 'gargoyles' rather than 'grotesques' though. Even though grotesques is a much better name.   Really, really disliked this book.   I'm not sure what Saran Wrap is...Is it cling film? It sounds like cling film...   That it, haha.   I'm still more scared of spiders though...   Heard that one before. Unsurprising.   Thanks, never too sure on the exact definition of a planet, or dwarf planet.  And what about when the moon frees itself of our orbit?    Praise be to him.   I always found it fascinating that a moon is simply anything that is within the pull of a planet's gravity. Pretty interesting to know our own moon isn't a moon.   Absolutely *anything!*    Search your brain (no googling!) for the most interesting and, possibly, mostly unknown fact you can come up with and drop it below! Then we can discuss it :D.   Just wander directly into the realm of fiction. Don't try and ground it in science. Create your own, entirely fictional, technology. Such as the Mass Effect gates, or the portals from the Portal game series, or the Halo Rings (Man...I play too many video games). If you're too worried about your book aging, go that way.   Harry Potter, of course.   Because there was only so many races. Men, Dwarves and Elves.   As far as the rings of power go, the One Ring doesn't count. The others were created by Celebrimbor but the one ring wasn't.   I expect Tolkien had a very specific reason, and it most likely died with him.   Also; there was more than three races of elves. The rings were made before the Third Age, so before the obvious division of the Elves (Lorien - Galadriel. Mirkwood - Thranduil - and Elrond.) When the rings were made the houses of elves were crazy everywhere. There were 5 families of dwarves to begin with, and they remained the most popular. Durin (the line of Thorin in the film and book versions of the hobbit). And men had pretty much been devised into Numenor. Though that race was split into two. Sauron does gloat however that of the 9, 3 were Numenorean lords.  It might been a display of power. The Elves were the most powerful, and it would have been risky to control too many. This is less true for dwarves, and really not at all true for men.   Popping in for a cuppa with the queen.  But seriously there's nothing to do in London.   ;) isn't it the best song?   Thing's don't get sucked into black holes, they fall into them. (No, I don't quite understand the distinction but yeah...)  At the centre of every galaxy, including ours is a *super massive black hole*. That's why galaxies have such bright centres, stars are being pulled in. Of course, we can't see black holes, so how do we know there's one at the centre? There are stars that we can observe moving at impossible-to-fathom speeds, being flung around a single point. There's nothing that can move such a large, dense star, unless it is a super massive black hole. And the star is being slingshotted around it.   My only best friend is a little orange envelope :( I don't get to see him very often though.   Taken as a recommendation on Reddit. I love McEwan, but this might be unlike anything I've ever read before. But he is such a fantastically brilliant writer.   George Ezra.  *Oh, so he's only like 20. And he's white...well buggar me...*   That would so absolutely change everything. That's a really interesting concept - that pockets of the universe were different ages. And being as we can't totally explain gravity, it might not be wholly farfetched either. That would mean we could observe not only a different part of the universe, but a part of the universe different in time and perception to our own.  *And still before we find intelligent life!*   *Parts of the universe could be older than other parts!*   That's what makes it super fascinating  The jump between the Sloan Wall and the Hercules wall is massive. I doubt that even if scientists predicted something bigger, they wouldn't have jumped to 10 billion light years across. By our own understanding of the universe something so large ought to be impossible. Nothing that big could have grown in such a (relatively) short amount of time. Maybe there's pockets in the universe where things grow faster than in other areas. Or the universe is just vastly older than we thought it was.   25 - Entire works of Edgar Allan Poe.  20 - S (or Straka) by JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst.  18 - leather bound edition of *Aesops Fables*  18 - clothbound 2011 edition of *The Picture of Dorian Gray*   The Triceratops and T-Rex lived further apart than Humans and the T-Rex.  Cleopatra lived closer to time of the moon landing than the building of the great pyramids.  Recently (unless it was a hoax), a new *biggest-thing-in-the-universe has been discovered. Previously it was the *Sloan Great Wall* - a cluster of super galaxies stretching 1.2 billion light years across. (No, you cannot fathom how big that is). Recently, the Hercules borealis wall (or similar name) was discovered, a cluster of super galaxies measuring **10 billion light years across**. Why so significant? Because in a universe *supposedly* no older than 14 billion years old how can something have become so large? The discovery of something so big could totally change how perception of the age of the universe.   I spent a year editing my own novel, read through it and edited it more than ten times. I was pretty damn thorough. And it's vastly changed, almost all of it. And I like the beginning, and it works well. But when I get to reading the end the difference in style and how much of a better writer I am at the end is so noticeable. I don't notice a sudden change half-way through the novel, or anything like that. It's a smooth flow. I actually quite like seeing how I had grown over the three years it took to write. Like a growth chart.  I mean, the book is shit, but at least I have visible proof it made me a better writer.   So I was going to say something positive, but it was only what everyone else has said. So let me reinforce it, you sound like a great partner. Also, she seems to be doing pretty successfully, which is absolutely great to hear. You must be quite proud.   Kudos. Most I could do if one came so close and scream and run like a little a girl. If I was on a chair I would probably tilt backwards and floor myself. I would panic like hell.   I sense sarcasm but I feel like I do.   Crying with fear. Literally just had a panic attack. I need help. All I did was squish it with my shoe.   But hey, I guess, when I can breath I might sleep now. Probably not. Terrified still. No idea why.   It's gone midnight and I'm sat waiting for a spider to appear to kill it. I can't sleep. Not well.   Yeah, moved back into my room. Hopefully it won't come back *back* to me.   Don't worry. I know the fear is absolutely irrational. I know it won't harm me in any way. I just detest them.   Can't. Stepdad is asleep in the next room and he's...let's just say he wouldn't take kindly to it.   It's on a new carpet, I can't squish it against that. Also, that involves being close enough to ensure the job is done properly. Or else allowing it to run away to god knows where - probably where I won't ever get it.   I'm not so sure...This one had shifty eyes, and eight of them...   Into my sister's room is it.   It's not very small either. Thick and black and just sat there, on the floor. I had planned on trapping it under a bowl for the night, but couldn't even approach it to place said bowl. Far too risky. And I don't want to sleep in there with it either. So...here I am. If I hadn't stayed up *tonight* and tried to finish my book this wouldn't be a problem.  Christ, I hate spiders. Oh, my fear of them isn't normal. It surpasses plain phobia. I really, *really* need to see a doctor.   Edit: IT IS HERE. IT HAS FOLLOWED ME! IT HAS SMELT AND SEEKS MY FEAR!  It came out onto the landing. I stared at it for a while, watching it, as it circled around and came closer to my room. I threw a show at it to little effect, and when I tried to step on it, deciding to act rashly rather than further succumbing to fear, it ran away. I screamed as it ran off, hiding now in my sister's room where I won't follow it. I could cover the bottom of the door, securing it, but not without risking the thing running out whilst I do so. That would too close. Now I am shaking, sat here watching my sisters door for it to return so I can end this. It is 12:30PM. I have work at 9. I am shaking from fear. I won't sleep with it still alive.   You could ask me, I'd be interested in a decent project.  I might PM you.   That does sound good. I've added it to a list on Goodreads of all the books I need to buy. Unfortunately I bought six books last week, and that on top of the more than ten I already own but haven't read. So I suppose I won't be buying it just yet. haha. I have book-buying issues.   Like I said; not as elite is it perhaps ought to be.   *The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman*  *The Virgin Suicides, by Jeffrey Eugenides*  *On Chesil Beach, by Ian McEwan*  and, *The Ocean at the End of the Lane, by Neil (The God) Gaiman*  Fairly varied. And there are books that have come close. *Slaughterhouse-5*, (I have a quote tattooed on me). *The Kingkiller Chronicles.* And *1984*, amongst others.   Not sure about changes to the current one but I can help you with the next...   Well if you're interested in having someone write, or edit/proofread I would be super happy to help. If you're looking for someone...   Friendly advice: stahp! Just write!   Being sick makes you exempt from needing to be productive.   Get both =]   That's always helpful, so long as know what words to put down. That's the important bit. The writing.   Yeah I was at that stage.  *I'll never make 30k words....I'll never make 60k...80k...100k...Damn this never ends!* (Finished at 125k).  But 85k in 5 months is bloody stellar. Took my three years to write mine.   We'll be masters of VR and hover-boards.   You certainly aren't the only one, but that doesn't make it any smarter. You'll never finish anything this way. Finishing and then perfecting is how it ought to be done. Rather than perfecting on the way - as you write.  Sure you'll have a perfect sentence. But that is all you will have. A sentence.   My grandma's much the same. I wouldn't have any hope to actually get her to play a game. Neat thought though.   Man if I could get my Grandma to play some games with me I would be all over that. That would be interesting.   Good day so far for you, no complaints =]   Took the place of favouritest ever novel alongside two or three others. It's not as elite a group as I'd like haha.  Gaiman is my favourite author. He is a god.   That's all it takes =]   I woke up this morning thinking *"Right, time to kill of my 7-year old sister,"* and when I read what I had wrote about her that hit me.   The best line I've ever written is six words, and hits me everytime I read it. (It's the very last line in my novel, no you can't read it :D).  But someone said "No surprise to the writer, no surprise to the reader. No tears from the author, no tears from the reader." What you feel, the harder bits to write, put that into your writing, emote, and it will make it all the better. Part of being a writer is utilising that. If you feel for your characters, the audience will. If you don't care about your characters, how can you ask an audience to?   Now go get your ass in gear! If you want to talk to me, I'm just an orange-envelope away =]   I found that writing a short story in the same universe as my own novel was a huge help. Almost to the point where parts of my book *couldn't* exist without it. It was vital.   If you're struggling to write, write a short story, then if you drop it, it doesn't matter so much. You can evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, and get a feel for your world.   Writing is just that. Writing. It's enduring the worst day and sitting your ass down and writing. It's realising that inspiration and motivation are entirely *useless*. You will never be inspired or motivated to write, but you just gotta do it. There's nothing more to it. Sitting down and let the words flow.    I agree with all of that. But for the actual creative part, the fun part of coming up with new things, and not knowing exactly where my characters will go, or how I'll write it, what I'll come up with, I love that. That's just the appreciation of literature. But, of course, it is all terrible without editing.  I edited my own novel for a year. That included removing 18k words and reading it over more than ten times. Three times out loud in its entirety. That sure as hell put me off editing.   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEEjKu_ukYY3L-eKonCdj9w  This guy's a start. He's one of the biggest I've seen. Following links from his channel will set you on the right path to discovering lots of other book vloggers as well.  Of course there's no guarantee they'll do you a favour, but where's the harm in trying?   I would recommend whatever works for you.  I find that whenever I'm not particularly in the mood to write I just sit down. And three sentences in I'm lost. People always complain about writer's block without even trying to do anything about it. Just sit down and write and once you've got a little bit down you'll get lost in the story, and then that's it, you're writing.   If you're only writing novella's there's no pressure to write a lot at all because it won't take as long to finish. If you feel happier just sitting down writing no more than 300 words, that's fine. If you want to write one hundred, and take a break and write another hundred, do so. If you sit down for a while and stop and realising your approaching 1k, I wouldn't be surprised, but that's great. Do whatever is easiest. If you want to try for a larger amount, but can't reach it, be happy with whatever you've done. And strive for a little less tomorrow. Or push your damn hardest to reach your word-goal.   So far, so good! The art style is fantastic.  Please tell me you're looking for a writer to work with you on the project!  (Why are you an egg being held in someone's hand?)   Sitting down and actually writing is what it's all about. Thinking about a thing is easy, writing is hard. Though it's super good to get ahead on the basis of the story. Nothing will come of it without those ever-so vital words.   Personally not a MOBA fan, but wahoo to higher productivity than normal! =D   I like to write every day. Not always possible. But I try. And if I do sometimes it's only 300-500 words. A paragraph. But that's why 1500 words is so important. You can get that in one day, or write little bits every day and still get it done.  We're the opposite. I dislike editing. I like actually writing. Editing is just painful and tedious.      Sounds like you did a lot of nice things for your mom. Pretty productive already, done quite a lot in a fairly short time - always a bonus! =]  	112

Cool. As long as its your tax dollars that pay for illegal immigrants to go to school while American citizens struggle to pay the costs of college and everything else then I'm alright with your delusional plan. Your tax dollars and money out of your pocket for non-Americans, not mine.    Yeah, but it bashes views that reddit feels are held by fat redneck Republicans so the stupid post stays and will frontpage. The wise teenage liberals of reddit probably are cool with ~~their tax dollars~~ their parents' tax dollars putting illegals through college when many American citizens - not illegal Hispanics - can't even afford college themselves and need to scrounge tirelessly for an education. Brilliant. Well done, wise teenage redditors who pay little to no taxes. Read the article and then reevaluate your delusional political beliefs.  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/nyregion/financial-aid-for-undocumented-students-no-longer-discussed-in-hushed-tones.html  When even the liberal commenters in the NY Times are outraged about illegal immigration then you really know how bad the situation has gotten.    You are the bravest redditor of the day for posting this may may attacking anti-science Republicans on reddit. You deserve a medal of honor for this may may.      I love how reddit's wise teenage liberals think that all of the illegal Hispanic immigrants pouring over our wide open borders are hardworking. Someone offer proof of this and I'll shut up and upvote this stupid cartoon. And no, the top comment and anecdote of this thread is not proof of anything. There are just as many criminal illegals and deadbeats pouring into these country for free shit as there are ones who work just as hard as you and your neighbor. We don't need these people here for anything. At all.       YOU GOTTA KEEP 'EM SEPARATED.

It's easily one of the biggest circle jerks on reddit.  The sub consists almost entirely of image posts because the mods don't allow self posts. I'm not sure what anyone would expect discussion-wise when this is the case. Sometimes articles are posted to TIA and there is good discussion but those posts are in the minority. If the mods want better discussion then they should allow self-posts but they don't want that. We see self-posts in this sub all the time and there is better discussion so I don't see why we can't have that in TIA. The mods just don't want it. This wasn't always the case there.   Hieroglyphdicks   Time is a flat circle.   So instead of looting and destroying the property of a group of rich White guys from Oregon they destroyed the property of the Black owners of a local mom and pop store? Sounds about right.   https://i.imgur.com/q6oaVhc.jpg   Yeah but girls don't have the societal and necessary impetus to approach men to get any sort of romantic or sexual gratification started like in a bar or a club. Very few girls like you described exist and behave that way. There are more than a few unattractive guys that behave in an awkward and uncool manner but feel the need to try to engage because both society and women put that burden on nearly all males, both attractive and unattractive alike. It just so happens that the former has to do it a little bit less while the latter has to engage with women 99 percent of the time if they want anything to happen. Most of the time this doesn't end well for them while most of the time it ends well for attractive men.   It's much easier to get labeled as a creep if you're a man who fucks up socially in romantic situations than it is for a woman to be labeled the same.    Do you want more ISIS recruits?

 How do you prove good cinematography?

Everyone in this thread seems to think I don't have very good taste in cinematography. Yes, I have seen many, many films; but Interstellar has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Some of my favorite DP's include Roger Deakins, Emmanuel Lubezki, Robert Elswit, Conrad L Hall, Vittorio Storaro.    Some of my favorite films feature astounding cinematography these include American Beauty, Blade Runner, Alien, No Country For Old Men, There will be blood, Fight Club, Zodiac, Se7en, Inglorious Bastards and many others.  It's just my opinion, but I think Hoyte van Hoytema did a very good job in this film along with Chris Nolan.      Life.   Her natural environment is the kitchen.      You make a solid point.   Stand by me (JB HI FI limited addition. ALL STAR WARS DVDS LIMITED EDITIONS Forrest Gump Special edition Beowulf Charlie   the chocolate factory Pearl Harbour  The Corpse Bride The Nightmare before christmas Slumdog Millionaire The social network   For those of you who have seen it, why is it getting bad/mixed reviews? What's wrong with it? How could they improve it?   Seen it. Love it.   There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary   Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, dry, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it. Not to mention the top-notch voice acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette and Barry Humphries.  [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_Max)         Why all the hate for daredevil?   ahhh.....YES.   Direction is kinda weak at times and 'one note'.  The acting is pretty good.  Writing can be a bit flat at times but overall it's ok.  The cinematography...do I have to say anything? Roger Deakins yet again delivers a visual feast, every frame is crisp and balanced, the lighting is beautiful; it deserved that oscar nod.   Pumped for the movie?   Did you guys like it or not?    Tell me a bluray that you are willing to trade, the condition and region code.  This is REGION B only and in pretty good condition.   This just made my day.   Blade Runner and The Empire Strikes Back.   I totally agree.   Adaptation.  Irreversible  End of Watch  Anything Wes Anderson  Mary   Max (HIGHLY recommend)     Paul Giamatti.  Imagine [him](http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/tvbizwire/paul-giamatti.jpg) in full pennywise mode.    So lets just start by saying that my eyes get really itchy when hop into bed. I don't know what is is but as soon as I lay down, they get all tingly and irritated. So most nights I lay there rubbing my eyes for about 5 minutes or until I think enough is enough.  I then usually stumble out of my room into the kitchen to get a cold flannel to put on my face. The previous night I decided to put a flannel in the freezer to put on my face/eyes if they become itchy, which they did.  So I got into the kitchen and staggered over to the freezer, seeing nothing but colors and shapes from the good, vicious and long rubbing that I gave them (come on it feels good), I opened the freezer (all lights were off btw) and grabbed the first thing that felt like a nice thick frozen flannel. I then zombie-walked my way back to my room and put the ice-cold solid piece of heaven on my face.   Well I woke up the next morning; the pillow was red and so was most of my face.  I thought I was in that scene from The Godfather, seriously, I was shitting bricks. I then feel a soggy, warm and wet sludge-y like presence against my upper back/neck area.  Well what do you know? It was the steak I was supposed to cook the previous night, wrapped in glad/plastic wrap. Most of the blood had leaked out from it and onto my face, pillow and some of my sheets.  And of course the REAL frozen flannel was sitting in the freezer where I had left it. I swear it winked at me.   Are they? I didn't know that.      I would be great if you guys could give me some recommendations and advice, a link to a website that sells them would be great as well. Thanks in advance.   Google Images and trailer screenshots...         Why thank you   It does a little.      Wow dude, thanks for all that advice. Just a few questions:  What did you mean by 'some shitty bundle?'  Also, do know know any websites/books/resources that you think is a good starting point for somebody who wants to be a cinematographer?       Can you guys give me some advice and point me in the right direction? It would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!   Never seen The Breakfast Club.  Goodbye all my karma   That's the best damn summery I've ever heard.       I love every single one of PTA's films. Sure he's not for everyone, but he's my kind of filmmaker; dialogue heavy, contain dense and relevant themes, real and exuberant characters and top-notch writing and directing.   He's certainly not for everyone.   Not a PTA fan?      Good to see Inherent Vice on the list, was not expecting it.   Tell me, is your father a happy man?     Just looking for anything that analyses the work of PTA. Please leave a link in the comments. Thanks!   In the T.V section, when I saw the words 'True' and 'Detective', I jizzed.   Why's that?   What did you think of Inherent Vice? (I'm asking everybody this)   She was a demon.   Nice to see Inherent Vice high up on the list. What did you like about it?      I have no idea why you are being downvoted, you made a sold point.   What about pro feminist? Because I've heard some people call it that.   Same here.       This thread is turning into the official discussion page for 'Inception' when it was released.   WHY are you getting downvoted? That's really quite pathetic.   I prefer them both the same, they are completely different genres.   For me it was Killer Joe, Se7en and The Chaser.   My vote for Zodiac made it in! :D      Yes! Thank you for commenting!

Oh, you have NO idea      District fucking 10.   This is the last director I'd expect to direct this.  Nonetheless, he is a fantastic director. Just watch Prisoners.    No Country for old men.

Rosamund was ROBBED.   Look at his face, and imagine him in clown makeup.

You are on reddit movies my friend, it's just what's going to happen.      You're judging from a picture? That's mature.   Why the hell are you getting down-voted?   This is awesome news. But not as good as the day when I open my r/movies feed and see 'District 9 sequel announced'.   Michael Bay   Why can't this be the bluray cover?   Yeah this has been questioned over and scrutinized for years. I don't actually know, I think it's just an easter egg.   That's a dick thing to say.   It's annoying because I can't prove to you that I have not downvoted anyone on this thread.   Well for starters, and I forgot to mention this, but Cuaron did not deserve Best Director, that should've gone to McQueen.  Best Picture nod for Gravity was, to the academy, a no-brainer but come on BEST picture? That nomination should've gone to Prisoners. An Bullock nominated for best actress? really? That nomination should've gone to Emma Thompson or someone whose performance was better. When I said 'that years gravity' to 'Shakespeare in love' I did mean nominations as well as wins.   It did win other awards...   Sure It deserved awards, just the amount that it won. There were much better films in terms of story, substance and acting.   Peanuts? more like the small bits of salt that are ON peanuts.   Such a rob   That year's 'Gravity'   Any move that won a major oscar like best picture, actor, director, whatever, just leave it in the comments :)   I was thinking L.a confidential for a sec before you said it was released within the past few years.   Yeah that 'joke' almost made me fall out of my chair, I was so not prepared for something so....crude? But yeah I didn't know what to think. That's not to say she didn't have a good ass!   I love it. It's such an adventure.   The church scene is easily one of the best action scenes of the year.   Starting a Bluray collection and I just want to ask r/movies what are some essential movies to own on Bluray?

I'll be sure to do that next time    Thanks so much!   Thank you!   I remember watching this trailer that was a spin off/parody of the cheesy 80's retro action movies, it was a bit like Far Cry 3: Blood dragon in its style and in the trailer it was about a vigilante cop type-a guy who is sent back to fight the Nazis but is instead sent back to the dinosaur age. I know it sounds really weird but the trailer was awesome and anyone who knows about this movie please comment the title or link to trailer in the comments. Much appreciated :)   This may become the highest grossing film of all time.   I don't see why you were downvoted for that, you made a very solid point. Upvoted :)   Detective Loki from Prisoners.   With Reddit I really feel a sense of community and I can't get that by just searching it on Google. I want people's personal opinions and examples of what Neo-Noir is and sure I can find that on Google but like I said, I'd rather ask r/movies. Also just looking through your comments you really do look like you enjoy condescending and picking apart peoples opinions, so please, don't get angry over little stuff like this. :)   Holy shit thanks for that!!!   Well do you have a better choice?    I could search it on Google, but I'd rather ask /r/movies instead. I've been hearing those two words ever since I really started having a passion for movies, and I never really payed attention. But now I think it's about time I started to find out what it is. Please don't down vote just because I don't know what it is.  	137
 Not sure why you were down voted.  I have many friends that are exactly what you described, people that never leave.  I decided, fuck that, saved up my money and moved out of the country.  Its just all about making the decision to actually do it.  Edit: spelling   What is this "athiests" you speak of?     The only reason I clicked comments was to upvote this inevitably posted comment.   That's so meta...    Personally I'd be thinking about the first few weeks after our wedding when we'd start talking about fetishes and sexual boundaries/secret desires and all that and I'd tell her how much I want to give her an enema. To be clear I'd want her to privately give herself an enema first so there's no scat then fill herself up with water again along with 3 movie sized bags of skittles and invite me in the bathroom, I just want her to squat over me in the bathtub so I can stare and poke at her anus as she sprays a jet of skittlewater into my mouth as I wildly jack off as the crack of wet skittles spraying off my teeth creates a machine gun sound effect, then finger her as I lick out her gaping anus as it twitches and quivers. She's a bit weirded out at this but she loves me and knows this fetish is something I've been fantasizing about since I was 12. Plus we're married and have a newborn together, what is she going to do, divorce me over this? She's more than welcome to peg me afterwards or any other fucked up fetish most guys would balk at.  That is my personal favorite.  I still can't stop laughing   My best friend has referred to Christmas as Newton Day since we were 14.  I have sent him a "Happy Newton Day!" text now for a decade.     losing the game, checking in.   My friends and I also saw Jawsome very often, but we have now incorporated more words into this style.  Words like "Jawful" or "Jawstruck"  "Man, I am jawstruck by how jawful this movie is."   http://www.unitedwisconsin.com/recall-offices  This is a list of recall offices, and many union halls in cities/towns also have outposts where you can sign them.  That's where my parent's and siblings signed.  As I am living out of country, I can't sign. :(   But promote this list of locations if more people you know are unaware and wish to sign.   YUP - Love me some Decemberists, last show I saw before I moved out of the country.  So good.      Like I said different strokes for different folks! :) Have an upvote.   Definitely love some Tool.  Maynard is a genius.  Puscifer and APC are rad too.   Obviously everyone has different tastes in music.  Different strokes for different folks.  So I guess I will start, bands I listen to that really just rock my socks and maybe more people should have their socks rocked by: The Decemberists and Limbeck.  Both awesome, in my opinion.  What about you guys?   Agreed, resin taste awful.  It was simply a last resort when the city was dry...   Was doubtful, then it lined up with the entire "The King is Dead" album by The Decemberists.  Really cool.  Rad find, man.      /Longtime   Ed Gien and Jeffrey Dahmer were both from Wisconsin.  ALL WE EVER GET IS CHEESE!     I am from Wisconsin, and both of my parents work in cheese factories.  Stereotype proven.   My exact strategy last time I played, led to my eventual victory after the 9 hour marathon game.  But sure enough...Australia's owner got second place.  	21
 You have Dany in both groups as evil but your entire basis for choosing Euron for the third dragon is that one of the riders *has* to be evil?   Iroh was never portrayed as a villain really. Dat Zuko character development doe...   Explain how this is a human rights abuse, please.   I just don't think you did a very good job of communicating your thoughts to the rest of the class.  But we can go with it being too complex if that's what makes you happy.   What are you talking about?    No Harden is a plus doe!   While I completely agree he's acting unprofessionally, he can't just "go to another team". He's under contract for 3 years - a non cap friendly contract - so it's unlikely he goes anywhere.  My guess is he's getting bad advice from his uncle again. Really really bad advice.  Stop being a baby Andre, you signed a contract, honor it.   Oh piss off. There has always been editorial news and 'real' news. Not advocating Fox and Friends but it's not supposed to be a 'real' news show. It's full of human interest pieces and editorialized content.  There are tons of shows - that make up the majority of the air time - that are dedicated to 'real' news.  You can find an example of this type of show in every single country.   Science museum is close as well. And Rothko is worth a look and is a minute walk from Menil.    galleria mall.       You're not worthy of calling yourself a lefty.   On the other hand, 16 year olds dude.   Well at least you weren't indoctrinated.   Bad sport.   Yeah because seeing the Pacers in the finals would be so much fun! Weeeeee!   Come off it man, I was just joking.   One of many things that make him so endearing.  I love that he doesn't sound like an actual black person and I can relate to him on a 'normal' level.   As a spider, I couldn't agree more.    He didn't run a third time because he ran for President of the United States, which he was also elected to twice.   He's under contract (not a cap friendly one either) for the next 3 years. Don't expect his situation to change.   I have an N64 in it's original box with the original plastic stuff and manuals (pretty sure). box isn't in the best quality but I'd consider parting with it. Also have golden eye 64 with box but the box is in bad condition.   I think the logical thing would just be to eat your eggs in the 5-10 minute time period you have before they start to lose their heat.   "He's come to rape the girl, don't let him escape the place with the girl"   "the product is gluten free"  way to get on the health buzzword bandwagon. great marketing instincts, kid.   nope, so you should probably whine about it.   Nobody thinks 5 hours of TV isn't couch potato status...   You might like Shy Boys :  http://open.spotify.com/album/4c14HIsehJaxaNQAkhUQBP   havin' fun?   lol!   Classic christophvel   It addresses the fact that less intelligent individuals tend I reproduce more than intelligent ones.  Is this a fact? I think the corollary to higher amount of offspring is socio-economic, not intelligence. Also, smart people predict we'll hit peak population in 50 years or so.   stop liking what i don't like   [10]   Despite all the destruction and deaths it left, Ike's aftermath was pretty fun. Lots of powerless house parties. Everyone had their doors open. You met neighbors you haven't talked to in the 5 years they've lived next door. MREs, etc etc.    All I wanted was some mc nugs to nurse my hangover Sunday afternoon, but it was closed because of this. Officially boycotted.    Can't be as bad as Coachella the first night. Took 2.5 hours after we got in the car before we were out of the lot. Talk about a clusterfuck. People who took shuttles were waiting until 5 am (last show ends at 1am).   Although perhaps it will encourage more people to take pub transit or bike or car share.    I don't think the connection really fits. One of his big character traits is the whole coming from nothing thus fueling his ambition for power shtick.    Mack is going #1   Not before the morons screaming "queue the morons screaming 'child abuse, child abuse!'" happens.   He does work with inner city youth. He's one of the most intelligent and tactful former professional athletes we have.    Hawks crushed the Pacers in their first game too. Just sayin'. Rooting for y'all though.    Dude! Mo Williams!   Keep the canisters to put junk in and throw away the flimsy boxes. I fill mine with bottle caps.   It's actually called a string bet but yeah.   That would require coaching.   He just seemed like a genuine dude. He played with heart, tenacity and humility. He was by far my favorite player to watch outside of TMac pre-bad back.    The stats I saw thrown around were approximately best in the league in PNR and worst in the league in post ups.   I agree 100%, I just believe that his post up game has improved under Hakeem and you can see it, if anywhere, in his footwork. He is still a bit clunky at times but he definitely isn't the stone handed offensive liability that /r/nba made him out to be this summer.   Which is fair, but I did admit that his time in LA was an unmitigated disaster.   Dude is busting post moves during the playoffs I didn't even know he had when he was playing for LA.  That's because he didn't have them then. He's been working very closely with Hakeem pretty much since he arrived in Houston and you can definitely see Dream's influence on Howard's post moves. Another sign of his dedication to improvement and his game.   "i don't see ~~color~~ flair"   I bought signed, game worn Carl Landry shoes a few days before he got traded. Saddest I've ever been as a rockets fan.    Chuck wagon! One of my favorite ex-rockets. Dude was a brick house and he had the most entertaining fts.    It really sucks when people hate you just because of your flair and your comments are automatically viewed through a filter that no matter how poignant or accurate they are, they're already wrong.    There's a huge difference between not supporting someone and actively disparaging him. After Howard signed with Houston, the vast majority of visible Laker fans spewed vitriol and disdain. "He's not big enough for the bright lights and pressure of LA", "he's washed up anyways good riddance", "he doesn't try what a fake superstar", "worse at offense than thabeet". Obviously I don't believe this represents Lakers fans as a whole but the vitriol usually trumps realism in environments like this and that vitriol rose to the top.  I don't blame you for not supporting him. His time in LA was an unmitigated disaster and then he left.  Still, reasonably discussing Howard as a player and a person was next to impossible for a few weeks/months after we acquired him.  /r/nba was sure he was done, was sure his offensive game was on par with Asik, was convinced he was lazy, sure he was a chemistry killer, etc. etc.    Yeah how dare I be frustrated that this sub has a persecution complex for the rockets. Seeing nothing but negative post after condemning post gets pretty old pretty fast.   also logic? What? The average casual fan aka the majority of fans have a positive view of Lin. He's polarizing in places like sports forums because of his erratic play. Vitriol will bleed through logic every time in environments like this.    I think there's a difference when you're trying to imply that the Toyota Center went into a collective and orchestrated booing of Lin (which didn't happen), versus a few knuckleheads booing Lin (which could have plausibly happened).  The average casual fan in Houston likes Jeremy Lin, honestly probably more than Harden. Harden gets shit on a lot. I don't understand this perception that he escapes scrutiny while Lin is selectively and constantly dragged under the bus.  But hey, whatever can rile up the most /r/nba-heads to the side of 'not houston'.     A targ bastard repopulating the others? A song of ice and fire. Crastor for AA confirmed.    poe's law up in here   There is a difference between a collection of knuckleheads booing jeremy lin and the arena booing him. In this case, I'm sure there were a few people in the stands booing Lin directly, however the majority of the boos that people are referring to were directed at a combination of Mo Williams checking in and a bad (not bad) call being replayed on the screen.  I just love how this completely unsubstantiated bullshit has leaked into every fucking thread that is related to the rockets.    I still can't understand how the fans accept Harden shooting 30% doing terrible defense all night and for an "All Star" and "1st team all NBA" player.  jesus christ the skewed perception this subreddit has of rockets fans is crazy. harden gets *so much hate* when he plays poorly, way more than lin. acting like rockets fans are happy with harden's performance is absurd.   i personally think he is playing poorly but i'm not gonna execute the guy for it. he's a person. same with lin; he has played poorly much more than harden has this season yet it never changed my perception of him. he's a person, they're all young. they all have a lot of pressure on them. they don't have the best coach. etc. etc. the point is that win or lose, bad performance or good performance, i support the team and the players.  this subreddit has gotten pretty unbearable for a rockets fan who just fucking enjoys basketball for the simple fact that it's entertaining. i can't even come in here after a loss anymore; and i'm starting to realize that i shouldn't after a win either.  why does everyone have to take the fun out of sports. why can't we just leave it all on the court, accept the outcome, and talk about the game like fans instead of obsessed school girls with emotional problems?   it used to be an alright community. there were some solid posters who provided valuable insight. then we got yao ming and with them came what were dubbed YOF (yao only fans - basically 98% chinese people) and that kinda divided the forum and ever since then it's just a huge echo chamber of hate when bad and love when good. i go there during trade season because trade discussion is fun, but anything relating to the actual season and the actual players and the actual games is garbage.  it's kind of like how /r/nba is now.   not sure if serious   /r/nba is becoming pretty shitty. i do agree that clutch fans is a very shitty place though.  i'm starting to become extremely disillusioned by sports fans in general. they're really starting to fucking bother me. no one can just chill. no one can accept a bad performance. no one can take a step back and look at it all from a wide angle perspective. it's gross honestly.     It's like, if Lin makes one bad play, he's shit, yet Harden can make ten bad plays in a quarter and he's just having an off night.  it's ok man, you guys do enough hating on harden already, we're just balancing it out.  also you aren't paying attention too much because people are pretty polar extreme about harden whichever way he is playing.  i was at the first game, it was the 2nd quarter, i went to the bathroom and a guy next to me was talking to his buddy about how shit harden was.  this was the first game and the first half wasn't even over.  you just have a filtered version of reality that support a narrative you want to see.    that comes with love and hate.  i disagree. i don't see any reason or benefit to bringing hate into the equation. sure i'll be disappointed if we lose, and i'll be disappointed if harden doesn't play well or howard looks like he's playing lazy or lin does something stupid...but it's just basketball and that disappointment wont last longer than 5 minutes. I love the rockets but i'm never gonna turn that into anything other than joy. if they lose they lose and i go home and i go to sleep and i wake up the next day in the exact same situation as if they'd won.  C'est la vie   Rockets bad. Rockets fans bad. James Harden bad. Dwight Howard bad. Jermey Lin 'oh i like him he's only cool rocket'.  /r/nba is a joke. i remember it was like this for the heat a couple seasons ago, which is funny because a couple seasons ago the rockets were /r/nba's favorite second team.   I live a couple blocks away from there, gonna be interesting how it changes traffic. I just hope there is a coffee shop in there somewhere, otherwise that Starbucks across the street is gonna start getting stupid busy.   this sub is fucking retarded. any reason to hate the rockets and rockets fans.   Jesus this subreddit is ridiculous. They've played the exact same amount of games as the Rocket's have. And yeah Rockets fans were the only one's talking shit about Lin when he was playing bad basketball. And we are the only ones riding his dick now that he has played some decent (and tonight great) basketball.  The fucking difference two years makes, from /r/nba's most loveable team to /r/nba's villian number 1.  Bunch of fickle cunts.   A 30 story apartment high rise.   Nope, it's because they look like big fat sea cows.   Booing a replay on the tv screen actually.    Bad timing. They were booing a replay of a call when he was checking in. Obviously they disagreed with the call.    Yah but they didn't make the cut ffs   You'd be surprised. Have lived in Houston majority of my 25+ years; lived in Michigan for one of those years. Saying y'all was basically like having a British or Australian accent up there. I was seriously 'exotic'.    It's really not though ya moron. That's why it's such a contested play. Jesus.    Should have realized this when y'all were hacking Asik last year down by like 8 with multiple minutes to go. Shitty coach; welcome to the club.    Where can I find me some of these air max's with children skin uppers?    The Seattle Rain.  Just because.   Well he linked directly to the original source. Jesus, it's not a thesis paper, it's an album of pictures of fucking crayons.  Crayons.   My eyes are open. I choose to enjoy the content that gives me joy, while effectively ignoring those which don't.  Nothing is worse than seeing a post that I enjoyed, wandering into the comments to actively discuss or read a discussion or just make a silly comment, and seeing it filled with nothing but 'repost', 'op is a faggot', 'this isn't oc', 'op is a karma whore', etc. etc.  1st, it takes any potential conversation out of play. 2nd, it's petty. People whine and whine and whine about karma whores and that OP is 'only in it for the karma' and OP 'is trying to deceive us', but they don't realize that half the content they are enjoying could suffer equal fates in their respective comment sections.  It's just bad manners frankly. It's rude. It takes away from other's experiences.  Granted, there are cases where OP has blatantly deceived the reddit populace, but unless it's for actual monetary gain, I honestly could give two shits.  Lied about your mom banging your dog? Cool, thanks for the story.  Lied about a celebrity you saw? Cool, thanks for the photo.  Lied about a place you've been? Cool, thanks for the window to a place I've never been or a reminder of a place I have.  Life's too short to get caught up in the whole 'i'm being (potentially) deceived by someone who has nothing to gain so I should let it get to me' game.   I thought reddit was for us to ingest content, not to whine when the free entertainment we are given isn't up to our absurdly high standards. Traditionally speaking of course.     First, he never claimed them as his own in the title. Second, if this is the kind of thing that grinds your gears you should seriously reflect on the things that make you tick.      Sports fans are not rational creatures.   Barring a miracle run to the finals, I think he's gone no matter what happens the rest of the way.   Ps your team doesn't exist.    James Harden's sorry ass.   Gotta love this subreddit.    Portland also had to have a record setting game by LMA to get to OT and they had a few circus shots and a tip that could have gone either way in the first game. So you're not saying anything. Just typical basketball fan who can't digest more than the most recent game at a time.    It's on the Wii Virtual console as well. If you have a wii I'd highly recommend it over a rom.   I don't think games are blacked out during the playoffs. They should all be on TNT or ESPN.   When he doesn't say this he's lackadaisical and lazy, when he says this he's a tumor.    nah I didn't sit down from about 5 minutes to go till the end. but hate on hata   We were up when this picture was taken.   ha that's bizarre. small world.  "i'll wear a blue shirt, that way i'll be easy to spot in crowd shots!"  we're on to you dude.      This guy has women and relationships all figured out.   There are no telephones *or* internet, but there are phones *with* internet. It's perfect!   A lot of people shave their head for solidarity of loved ones who are going through chemo. Maybe that.   Really? Salad, steak, potato, shrimp, carrots.   Really great cross too. Dude should have never had the chance to score on a bicycle kick.   in order to blow up kids   Austin has pretty shitty fucking traffic.   Why do you think it's unfair? She's not exactly likeable, especially pre-Dance with Dragons. She isn't relatable. She isn't funny. She is pretty mean to Arya. She is selfish and entitled. She liked Joffrey. She lies when it suits her personal interests.  I get that she's in a shitty situation post GOT but that doesn't mean people have to like her.  Arya, on the other hand, is cunning, brave, strong, independent, adventurous, awesome, resilient, funny, and relatable to 'the little guy'.   I believe diedrichs was bought buy Starbucks or went bankrupt and the manager bought that location and changed it to Dirks.    Yah but I know of you.    I was wondering if that's what the sign meant by 'thank you montrose'. Used to go there but Starbucks is closer and the baristas are much friendlier + green tea. Though their iced coffee was divine. Sad to see it go.   	107
 Is that you Mr Wilson?   Until we as a society are willing to make common sense bans on "that thing that goes up" we will never solve the mass shooting problem in this country.    Scenario:  1.  Kid throws can at gunman.  2. Gunman caught off guard for three seconds.  3. Gunman recovers and shoots kid.   Why is it Liberals never refute facts or debate? Liberals only shoot the messenger by being critical of OP or news sources.       As a Conservative, I am never embarrassed to tell the truth about the falsity of climate change.   Genetics have always separated us   She would be good for poles everywhere   I am sorry that your Liberal narrative is being refuted by reality. No one is stopping you from providing facts that you feel counter the facts provided in this post.   Apparently, the Left views ANY challenge to their ideology as being evil or bizarre.    advocating for 'traditional marriage'  Her motivation for advocating traditional marriage is her own moral beliefs. That does not equate to her hating anyone. You are doing what the Left frequently does which is to assume anyone who has a different viewpoint must have an evil intention behind it. If someone stands for traditional marriage then they must be anti gay. Anyone opposed to Obama's policies must be a racist.   I actually listen to Glenn Beck and he has never stated any anti LGBT attitudes at all.   Apparently the old saying is true "Conservatives think Liberals are wrong. Liberals think Conservatives are evil"   These articles are not anti LGBT. One says people should not be forced to do business that conflicts with their beliefs. Religious people should not be forced to bake LGBT cakes just as LGBT bakers should not be forced to bake Westboro Baptist cakes. The government shouldn't force anyone to bake any cake that conflicts with their personal or business philosophies.   The other article is about a woman who questioned the methods of GLAAD but was not anti LGBT.  Can you explain to me how these articles show the Blaze is anti LGBT?    The Blaze is not anti gay. What a sad, twisted world view you must have.    What a miserable life you must lead. Don't you have anything better to do with your time than being an internet agitator?    You seem to enjoy trolling others who don't think exactly as you do. Are you intentionally trolling or are you really that unhappy?    Liberals get confused when their ideology clashes with reality.    You Leftists are never wrong. No matter what proof I offer you will reject it as inadequate. I could literally provide video proof and you would reject it as not enough.   I reject religion as a guiding force. I reject YOUR religion. Why can't you simply allow others to make up their own minds?      You Leftists are never wrong. The democrat party is like a faith based religion rather than a political organization.   That the Democrat Party is no longer a party of ideas and classical liberal thought but rather the followers of rigid, leftist ideology.    JFK could not get elected as a democrat today. The party demands politicians in the manner of Barack Hussein Obama and Elizabeth "fauxcahontas" Warren   Two of the articles lists members of Congress  who  identify as hard left. How can that  be opinion? Dude, how did you make it through evil medical school?   You are so busted herr doktor. Can you dispute my facts with counter facts? Or are you going to just shoot the messanger. Typical Alinsky Liberal.    http://www.wnd.com/2010/08/191605/  http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/watchwomanonthewall/2011/08/socialists-in-congress-with-ties-to-communist-party-usa.html  http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/nov/30/gallup-yes-democrats-liberals-favor-socialism/  http://www.debate.org/opinions/are-democrats-socialists   What then exactly would you like me to prove?   So you maintain that the Democrats are not anti gun and that they have no intentions of increasing gun control?  Is that your contention?   This is why no one believes you're a gun owner.   You. Are. Awesome   You are right.   The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights.   The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights.   The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights.   The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights.   The Democratic Party fully supports gun rights. They have no intentions of restricting gun rights.   Hahahahahahahahaahahahahahaha   Not at all. The Democrat Party AKA Liberals have openly stated that they are anti gun.  It amuses me that you refute that.    If you believe the Democrat party is pro gun then there is nothing I can offer at this point. You must be leading a very blissful life.    No one is stopping you from offering proof.   http://yubanet.com/uploads/4/Planeten-Jorden.jpg   I don't know who David Klein is but your link authored by him is simply his uneducated opinion. Nothing more.   I assume he is referring to Goldberg's book "Liberal Fascism". The term Liberal Fascism was derived from a speech made by George Orwell in the 1930's. Goldberg's book of the same name is fully footnoted and extremely well researched.   In that book, Goldberg describes the various versions of socialism that was being created and discussed around the early part of the 20th century. Naziism and Fascism were two  forms of socialism.  Hitler and Mussolini were both serious writers of socialist political philosophy and championed its use as a fairer system than capitalism. Each created a unique brand of socialism that they felt was better and fairer than the previous versions of socialism offered by others up til them.  Both systems retained the classical elements of standard socialism including non private ownership of thee means of production (and distribution), a planned economy, and a government/community centric society at the expense of individual freedom. Both also offered unique elements that only their form of socialism featured.   I am sorry that you don't agree with historical fact. Some think that fire can't bend steel and that 9/11 was an inside job. If you wish to contest proven historical fact then please offer your own proof. Goldberg's book is full of footnotes. Can you refute any of them?   To repeat an overused cliche, the truth hurts. The Nazis and the Fascists were true socialists.   Never be afraid of the truth. Good luck   Actually, the Nazis and the fascists were both socialist movements. Hitler and Mussolini were prolific writers on socialism. This is historic fact. Some are confused by the fact that the Nazis were bitter enemies of the soviet Union and mistakenly assume that makes the Nazis and Fascists polar opposites to to Soviets   Actually, the Nazis were socialists so historically that is accurate. My previous comment merely stated how I felt sorry for you for you supporting a political philosophy that was determined to limit your civil rights. It shows how politically confused you are.    The rest of the educated world disagrees with you.    The naivete of Liberals never surprises me. The Left has always wanted to eliminate guns in private hands. You are like one of those Jews in the concentration camps who collaborated with the Nazis. Your position arises pathos in me for you rather than blowing my mind.    The Left can only thrive if it lies about itself and its opponents.     Most Americans don't want to wind the clock back before the 1940's.  No one has mentioned the 40's. All Conservatives want is smaller government, less taxes, less regulation. It is our contention that government is out of control. It expands every year in its scope, size, and influence in the people's lives. Power is a zero sum game. Power is finite. The bigger slice of the power pie that the government takes must come at the expense of the people's freedom and liberty.   How can you possibly view these goals as extreme? I simply don't want politicians deciding for me how to live my life and control my destiny.   Where the Democrats want to take this country is diametrically opposed to where Conservatives want to take this country. Grid lock is not a bad think. Compromise is a death by a thousand paper cuts.  One simply has to look at where each party ultimately wants to take the country.  The Left, the Democrats want to march us towards a communal socialist state rule by a rigid, uncompromising ideology.  The right, the Conservatives want the US to have smaller government and less government interference in the people's lives. They want to follow the path of Jeffersonian Democracy.   Though from space it looks like a impact crater or the remnants of an ancient volcano, the Kondyor Massif, in Russia, is neither. Rather it is in what's known in geological terms as an "intrusion." An intrusion forms when molten magma of igneous rock crystallizes below the surface of the earth, in this case forming a perfectly circular rocky ring over a billion years ago. (Because they form underground, intrusions are also known as plutons, named for Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.) Harder then the rest of the earth around it, the Kondyor Massif intrusion (in this case an alkaline-ultrabasic massif intrusion) has slowly made its way through 5000 miles of mantle and is now visible on the surface of the earth. A stream flows out from its center, fueled by the snow waters melting from the Kondyor Massif's 2000-foot-high rim.   Apparently for most redditors no   Wow dude. That's a big butt plug.   Marx wrote of a transition from capitalism via socialism into communism. The end game is ultimately community ownership of everything. Socialist theory has always stated such. Progress to the Left does not mean a general improvement of society or a fairer system. Progress means a march towards a specific, rigid, Leftist, ideology.   Some assume Sweden or Norway like states are the goal of socialist societies. It is not. Those states are merely transitory, stepping stones along a path that ultimately leads to true and rigid socialism.       I disagree. Within the GOP we debate regarding issues such as legalization of pot, gay marriage, abortion, religion in government, immigration, taxation, size of government,  with several factions (Tea Party, establishment GOP, religious right, Libertarians, RINOs) all fighting for influence.   You are naive if you think the Democrats desire anything less than a total ban on most firearms. They would pass such a ban today if they thought they could get away with it.     Wrong. The Tea Party wants RINOs and fake establishment republicans gone. The TP desire less taxes, less regulation, and smaller government. That's it. Nothing radical at all.   When dealing with the hard Left Democrat party, moderation is irrelevant. The Democrats want to fundamentally change the USA. We oppose that agenda. There can be no compromise.    The bullet got inserted into the case upside down. It will still fire just fine. Troops during WWI used to intentionally flip bullets and insert them upside down so when fired they would impact on steel plates and cause spauling on the other side of the plate. It was a means of killing soldiers hiding behind steel.     I listed true socialist states and not quasi socialist states that feature rich, homogenous populations, that feature some socialistic policies but are clearly not actual socialist states. Also those states can afford more socialist policies because the USA pays for their defense. Lets see socialism work in a poor country without coercion and violence.    Did you somehow miss the part where the Democratic party's philosophy is fundamentally at odds with socialism? I guess you did because I've already explained it.  All you said was the Dems are for tax cuts which they clearly oppose  If you think this, then you have literally never picked up a history textbook. Socialism has always been characterized, and in fact, requires, sudden and violent change.  You may want to reread your Marx comrade. I think you missed a few chapters. The process from capitalism to communism is a long march not a sudden violent explosion:  https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm     What about economic issues? Taxes?   Clearly neither socialism not the Democrat Party favors anti ethnic or anti sexual identity policies regardless of past transgressions.   Today's Democrat Party is in lock step with all of the elements of classical socialism.   Socialism is a long march towards a definite destination. At first there is a period where socialism exists along side capitalism. It exploits Capitalism and co-opts it. Rather than outright government/community ownership of the means of production, socialism at first controls industries via crony Capitalism and regulatory favoritism. Eventually, socialism evolves from a parasitic relationship with its Capitalist host and kills it and instilling all classical aspects of socialism (ultimately to communism)    Democrats are trying to fight for an increase in size of the traditional middle class. This is not something that socialism supports - socialism supports classless society.  What policies specifically?  Tax cuts for the middle class. Socialism would not support tax cuts, period.  Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats  Tax-cuts for small businesses. Socialism supports large state-owned companies, not small businesses.  Absolute and total lie. Name Any tax cut proposed by the Democrats  Pro-immigration reform. Socialism does not jive with multicultural societies.  Immigration reform is designed only to create dependent Democrat voting block. As for multiculturalism, no such limitations are a part of any socialist ideology except for Naziism. Isn't Cuba multicultural?  LGBT rights. Again, socialist countries across the world have pretty much never encouraged this, to the point at which you could be punished.  Socialism dictates no such restrictions on sexual identity except for the Nazis  Freedom of speech. Also isn't supported by socialism  There is no debate within the Democrat Party. Ever been to a college campus? Dissenting opinions/viewpoints are forbidden and routinely shouted down or silenced as hate speech, micro aggressions etc     No, the Tea Party wants the RINOs out.   Such as?   You are confusing traditional liberalism as practiced via Jeffersonian democracy. Over the latter part of the 20th century, liberalism was co-opted by the Left. It no longer means open to new ideas and personal freedom. Today it mean a rigid and static path towards classical, ideological socialism. Ever notice why there is NO debate regarding policy within the Democrat party? It is ideologically rigid with no acceptance of any competing messages or policies.   Modern day Liberalism is merely one path to the ultimate end game of true, in practice socialism. Liberalism is a form of socialism whereby American culture and traditions are destroyed and replaced by socialist policies.   In essence, Liberalism is a transitory phase of socialism but it is indeed socialism.      I know what the word means. Socialism is an economic and political philosophy characterized by non private ownership of the means of production, a planned economy, and a government or community centric society at the expense of personal freedom.  Key socialistic governments have existed in the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Castro's Cuba, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the Nazis, and Mussolini's Fascist Italy to name a few.      Someone of YOUR income would not be invited to eat there. It does matter.    Liberal used to mean open to new ideas and free thinking. The term has been co-opted by the hard Left and now means something very different: Hardcore socialist.   So you are saying that income inequality does not matter and should not be a political issue?   Top Ten nicknames for Elizabeth Warren who lied about being a Cherokee Indian for the purpose of stealing an affirmative action teaching position.     10)  Dances With Ethics  9)  Pinnocchahontas  8)  Sitting Bullshit  7)  Forked Tongue  6)  Poserhantus  5)  Hunts at Whole Foods  4)  Sackatheeconomy  3)  Hiataxa  2)  Lie-a-watha  1) Fauxcahontas   Ever hear of Barack Hussein Obama?   A lot of people who eventually run say that. Might be true. Might not be true   Warren will run and win the nomination. Hillary is toast   Whenever socialism fails (as it always does) the apologists come out and claim it was not real socialism.   Who knew Obama was a cotton fabric?   I beat you fair and square in a debate on fracking. I provided too many facts and you wilted under the pressure and quit.  Today, truth won out over religion.   Please provide proof that fracking causes ground water pollution. Fracking has been used for nearly 100 years. It has a great safety record. The only danger is rare cases of tiny leaks caused by equipment failure. These rare cases release the same amount of oil as a vehicle crash and a fuel tank rupture.   Seriously, if you reject the scientific facts of fracking then you oppose it for religious reasons. If so, I believe you have the right to belong to any faith based belief system you choose but don't try to force everyone else to join also. I am an atheist and I don't want to join anyone's religion. Even if it is Gaia based environmentalism.    http://i.imgur.com/qtdpCd8.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/IZ6Kn8T.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/hjAKn5c.jpg   Well failures are rare. They typically involve defects in the well shaft casing. Any leakage of anything is quickly discovered via a drop in pressure in the well. Ground water and the fracking chemicals and gas and oil produced are separated by thousands of feet of earth and many layers of impermeable shale.  Thus, the only way for anything to contaminate water is via a defect in the pumping equipment or defect in the well casing. Such defects can be quickly fixed.       Be the mature one, visit her and make peace. She can't harm you while she is alive anymore but you may regret it someday if you don't.    Wow! Uranus is huge!   Actually, when I took graduate level chemistry classes I learned that fracking chemicals are injected thousands of feet away from ground water separated  by many layers of impermeable shale . I also learned that the fracking chemicals react with iron compounds in the earth and convert the chemicals into iron oxide AKA rust.    Hitler was a capitalist? Not even close. Hitler was an avowed and committed socialist.    http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/   'non privately held means of production', that's redundant.  I was pointing out that at various stages of socialist theory, the means of production are owned or controlled by the state and then ultimately by the community (and likely administered by the state for the community). I was not being redundant.     I agree the various socialistic systems seek to achieve the same end game via differing paths but they all end up at the same destination ultimately. That is a planned economy,  non privately held means of production and distribution (whether held by "the community" or by government), and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.   As for fascism, that and Naziism were true socialist ideologies. You listed some of the unique elements of their brand of socialism but you fail to acknowledge their commonality with "classical" socialism. Fascism and Naziism featured no private ownership of the means of production (and distribution), a planned economy,  and a government (or community) centric society at the expense of personal freedom.   Socialism is a family tree that shares the same roots   Anti fracking is anti science. Liberals are hypocrites.     reform socialism like seen in most of Europe and Canada  I disagree. There is no such thing as reform socialism. Socialism has many forms (communism, progressivism, Naziism, fascism, anarcho syndicalism, etc). Each form has distinct differences that can be considered distinct paths towards an end goal. The end goal for all systems is ultimately the same.    Please reread the article. It claims that water levels have risen an average of 3mm per year during winter storms only. The sea levels have not risen and remained higher. As an East coast property owner, I have made careful measurements of sea levels at my own home and have observed NO increase of any kind.     Capitalism is probably more propaganda-filled than any 'Communist' system ever was.   http://i.imgur.com/qrpS6vX.gif   Maybe you should stop making excuses for failed systems   Most of Reddit is pro socialism. That woman and thousands of others risked their lives to escape socialism. Maybe socialism isn't such a good system after all?   Please inform me of anywhere on earth that sea levels have risen?   Anything is possible so that is why we must use the scientific method to prove truth and falsehood. Are you opposed to continuing experimentation on climate science?    So you are saying that scientist understand all climate systems and can model them with at least 50% accuracy?   No denial whatsoever. We just think the science has been corrupted by politics. Lets test and experiment and discover the truth wherever that may take us..   If you say so...    He used the socialist title to as gimmick to attract followers.  Proof?  The fact is that during the late 19th and early 20th centuries many political philosophers were trying to formulate the most equitable form of socialism. Among these were Communism, Fascism, Naziism, even Anarcho Syndicalism (of Monte Python Holy Grail fame) and several others. All of these forms of socialism maintain the standard elements of classical socialism such as non private ownership of the means of production, a planned economy, and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty. All of these forms of socialism also featured important differences such as Communism's international focus or Naziism's extreme racism.   The study of socialism is an interesting exploration of political philosophers attempting to find the best and most equitable way to organize a society's government and economy. Sadly some of those offshutes resulted in evil regimes and systems.  All of this is well documented. I really can't grasp how you can even challenge these facts other than you feel uncomfortable that the system you favor now has some unsavory relatives in the family tree.  Arguing about this is like you trying to claim Bill Clinton wasn't a Democrat.   I really don't know what else to say. A lot of people get confused by socialism and the Nazis because during WWII the Soviets were at war with them. Some assume that because the Soviets were against the Nazis that the Nazis must have been political polar opposites. Confusion also comes from the creation of the whole Left wing Right wing political spectrum of the French Parliament and where various politicians sat. People incorrectly assume that the spectrum of the French Parliament at the time represents the entirety of the international political spectrum we have today.   In other words what was considered far Right or far Left in the French Parliament then is not necessarily what we would consider as being far Right or Far Left today.  Again, I don't know how you could even argue this historical fact. I suggest you take some college level political science and history classes. Being ignorant or intentionally misinformed will not serve you in life.  Good luck   That would explain their sexual habits   Hitler viewed the Communists and other socialist groups as competitors for the same power goal. He disliked Communism because of its international focus and high Jewish membership.  Simply because he and Mussolini were socialists does not make then automatically like other socialists or any other political group.   I really don't know why you are fighting this fact so much. It's an historical fact. There is no debate here.   Sorry but the Nazis and Fascists were both socialists.   "The truth is incontrovertible, malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end; there it is." -Winston Churchill     Sorry but the Nazis were the German National Socialist Worker's party. Hitler was a prolific socialist writer and philosopher. He rejected Communism because he felt it was too slow and contained too many Jews. The Nazis' social, economic, and political policies were main stream socialism.   High taxation merely takes money away from productive job creators and gives it to government which usually squanders it on wasteful projects. You are assuming that the country thrived during high taxation periods as being the cause for economic expansion.   You really need to get a basic education. You will never succeed living off of false assumptions and silly slogans. The world just doesn't work that way.   You are mistakenly attributing any "good" or beneficial policy with a being Progressive policy.   What do you think the end game of progressivism is? Ultimately, will we or won't we end up in a socialist state? Be honest.    The Tea Party wants LIMITED taxation not NO taxation.  It is an historical fact that the Nazis and the Fascists were socialists. Your definition in no way contradicts that except its incorrect claim that Fascism was "Right Wing".  The false claim that the Nazis and Fascists were right wing comes from WWII when the Soviets were at war with them. The Soviets and the Nazis and Fascists were all socialists but different, competing forms.   Again, please take some survey classes in political science at your local community college.    Simply put, the EPA is supposed to enforce environmental laws that have been approved by Congress and signed into law by the president.  The EPA instead constantly expands their influence by creating law under the rubric of environmental protection. They do so without regard for the economic effects of those regulations. They do so without legal authority to do so (can't create statutes). Their policies destroy entire industries (see coal, nuclear, etc}.   BTW Barnes cartridges are 3x as expensive as lead based cartridges are. Biofuel is available. It is more expensive than diesel or gasoline. Why aren't YOU driving a bio fuel car? Why isn't YOU home heated with biofuel? Hypocrite     I am not against all regulation. I am against the endless expansion of regulation. Case in point: During the 70's the EPA created very helpful regulations on clean water and pollution. Since then, they have attempted to regulate anything even remotely relating to the environment.  These new regulations are very expensive to comply with, they are of dubious and often no value to the environment, the new regulations don't take into account economic impacts when imposed, the EPA oversteps into areas that should be regulated by congress, the EPA regulations often involve political or philosophical agendas rather than environmental protection.  Just this week, a judge ruled that the EPA can't regulate lead bullets. If the EPA had been allowed to do that then they would have unilaterally infringed on the people's 2nd amendment rights.        Tea Party is not against ALL taxation, it is against endlessly raising taxes so government can endlessly expand and regulate. Please stop misquoting the Tea Party's goals   Forcing everyone into socialized health care to provide medical services is like  forcing everyone into public housing projects to solve housing challenges.   Socialism is a political and economic system characterized by having a planned economy, where the government controls the means of production in a government centric society at the expense of individual goals and freedom.  Fascism (and Naziism) were both forms of socialism. Not in just name but in goals and in practice. I strongly suggest you attend some college courses before you continue to discuss political science.     Me   Huh? What are you talking about?   No, the Tea Party stands for lower taxes, smaller government, and less regulation. It is about making government have a smaller impact on the people's lives and giving the people greater freedom.  Your list is a simplistic infantilization of the Tea Party's goals. We view the progressive Left as false prophets of the poor and the middle class. The Left's goal is only socialism, plain and simple.    I can assure you that the Tea Party will oppose any progressive legislation proposed by ANY politician of any sex or race. Why is it so hard to grasp that we oppose the policies. The Left's political ideology is diametrically opposed to our political philosophy. We believe progressivism is not simply a desire to make things better but rather a rigid path towards socialism and ruin for the US. It's that simple. The Left lies and claims that race is involved.   is Obama a Marxist, Communist, Socialist, or Fascist? Can't be all of them  All of the political systems named above are socialist systems so Obama indeed could be a Marxist/Communist or a fascist.    No, I am saying that the gas/oil industries have been fracking for almost 100 years and that any pollutants that get injected deep underground quickly turn into iron oxide AKA rust and are totally harmless and have never caused ground water pollution. Science    you are against anything labeled "progressive" even if it works  Please tell me what progressive policies work?   Please provide proof. If it is so obvious then finding proof sould be easy...  Crickets?   No, Democrats assume they are of normal intelligence   As a Tea Party Conservative I can say that I am opposed to almost every "progressive" policy proposed by anyone. The insinuation that the GOP is opposing Obama simply because he is black is  completely false.    Fracking has been done for almost 100 years.    http://i.imgur.com/qrpS6vX.gif   The people opposed to fracking are opposed to it for philosophical reasons that are independent from any factual basis. Even if fracking (or any other fossil fuel technology) were 100% completely safe and risk free, they would oppose it.    Leftists never debate facts, they only shoot the messenger   You obviously do not understand what Atwater was saying. He was saying that the GOP could attract disillusioned Dixiecrat voters with economic appeals rather than racist appeals.   You really need to see the interview again and really try to grasp what was said.  Please also read this link. http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php   Can you offer proof that the current GOP is racist?    So we both agree that the GOP is no more racist than the Democrat Party.   The Southern Strategy has been proven false. The migration of southern democrat voters did not happen suddenly as a result of the civil rights act being passed. The migration was a decades long process due to the Democrat Party turning left and moving away from American values.  There is no evidence whatsoever that the GOP adopted racism or embraced racism.      Democrats supported slavery, started the KKK, supported segregation, initiated Jim Crow Laws, opposed the civil rights act.    Damn Democrats and their Jim Crow laws.   After the volcano on Krakatoa exploded in 1883, Muslims there attacked and killed non Muslims. Muslims have attacked and killed thousands of people in countries all over the world. It seems as if the problem is not happenstance or environmental. The problem seems to be institutional and cultural. My issue is that you and others that think like you simply can't recognize or accept that all cultures, religions, peoples are not the same.      all the horrors in the world are committed by people through pure happenstance   Please read what you just wrote. Can you seriously believe that?   If you were to honestly view the history of Muslim extremists motivated to intentionally kill in the name of their religion, you would see that happenstance has had nothing to do with those acts.     Thanks!   I am reading his book "Gulag Archipelago". I could not find a better cite. I am looking for the actual page number now.     I tire of people like you who simply cannot distinguish/differentiate/discriminate between the actions of two groups of people and feel the need to place both groups in the same moral basket. The USA and the Nazis killed thousands of people during WWII but they did so for different reasons. They are not two sides of the same coin.   Muslim extremists have been engaging in terrorist and violent acts for centuries and against every culture they interact with. Islam is a religion based on conquest and subjugation of their rivals. Radical Islamists have been involved in thousands of religious based violent attacks in just the past 20 years. http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/index.html#Attacks (follow links to yearly lists)  The only reason the US is engaged in violent action against Muslim extremists is because they simply won't leave us alone. They have already declared war against us unilaterally.   According to your logic, a robber who enters a store and shoots a clerk and the store owner who defends himself and shoots the robber are moral equivalents because they were both shooters engaged in violence.  If you cannot see the difference between the two or the difference between what the US does and what Muslim extremists do then you are indeed being juvenile and naive and engaged in wishful thinking.    No because you are replacing critical thought, logical analysis, cause and effect with juvenile wishful thinking.    Yes. Naive and silly   You are a despicable, simplistic person.    This being reddit, I am surprised no one has made a snarky response such as "It is your wife. Pic taken at Motel 6 down by the interstate"   No. Gun ownership is a civil right that shouldn't be restricted by special interest backed politicians   I honestly don't care if terrorists are tortured by Bush or drone killed by Obama. F*ck them all   I have no idea what you are trying to say. I assume you misunderstood my previous comment    one could argue that, in general, conservatives only disagree on how quickly we should approach fascism  Fascism was a socialist political movement. I highly doubt many on the right would push for such a system.  Also the Democrat Party is being led to its ultimate path towards real socialism. Everyday Democrat voters are being falsely led to believe that the party only seeks an general progress towards a better future.    legitimizing torture and killings without due process  Obama can end this today. He supports drone killing without due process (I personally agree with his policy)   restricting choices and education concerning reproduction  The abortion statutes in the EU are much more restrictive than the USA. (I personally don't give a shit about abortion either way)  invading other countries to steal their natural resources  Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?  restricting human rights to only exist for whites and/or christian  Can you offer any proof that that has happened? Ever?  putting people in prison for what they do to their own bodies.  If you are referring to drugs, both parties have supported the war on drugs for a century  I don't like the world-conquest size of the defence budget, the complete neglect of how we are rapidly destroying the planet  The US defense budget keeps sea lanes open allowing world commerce. The US guarantees the security of the EU, Canada, and many other countries in the world. When there is a natural disaster, it is the US military that always offers assistance.   Can you name a country that is a better steward of the environment?     Your definition of Liberalism is the traditional one such as could be used to describe JFK. Today Liberalism is simply a path towards a socialist end game. Notice how the left never has any disagreements on policy? Everyone on the Left is following a strict, static, rigid ideology. The only debates I see on the Left is an occasional debate regarding gun control and a debate on how fast we should proceed down the path towards socialism.  On the right there are many debates and factions such as Establishment GOP, RINO's, Libertarians, Tea Party Conservatives   disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., or to restore traditional ones, and to limit change.  Yes as in the presence of government in our lives. I want less government, lower taxes, less regulation. The correct definition is a rolling back of most Liberal policies of the past 40 years. Most, not all.   Very naive of you to say that. I am a Tea Party Conservative and I reject everything the left favors. I view them as a cancer on the country and will resist every policy they hope to implement. Why do I oppose the Left so vehemently? Because their policies differ so much from the Right's     Progressivism and socialism are merely different paths to the same destination. Ultimately both lead to a world controlled by self appointed elites that know better than you do how you should live your life.    Can you please tell me what the end game of progressivism is? Is it or isn't it ultimately socialism?   You and other Liberals make the same mistake of confusing what political parties actually stand for.  Progressives are not promoting a general progression towards a better world. Progressivism is a strict, methodical march towards garden variety socialism. The end result is a society run by self appointed elites.  Conservatism is not an attempt to conserve tradition or the past. Conservatism is the desire to keep government small because as government expands, the personal liberty and freedom of the people must necessarily be limited.     No clue what you are referring to. Conservatives only want the government to tax us less, spend less, and be less of a nanny state   False, I attended a Dave Bratt  (he beat Eric Cantor) function there and the religious people I met were polite and respectful. They are religious, good for them. I am an atheist, good for me. We all got along just fine. No bibles, no snake handling, no drinking of strictnine.   That's how they serve chocolate milk   He made no comments regarding gay marriage so you really can't claim to know what position he would take. Both Obama and Hillary were against gay marriage a couple of years ago.   As a Tea Party Conservative, I don't care who marries who.  Jefferson invaded Libya and kept US Marines there for several years  War on drugs has been pursued by both parties for 100 years. Obama could end it today if he so desired.      I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative and I don't give a shit who you marry. I grew up middle class and have been poor in my life. I got educated and started my own business. Even when I was poor I still rejected the Progressive message because I knew that Progressivism was a fraud. It was not a path towards a general betterment of society but rather a specific march towards socialism and government control over the people by self proclaimed elites.      The GOP is made up of many factions: Establishment RINOs, Tea Party Conservatives, Libertarians, Religious Right etc. The Religious right make up only 10% of the party. I have no friction with the religious right other than thinking they may be a distraction from our core message of limited taxation and less governmental control over the people.  I feel the bigger problem is the Left's disingenuous claims and outright lies regarding the GOP as being religious racists. I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative who is active in politics and I simply never encounter the intolerant bible thumpers and racist/homophobic/misogynistic  types the Left always claims makes up the Right.     Why do Liberals view the Right as evil? We on the right are not evil or insincere or anti anyone. We simply reject progressive socialist policy and embrace a more traditional Jeffersonian philosophy.    I did not know you were a mod for r/politics. Don't get mad at me for pointing out that she is nothing special and just another corrupt politician. Don't we have enough of those in DC as it is?   Hirsch may be a marketing genius.

Please stop trying to change the subject which is Elizabeth Warren's history and pattern of dishonesty and placing her goals above the people's needs.    It's not Ad hominem because it is not simply a meaningless attack of Warren for being a bitch. It is a criticism of a necessary requirement for leadership. I demand all leaders be trustworthy and not place their goals ahead of the people's needs.   Warren has a documented history of lying. Even her husband lied about being a Native American too.   Please look at this chart:  http://i.imgur.com/qqhr4dK.jpg?1  This is the relative Warren claimed made her Native American.

I don't know about you but I view that as grossly excessive. Those regs apply to someone....    It is human nature that most people and corporations will seek to pay the least amount of taxes. Even if revenues stay the same, there is a benefit from making the paying of taxes fair and easy.  The tax system as it stands today is too complex and politically abusive.     Taxes are ridiculously low in this country especially if you're a person who invests.  http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx  (USA taxes are highest in the world)   How do we collect taxes made overseas today? How do other countries handle that? Obviously this is not an impossible task.    Brain food. Literally     Defining the price of intellectual property is notoriously difficult  Difficult does not equal impossible.  B is overseas. Are you saying we'll tax overseas subsidiaries of US companies?  Companies will always flock to lower tax havens ( see recent Burger King/Tim Horton's merger).   If the US has lower tax rates then companies will migrate more operations here.   Compare what US companies pay in taxes today with the current tax code vs a proposed flat tax of 15% and how international income is taxed.   Any increase in gross income generated would be taxable. Companies could play any accounting games they wished but if income increased then that amount would be subject to the flat tax.   A sells off it's intellectual property to B  Difference between base cost and sale price is taxable income.  B rents back it's intellectual property to A for an amount of money equal to what A's gross revenue would otherwise be  Rent received is taxable income   Everyone (people and all business structures including trusts and non profits) pays 15% on gross income from all sources derived. No deductions, exceptions, or loopholes.    Blind people can't physically see a school test. Are you saying that poor people have a physical impediment from paying the same relative percentage of their income as other classes?   So you think the poor are not as capable as the richer classes?   So you are against equitable taxation? You are against everyone paying their fair share? You only want income redistribution comrade?   http://i.imgur.com/qrpS6vX.gif   http://i.imgur.com/Eaz3lJC.jpg   Consider a law that required every person and corporation to pay a flat tax of say 15%. No deductions, no loopholes, no other procedures. Wouldn't that be a fairer and cheaper way to collect taxes?  We need to collect taxes. That is fine. It's the method of collection that leads to abuse and inequity    Boogie nights....and days   Way too many stores would sell feminine hygiene products   Lou Gehrig died of Lou Gehrig's disease.  How did he not see that coming?   In many third world countries, toilet paper is dropped at the side of the toilet and collected each day to be burned     Taxes are ok. It's the IRS and its politically driven bullying I dislike.   "You don't need Mussolini to make the trains run on time"     How could anyone not want to cripple the IRS?   Can you offer any proof that the Kochs control the Tea Party? You need to stop dealing in things you wish were true and start incorporating facts into your interpretation of reality.  #BestLaughAllDay     Don't laugh. Offer proof.  Let me offer proof that George Soros is the financial controller of the political Left in the US and controls the Democrat party:  http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=977  Now, dispute these facts if you can. The educated debate. Fools just laugh.  Also, the difference between Soros and the Kochs is that Soros thinks he has it too easy ~ that he's not being asked for enough, while the Kochs use their money and influence to further the idea that they are asked too much.  Can you see the difference?  I have no clue what you are even saying or asking.  I bet you Jesus could!  I am an atheist so I don't have a clue what Jesus believed     Reagan started a war on unions in his first year in office  War? He fired a bunch of PATCO union air traffic controllers because they were not legally allowed to strike and they did so anyway.  And what is with Liberals and the Kochs? I am a Tea Party Conservative and the Kochs have no influence on anything. They are rich guys who make donations. Good for them. I bet you think Soros and Steyer are just concerned citizens and deserve a pass. They don't use their money to buy elections and influence legislation do they?     You are 100% wrong. The only portion of the middle class that the New Deal created was from hiring government bureaucracy employees.  May I suggest you read a book on US History? Your knowledge on the subject is based on Liberal ideology and not historical fact.    "Records show Roberson has been arrested several times in the past for robbery, burglary and theft. According to the preliminary report, Gould and Roberson are from California. The report states a search warrant was obtained for Robersons vehicle. Police said they found a stolen bracelet, two handguns, bloody clothes, a bus ticket from Los Angeles to Fort Smith, and a black duffle bag containing duct tape."   Saying that the New Deal created the middle class is just about the silliest thing I have heard in a long time. In most human societies, the merchant class created the middle class. The New Deal created two types of jobs: some manual labor, low paying jobs and government employee jobs.  It was WWII industrial production and expansion that brought the US out of the Depression. It was industrial and business expansion that expanded the middle class.   Your example proved my point exactly. Thank you.   Democrat economics in a nutshell involves the government stimulating consumer consumption by giving money to the public sector via building projects, public agencies, or simply handouts.   Conservative economics in a nutshell is to make the cost of doing business less via tax cuts and less regulatory expense. When businesses have more money they will stimulate the economy by expanding and increased hiring.  The Democrat method helps unions and special interest groups and works only so long as the money is flowing.  The Conservative method is superior because lower costs for business creates sustainable economic stimulus.   To paraphrase an old saying: Democrat economics is like giving a man a fish and allowing him to eat for a day. Conservative economics is like teaching a man how to fish so he can eat everyday.    I travel extensively throughout the Southern US and most people are middle class. You really need to get out more often and not rely on your own prejudices.   EU can afford a lot of socialist policies because the US provides military security for them. They also rely on Germany to support the poor countries such as Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and Greece.   The Left only offers "solutions" that result in higher taxes and empowerment of elites. They NEVER offer anything else.    Thomas Jefferson used to be called a liberal because he was open to new ideas and was a pragmatist. Today the term Liberal only means a slavish adherence to Leftist ideology. The open mindedness and the pragmatism have completely vanished from Liberalism.    Do you really believe that? JFK was about where George W Bush was in domestic policy and in foreign policy.   The Left is simply extreme Marxism.    Well, we didn't find any firearms but we did find a 1998 copy of "Juggs" magazine in the garage. We are placing you on our internet deviant watch list so that your neighbors can be warned about a sexual predator in their midst.    Often simply wrapping a wart infected area with duct tape and keeping it on for a few weeks will irritated the area enough to engage your body's immune system to react and destroy the wart.   Yes. The US has still not recovered from Obama's recession to this day    Only fools and the easily led believe the economy is in good shape. We have not recovered from the Obama recession. Good jobs for college graduates are scarce. Workers have given up hope.  Here is the labor participation rate: http://www.zerohedge.com/article/labor-force-participation-rate-drops-25-year-low-645  Please explain how it is a good thing that the rate is at a 25 year low?   Are you saying that the 90 million people not in the workforce retired during the Obama administration?   Do Liberals really believe that the Democrats are creating jobs? The number of Americans who are even participating in the job market has declined in every month since Obama became president.   Then Neo-Cons like the folks at this rag will have one less apparatus to wield their many, anti-choice policies.  What does that even mean?    Can you offer ANY proof that what you claim is anything more than just the rant of a psychopath?   These miniature helicopters are tiny, being 10x2.5 cm (4x1 inch) aircraft that are battery powered, very quiet and can stay in the air for 20 minutes per sortie. The rotor diameter is 12 cm (4.8 inches). The UAV is made of hard plastic and one can be ready for action in less than a minute. A complete set (two UAVs and the controller) weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 pounds). The operator can see (and capture) video and still photos on the hand held controller as the operator sends the PD-100 up to a kilometer away. The operator can zoom the camera. The PD-100 also carries GPS, a thermometer, compass and altitude sensor. Max speed is 10 meters a second (36 kilometers/22.5 miles an hour) and max altitude is about 500 meters.   She is such a horrible person with no redeeming qualities.    You are a Liberal. I am still 10x as smart as you are   IMO an 11 year old that does not speak is a win/win for everybody   She is not a credible source. The families know that Obama and Hillary let those people die for political reasons. They then tried to cover their asses with that lame lie about a video being the cause.     Not true. Can you provide links?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringwoodite   Yes like baby teeth. Didn't your parents place your discarded baby toes under your shoes at night for the foot fairy to replace with colorful pairs of socks?   The families of all of the  Americans who died in Benghazi might disagree with the author. They fault Obama and Hillary for a failed policy, failed reaction, and disgusting coverup to protect political asses.   	199
 Prosciutto pizza!?! That's pretty classy   How's the food there?   Just came across these recently and my molecular bio isn't as strong as it should be.  Seems like a new way to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria and other things like Marburg and muscular dystrophy.  How does it work  and why is it better than antibiotics?   If only the ISS would test this...   This is true. I've seen some truly messed up models as a result of humidity in the support and/or the model material while it's printing.  All you can do is get a new spool and reprint.      It'd be nice if they didn't have to use a laser to create the surface.  What I mean by this is that they have to post-process the material after the sheet is made which is going to add to the cost.  The process by which the metal is 'cast' does not produces this surface.   In my experience with 3D printed materials, the layers are not laid down perfectly flat on one another and there is a capillary force that pulls liquids through (this applies to FDM, I have no experience with other technologies).  It's possible that if the plastic was heated a little bit closer to being in a liquid state rather than closer to being in a solid state as it is laid down that this might solve the problem, but then things might get runny.   Also that there is a scaffold interior instead of a solid material isn't going to help with the out gassing problem (I'm assuming you mean the gas in the interior of the part is coming out of the part not the material itself is off gassing). Perhaps if a part was printed solidly it would be less noticeable as the space would be filled with material.   How would you adapt today's technology towards medical applications that require sterilization either of bulk material or the final printed product such that they can be FDA approved? Are new materials that aren't currently printed with necessary or is something like PLA that is widely used capable to fill this void?   Do you mind some old PDFs from when I took a SolidWorks class?    Also, check out www.vertanux1.com  I've been learning PTC Creo from him and he's been great.  Maybe check out the final/midterm for SolidWorks/Inventor (or whatever he has, I've been focused on Creo).   As a new Ohio resident looking for a corgi, where do I get one here?   As someone at the bar, where are you all? Found going away party, but no Snoo sign   So this seems to be kind of an odd problem that is currently driving me crazy.  Basically what happened is that my school (university) converted all student email accounts to the Gmail based ones that are great and last forever.  When I graduated, I was hired temporarily by my adviser while I hunted for a job.  Because of this, my email account was converted to a Microsoft Exchange account.  This means I log into an Outlook Web App to check my email instead of going through the Gmail login.  On my phone, I can't add the new account as an exchange account because it makes a duplicate.  Now I have to use multiple email clients on my phone despite there now being support for Exchange.  The reason I don't just delete the account now that I have a job and don't use it much is that I have all my purchases, subscription (All Access) and that sort of stuff tied to the old Gmail account that I used from my university.    Is there any way to have the account on my phone, but get the Exchange emails (which may or may not go back to the Gmail account, no one seems able to tell me)?  	13
 That is one way of doing it, but you have to pay for SSL with their higher packages. It isn't free.   Also from reading and my own experience with them, if they (CloudFlare) provides the SSL Certificate, then you don't have control over it. They do and the can decrypt your connection because they also own the private key.          This list kinda makes me laugh...  	4
 oh cool!   it still fits, the squash banana is simba   The only thing I would want extra from this game is the ability to make my own character. Making a woman would be cool, for instance, but hey it looks rad anyway so yeh good luck to em. Can't wait to buy it :)            Nice video! Will it be a 60 dollar purchase or subscription?   I've never looked into this game much, but can someone tell me if this is correct?  It will be a game where you buy and upgrade your space ship, you can leave your pilots seat at any time and board other ships or walk around space stations. You can use a gun and you can also land on planets (cutscene landing?)  If thats right that sounds really good, but will there be a story or is it more of an MMO experience type deal?      I've been to the U.S. and it really is full of lovely people. I think the american political system is horseshit and your social structure is unfair, but god damn, everyone I met over there was so friendly and kind.      I love PBS game show :)      Bethesda Harry Potter game would be amazing. Going to classes, learning spells, finding hogwarts secrets, having friends (companions) and all of that would be amazing.   I really hope they do voice acting in French with english subtitles, love French language :D   Looks really awesome, makes me want to go back to working on a proof of concept I did ages ago about a wild animal game:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU2rEQEuixQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n37jvVdQt4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_3s-fLzDlw    Corgi's are amazing!      Fear.   Writing is still important but its now become a first step for other mediums. Video content comes to mind (youtube videos like "explainers". Good speaking and imagery is important but the writing underneath is why people keep coming back. Edit: sorry, on mobile   sounds perfect, do you have a greenlight page? will probably get it  P.s. how did you get into games writing? I'm making my own games currently so I can get some experience writing stories for games. Did you do the same?    Definitely would love to see a Bioshock game that tackles military interventionism, particularly given recent controversies surrounding drone strikes. It can really paint you into a corner when you start creating enemies as a consequence of trying to stop your enemies. If that can be intelligently critiqued I would be pretty stoked.  Along similar lines, I feel systems like the military industrial complex or the surveilance state would also be interesting issues. Metal Gear Solid has already addressed this pretty well already, though albeit in a completely different fashion to what Bioshock could do.  	22
 Same with me, I have never even taken a selfie, let alone posting it :(   Think you forgot Ingress?   You guys don't understand, Lord DuARTe uses a Macbook to keep an eye on the enemy.   India...   Blazing hot. 40C/104F.   Thanks for the advice, I would definitely try that today!   But how do I go about drawing them... When I draw real-life people, they turn out to be a complete disaster :(   But my drawings will look very amateurish to you!...   [Here's one!](http://i.imgur.com/ZBMROO6.jpg)   Great! I never can do as good as that!   Yes!!!   Even I am glad that I took it up. Really helps me utilise my free time. Can you show me one of your drawings? :D   I did realize the fact, that's why I inserted it there :P   I quit drawing a few years back, but this year I started to love it again, and I started spending more of my time on it...   I live in Maharashtra...   I love drawing catoons! (and sneks, lol jk). What do you like to draw? :)   **MY EYES ARE RELIEVED!!**   I am in India, and I just finished the 10th grade exams...   I love drawing, and tinkering with my mobile...   What about you?   Ummm... You would find me a wierd personality, as I never listen to music and I don't play games...   I am just watching a few vids...   XD. So, what are you doing?   [Saw ths pic, can't stop laughing!](http://i.imgur.com/tW4AjAU.jpg)   Indian food :) ... What about you?   Sure :D   But the effects were great...   Bored, too... nothing much to do :(   Yeah, certainly nice to look at!    The James Cameron one!   Yes, I seem to prefer dogs!   You saw Avatar?      Then.... Gravity?   You saw Interstellar?   [For all orange fans!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN5PoW7_kdA)       It's about cats? Somehow, I don't seem to like cats...   Yes!   I've never read horror books, too.   Which ones do you like?   I have no work to do currently :( Just browsing reddit...   I never watch horror movies. Do you read books?   No. *Hint: The country which your team defeated in the Cricket World Cup semifinals*   Thanks! What do you plan to do now?   If you like animated movies, you would love to watch Home! It's a cute movie :D   Yep.   Nothing, just browsing CC, nothing to do :( What about you?   Hi, just feeling very bored!   Far off...   Nah...   I doubt...   Now guess where I live...   :P   I made it orange.   Australia?   Asia?   In your house?   [Here are my new shoes!](http://imgur.com/39L28Yw)     Water :P   I would, for sure. 3 of my friends have come over, will you be there in 2 hours? Will catch up with you!   I bought a Sketchers running shoes for my birthday!   I woke up and read the newspaper. That's about it :P In the evening, I would go for running, as I am excited about my new shoes :)   Hi! So, how's your day going?   Hey, no problem mate. :D   Thanks a lot!   Power cut at my place, and I switched to my mobile. Really can't do much at 1.20 AM without lights :'(   Visita   Reminds me of their epic failure.   Power cut here :( On my mobile now, really can't do much without lights at 1.15 AM :'(   Really sorry, my scanner is not working :'( Please forgive.   Really sorry, my scanner is not working :'( Please forgive.   Really sorry, my scanner is not working :'( Please forgive.   Really sorry, my scanner is not working :'( Please forgive.   Really sorry, my scanner is not working :'( Please forgive.   Never heard of them... Can you tell about them?   On it!    I am starting to love drawing now!   Thanks!   What was the epicentre? Any idea?   Shit! All safe?   I didn't get you!   Right!   Not Sunday yet, though! But Saturday's almost over :)   Saturday's almost over here :(      Same for you, mate.    Even I am hoping for the same...     He was 14 when a bullet hit him during school rifle practice. He's still in coma now after 2 years...   I read that one of your friends suicided. Even one if my school friend was hit by a bullet, and I know how it feels :(   I haven't slept before 3 since the start of April!   Hey! What's up?   Hey, what's going on?   Happy birthday!   The British spellings are always used in my country, so I prefer them.   Mornings! That's what I've done always!   :D   Yes! Sure! I would love to :D   :( Thanks for the info, though!   I have seen you before on this sub posting about it...   My Nexus is currently at home, so I cannot provide proof. Till then, I am using a Moto G GPe. What about you, OnePlus shill?   #IUseLollipop   MKBHD   God    **MODS MODS MODS MODS MODS**   Apptly?   what's up   Ceiling.   Umm... I don't know... Never seen any cases or so...   Hmmm... Interesting. I read that it stops on a fact-book, but I guess it would be wrong.   The reason behind saying bless you is, when we sneeze, our heart-beat stops for a millisecond.   Hi, Philippines!   I know, the whole country is in ruins :( The tremors were felt here in India, too.   Seeing your username, are you fine?   Nope. I have never had one before :)   I don't think so :P   Cause I don't have one.   New Jersey, New York, Kentucky, New Orleans, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Florida, Washington, Ohio, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Utah, Alaska, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Indiana, Indianapolis, Kansas, Arkansas and Pennsylvania.

 Round 1) An outright no rules street fight. Rocky gets boxing gloves if he wishes and fights in his shorts, the enemy gets whatever weapon they are most synonymous with (Han Solo gets a blaster, Vader gets a lightsaber, etc). Use of The Force is permitted, no vehicles or ships etc.  Round 2) A boxing match. No weapons, boxing gloves are optional.  Round 3) Same as round 1, but with Star Trek characters  Round 4) Same as round 2, but with Star Trek characters  Any Star Wars/Trek character from any canon is permitted. It is peak Rocky and he gets a montage before each fight.  Could he beat Chewbacca?   I need to pass a fitness test that requires: 25 pushups, 45 situps and an 8 on the shuttle test score.  I can easily beat the 25 pushups and shuttle run score, but I've never done a situp in my life. I can't even manage one. The form they want you to use is placing your hands on your lower thigh and move them along your leg up to your knee. I can get about 2/3 of the way up there and just can't get any higher. I can't even do one rep. I DO NOT get anyone to hold my feet down, I have to do it unassisted.  I need to be able to pass by the end of the year. What's a good place to start?   And if I fail, do I have to pay the full $990 course fee again, or can I just pay to sit the exam?            Where there more people at Wayne Enterprises that new of Batman's identity? What about the military people contracting these designs? Or the people working on parts not made by Wayne Enterprises (perhaps the Batmobile's engine was made by Rolls Royce specifically for that vehicle? They found the wreckage in the tunnel in The Dark Knight and very few large projects like that are all designed by the one company, let alone by a small enough group to keep it all hush hush.  Is Batman being associated with Wayne Enterprises perhaps quite well known and just kept on the down low due to one big non-disclosure agreement?                Last trophy I need for platinum.   The difference between just making contact with my body with the ruler and pressing hard in against my 'fat pad' yields and extra half inch. How am I supposed to be doing this?               [This applies to Wiggles canon (TV shows, in character performances, books, etc) and not the irl Wiggles band who fill these roles.]  He stays awake, writing the songs, choreographing the dance moves and  managing the band. It's pretty clear that Murray has no interests outside of screwing around on his guitar, while Anthony is a pure food obsessed hedonist. Greg doesn't seem to have any active interest or hobbies outside of performing at all. So who is the hard worker churning out all those hits? Of course, it's Jeff.  Despite supposedly sleeping all day, he still manages to know all the words, music and moves. Why? Because he wrote it. He wrote all of it. And the rest just piggyback off his success. Not that he cares, everyone seems happy with this arrangement. I mean, how often do you get to sleep on your job without anyone getting angry with you?      Woah         I have one listed on the Steam market, but no one has bought it (it's been there for a few months). I even keep lowering the price.                        It's pretty common to see a King or second to the throne inspiring his troops from the front lines, before leading the soldiers into battle from the head of the pack. Was this common? If not, did it ever happen? How frequently would Kings actually join the fray?      Basically, I've been travelling a lot lately and this is the first day I've had to get on the Internet in two weeks, so I haven't kept up to speed with this game. I am about to go without Internet for awhile again in a few hours and I'm thinking of picking up a single player game to kill some time.  So, tl;dr, how crucial is the co-op to fully 'experiencing' this game? Is it like Borderlands, where I can still enjoy it single player, or is it more like Left 4 Dead where the emphasis is on multiplayer?            You can use http://www.redditinvestigator.com/ to find out. I'm not sure how accurate it is, but I'm pretty sure it's right in my case.   A lot of good suggestions are making it to the front page today, so I thought I'd take a moment to suggest something I think Dota has needed for a long time: heroes should fart when they die.   Honestly, I fully expected to have this feature by the time the game got out of beta, but that felt like a lifetime ago now. I think this should be added before TI5 as a priority feature, but they'll need to start ASAP if they're going to get all the VA's in to record farts for their characters in time.                     Firstly, these videos probably covered a wide time range as I've seen many posted, and it's been awhile since I've watched them so my specifics might be wrong.  At any rate, it was interesting to watch them because they often involved a lot of disarming and grappling. Was the common soldier trained in these techniques and if so, did they translate well into actual battles? Or was it more for 1v1 sparring and showfights? Kind of like how you learn a lot of advanced martial arts techniques, but when an actual fight breaks out you'll probably just use a basic grapple and pummel your opponent anyway?      Just want to know if I should buy now or hold out for a GOTY edition down the track.   Also if it's the latter, and my Plus subscription ends, do I get them back if I renew? What about save game progress and trophies?               Is there a strict definition for what guides Vulcan logic?   Or to suggest that overly sexist and objectifying portrayals increases the average males perception or treatment of women?  Because at the moment it just makes me think of many other arguments from the past: violent videogames will increase crime (they didn't, and crime is at a low while violent games are at their most gory), heavy metal music will lead to Satanism (completely debunked), rise of availability of porn will lead to increased rape (no correlation has been shown, let alone a link).  What exactly are SJWs using as a basis for their beliefs that sexy videogame girls = increased sexism in society or violence towards women in videogames will lead to actual violence committed towards women.  It seems to me like average living conditions in a country, religiousness and experience with women on a day to day basis all seem like they'd be better predictors of sexism and ill treatment of women than fucking videogames. (everyone plays videogames these days too, more people than ever, so it's certainly not an exposure issue. Previous generations who don't play games seem more sexist?). However, even this is just speculation, so to avoid sounding hypocritical: I have no idea what factors influence sexism. But I certainly don't see any reason to believe videogames are any more responsible than any other factor at the moment.  Feel free to prove me wrong.   Excluding trade spam rooms of course.         Rules: Each round takes place in a standard wrestling cage. There is no escape and nowhere to hide, nor are there any weapons. Each fighter is in a pair of boxers, no equipment, no armour, just pure brutal fisticuffs. Force to die or concede wins. Geralt gets potions beforehand.  Round 1: Geralt vs Spock Round 2: Geralt vs Batman Round 3: Spock vs Batman   And what about this very question? Is this 'listable'?   I've never hit level cap in an MMORPG before, but I think this might be the first one I manage to do it in. My question is: What is there to do at that point? What exactly does an MMORPGs endgame involve? Constantly fighting the same bosses over and over again for the chance of slightly better equipment is how I picture MMORPG endgame to work, is this at all accurate?            I just thought it would be funny to watch it from that perspective. A movie about Jim Carrey freaking out over nothing for an hour and a half, then walking out of a door in the ocean.  And all the in universe advertisements (like Marlon drinking his beer slowly in front of the camera) and things like the looping pedestrians/cyclists around his neighbourhood would look ridiculous. Please tell me an edit like this exists.  **TL;DR: Is there an edit of the Truman Show that removes all references to Truman being in a television show, because that'd be boss**   Batman got absolutely stomped in the first fight, but in the second fight he seems to win pretty handedly. It's even at first, but towards the end Batman is shitstomping Bane. Why was the matchup suddenly so even between them at first, and could Batman have continued to keep up and even win without damaging his mask?  Scene for reference [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxqC9LyNo-0)  Also not sure if this entirely counts as on topic for this sub, or if it belongs in another sub.      The more obscure the better as I've probably played most games you're about to suggest. Preferably PC, but suggestions from any console is fine.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y13cES7MMd8#t=50         I'm really curious to know what Valve's intentions for it are.         And how it will work. Hopefully cosmetic stuff works like L4D2 and doesn't require you to play on a special server. This pretty much killed workshop for KF1 for me.   By 'proper' I guess I mean something with some actual depth and story or gameplay mechanics akin to a typical PC or console game. Something that doesn't rely on Internet access, purchases to continue playing, etc.  I know both XCOM and some Final Fantasy games are available, but I've played them all to death in the past.   And would I likely get banned? I've always entertained the idea of making a novelty account to collect celebrities opinions on my dick, but would they even see it? Would I likely just get downvoted and banned? Would it count as sexual harrasment/illegal (I wouldn't trick them, I'd be straight up like "Here's my dick, what do you think of it Mr. Musk?")  Even if I only got one in every 20 celebs to reply it'd be worth it.   Preferably an action RPG, but anything will do. Something that gives you good control over your stats and ability progression and have the choices actually matter.  Thanks!  Edit: Preferably a little less mainstream. Great suggestions so far, but I have played most of them already!   So basically, I'm having trouble getting my speakers to split the sound correctly. I have them all plugged in and they all produce sound, but only for the Left and Right sounds when I run tests.   [So in reference to this image](http://i.imgur.com/T1yswxO.png), when I run the test, it first tests the left speakers. The speaker that should produce a sound here does. However, so does the center speaker, and the rear left and right speakers. During the test of the right speaker, again, rear left, rear right and the center speaker all produce sounds alongside the right speaker.  It then runs tests for the center speakers, rear speakers and sub - all of which produce no sound from any speaker.  Basically, left and right speaker are working as intended, but all remaining speakers seem to just play both the left and right sounds.  I've clearly set this up wrong somehow. Can anyone walk me through how to fix this? Thanks in advance!   http://i.imgur.com/kz9obCb.png  Haven't seen it happen once.   Firstly, I am Australian, and am assuming most first would countries have similar standards for leave and sick days.  Secondly, referring to CEOs of large multimillion dollar companies.  So yeah, what do their basic 'employee contract' look like in concern to days off? What happens if they call in sick but they're seen at the beach or something?         What's it like to have to date/be intimate with people you don't find physically attractive (due to your own limited options)? I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to 'settle'. Do you just overcome it and focus 100% on personality (to me, both looks and personality matter) or do you just partner up out of fear of being alone? HAVE you even managed to have relationships?  Do you feel self conscious all the time? Do you think it's impacted job opportunities? Friendships?  Is it a self imposed unnatractiveness (refusal to workout, etc) or did you just lose the genetic lottery?  TL;DR: How has being ugly affected your life? How do you deal with it?   Long story short, started with a Sorcerer build, used Soul Vessel to rebuild into Dex build for new game plus, have 12 Int and Attunement points pushing my soul level up that do nothing. Is there an item I can use to reduce them? I vaguely recall being able to do it in Demon's Souls.   Resident Evil 4 was the last RE game I really, really enjoyed. RE5 was good a single playthrough and messing around with a bit of co-op, it was a good game, but it was really where the series started to nosedive. I decided to give Resident Evil 6 and Revelations a shot, but they just bored me to tears. Is the series dead for good?   Title says it all.   Anything to keep an eye out for? Any must get boss soul weapons/armour?   All of the most frequent guests on QI get into an all out fight at the pub over some trivial fact in dispute. Who is the last one standing? This brawl also includes a wildcard, which will be explained below.  The 'contestants' are:  -Stephen Fry  -Alan Davies  -Bill Bailey  -Jo Brand  -Phill Jupitus  -Jimmy Carr  -Sean Lock  -Rich Hall  -David Mitchell  -Clive Anderson  -Rob Brydon  -Sandi Toksvig  -Wildcard (you may add on guest from the remaining guests who have appeared on QI from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI#Guest_appearances) if you wish).  **ROUNDS**  1) The all out brawl. Who wins? Who is dead last? What about a ranking from first to last?  2) Who was likely the most drunk?  3) Who most likely instigated the argument?   I noticed the store page lists ST:O has having Steam achievements. Where can I actually see these?            They got less fun every year, and now we're reduced to a simple badge crafting. I know most people don't pay attention to them, but I think they're a nice touch of fun and fanfare, especially when they introduced unique cosmetics for games like Dota 2 into them last time.   This is currently being promoted in a giveaway thread on pcmasterrace: http://dimmdrive.com/  What does it actually do and why would I want to use it?   It's in a regular fist fight. No weapons or significant environmental features. Who is the strongest person current Alec Baldwin could beat? What about in his prime?      I bought a business and noticed I had only received income from it once over several days of play. At this rate, I don't feel like it will ever pay itself off. Definitely not before I finish story mode.   Basically, I remember getting this error about a week after I first got my PS4 and having to fiddle with the network settings for hours. I am getting it again now when trying to access the store any other PSN features. However, I was not getting it at the start of the current attacks, it only started yesterday.  So I'm wondering, is this just coincidental timing with the error returning, or are other users getting this error?  Edit: Australian, if that matters.   Again, not trolling, some people may interpret this as a jab at the game. I'm genuinely interested. Is there a breakdown of the costs anywhere? Does that 200 million include marketing costs or a fat paycheck for licensing? Maybe they absorbed engine development costs into it (assuming they built an engine instead of licencing it)?  Where did the money go precisely?      Anyone else having issues with this? Doesn't seem to appear in big picture or regular Steam.   An ultimate, with a suitably long cooldown (perhaps the longest in the game), that could reverse time by 3/3.5/4 seconds? Everything would be returned to the state the game was in several seconds ago (with the one exception being this ultimate is placed on cooldown).  Aghanim's Scepter allows you to rewind time while dead.   Particularly, actual expansions with new quests etc?  I was kind of disappointed to see Dark Souls 2 release three expansions AND a 'remastered' edition within the first year of its release, I regret not just waiting and getting the definitive version. What are the odds of The Witcher 3 taking the same path? Should I pre-order or wait a year or so for a 'complete' version to come out?   Are photos like this touched up?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula#mediaviewer/File:One_Picture,_Many_Stories.jpg  Or are there actually places like this I can visit and see the night that bright? Particularly, the bright red center nebula and the glowing blue and purple stars/galaxies scattered throughout.  What about space photos like this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula#mediaviewer/File:Keyhole_Nebula_-_Hubble_1999.jpg  I get that nothing is faked, but MOST of that colour is outside of the visible light spectrum right? What would that look like to the human eye? Just black?   What are the big teams? The big strats/heroes? Any 'must watch' games from the past few months?      Also, does the customs counter in the records page only include the ones you have unlocked?      So I've got a pair of Sennheiser HD598s playing both through my PC and iPhone. I'm jumping back and forth between two tracks. One is a 320kpbs track ripped from a videogame. It's the original source file so you can bet it's high quality. The other is a 192kbps mp3 copy of it.  I'm failing to notice a difference between the two tracks, except that one is half the filesize. If I shuffle them and close my eyes, I can't tell which is which. Are my ears simply not good enough? My equipment? Why do people care so much about filetype and bitrate if not? Or do some songs simply compress better than others for whatever reason?  Educate me here audiophiles!   Unfortunately neither game seems to have Australian based servers, and I can't be bothered trying to PvP with lag.   I haven't played in awhile, but noticed today I am getting bullet bills in the middle of the pack and far more frequent 'good' items. I recently got a blue shell in second place. What is happening?   So I was posting on 4chan and (obviously) noticed that have a new captcha where I just have to press a checkbox to prove I am not a robot. How does this work?  I'm guessing users who pass enough captchas get this status, but if that's the case, why do I have to check a box at all?   I have a Gateway 3DS if that matters. I am just sick of grinding custom moves on the Wii U and wouldn't mind getting them all unlocked on my 3DS so I can transfer character sets over to the WiiU.  Thanks in advance!      What are the typical mistakes in this bracket? What roles should I learn to see the greatest progress? Is it better to play a farming game or an aggression game in this bracket (solo queue). Any guides specifically for this MMR range?  I know it's an awful vague question, but it's kind of hard to improve when I mostly play with people at my skill level (most of my friends are 2.5k MMR).   So who was right and about what in this video?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ5JvMOn5n8   What are the odds of items dropping? Do I have to just own the Arcana in my inventory or do I need to have it equipped? Does it have to be the PA Arcana?      While I'm at it: why was this solution so difficult to come up with?      Is it possible to get Druid's bear to stand next to his effigy, and get Druid in bear form? If not... can we have this please Valve?         I get an hour or two of cardio each week (15-25 minutes of jump rope most days of the week) and lift a bit of weights to keep some muscle definition.  My usual diet is stuff like chicken/beef stir fry (usually noodles over rice, since it reheats better), chicken or ham wraps/rolls, veggies (usually potato, carrot and broccoli), eggs, hamburgers (homemade) and occasionally red meat like sausages/chops. For breakfast: cereals like Wheat Biscuits, oats, cornflakes and Just Right with fruit once or twice a day (usually apple or banana). Occasionally soups and when I have toast (with eggs) it's wholemeal.  I usually just prepare all my lunches for the week (so one week might be wraps, next week stir fry, next week rolls/sandwiches) so it is a pretty static diet.  Now, the bad things. Once a week I'll usually have either takeout (KFC being my most common, usually a burger, a few pieces of chicken and a water instead of soft drink, followed by pizza, which I absolutely gorge on (I'm not overweight, but I freaking love pizza) and something like apple pie with cream once or so a week.  I can identify that this is a generally healthy lifestyle, but a close family member recently passed away from a heart attack which has me on full paranoia mode. Am I one day going to regret a couple of desserts and weekly takeout, or am I overexaggerating the effects of these bad foods?  Also, is there a better sub to ask this on? I thought of r/fitness, but I thought maybe they'd be more concerned with muscle gain than general health.      I finished the game in Grounded (first playthrough). I want to go back and finish it in Grounded + to get all the + trophies, but I also want the fully upgrade/shiv door trophies, which I don't think there is enough materials to get.  Is it possible to go Grounded  Easy + (get the upgrades and collectibles trophies)  Grounded + (for remaining + trophies) all with the one 'Joel'? Or can I only go down difficulties when starting a plus mode?   I finished the game in Grounded (first playthrough).

Is it possible to go Grounded  Easy + (get the upgrades and collectibles trophies)  Grounded + (for remaining + trophies) all with the one 'Joel'? Or can I only go down difficulties when starting a plus mode?      For example.  Phone rings  Hello, this is test_subject5355  Hi NS, this is Blank from Blank Inc., how are you today?  I'm good thanks  Now at this point, I usually just stop speaking. However, I noticed that sometimes there's an awkward pause. So I figured I'm doing it wrong and started sayings  I'm good thanks, and you?  Now all 3 times I did this, the person on the other end let out a light laugh. All 3 times. It might be because of how unconfidently I said it or am I not supposed to say that?  This question is probably pretty ridiculous, but I just feel like an anxious mess when using phones (talking over people, awkward silences, so forth) so maybe I'm overanalysing, but I don't know what I'm doing so I thought I may as well ask.         I just bought a PS4 and I have an old PS3 account that I forgot the password/DOB to. I contacted Sony support and sent passport for ID and they should be able to give me a new password.   Anyway, I was wondering if I avoid online features and play games on the default account without creating a PSN account (User1 I think it is) and unlock trophies, can I sync those trophies with my PSN account once I get the password? Or will I have to start again?  Basically: -Have old PS3 account -Have PS4 -Unlocked trophies on PS4 profile that currently isn't associated with PSN -What happens if I associate my old PS3 account with my PS4 profile on PSN?      I haven't really been watching lately, has 6.82 had any major impact on picks/strats?   Seems to be particularly common in chunks of chicken from stir fries.      Just curious, I went through my old family computer and I found a bunch of flash games (Stick RPG, Sinjid: Shadow of the Warrior) that I downloaded years ago. I started playing them again and all my save data is still there. It got me wondering where this data is stored. I'm playing them through Internet Explorer. Is it all stored in my IE cache (as if I was playing them online) or within the .swf? I thought it was kind of nifty going back through this stuff and want to back it up for memories sake, it feels strangely good in a nostalgic way to go through all this old stuff. Thanks!

I'm guessing it's because they're more reliable and will generally be better actors, but it always feels really weird. I often watch these movies assuming they're adult learners at small time colleges/unis before someone mentions that they're in high school or something.  It's particularly common in the horror genre.         I think this would be a great change. Valve's free to play model should extend to the store itself. Every game sold on Steam should become free to play, and Valve can support it by selling hats for your Steam profile pictures.  Hats could be purely cosmetic, or they can go the TF2 route and make hats 'sidegrades'.  Imagine:  **The Time Saver**  * +35% load time on the Steam store  * -15% quality of images   **The Merchant's Monocle**  * 5% better prices on the Steam market  * Maximum of 10 market purchases allowed a day   **Santa's Christmas Hat**  * +40% chance to receive drops while browsing the Steam store or playing Steam games during Christmas Day  * -75% relationship with your family   I for one think it would be an amazingly profitable venture for Steam, as well as benefiting all Steam users who can now play games as they please.  What other interesting hats would you like to see?         In my case, I just got offered a job working 7am to 7pm two days, then 12am to 7am two days with four days off. It basically just rotates like that non stop. While I think I'm capable of doing this and still maintaining a solid 6-8 hours of sleep a night, I was wondering if it would cause health issues?  I really want the job as it would work well with Uni since I'd get four days off back to back frequently to study/classes/assignments despite it being a full time paying job.  Will this be a health issue? What if I only did it for a year or two?   I'll keep things brief. I'm looking for a job relevant to my degree. I have taken a full time job in the mean time. They think I'm going to be here for years, I'm just treating it as a temporary job. I have applied for new jobs since then. Odds are, I'll get a smattering of interviews at random times throughout the coming months (not in one big block), so I can't just keep booking sick days or taking random time off throughout the day and my lunch breaks are only 30 minutes.  I have no leave accrued because I've only been working this job for a few days.  What do I do? I feel really trapped in this poor paying job with bad conditions and no career progressions, but I can't quit (financial reasons) and can't find a way to attend interviews for better jobs.   Do Americans know who the "Bananas in Pyjamas" are?   Is there any specific reason the games on Steam are being released in this order? Will we likely see all Final Fantasy games come to Steam (7, then 8, then 3, then 4, then 13)? It makes it seem like they don't ever intend to release 9, 10 or 5?  Also what are the odds of getting these games? Is there some reason we didn't get 9 after 8? The only reason I can think of for not getting 10 is because of the HD remake recently.  Particularly, will we likely see IX, X and XIII's sequels?      OK, so I have these very vague images in my head of a game I played when I was younger. I sincerely doubt anyone will be able to help me as I can't even hold the images in my head very well. But here we go anyway.  It was a PC game, I played it in the mid to late 90s. It was a first person game and I believe it involved you exploring a cave or something. I think early on you get attacked by a bat or some sort of flying creature. I can't remember if it was an FPS or not, but I think it might have been 'on rails' and had cinematic style graphics... I think.  I really can't remember anything else. May or may not have been set on another planet (it involved a lot of alien enemies).  Is there a thorough database somewhere I could peruse to maybe remember a bit better?   Thanks.  Platform(s): PC  Genre: Unknown  Estimated year of release: 1990-2000  Graphics/art style: I think it was a combination of real life footage and animated? Or maybe entirely 2D. It had a 'realistic' look to it.  Notable characters: None  Notable gameplay mechanics: None  Other details: I don't remember anything :(   OK, so I have these very vague images in my head of a game I played when I was younger.

Why did we 'invent' capital letters? When did they first appear and how else have they been used throughout history (now, usually for proper nouns and the starts of sentences along with some other niche uses)?   Why did we 'invent' capital letters? When did they first appear and how else have they been used throughout history (now, usually for proper nouns and the starts of sentences along with some other niche uses)?      I was just thinking, something that has helped me deal with my anxiety over the years is forcing myself into increasingly uncomfortable situations until I adjust to it. However, having the Internet has allowed me to avoid many things that could have served as a great means to overcome my anxiety much quicker (mostly to do with human interaction: leaving the house to shop, talk to salespeople, phone calls, etc).  Do you think a rise in Internet availability could be linked with a rise in anxiety? I know it's hard to judge this sort of thing since mental orders in general change their definitions over the years and reporting on the whole is on a rise (people more accepting about or it aware of it).  Is there any research done on this potential link?   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/HubbleDeepField.800px.jpg/1045px-HubbleDeepField.800px.jpg   I just finished Chapter 3 and I haven't even finished the first day yet. I've done all the sidemissions that popped up (they felt scarce, tbh) and collected a fair amount of stuff. I remember feeling really pressed for time to do much in the original Dead Rising, but I'm just breezing through this one. I'll be finished well and truly before the six day mark.  Does Chapter progress slow down at all soon - or side mission frequency increase?   For example, would the top 10 female tennis players be equal to the top 10 males?       It doesn't make them look threatening, it makes them look like props for tourists. Is this actually how they're seen within England? Why can't they just stand still and guard the palace without having to work around like a jackass?   Are you still using it? With SteamOS? What are the pros and cons?  The controller is obviously out of date, but how are you enjoying the trackpads?  Edit: I'm referring to the early Steamboxes that have been given out a few months back.  	163

What I think is that u/CaptButterToast kind of runs this whole Gen Wunner are obsessed with nothing in to the ground... in a few threads... because both sides are kind of so adamant about their position. But again, I just posted this video because I thought it was funny. And love Pokemon.      Yeah see I was in first grade, had both Red and Blue, and love all the generations. I can see both points of view... Funny I had a feeling about that.   Lol am I right though? Did you not play Gen 1 when it came out?   Ehrmahgawd you watched that video too   One could say the inverse, that younger fans don't appreciate Generation 1, because they didn't start playing until Generation 3. You make a bunch of valid points, it's just this video is satire. Not something to be Outrage(d) about.   Looks like $65 dollars to me. *cough* Sorry, had a bit of a dog groomer moment there.      Probably right, since most of the video relates to Generation 1.   I like how your pup has a healthy looking cranium. So many of them are so narrow it causes neurological problems.

People break off it to separate groups, tribes, and nations. Leading to an eventual Revolution of the ruling class. I'd call it 'The Opium Den'.   I sit waiting.  They weren't kidding,  Just staring is erecting.   This group drinks,  And grunts, and talks,  And I want her innards.   She's carrying,  And I can see it,  I just need patience.   I wait till they leave,  She walks off,  I follow her breath.   The bitch tilts and cocks,  I balk and dive down,  She keeps going.   I'm hot, I'm sweating,  It's a hundred degrees  And my lips are on-  "BILL!!! BILL!!! I GOT EM'! BAG'D THAT HUGE WOLF SONUVABITCH!"    Mars is such a cruel place to live.  Don doesnt use my name, just keeps me locked up in this little cage all day and night while he fiddles with colonizers, mining for riches as I soil my cage.  My names Bethany; you should remember that, that and Ive been trafficked here for fucks and giggles.  Well, its been about 4 months since Don found me on a personal ad, drugged me, raped me, trapped me in a small box, and kept me in his work building on the Mars colony.  I only know where I am because of passerbys shooting the shit about the glories of space expansion.  No, I cant talk back, hes got a ball gag in my mouth, Don isnt that stupid.  I also know something thats quite interesting about the room Im trapped in, and that is that it contains quite a large amount of explosives.  I dont like to toot my own horn, but I know a thing or two about blowing buildings up to high heaven, in this case THE heavens.  During his last fuck-and-go, I managed to fiddle up a spare lighter from the sleaze bag's pocket and jam up my well, you get the point.  So Im going out with a bang.   We, the gutter junkies, the corrupt pharmacists, the strung out whores, the closet pill poppers holding nine-to-five jobs, were all that were left. Everyone else just never woke up.   Thank you.      I also have a shelf for my comic book and glass of milk  Ah, the 'Butter's Technique'. Comfort and class.   ... more the sexual scenes in the book. Clowns give me the heebie jeebies.   Well it's part of the job for small and medium dogs. Large dogs usually don't need it. Otherwise, millions of dogs would just scoot their butts on your carpets. And no one wants that.   I found out by reading Stephen King's 'It' at 13-14         This isn't a debate, just speak/type better english.   Even though this isn't new to me, and I don't think it belongs here, I love that it's here. Thank you so much.   I've been nothing but logical, I even presented evidence from GLAAD, gave you a bit of history on why people don't like the words, 'fag' or 'homosexual'. Unfortunately it goes upon deaf hears. This is like talking to a piece of cardboard --- that's me being condescending.      No but words bring up feelings, thoughts, memories. Words have emotive value. So stop using it and make the world a little bit better. K? Cool.    I can't stop laughing.   Oh oh oh, I know it's french, but [YELLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c-GeBqUgAA).

Dog groomer :D   Sorry you feel that way, just trying to educate someone with poor word choice on a public platform. We are equals. Just that people in my community have a past of electroshock therapy, forced castrations and genital mutilations, being sent away to camps and therapist for 'help', being dragged behind cars, abused and battered; but it's fine, I just need not be offended and grow thicker skin.   I love them now... thanks for the share! I also added another band in my first post, Grand Ole Party. She sings AND plays drums, at the same time. So much badassary.

Also, 'homosexuality'. Here's a GLAAD [page](http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive) that talks about that word as well. Internet can be educational too. Not just a place to perpetuate shitty vocabulary in the honor of 'tradition'.   I was grooming two [American Straffordshire Terriers](http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images11/AmericanStaffordshireTerrierMountbrierfarms935without.jpg), really easy, just a basic bath, with some light brushing and a nail grind. Well I was grinding one of the dogs nails, and I looked away for a second to answer a coworkers question, and she didn't like me just holding up her paw. She growled for half a second and snapped her jaws about an inch from my face. I heard her teeth. Finished the nails quickly. Took a break immediately. Sat smoking a cigarette with my hands shaking like I had Parkinson's.   Gave a guy with a dog a few dollars. Told my roommate about it. He told me that particular homeless guy beats said dog. Immediately felt terrible.   Mmmm... straight people claiming words about sexual minorities aren't insulting when they're told they are....   Because porn.   I don't believe you.   Since I work with them, 94.3% of my day involves talking about them. Especially off work. Friends. Family. Random strangers walking down the street that notice i know exactly what breed of dog they own.   Elephants. Also, my first word.   A false positive HIV result. Fucked with my head for years.   Best: Graduating and running up to my friend and hugging while simultaneously swinging her around in circles.  Worst: Getting jumped by 30 bros cause my friend looked gay, and I was gay. Mostly because of him though. And I only got spit on. He got knocked out.   Ever hear of [Boomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomsday_(novel)? That.

I grew up watching your shows in the classroom, and those shows helped blossom my interest in science throughout the years to such an extent! Thank you so much. My question relates to extinct/endangered species and this current Holocene extinctionary period, and what we can do to prevent some of the loss.  I understand that certain institutions exist that preserve endangered and extinct animal DNA and bodily samples, such as [The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo](http://www.sandiegozooglobal.org/what_we_do_banking_genetic_resources/frozen_zoo/), with the hopes of maybe one day being able to recreate these species, such as what they did with the [Banteng](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Clone-of-endangered-species-succeeds-Angus-cow-2656880.php). You hear people talking about wanting to bring back the mammoth, or thylacine.  Some scientist, such as [Dr. Paul Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Mammoths-Extinctions-Rewilding-Environments/dp/0520252438) actually wanted to sustain large numbers of ice age megafauna on the U.S. continent, brought in from other parts of the world.  My question is this: do you believe our resources are better spent conserving the life that currently exists on this planet, further preventing mass extinction? Are these ideas of resurrection too 'sic-fi' and farfetched to be beneficial in the name of biodiversity?   Again, thank you so much for inspiring generations of kids around the country. Cheers.

 1. Good advice, as 1 out of every 50 eggs will be ...weird. Extra yolk, fertilized, or just generally gross. I break them singly into a plastic egg cup before I toss it in the pan/baking mix.  2. If you're having this big of a problem with egg shell, you're cracking your eggs too hard. Just tap them on the side with the back end of a knife, use both hands (pro level one handed!) to pull the shells apart...usually no fragments.   Excellent suggestions! Thanks so much. I definitely use outside storage, though that fried in my electrical explosion event too. This think looks lag free and powerful! Thanks again!   Over time,  I have learned to like the ending, but upon first read, it just pissed me off...it felt cheap, too easy...re-reading and reading again, and I feel a little bit better for it, but when I read those words, those oh so familiar words, after all this time....*sigh.   Most of my recording paths are "live" (for lack of a better description), basically an outboard sound source - outboard preamp - outboard effects - into the DAW. What plugins and VSTs that I do use are instrument modelers for my MIDI controller...and not big combo packs (like Komplete programs with over 250 instruments emulators, I look for downloads of single sounds, or just a few options for a single sound, depending on my needs... I know you need me to be more specific, but the reason that I'm attempting this build is that I had a major electrical fuckaroo caused by an act of drunk people driving into power pole...fried my studio, and most everything connected to it....including a very high end APC surge protector...with the insurance nightmare, it's been months (almost a year) since I've been able to use the studio, so it's difficult to remember all the VSTs and plugins that I have used in the past.) I will say again that VSTs and plugins are minor compared to the "live" aspect of my recording. (I know that Cubase is built for beatmasters and electronica, but it has features that work for me as a live recorder.)  As far as tracks, most songs would have five or six stereo tracks (the way I record/mix that means 10-12 single tracks) effects tracks for each of those, and maybe 3-5 digital/midi tracks, with effects tracks for each of those...so 35 tracks max, and that would be a very "busy" piece for me.  The only other pertinent thing I would add is I would like to have the ability to use a dual monitor system...my last studio did not, but I think that would make my life a little easier; having both the ability to split screens so that the DAW is on one screen, and effects/emulators/MIDI can run on the other, and to mirror, so when I'm working with other musicians we can both see the same DAW while working in different area of my studio corner. (And, I'm not much for overclocking or anything, my DAC provides external clocking anyway, pretty sure.)  Sorry so wordy, and I appreciate whatever advice is coming my way!   None. Digital Audio converter will run on USB 2.0. Mic/instrument/midi will run through DA converter.   Read on. You will be given an opportunity to stop early. Many of us wish we had. But you won't. And King will call you out for your decision... "You are the grim, goal-oriented ones who will not believe the joy is the journey rather than the destination...who still get the lovemaking confused with the paltry squirt that comes to end the lovemaking." You will read to the end, oh yes, and you will see...yes, you will see. You will finally see.  The next time you read it, stop there. It's better that way.   I would like to, but my previous PC did not...latency was noticeable in some heavy application sound paths.    I need to replace my digital audio workstation! Thinking about a combo machine that I could also use for general video editing (no software chosen, youtube quality stuff) and photoshop applications. DAW running Cubase 5, (maybe upgrading) along with several other virtual sound editors/effects/modulators/emulators. Lag is a killer in sound recording, of course, so let's avoid that. Budget on the low end, let's try to keep it under a grand? I can source OS and peripherals elsewhere.    Self-explanatory.    I tried everything...the only thing that worked for me was patience, and trying to be understanding and not filled with self hate when I failed, which I did, over and over and over and over again. But each time I failed, I would let them grow a little bit farther. I still don't know if I've succeeded, I just haven't bit my nails in quite a while, I may still bite them in the future. But if I do, I'll move on, start over, and be patient. I will win.   Same problem here. I just quit biting my nails recently, (three year process, not biting for months now) and it seems to have gotten worse. Inside of my cheeks are beat to hell.   That was badass. I think the commentators will be washing their underwear and extra time or two...they really seemed to enjoy that.   Lick your lips, moan, look him deeply in the eyes, grunt and say..  "I'm gonna be pickin' your ball hair outta my teeth for *days*!"  Try to be sexy when you do, it helps.    I do it all the time.  I'm up to one orgasm. Then I take a nap for 56 minutes.    Didn't really get that either. I thought perhaps she's mad at the way Glen's been acting about the whole thing, but if she was mad about Glen being super mad, why get super mad at Glen?  Still don't understand women, even when fictionalized. *sigh.   Two methods here. As mentioned, the menu puts profit above all else...the items that are described the best, or boxed out, or "featured" or some such, are the items that the restaurant makes the most profit on. These are not necessarily the best items, just the ones that make the most money. Quick menu rule of thumb...if you want good food, order what the restaurant specializes in. Eating in a steakhouse, order steak. Pizza joint? Stay away from the sandwiches. Don't order chicken at a seafood joint. Other method is to chat up your server. They may suggest items with a high markup to try and pad their tip, but engage them, and ask them what do they eat when they get off work. Tip accordingly for awesome suggestions.   Lucifer's Hammer - Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (sp?)... the book that turned me on to reading oh so long ago. Great epic end of the world shit right here man.   This is a good idea. There is a disconnect in expectations as most men are waiting to meet their insatiable whore while most women are waiting to meet their Prince Charming...or, women need to watch more porn, and men need to watch more Disney.  Or Disney Porn. Just sayin'.   One time my future wife and I were hanging out with some friends at our local bar. I was yuckin' it up, being the life of the party (my thing) and the future wifey-poo says something-or-other while I was talking to some friends, so I face-palmed her, and (loudly) said...   "SHUUUUSH! Grownups talking!  We are still together, married for three years, believe it or not, though she does tell me (too often) that that was the closest she's ever been to slapping the dogshit outta me. Even though I got a great laugh out of that line, in the end, not worth it, wouldn't recommend it...     "Oh, you were *in* the Holocaust? Well at least you weren't raped in the Holocaust."   130 pounds of prime rib, about 45 filets of tenderloin, a couple of porterhouse steaks, about 50 top sirloin steaks, about 30 ribeyes, 250 baked potatoes, four pounds of creamed spinach, about two gallons of rice, 20 filets of salmon, 20 filets of swordfish, two pounds of shrimp, 40 racks of babyback ribs, and 40 chicken breasts. (I had to work, had leftover ribs with the wife when I got home around midnight. Happy Valentine's Day!)   I call mine the Rubik's Cube....because it gets harder the more you play with it.   So much of our reality is based on that fiction.   A smile.   Seriously. Whether it's sexy short skirts, or a long skirt and no undies, or sweat pants and tank top like Panda said, the most important thing is confidence and fun.  For me, just the smile, when we get home, please. I don't need anything else.   Lol....true, it has been said that you can turn to any random page of the bible and find relevance. The bible is full of death, so really no surprise that that is mentioned often, but it was neat to see how many chapter 2, verses 17 had something in common. (I researched chapters 21 verses 7 and didn't see as many commonalities.) Just a statistical blip, but it was fun researching it. (An atheist's best weapon is biblical knowledge, you know!)   Hmmm....  So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Ecclesiastes 2:17  The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes. Lamentations 2:17  Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the temple porch and the altar. Let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?' "  Joel 2:17  The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,  Isaiah 2:17  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. Song of Solomon 2:17  And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams  Acts 2:17  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. James 2 2:17  And the world and its desires are fading away, but the person who does God's will remains forever. John 2:17  but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die. Genesis 2:17  Very interesting. I wonder if this was intended or mere happenstance. A lot of these verses sort of...*fit*.    I saw it...curiouser and curiouser...   You spelled "Idiots" wrong.   Good read, opinion adjusted, but, reading the report, I feel like the main thing I learned is that here is another example of a complex economic system being described two very different ways. The ROI of 7:1 (I wasn't familiar with the 22:1, that seems high!) and 1:10 shows the difference between NASA *contributing* to new ideas, and the *direct* effect of creating businesses or patentable new items that result in private sector profit. (I admit to being biased in favor of NASA, I live right down the road from America's Spaceport, and there's nothing like watching a launch light up the night sky over the Atlantic!)   We needed NASA to get us off the planet. And they did so. But only with the entire nation behind the endeavour, fueled by the Cold War scare. Now that we have been there, national interest is far lower, and the return on investment is perceived to be low, though the opposite has been proven, even showing that compared to other monies spent on government program, NASA has the best ROI than any other program in history. But, short of some international boogeyman threatening to take the moon from us, the future is going to be about money. NASA is more about science, and I think that they will continue that mission in the future, but the next space race is already on, and it's a race for revenue. Whether it will be from mining asteroids, or lunar tourism, or orbiting solar power generation stations, or even asteriod based robotic manufacturing plants, private companies will lead the way in further exploration as they try to find the money hidden in space. Overall, I feel like this is a good thing, private companies taking the risks, and reaping the rewards will mean that many private citizens in the near future will have access to space. This will lead to colonization, whether orbital, lunar, or other, and once humans are living in space, there will be more opportunites for people in support positions for those working in space based industry. (Those folks gotta eat, somebody will get up there and figure out how to open a restaurant, though I think a bar would probably be first!)   I think the media is being careful...there's a strong chance that this guy could end up looking a bit like a hero. Read the "manifesto" and ignore the second half, and it's like a Hollywood movie where the good guy is identified as the bad guy by the bad guys that wear the uniforms of the good guys.  Also, the MSM doens't go out of it's way to report on cops looking bad at their jobs, and so far Dormer is making the LAPD look like a bunch of boy scouts. Watch, when they catch (and kill, most likely) this guy, this story will suddenly get a whole lot of coverage.   Sure, sure, sure, let's all sit down and have a rational conversation, but ask yourself, *is it funny?* (Note: I don't think the situation is funny, really it's just a bit disturbing, and probably would be best handled in some other fashion than mine, but if they choose to take my advice I feel I should add that they put a camera in the box as well, you know, *for the funny!*   If I had a penchant for stealing panties from my female friends and GFs of my male friends, and got a box full of panties, and *then* uncovered pictures of my male friends and BFs of my female friends wearing those panties, it would certainly make me think twice about repeating that behavior! Letters not necessary, I suppose, but a bonus, as OP stated that he wanted to preserve the friendship.   Tough question. Here's why.   Sound: Everybody likes a different sound. And everybody plays a different style. Fingerstyle pickers want a real bright sound. Chorders want something that's going to ring out a bit. Compound that with the fact that the strings that I like on my acoustic are gonna sound different on yours.  Size: The gauge of the string is important as well. Real thin sets (from .007 or .008) are for real light players or softer sounds, heavier sets for the big strummers. Gauge of the sting will affect brightness to a small degree, with heavier strings, generally, being brighter.  Metal: Lots of different types of metal besides steel. Steel nickel wound. Brass/phosphorous. Hell, you can buy strings with a gold coat if you want. Different types of metals will give you different types of sounds and finger feel.  Price: Cheapo strings are usually just that, but expensive doesn't mean good.  Life: If you're touring, and changing sets every four days, then the life of your strings really doesn't matter. But if you're like the other 99.9% of us, you're probably on a budget, and want those strings to last a bit. Each company's strings are a little different here, and unfortunately the only way to compare is to buy them.   So, for me, I choose Martin Marquis 80/20 Phosphor/Bronze with the unwound Gstring, med gauge. (.009). Because, I like the way it feels on my fingers, I prefer a med-heavy gauge, because sometimes I like to get funky on my acoustic. I like the life of my Martin Marquis, I like C.F. Martin in general (my box isn't a Martin), and they formulate those strings for players like me; casual players that want ring and sustain, that want a long life from their strings, want to minimize breakage, and that play the style that I do, which is, mostly chords, some fingerstyle, some flatpicking, etc.  Try a few on for size and see what you like. Talk to your shop guy, he probably plays, and probably has an opinion, and it is probably as worthless as mine!      Didn't think about cutting a blank to use as a template! Genius! I had planned on using a press (homemade, of course!) with the bit I was fantasizing about existing, with the wood clamped down. But the template thing might work for me; the goal is to cut a significantly large amount of same-sized discs.   Saw these when I made the trip to my local HD...but when I asked the orangeman if they had arbors without the drill bit I just got a blank stare....   It seems so simple, but I cannot find what I'm looking for. I need a hole saw. But every one that I have found has the pilot bit on the arbor. I'm looking for a hole saw bit without the pilot bit. (I don't need the hole, I need the circle of wood...without a hole in the middle!) What is this thing called, and where can I find it? Gotta be quicker and more exact than my jigsaw!   1. Collect letters from all women missing panties, politely explaining that he should stop, but that they understand that he has a fetish that makes him do this.  2. Collect panties from all women involved.  3. Get a box.   4. In the box from top to bottom should be:  * A typewriten note stating that you are still friends, hope this helps, enjoy the panties. * Letters from the women involved.  * Panties.  * In the bottom of the box, include a picture of all the men that have had GF missing panties, dressed in the panties that are in the box, and nothing else. Dissapproving looks a bonus here.  Mail the box off, and wait. Something should happen.   Hmmm...Depends. If the eggroll was Chinese style, you most likely are looking at a snake fang. This signifies good luck in the Chinese culture. The tradition is that whoever ends up with that snake fang stuck in their upper gum is considered the "winner" and you should return to the restaurant/store for your prize!  If the eggroll was Japanese style however, it's probably a bird's talon, and it means that you have been marked for assassination by the Yakuza. You should probably find a safe house, lay low for a while.  If the eggroll was any other Oriental style, than you probably have a cat claw there....nothing to worry about. In this down economy, many eggroll manufacturers and restaurants are cost cutting however they can!  But, a word of caution, if this was an American style eggroll, you have found what is locally called "a reason to sue the shit tits off of somebody" and should lawyer up and get ready for your payday, even though there was no real harm to you.  Hope this helped!  Expertise: I've eaten like 14,000 eggrolls in my life. But I ain't never seent nothin like that!      As much as I love Family Guy, I save all my props for the music that you guys do...really over the top, and we appreciate it! Any thoughts about a full length Family Guy musical?    These people must not ever have heard of the internet. When you tell us "Hey, don't manipulate this picture in any way" we say "Challenge accepted."   I would totally go check out someone who calls themselves Slappy McNuts....I don't know why, but I would have to know. I don't know what kind of performance I would expect, however.   Have you considered Slappy McNuts? Just off the top of my head...   Worth the read. It reminds me of some of King's early work, especially some of the short stories. Also, read his other works (Heart shaped box and 20th Century Ghosts)...he shows his father's quirk of linking his stories together. (BTW...20th Century Ghosts is outstanding, if a little confusing.)   I barely fit in them too...sometimes it's like carrying around a hotdog in a hefty bag. So what do you do? Tie it off with a bread tie? Duct tape? Rubber bands?    Nope...that's easy...awww, hell!! Bastard!   Two punk rock bands in the '80's.

(Yes, that Seinfeld). We've been using this at home just to up the nutritional content of the baked goods that we make, but it sounds right up your alley. Short version...make vegetable purees and hide them in delicious foods that your toddler (might) want to eat. Good luck! (Annd FYI...looking out for your girl *is* mommying up, no matter what path you take!)   TiL about Albert Fish, some cool ass snake, and warp drive. I love my fucking homepage!   Read on.   That's the one. It reads a bit like a textbook, but I believe that investing the time to get to know your DAW is going to help you in the long run. Happy recording!   Love it. Will buy, even not knowing what mold!   1. Not a lot of info here, but first guess is that if it's not showing in your VST plugin list it's because you haven't added it to your VST plugin list yet (those are two different actions).   2. Hopefully it came with a book. Read it. Read it again. Take notes. Reference it. I love my cubase, but if I had any real complaints about it, it would be that it doesn't have a real "natural user feel" to it...there is a big learning curve. I use 4 still, and I'm still learning. Also check out [Steinberg.net](http://www.steinberg.net/en/home.html) for specific info about cubase, and [tweakheadz.com](http://tweakheadz.com) for general recording tips.  3. I love my cubase. It was built for digital (dance, edm, electronica, etc) but I use it for (mostly) live recording, and like more than any other DAW that I've used. Use the trial, if you like it, pull the trigger on the full version.       I do all right playing the blues, but I play by ears and heart. I've heard some guys rip SRV perfectly, but it somehow misses something...Stevie had some reason for those notes that the rest of us can only experience, never replicate.   Pork, red onions, pineapple (or mango), plus spiciness. Yum.   I have no practical advice to give you, so I'll share a George Carlin quote instead.   "It's not enough to know *how* to play the blues, you must know *why* to play the blues."   Strums for each chord, or rhythmic strumming pattern would depend on song and player choice. Assuming our example song is in 4/4 (common) time, you would have a lot of options.  Whole note strumming would be strumming the chord one time, and letting ring for the other three counts of each four beat measure (Strum-two-three-four).  Half-note strumming would be strum-two-strum-four. This is way over simplified, as most rhythmic strumming is going to be a mixture of up and down strums, at a mixture of tempo, depending on song and player.  If you're asking for practice reasons, the easiest answer, for a 4/4 song, is to strum each chord four times per measure (quarter-note strumming). Your example song would be: E,E,E,E,D,D,D,D,G,G,G,G,A,A,A,A, in the 1-2-3-4 manner.   Ummm...all of them? Most of them, really. Not into bigger girls too much, but I that doesn't mean that I haven't found an individual bigger girl sexy. I'm probably the wrong dude to answer this, because yes, I love me some sexy bodies, but I am so easily turned off by negative attitudes, poor intelligence, unwilling spirit, etc. Give me an average looking girl with a can-do attitude, and I found the sexiest girl alive!   Slow cooking really is as easy as everyone says. But here's some protips:  * I really recommend against cooking from frozen due to the food being in the temperature danger zone for more than four hours. Most of the time you're going to be safe, but it's that one time that will change your life. Food-bourne illnesses will make you want to be dead. Thaw your meats a day ahead of time.  * Red meats really benefit from browning before crocking. If you have time, cut steaks into 1 ro 2" cubes, brown in oil, salt and pepper, (don't cook them, just brown the outside) and toss in the crock. Extra flavor here we come!  * Crocking generally means that you're cooking with a liquid. Over that large amount of time, your liquids are going to concentrate somewhat. Be careful when adding spices. If you put two tablespoons of salt in two cups of water, you're gonna come back to two tablespoons of salt in 3/4 cup of water. I add little spice/flavor at the beginning, taste about one hour before you expect to eat, and adjust accordingly.  * Don't be afraid of bone-in meat. Crock it, pull the bones. Slow heat breaks down all kinds of connective tissue, that's why crocking is so awesome.  * Because of above, don't be afraid of discount cuts of meat. Chuck roasts, chicken thigh, random chops of pork are all great meats that will break down easily.  * I had a horrible experience trying something with fish. I don't recommend it. But that's just me.  * Check recipes for ideas. You don't need recipes, but there are a lot of really cool ideas to crock up. Recipe is meat+liquid+seasoning+time. Simple.  * Have fun, and remember to turn your crock off when you're done with it. Worst baked on disaster ever!   No matter how much you shake and dance, the last drop always ends up in your pants.   Your school has nice balls.   Would also add a big hurdle for me to jump over, and hard lesson learned..  You are never "done" writing a song.  I've changed my songs over and over and over again. Each time I play it, it seems like I see an opportunity to improve the message the lyrics were trying to convey, or a slightly more fitting guitar phrase that fits the mood of the song.   I have songs that I've been working on since a teenager, and while my friends from high school would probably recognize the song that I play for them, they would also recognize that it's nothing like the one they heard the first time, oh so long ago.   I've tried to share Zach Deputy on reddit so many different times...and nobody seems to appreciate him. Part of the problem is most of the YT vids are just not showing what it's like to see him live. Huge fan from FL, loving seeing someone else rep ZD!   In Boca, there is nothing to do but wait to die, and count old people. Enjoy the beach.    I'm gonna go with... all of them. Hated the 90's. At least pop stuff.   Whatever you do, do not dumb yourself down. You might attract guys, but they might be the wrong kind. The reason that you are getting approached by older men are because older men (me!) also exude confidence, and generally have our shit together.   Way I see it, two options: One, start talking to people, making plans, and starting things on your own. Not necessaryily asking guys out on dates, but start organising things on your own. If guys can talk to you a bit and get to know you, and find that you aren't that intimidating, your prospects might go up. Inversely, just start chatting the guys up, and go on and exude your confindence. Ask them..."So, when are you going to ask me out on a date?" Stay friendly, and I hope you find what you're looking for. (I did!)   True, and I stated that in my comment. My point was how many people are taking that little blue pill, not because they have limpus dickus, but because "the tv told me to ask my doctor"?   Wasn't selling "Uncle Leroy's Calmative" out of the back of a horse drawn trailer a business model? I can see the comparison.   True enough. I didn't think of energy drinks as "medicine"...I was looking more at big pharma taking the place of snake oil salesmen.    Quacks and snake oil aren't really the issue anymore. Science has paved the way for a new style of schyster.   It seems like now the goal is to develop the drug alongside the symptoms...diseases that we've never heard of now get nationwide commercial coverage as we discuss Restless Leg Syndrome, or how often a dude over 50 is supposed to be pissing.  I'm not belittling people that have real issues that need real medicine to help them, but how much were we as a nation discussing Erectile Dysfunction before the advent of Viagara? It seems from the content of commericial advertising that just about every healthy male over the age of 50 or so is in dire need of propping up their boners so their hot middle aged wife doesn't leave them for the tennis instructor. Same thing with ADD, ADHD, MAOI's, and the pharmacopia of antidepressants that are now available.  In short, why have fake meds when we can count on fake (ok, not fake, but trumped up, overstated, or broadly and casually diagnosed )diseases to make "real" meds for?   I would also suggest offering a small reward if you wanted the physical card returned to you (enough to cover postage and a bit to sweeten the deal) or specifying that you just want the data and providing an email address or website for the pics/data to be uploaded to.    To be considered an "Advanced" guitar player, the player must:  * Show up fifteen minutes late to practice. At least.  * Have visible tattoos/piercings. (Face tattoos will be accepted as a substitute for piercings, but multiple piercings will not be accepted in lieu of tattoos.)  * Refusal to carry any gear but his/her own to and from gigs.  * Must have one of the following: (Consistent alcoholism, recurring mental issues, or recovering addiction to hard drugs. (Marijuana does **not** count.))  * Must also have one of these advanced habits: (Playing parts of songs that the band does not know/perform while lead singer engages the crowd, the ability to sing backups in a mike that is not hot, or the ability to cue primadonna meltdowns on cue.)    Zoltan Brewing Co. - the crazy bird at the way station in The Gunslinger  Callahan Brewing Co.  And of course....**19**.   Love to throw with you, or buy you a beer. I'm bringing the team from New Smyrna down, six of us, to check out what Wickam Park has to offer.   Nice to see this. I've been talking about the "Big Mac Effect" for a long time, both on line and in person, declaring that as long as Joe Schmo can hit up the local McDonalds and get a Big Mac for a couple bucks, he's gonna think that everything's all right with the world. It's good to see some hard science that shows this.   Hmmm....bite two corners off my BBQ hot pocket and blow through the thing? Are you trying to get me to cool my hot pocket, or defaceify my wife? This seems like it could be a terrible idea....that I'm gonna try anyway! Look out puppies/wife/small children, daddy's blowing a lava pocket!   Upvote for visibility....better follow through. And be careful. They don't like being filmed when working, they certainly aren't going to like this.    12" to 16", assuming your breath is okay. Any closer and you look a little rapey.   [Disco Duck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxf2KCSyvgQ) (Yes seriously.) It was done by a radio dj and his band, Rick Dees and his Cast of Idiots. It was on an album of "funny" songs, lots of stuff that would have been featured on Dr. Demento's show. I was about five or six at the time.   Yep, got a lot to work with there. I should be ok. I'll just have another diet Dr. Pepper...*pop *fizz * slurp....shit, now I'm energetically depressed! Hand me my guitar and that pipe over there! *spark *puff *aaaahhhh...much better.   But the people on tv look so happy when they drink diet Dr. Pepper...has the doctor been lying to me? But, I drink diet sodas for my caffeine addiction, so I'm more likely to develop depression by drinking a beverage that reduces my chance of developing depression? Fuck, I'm confused. Probably all the diet sodas.   I've got a quick wit and an even quicker mouth, and it's gotten me into trouble plenty in the past...with gf/parents/job/school.  Got better and better jobs which required me to not act like a drunk monkey on a daily basis, and struggled with both cursing, and content, of what I was saying.  I developed what I call the "2 beat rule". Whenever I start to say something, I take just two beats (ill-defined segment of time, but long enough to review my intended statement) and think about what the other person will hear if I say what I'm about to say.   More often than not, I choose to say nothing, because what I hear in my head suddenly sounds hurtful or base.   But I let it rip later when I'm at the bar!  Good luck. Being aware of your language and the way you use it is really the first step. Whatever steps you take next will more than likely work because you have already identified a habit that you want to change.   Every Asshole Does Grass But Eggbert is how I learned them back in the stone age!   Nope. I liked the remake for the multiplayer, the level play was quite weak though.   yep, exactly...cool sound to add to your repertoire on acoustic.   Goldeneye. Nintendo 64 or WII.   Ahh...the good old Teapot Dome scandal! Good God I love history!   1. Probably the post WWII to Vietnam era.  2. Civil War.  3. Lots. I had a really awesome teacher in HS, and we talked about a lot of things that were left out of our sanitized textbooks. I wish I had spent more time with him, but he inspired me to look for my own truths, and I have for the last thirty years. Thank you, Mr. Postlethaite, OHS!  4. You could...maybe group SMS for historical events? Today in history, or that sort of thing...  5. I am an employer, but I don't think I care about your knowledge of US history, outside of if you had a college degree, because any degree is a good thing.   Thanks for being a teacher, keep up the good work!   Sounds like reasonable parenting, so that's probably not an issue. And good relationships at home (I'm still a fan of stay at home parents, doesn't matter which one!). ANd I read RefuseBit's comment, and wonder if maybe that might be part of it...eight is a strange age, he might be gifted, but without the ability/vocabulary to express his interests, combined with his sort of timidness might lead to the kind of behavior that he's evincing.   Overall, I think he bears watching, but I wouldn't overworry. You sound like a cool aunt/uncle; stay involved, and help him evolve, and take him back to the lab! My kids would be so jealous!   It was awesome of her, and I'm lucky, because she has been and still is adventurous, and we've had much fun because of that...but I still know that I haven't made up for that night...lol. I hope it works out awesome for all three of you guys!    I would be thrilled beyond belief. I've talked to my SO about this before, and it doesn't seem to be her thing, but a guy can hope! I would say be careful, because you just don't know where his head might be at any given day...you would want to tease him, give him clues about what was about to happen instead of an outright surprise.  Let me share a story with you.   Long ago, before my wife was my wife, I was working at a restaurant near the house. A bit too far to ride the bike, she would give me a ride and pick me up at night when I got off, around midnight most nights.  She comes to pick me up, and I open the door to slide into the car, and there she is, my beautiful eventual wife, in all her naked glory, sitting in the driver's seat.  Unlike every other guy in the world, instead of being thrilled about this turn of events, I half-smirk, say something stupid, and get in the car to go home. (I don't remember what I said, my wife's a redditor, perhaps she'll stop by and tell you what dumb thing I said instead of telling her how beautiful she is, or how impressed I was with her being so brave to surprise me by picking me up completely naked.)  What she didn't know is that I had just gone through one of the worst days of work I had ever had. To her credit, I no longer remember what was so terrible that night, I just have a very clear memory of her amazing naked body shining in the dome light of her VW Rabbit!   Just sayin' be careful of an outright surprise...you might not get the disired result. You probably will, but there's that outside chance that his head might not be in the right place...and it would be terrible if another man on this planet was stupid enough to ruin something awesome by not being able to shift gears fast enough!      (sorry babe!)   Keep the pick hand moving during the ring-out portion of the chord, just lift the pick off the strings.  Practice this by keeping the 16th notes by percussing them with your pick on your pick guard while the chord rings out.  Essentially you will be working on two seperate rhythms at that point, one strum, one percussive...eventually you will be able to just skip the percussive part, and feel that staggered rhythmic pattern.   Father of two, boy 8, girl 5.  A lot of the behavior that you talk about when he was visiting the lab seems pretty normal to me, or at least age appropriate. My boy is not real "hands on" with new stuff, but he loves to learn new things and be around new things. I think that if he went to work with his uncle (not a scientist (how cool!) but road construction) he would love all the machines and cool stuff, but might be leery of actually getting involved. Some boys are different, and would be all kinds of hands on, to the point of seeming like mania.  The defiance could be described as normal for his age group as well. This is the time that they start to understand themselves, and he may be pushing the boundries to see what he can get away with. How's the mom and dad at home? If they're allowing this behavior to go unchecked or are unwilling disciplanarians, they might be fostering these sorts of problems. (When you describe impatience for future goals/rewards and change of situational difficulties, it sounds like he's maybe not getting negative reinforcement of these behaviors at home.)  The scaredness, (or timidness) that I sensed you were talking about might be something that you should watch. It could mean a lot of different things; from the relatively normal i.e. he's just sensitive/timid, to the relatively severe i.e. he's got something either real or imaginary to be scared of, and is acting on these feelings.  Overall, he sounds kinda like a normal eight year old boy to me, assuming all developmental skills are about where they are supposed to be.   How's the relationship in between the boy and his parents? Are they stern enough in their demands about his diet, his habits, his bedtime ritual? Or are they enabling his bad behavior by not being resolute? Did this behavior maybe start as a reaction to the new child in the house? Hopefully there's no overt favortism between the two children. Without knowing much more, I can be of no help, but overall, outside of the timidness/anxiety he doesn't sound that much different from my boy.     Duuuuuuddde...really? Out in the rain? Ouch.  Sad to say, you might be fucked. You might be able to fool the folks at Taylor (read that: Fraud), but if they want to see the demolished piece of art that was your 714, they will see the water damage. If your warranty is through Taylor, might be worth contacting them and telling them that you're an idiot and maybe, just maybe, they might take pity on you. Doubtful, but possible. Outside warranty, probably best to try to go with fraud.   I'm sorry for your loss. Hope you have a backup box so you can still play the blues!    1. 40  2. Full time manager  3. 14M (step-son, part time contact), 8M (at home), 5F (at home).  4. Job doesnt give me traditional weekday/weekend, but I have five work days, two off, so whatev. Typical day starts around 7am. Breakfast. One hour of either TV or video games. (assuming not a schoolday). One to two hours of self-play, generally in their rooms, sometimes outside. Together time until lunch. Lunch. Open afternoons, depends on what has to happen that day, sometimes errands, sometimes recreations, sometimes crafts. Dinner preparation is family time, dinner is family time. After dinner routine that leads to bedtime. Good is being a dad, stressful is getting young kids to do stuff together is like trying to herd cats.   5. Struggling to make every day relevant, and stay involvled with the kids. I'm tired all the time, and work too much, so is tough to stay involved instead of just sleeping all day.  6. I don't really ever feel defeated as a parent. I generally feel that I'm doing a better job than most dads in similar situations.  7. Not really reliant on goods or services when it comes to the kids, but in the spirit of the question, would have to say either Netflix/Internet, or the Wii. They both allow the kids some time doing something that I only have to half supervise, allowing me time to do some grown-up things.   The very reason I can't suggest The Joy of Cooking enough is because it can be read *both* as a textbook **and** a cookbook. As far as skill set, there is an assumption that you've been in the kitchen before, but the "About" sections that preface each subject area covers more advanced cooking methods and such. Just a few days ago, I couldn't remember for the life of me how long to boil carrots (i could have just watched them, but I had other stuff on the stove, and that was the first step in a recipe) and I quick referenced my Joy so I could work on my timetable.   Check your local library and see if they have a copy, and give it a looksee before you pull the trigger, but I wouldn't want to cook in a kitchen that didn't have The Joy of Cooking in it.   I have found that many people that have nearly fabulous handwriting hate their handwriting far more than I do...and I have the handwriting of a drunk monkey. Long ago I switched to an all caps scrawl (that I later learned was called Architectual Block Printing) that more easily conveys my message without error. Since switching, people have commented how neat my handwriting is, and I am nothing if not amused at what amounts to a utilitarian choice for legibility being appreciated for its form.   Hot Snakes? Awesome! I needed that phrase so badly; it's the holidays! Fuckin' hot snakes! Too broke for gold, have a orangered instead.   Hot snakes....yessss.   A good friend told me that whenever I am faced with a difficult choice to flip a coin...not because you should trust in the random to decide your fate, no matter how small the issue, but because in that brief moment, while the coin is in the air, you will know what your heart truly desires.  I use it without fail.   Spend the 50 bucks on beer, get him drunk, take the axes, tell him he told you you could have them.   Had to be. Probably riverside, or near Pappa's.   I've seen some terrible things here in the N.S.B., but I've been lucky enough to avoid this. Must be mainland, shit like that just doesn't happen on the island.   Thank goodness for that giant red arrow. I wouldn't have been sure what to look at in that video.   "Oh, look at all these people standing around watching something...meh, that's pretty cool, I guess"  "Wait, what's this red arrow?"  "Holy shit, a fucking elephant, fuckin' shit up!"  Thanks Red Arrow!   Yep, still checking the fish about whenever I bring new fish in...no questions on best preparations, how to clean/gut/scale, etc.   I am not familiar with the class, so my opinion may be uninformed, but I would think short of a professional culinary instruction in a classroom setting, that you would be wasting that $50.  First, take that $50 bucks, and buy [The Joy of Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-75th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0743246268/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1356534467 sr=8-1 keywords=the+joy+of+cooking)...not your typical "Cookbook"...it has plenty of recipes, but each section/chapter is prefaced with the "why" of cooking...why heat causes meat to brown, why you must scale certain types of fish, why herbs are best fresh, etc. Great book, and constant companion of mine while in culinary school, at home, and at work. And, you can spend that thirty bucks left over on something nice.  I don't know where you live, but any medium sized metro area is going to have classes offered on a single basis (i.e. outside a degree program). Check places that focus on alternative eating...fresh markets, vegetarian/vegan shops, etc...these places often will offer a single class on a single subject for a reasonable amount of dough.  And can't say enough about experience...one of the best ways to get a feel for your kitchen is to spend a lot of time in it! And take notes. seriously....if you are having problems with consistency when it comes to seasoning, start note taking and measuring what you're using, and then make notes about how you felt about the taste, adjust next time, take more notes, fine tune, end up with something that works for you, and is probably pretty tasty!   Right there with you. I brought it up to my wife, and she's given it a go a few times, but she says it's not her thing. Makes her happy to see me have a good time, but can't get her to initiate without having to almost beg. I think it's maybe more taboo for a female to be on the giving end of anal than it is to be on the receiving?...either way, it still makes me happy, and every now and then is better than never now or then, right?

I wish that you would message the mods some proof. Lacking that, let me begin...  I am so sorry for your loss. I know that means nothing, but I sat at work Friday morning, watching the coverage, and barely controlled my tears as I thought of those poor children, and those poor parents. My heart, and the thoughts of my entire family, have been with the parents and families of Sandy Hook for the past few days.  Question: How exposed were you to the media coverage, and what, overall, sort of job do you think the major media did to cover this story? And, do you feel that that sort of coverage is appropriate? Is this a tragedy for the nation, or should it have been a little more low-key?        Dio!!!   I hear ya. I run a small club, and we limit to ten people, but we play way early on Thursday mornings on an uncrowded course, and stay very aware of people coming up behind us, usually giving way for playthrough a hole ahead of them. But that happens rarely.  More often, our group gets stuck behind a group of two or three that have never played before, and chuck plastic into the woods like there's no tomorrow, and most of the time, after explaining etiquette, and exchanging tips, we both go our serarate ways, happy...but not always....not always.   I love Fat Tuesday's! Used to have one here in Daytona, but they took it away from me! Now when I need delicious adult frozen beverages, I must buy them at 7-11, and pour FourLokos in them!

I care. Really. I'm a father, 5 and 8, the same age as some of those kids that were shot and killed today.   I'm a man, a burly manly, Ron Swanson type man.  I was at work, and had trouble controlling my emotions as I watched the events in Newtown unfold.  I don't know the families....but I have a family. I don't know the victims, but I felt like a victim, in a very very small way compared to what those people were dealing with, for the loss of innocence, of safety, of feeling like it was totally okay to drop my kids off at school in the morning, and know that they would be there when I showed up to pick them up.  I'm aware of the situation in the Congo, I know about the humanitarian crisis in most of sub-saharan Africa. I don't know much about Burma, but I've been following the stories out of Syria. Terrible things happen all the time.  But sometimes I forget that. I'm American. Most of the time, things are pretty okay here.   Not today.  Sensationalism? I agree with you; if more attention was paid to the crises in other parts of the world, it might be easier to empathize with them.  But this was our home. Done by one of us. To some of us.  I made a FB post about it...I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted to cry, or to find my kids and hug them, and hold them close, knowing that they were okay, and that I could still protect them from the harsh ugliness of the world. I wanted to do more...more to help those people, more to feel like I was protecting my kids.  I don't grieve for them...I didn't know any of them, but I grieve for the innocence of my kids. I will spend a large portion of my day tomorrow talking about this with them; having a difficult conversation with two very young people that I care very much about, that I love more than anything else in this world; a conversation where I must admit, as their father, their protector, their rock, that yes, there are bad people in this world, the boogie monster is real sometimes, there might be someone that wants to do you and/or your family harm.  I'll tell them that the most important thing is to be careful, aware, and safe.  I'll tell them that we are a family, and that we will do anything we can to protect each other.  I'll tell them what I have to, to make them feel okay again.  And I wish that I could do that for the families that lost children today.  And I wish that someone could tell me that everything that I've worried about today was nothing. That I didn't have to worry about ever losing my children to violence or accident.  But today proved that no one can do that for me. And there are parents out there, right now, that learned an even more difficult lesson.  I may have no business grieving or not grieving for the pain and challenges of strangers, but I won't apologize for the emotions that I have as I witness the loss of these kids...the loss of these families...the loss that we *all* felt today, because of a silly notion of whether I have a right to or not.   No problem. It's hard sometimes when you realize how exposed our children are to the hurt and bad and ugly in this world. I'll be sharing something I learned from Mr. Rogers long long ago. Words from his mother...   "When you see something bad happen, remember that there are helpers. If you look, you will find them, people that are helping other people. Know they are there, and find hope when you see them."

I'm glad somebody said it. But while I have you here, what's the best thing for me to watch videos on my TV? Should I go with an off the shelf Roku, or maybe jailbreak an Apple TV with XBMC?

When I play alone, I can't get high...no focus. Fun to just fuck around with the guitar when I've been smoking, but not for practice.

Skinny girls.   Thats a really good idea, I'll float it to the club and see what we think.    Planned on that...most of what I've seen so far has been about league play assuming handicaps were already figured, but I did do a pretty broad google.   And to keep score.    I gave the forums a cursory glance, and didn't see anything right away, but will check more when I get off work. I thought about two pools, but the group's not quite big enough for two or more pools yet.   Everybody has suggested that, and we thought about a "challenge day" of doing that very thing, but we play with someone who is ambidextrous...but we could make him play with his feet...   Will do, didn't think about looking there. Checked DiscGolfersR.us and didn't see much.   No, for real, I just don't get it. Anybody want to give me some tips? I want to take our little amatuer league to the next level, but I can't bring in better players and worse players than are already involved and keep it fun (and fair) for everyone.  So, how would you handicap a small club?  * We play on one course only (relatively easy, relatively short, highly technical)  * There are currently 10 players, but we want to expand.  * Co-ed.  * Skill levels from experienced to brand noob.  * Cash is involved, so must be fair, and managable.  * Once a week play, one round (18 holes) only.   I've been looking at those on amazon! I just don't know what the hell they are and what they do. Gonna have to do more research.   We checked that out at our local library, but I didn't see her get too excited about anything in it. I was thinking about something like books of patterns, or parts...like how to do pockets, corners, double seams, etc.   Well, I am the epitome of dudeness...she sews skirts, kids clothes, baby blankets, embellishments to store bought clothes...quilts a little (I'm assuming the definition of "quilts" as "stuffed squares sewn together"). She has a pinterest, but just started, and I know what's on it, but mostly stuff that falls into the "other crafts" category. She also does great work with over the shoulder bags.   Tough call. The Cameo looks like it would be better for what we do...(not just for sewing, we screenprint too). Have to think about that...   She's set as far as a sewing machine...for now. We've looked at some higher end options, but that's a later-on gift. A serger is something that she has mentioned.   I wouldn't even begin to guess about patterns and fabric for her!   She's a machine sewer mostly, but she does quilting as well.    I was thinking about GCs as well, but for the wife (that's why I'm asking) it seems a little impersonal, at least as the main gift.    A serger might be a little out of my price range...but interesting. I don't know what they do, or if it would be appropriate as a gift for my wife, but the Cameo...a little pricey, but could work for a couple of different crafts. What do you think about lower priced comparibles to the Cameo Sillhouette?   Love those, but that would be a better gift for me than for her!   A light is something that I've been considering. Also scissors, because I'm husband, and kids. Would little stuff like pins, thimbles, needles, pincushions be safe? Or would you be super particular about what you get?    I'm asking for ideas for my wife...isn't a husband buying his wife an iron grounds for divorce? But seriously, a nice iron would be a good gift? She has one, but it's older than our relationship...lol.   Lol...I'm a he, asking to get some ideas for my wife...I'm so lost when it comes to this stuff! (I'd love to get her a high end machine, but a grand is a little out of our budget!)      That comment just is begging for me to yell out "Your Mom!", but I think you're asking where I live? Volusia County, New Smyrna Beach, take 44 out of Eustis, head east until you hit the beach, and I'm on the right.   The easy answer is Space Monkey. Why? It's epicness is only overshadowed by the obvious need of my blank wall to support Space Monkey Art. I would hang this in my music studio (corner of my living room) and create a song about Space Monkey for Collage-o-rama. What you do with it at that point is up to you!   Space Monkey Mafia, Unite!   I started surfing long long ago, but gave it up after I moved away from the coast. After many many years, I found myself back on the east coast of Florida, surrounded by new friends and decent waves. So I'll share the story of the first time I returned to surfing.  Some old friends of mine planned a trip to the coast to come see me and casually mentioned getting some wavetime in. I hadn't been surfing for about 20 years at that point, but figured what the hell, can't be too hard.  I went down to my local surf shop and picked up a used long board, 9.6 softtop, and told my friend that our weekend would be a go.  Over the next couple weeks as I waited in anticipation for good friends and good times, I tried to make time to get out and practice a couple of times, but just couldn't find time. (I work way too much).  The week before our surf weekend, checking the weather showed me that there was a storm developing. A big one. Might be Cat 1 hurricane, well offshore, by the weekend we had plans. Didn't worry too much, just thought we'd get some solid waves.  Nope.  The day before my friends came down, I went over to the shore to check the waves. It was washing machine time, but on steriods. The waves were big, but no rhythm, no sets, just muddy, and **angry** looking large chop.  I went home hoping for a better look the next day.  Friends showed up early, about dawn, and we checked the beach out immeadiately. If anything, it had gotten worse. My friends were determined to try it anyway, and I wasn't going to be the one to say no.  Two of my friends had some surf experience; long boards on the north florida gulf shore, and one was from some center of the country state that had never seen water larger than a lake, and didn't know jack about surfing.  So we get ready, and decide to have a couple of cans of liquid courage before we head across the street to defeat the monster. Heads held high, and feeling no pain, we carry our boards over to the shore.  We get out into the muck. My two friends with longboard experience have slightly less trouble than I do getting through the muck to search for the break, such as it was.  I had a moment where I knew things were going to go bad. My neighbors are all surf shop monkeys, and two of them were out in the muck, body boarding. As I struggled to get past the chop, one of them drifted close to me and said "you're either really brave or really stupid, bro!". I almost turned around at that point.  Almost.  By then, my friends are out trying to catch a few. Doing okay. The third friend, no surfing experience, is sort of just drifting down the beach, getting his ears washed out for him.  I finally get out of the mess, sort of on the back side of the break, and I straddle my board to catch my breath, and take in my surroundings.  Friends one and two are surfing. Not great, but there were waves, they were just short lived and messy. Friend three, no where to be seen.  Relaxing for maybe too long, I notice that I'm drifting not just down the beach, but out. I'm heading to Africa, so I paddle in a bit to try and catch my first wave.  I'm just paddling casually, not pushing hard, just coming in, and I feel a bit of upwelling lift me up. Out of nowhere, I've paddled on top of a monster. (It was a monster to me!) The wave develops underneath me, and I've surfed a bunch back in the day, but never saw a wave develop from that point of view, not on the face, not on the front, but teetering on top.   I'm not so much paddling into the wave now as much as I'm falling into it, so I get up to me knees as I'm dropping in to this wave curling underneath me.  I surfed for about 1.6 milliseconds.  The wave buried me, tossed and turned, took a nasty hit from the board, had to push off the bottom to get a few whitewater breaths, tossed and turned, yanked by my leash, finally get my head above water, and start heading in.  I get to shore right about the time the lifeguard gets to me. I sort of plop down in front of him, he's asking if I'm alright, I'm embarrassed as shit, and tourists are gathering. One of them points out that I'm sitting a growing pool of blood.   Kind of roll over to my side, and my upper thigh, right where it meets buttcheek, is total hamburgered. Took a fin in the crease. Friends gone, embarrassed enough, I wave off anymore help and hobble home to face the wrath of my wife.  Short wrap-up: I make it home, eventually first two friends make it back, we have beers and laughs. Friend three still missing. Finally shows up after hours, just drifted down the beach, and crossed the inlet, ending up in neighboring town, hitched a ride home with beach cops. Drank more, laughed more, did not surf more.  tl;dr. I'm old, don't drink and surf.

I tried and tried and tried. I used hot sauce, no bite laquers, gloves, just about everything. It's a tough habit to break.   Good news? It took six seperate attempts, a little bit of self-loathing, and almost two years, but I haven't bit my nails in a few months now (after biting for over 30 years) with some nice new growth, and going strong!  What finally worked for me was just positive thinking, and telling myself I could do it, and everytime I failed I learned something new about what triggers my addiction.    When my wife and I, before we got married, were visiting our doctor about her first pregnancy, his distaste in our unmarried state was evident. My at-the-time-GF and I got into a semi-serious accident on Thanksgiving, about halfway through her pregnancy. She began to suffer from some joint and bone pain in her right hip. We asked our doctor about it on our next visit, and I shit you not, he suggested that we get tested for "bone herpes".   tl:dr A new study has shown that other people waiting until marriage to have sex makes people that already made that decision feel better about the years of self-repression and frustration that they suffered.   It's called [chocolate bloom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_bloom).

Didn't even go to school here in NSB, didn't care much for high school, and you're describing the folks that I didn't care for when I was in high school 25 years ago.   What I am is a football fan. HS, college or NFL, I like a good game, and this has been a good year for the 'Cudas. (I am also a fan of HS marching bands, my step-son plays baritone sax for the aforementioned Deland Bulldogs.) I just feel that this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. I've seen lots of HS ballgames this year, and years past, and there always is a little tension between the band and the players. They share the same field for warm-ups and pregames, and there just isn't much room at the high school level.    I live in New Smyrna Beach, the team that's doing the disrespecting...and we take our football seriously down here. Real serious.   First, what they did was inappropriate. I hope they are running laps for it still...but the big deal that people are making about this here in the area, and to some degree state- and nationwide, is getting a little ridiculous. They ran too far out on the field? Relax. They'll run. But let's talk about the excitement of hs football here in this part of FL. NSB has swept the table, including big wins against cross county favorite, the Deland Bulldogs, (HS of Mike Gillislee, RB for UF Gators). They're the pick for the District champs this year. Been a few years since we've won Districts, so it's a big deal for the 'Cudas. Spruce Creek, while a great high school, is every other teams' punching bag. Never had a good football program out there, and this last game is sort of the last hurdle NSB Barracudas has to jump on their way to District play.  Creek's band should have been allowed the field to do their pre-game band thing, but let's not beat up a bunch of high school football players that are way excited about a great year of football.  I expect an apology from NSB will arrive at Spruce Creek anytime now, and I'll be wearing my Red and cheering on my 'Cudas next week.   It's called "crushing" or "crush fetish".  It's a type of paraphilia that some people get off on, sexually. (How? I don't fuckin' know.)

The bigger game here is Iran  "The people who dragged us into a war against Iraq and Libya want to drag us into a war against Syria as a run up to war against Iran.  This is part of a long term strategy by Neo-Conservatives who I heard openly planning and promoting this madness to Congress throughout the past two decades.  America's decision makers must be very careful not to be suckered again (and again) into more wars.  Our intervention in Iraq destroyed that country's defenses and helped to create ISIS. An attack on Syria would strengthen ISIS.  It's time to end US interventions. It's time to take care of things here at home." -- Dennis Kucinich  See interview on these issues:  http://video.foxnews.com/v/3759968879001/a-look-back-at-obamas-decision-not-to-attack-syria/#sp=show-clips  See more recent piece on this issue:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-j-kucinich/isis-libya-nato_b_5764988.html?utm_hp_ref=politics ir=Politics                                                http://time.com/3206804/iraq-syria-isis-obama-airstrikes/            http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/2cpudc/req_300_with_25_interest_to_be_paid_back_on_aug/                                                My understanding is that international law prohibits the execution of POWs. My understanding is that the US acts in Afghanistan as an international force. That when the US captures a Taliban soldier, they are US POW. That if the US then kills the soldier, or hands him over to a jurisdiction knowing he will then be summarily executed, that this is a violation of international law.  http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2dapn2/some_pictures_from_my_tour_in_afghanistan/cjntkra?context=3  Somebody has eloquently argued (to a lay person like myself) that such regular actions of US capturing soldiers and turning them over to local parties for execution is not illegal. That it falls under civic, not international law. Can somebody with a proper background explain?  (Added note: I'm not interested in hearing whether this is moral per somebody's perspective. I think its deplorable semantics regardless of whether it is illegal or not. I want to know if its arguably legal - and if there's any precedence, etc.).                                                                                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be v=h7qFACSfd_k app=desktop                                                                                                   - [Today](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iraq-turmoil/what-life-iraqs-city-mosul-under-isis-rule-n151461)  - [The Friday when Sunnis of Mosul Gave Bayah](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b50_1405110293)  - [As ISIS entered](http://eaworldview.com/2014/06/iraq-civilians-welcomed-insurgents-mosul/)  We all know how it was before. God only knows what it will be like in the future. God have mercy on the future.   [Bombing in Hawija City, Kirkuk Provence](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=4ec_1405174893)  [Pictures of Sunnis Discussing with IS](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=469_1404851862)         See this link for an article on ISIS insurgents:  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/isis-insurgents-attack-town-north-of-iraqi-capital-baghdad-1.1864892  So the story is about ISIS capturing a town **north of Baghdad** as they prepare to eventually move in for the big clash we've all been expecting. Notice the picture at the top of the story? That's a picture of a police officer **inside Iraq** where 29 people were just killed. The implication? That ISIS is associated with this killing. That ISIS is killing prostitutes - in Baghdad, a city they don't control, when killing alleged prostitutes has never been their modus operendi. But hold on a second:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28281102  This is a story that's actually associated to that image. Somebody went into an alleged brothel in Zayouna and massacred several women - alleged prostitutes. According to the locals, it was Shi'ite death squads. What's more troubling? Maliki's Shi'ite forces suggested that they were going to clean Baghdad up of sleeper cells:  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/03/us-iraq-security-sleeper-insight-idUSKBN0F81FK20140703  People have been "disappearing" like they used to when the US first gave Shi'ites power in Iraq. ["Disappearing"](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6f2_1404371007) in Baghdad means you're getting a fate much worse then a quick death.  What's disturbing is the willful displacement of the imagery. Sure, they mention the killings in Zayouna within the article. But do they, like many other sources, indicate who's obviously associated with the killings given that Maliki is still in full control of the gunmen prowling the streets of Baghdad? Do they mention that Zayouna is one of the handful of remaining mixed areas in Baghdad? That the victims, allegedly prostitutes, may well have been average Sunni or Christian citizens (not that killing of prostitutes is in any way okay!). Nope - the Western mind is pushed to make a tenacious connection between this killing, which was not done by ISIS, and point their fingers at the wrong criminals so we can continue to think we're backing the "right side" in this struggle.   http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28281102               [NSFW Link](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=602_1404665038)  100s of Ayatollah Sarkhi's followers and Sunnis are being rounded up around Baghdad and executed/imprisoned in preparation for the coming war.

 I was in Year 11 at the time but apparently some kid in grade 8 or 9 at the time took a piss in some girls make up bag or pencil case (I can't remember) because she apparently took his phone one time and sent some rude texts to some other girl in the same grade.    Channel 10 here in Australia does the same thing, its annoying AND they show ads in the middle of the race! The saddest part is that the UK broadcast of the Australian GP is better than Channel 10.   They would make a considerable amount of money buy releasing an official season pass to watch the race live on their site or through various media devices e.g game consoles (ps4/3, xbox one/360), apple tv etc. Have various camera angles that you can choose from and show stats etc on the side. That would be my dream.    As someone who lives in Sydney, Australia I would love to see Sydney purely for the novelty of exploring a virtual version of your own city.    I think IGN would have come out strong if they didn't say "officially cancelled", had they just stated that it was a strong rumour then they would have been fine but I guess they put a lot of trust into this insider, enough to say it's been officially cancelled.    Does anyone have a strong feeling that is some kind of marketing buzz for TLG? By saying that the game is cancelled it will remind gamers that the game was being worked on and now with Sony saying it's not cancelled the game will be firmly in gamers minds leading up to E3   If that's the case they should just eat right imo. You can still lose weight by cutting out the junk in a diet.    holy shit i'm from Sydney but even then I have never seen a monstrosity such as that!   Yeah I can't really remember all my choices however I do know that I made some pretty crazy decisions at the end. I would love to see how they handle the characters.    What's the general cost to own a basic car in Hong Kong?   To be fair though we actually see progress in an MGS game, they don't get announced and then show nothing about it for a long time. FFXV was announced when I was in Year 9 in high school. I am now about to finish my university degree and we still know nothing about the game lol.    Have they stated officially whether the save files from Witcher 2 will carry over? It will be a big decision as to what platform I buy the game on.    I had one where the guards were in a search formation together and I hacked one explosive at which point he threw it against the wall next to him which killed himself and 2 other guys.    Is it possible to see what your npc model is?   They could just get Harry Gregson Williams. He does the score for the games and has done a ton of films as well.    Everytime someone mentions Arrow F1 I think of [this silly front wing](http://cdn.carthrottle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2001-Arrows-A22-2_2714056.jpg) they had on their car at one point.    The sad thing is that even if you recast him the performance would have been the same since it was the writing not the actor that delivered a fairly wooden performance.    Where is it stated that his memory isn't wiped? I always thought that both C3PO and R2 had their memories erased in the conclusion of episode 3.   I really hope it's a God of War game with a new protagonist and setting. I know a lot of people would love Norse mythology to be a primary setting for a new one.    I have a feeling they will focus it more on Battlefront and then give another small teaser for Mirrors Edge 2 since that game is on the backburner until Battlefront is done. I'm alright with that that though since BF4 didn't exactly have the best launch so I really hope they take their time with Mirrors Edge.    If that's true then what would the USA do? They have a much larger sporting crowd that watch their own homesports with a lot more money involved (NFL,NHL,MLB and NBA).   Can Japan and Korea host it again? Since they hosted it in 2002. Is there a specific time lapse before they are allowed to host it again?   One thing that throws me off his not having the controller vibrate when you get an incoming phone call.   Wait I totally forgot about this guy? They never revealed who it was did they?   I believe it was to keep it in tone with the sequels. They had a more heavier green tone compared to the first original release.    I didn't mean to undersell her. To be honest I've only seen her in maybe 2 films, Chicago and Down with Love haha.   DVD's will be region locked however most Blu Ray's will be region free. I'm Australian and have imported numerous Blu Ray's from America and they have all worked fine. But yeah with DVD's you will be SOL :( I use this site to make sure a specific Blu Ray will work   http://regionfreemovies.com/  I get that the PS4 is way more expensive in NZ than it probably is in HK however I think for warranty reasons its best to buy locally.    She seemed to be the woman who was in every film at one point and she wasn't a terrible actress, at least I don't think so. What happened to her career?   The Insider   You could try the Hills District. I went to The Hills Grammar School in Kenthurst and the school was located within a fairly large forest. Perhaps you could ask them for permission to shoot there?   I really hope the story is better this time around. The whole undercover cop thing had a lot of potential but they didn't do much with it story wise and it got fairly predictable towards the end.    I don't think it would happen again since the last crossover forced MK to be T rated because DC didn't really enjoy their characters getting torn apart.    Can anyone tell me what the legality of exploring a place like this would be? Does the council own it or is it privately owned etc?   If you liked Oblivion you will love Tron Legacy, it's made by the same director, Joseph Kosinski. That soundtrack and visuals are perfect.    Yep I was 14 when this game was announced and in Year 9 now I am in my final semester of university. Jeez this game has taken its time haha. I don't think it could live up to any sort of hype right now.    Holy shit that is truly amazing.   It's not required on consoles, it just acts as a little store where you can purchase in game items with the points you get from playing the game.    I've always adored the Phantom such a shame to see one in this condition.    I believe this is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioLQLRwTKS8) in question.   I was rather annoyed that we didn't really get to explore the meat of the city with citizens walking around etc. I remember they demoed a section of the game a few months before release and it had Nillin (I think that's her name) walking around the city with it being fairly occupied with citizens going about their daily business.   To quote the first Blade film I have always enjoyed the line: "Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill"   holy shit that's insane. I saw the film but had no idea they used animatronics. Guess it was just that good!   My first time I got lucky and I just hid in a car on the side of the street parked next to other cars. He ran past me several times trying to find me.   Yeah down for me here in Australia as well   Hey do we have to preorder to get the DLC?   I feel that Star Wars: Underworld would be a good title as that's what the title for the planned live action tv series was based off. This is just me hoping that the Boba Fett film actually follows a darker, seedier tone seen in that original 1313 teaser.    I think you should check it out in my opinion it's definitely above average due to the fact that the characters are just so likeable and well written.    Yeah I have the game running on a 5.1 Surround mix and it's pretty abysmal, however if you run it through headphones it's a lot better.    Usually in engine cutscenes are of a higher resolution and polygon count when making the game and with the last generation of consoles (360,PS3) you would notice that the characters and environment etc would look a lot better than when you are actually playing the game. With the new consoles (PS4,XONE) this is not really an issue and they can get the game to look as good as its in game cutscenes. Hence why even though the trailer didn't show any true gameplay we can safely assume the game would look like that come release.    These all look like parody posters you would find in GTA or Seinfeld.   300, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven (Directors Cut), Braveheart and I would also recommend Centurion which I enjoyed.    It was cancelled however if I were to speculate I would say that Viceral (makers of an unannounced Star Wars title) are retooling the game and maybe will announce it under a different name.   I thought they announced a while ago that it was pushed to 2015?   How much would it cost for Valve to resubmit the game for evaluation? Or is it free?   Man am I glad that this film wasn't about F1.    The PS4 cannot play locally stored audio files in game yet. You can use Music Unlimited which is Sony's version of Spotify to stream music in game while you play. I had created a playlist of my music and was playing it while in NFS Rivals at launch. But as of now you cannot listen to your own locally stored music while in game.   I imagine that they refocused their time onto GTA V and perhaps are making the game for PS4/XB1/PC? I doubt the game would be exclusive unless Sony ends up publishing but that seems rather unrealistic and doubtful in this current market.   As far as the state of New York is concerned you ARE the Assman.   It's just Maybach* haha and yes it had an electrochromic glass on the sunroof if I recall.    While RUSH (2013) sits on an 89% rating and 8.3 IMDB rating, I felt it was one of the films that sorely got overlooked especially during the Oscars. You don't even have to be an F1 fan to appreciate the film. Truly amazing in my opinion and Daniel Bruhl (Inglorious Basterds) kills it as Niki Lauda.    As someone who lives in Bella Vista, The Hills area in general is pretty chill, probably a lot more Christians in the population due to the advent of Hillsong Church which is kind of one of those youth mega churches you hear about in America. My uncle has a house in Castle Hill which is located on a street with other massive houses. His house was built in the 80s though so that street has old but massive houses which all border a fairly dense forest. The people are quite nice for the most part, definitely a welcome change compared to people around or near the city in my opinion.    I highly doubt there will be a teaser for TLOU shown. If the bolded parts of the leaks are true then I believe that they would show The Last Guardian at the very end of the conference kind of like a "but wait here's one more surprise" and boom they show The Last Guardian.    Amazing!   That's fucking retarded if that's true. Seriously he's a lawyer not a fucking bad ass super cop. Should have cast someone with less of a pull on the film.    Man of Steel felt like the closest thing to a real DBZ film.   This is such a fantastic show it really is in my top list. Great story which is now even more relevant in the whole recent NSA scandal which they tied in perfectly and fantastic characters.    Love the MP3 controls, seems like the kind of character that would want to listen to music while swinging around.   Auto updates and doesn't need the disc to update. All of my PS4 games are retail and I haven't had to put the disc in to update/complete the update of  game.    Australian citizen here, Jeep Cherokee's have always been quite popular here and I have also seen quite a few Chrysler 200's around. While the most common car you see here is a Holden Commodore (Chevy SS). Importing a Mustang, Corvette, Viper or Camaro is uber expensive as you have to get a RHD conversion and I imagine servicing the car would be stupidly expensive. Personally I love the designs of all 3 of those cars, it's just a shame they are so expensive.    So I have been rocking my Galaxy Nexus since 2011 and I want to upgrade to a Nex 5, is the battery life a substantial improvement over the GNex? Reason I am asking is that I know the battery life of the Nex 5 compared to some new phones such as the HTC One M8 and Galaxy S5 isn't the best but if it's a massive improvement over my G Nex it'll push me more towards it.    No, I have a 2013 328i with an M-Sport package and the only things that denote anything M-Related are the door sills, wheels and steering wheel. There is no external M badging on the body of the car.    I actually like this scene would have been nice if they remastered it and included it in the blu ray cut. Your score is excellent btw.   Glad that didn't happen it would have been too much in an already long film.    I use Xbox Music on my Surface Pro 2 and while I also have my entire iTunes library on the computer I mainly use it because the UI is a lot better + you can import your entire iTunes library into Xbox Music (at least on the sufrace). It pretty much functions like Spotify so I am just on the free account which lets me listen to pretty much anything except their are ads of course.    I like that this is a more contemporary looking UI compared to The Machine's UI, in a way it feels more threatening compared to The Machine.   Ohhh right wow haha didn't know that.    Wait what it's not my birthday though :(   I assume Cameras/Film/Music and PlayStation   Ben Afleck?   Anyway to view said videos on the PS4? E.g Can I copy a movie over and watch it on my PS4 yet?   Press X to chainsmoke.   Can't blame them, a dark period of fashion was fast approaching.   I wouldn't mind seeing some of the themes the Clone Wars explored, mainly being that grey area of dark and light. It raised very valid points about the Jedi order being power hungry and controlling in their own way. I think Knights of the Old Republic explored these themes extremely well through the character of Kreia. It made you look at the force in shades of gray rather than just pure black and white.   I'm afraid I haven't read that just yet but I plan to get on it very soon!   Supposedly the on hiatus/cancelled? tv show Star Wars Underworld was going to be based around a criminal underworld.  "Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its  about a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..." Rick McCallum     Always liked [Dooku's](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/File:DookuSaber-MR.jpg) lightsaber purely just because it was very unconventional looking, compared to the ones seen in the films at least   Is the weather display on the main screen a US/Europe only thing? I don't think the Australian models do that here or have Connected Drive for that matter.    Probably the Matrix for me. Just really made me think bigger.    The marketing blitz for Episode 7 is gonna be some next level shit.   I like the BMW shifters. [Here](http://lifestylesdefined.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMW-I8-Key-Not-Just-A-Key-2.jpg) is the i8 shifter which is similar to current BMW shifters.    Hah here in Sydney if you look under 25 they will ask you for ID. I never get asked though and I am 22, the beard helps haha   I find that if you just grow a beard, wear a flannel shirt and jeans then you will be instantly cosplaying as joel forever.    I guess I would rather wait then have endless filler like DBZ.   Forgive me for doubting you but haven't they explicitly said the game will be released when it's ready, as in they haven't committed to a release date.     I really hope it's a new main character and cast, I would like to truly believe that Shepard's story is over. This is the kind of game that would really lend itself to next gen hardware.    After the Phantom Pain I hope he is able to step away from MGS and perhaps make a fully reimagined version of Snatcher or even a new IP.    Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/cNgMg) which contains screenshots  from GPU-Z and the catalyst control center which show the temperatures. Some followup I had restarted the PC which showed regular temperatures however the fan was still going into overdrive as you can see the RPM they are running at is stupidly high.   So my specs are:  CPU: i7 2600k 3.4ghz (not overclocked) GPU: AMD Sapphire 6970 2gb (not overclocked) HDD: Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB HD103SJ  PSU: Silverstone Strider Plus 600W ST60F-P  MOBO: ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3 Motherboard  OS: Windows 7 Home Premium RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws F3-12800CL9D-8GBRL 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3   So basically everything was running fine until yesterday I decided to play some Titanfall then maybe a minute into the game the fan on my GPU went into overdrive it sounded like a jet engine. It has been doing it ever since now when I turn it on it goes into full overdrive and stays like that, GPU-Z said the fan was at 100% and the temperature was at -165 celsius, so something is defintely not right. Any help on what's going on would be much appreciated.   It looks like India, so yeah no helmets is standard.    For me it was Grim Fandango when I was younger, you had to get use the forklift in a moving elevator to stop it on a certain floor and I could never get it right.    Song: Enter One Artist: Sol Seppy  for anyone curious.    Yeah he wasn't a bad bond by any means he was just dealt shitty scripts after Goldeneye.   This is a serious question and may sound really dumb but if one submits themselves into a psychiatric hospital do they have to pay for services etc after they leave?    Is FC4 reportedly set in the Himalayas? If true I really hope they bring in the wing suit for that shit.   Can they not put a different looking button though that performs the same function?   I imagine that generally a trophy where you have to get all multi-player unlocks or get the highest rank would be the rarest. In this case I feel a game like Tomb Raider or AC4 may have some of the rarest trophies since I can't imagine that too many people are playing those games online.    While it's more of a re-adaptation of the book I think Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was much better than the Sweedish version.    That could be likely but SS was younger at the time and in peak condition compared to a Big Boss who was older and battle worn by the time of MG 2   Is it one of the Samsung Galaxy models?   Maybe this had already been pointed out but I noticed it for the first time at lest. In the Phantom Pain trailers where Snake is in the hospital it appears he is a lot skinnier and has lost a lot of muscle as a result of being in a coma and not being able to work out obviously. Just a small but nice detail that adds a lot to the character I think!   I'm assuming he is referring to Mark Webber who raced for Red Bull up until this year, he was known for having some pretty rotten luck on the track especially compared to his team-mate, Sebastian Vettell who is a 4 time world champion.    I was wondering why I saw Steve Irwin in my showing haha  	112

 The justifications are different, but the goal is always the same, concentrating wealth and power at the top.    Excellent, Now if we just figure out how to bring in 'Fast and Furious' and Solyandra into the picture, and convince ourselves everything is  part of a United Nations plot to take away our guns, we'll have a Unified Obama conspiracy theory going.   Twist: They're even more scandalous!      Adults admit when they've made a mistake, children try to blame someone else.    I don't have any particular insights into what went on at the IRS, but it certainly doesn't pass the smell test.  What I object to is someone as dishonest as Ryan grandstanding over anyone else's veracity.     The congressman with 21 statements rated False, Mostly False and Pants on Fire by [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/) and earned 13 Pinocchios from the [WP FactChecker](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/paul-ryan-added-to-the-pinocchio-tracker/2012/08/26/eb76222c-ef95-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html ) when he was running for Vice President is accusing someone else of lying.  Maybe the IRS officials are lying, maybe they aren't but Ryan has no standing to accuse anyone else of dishonesty.    Do you think Fox published a similar list about the Bush-Cheney administration 8 years ago.  A list that includes  9/11, resistance in Iraq, lack of readiness for Katrina, economic meltdown in 2008? I'm guessing not.   His reputation seems to have [held up](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/209438-poll-bill-clinton-most-admired-recent-president ).   I don't know if I agree. Michelle Bachmann was threatening to corral it for a while.  Not to mention Rick Perry and Herman Cain. There's lots of competition in the GOP for the gullible, small brained voter.   Appears that Huckabee is making a play for the imbecile vote.    Somehow, I have a feeling that George Will is already writing a column praising Dick Cheney's latest venture.    Unfortunately,  he didn't do so well with domestic issues which cost him his re-election. Great foreign affairs President though.    Absolutely on the money. Germany has [higher labor costs](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/german-labor-costs/) than the US, but manages to compete successfully in the world economy.      The internet could be managed as a public good, or it could be managed for profits of corporations.  Patents, labor rights, access to education, rules to regulate corporation, etc, all these things are legal and societal choices and greatly influence who will benefit from advances in technology.     Jackson did stuff South Carolina during the nullification crisis.  Other than that I don't find much to like in his record.  The treatment of Indians in the South is inexcusable.    GHWB was a mixed bag, but he deserves full props for managing the international situation during the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  That could have been a nightmare (the news from Iraq provides one possibility), but he managed to keep US - Russian relations on an even keel.   Here's one [example](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/science/05legal.html?pagewanted=all).   Hardly,  If we chose to,  technology could provide well for everyone with shorter work weeks.  But instead, we've opted to give the gains from technology to a small elite.   I suppose Marco Rubio will start telling us, "I'm not an insurance agent,Man".      Kind of like a has been athlete, still hanging on, hoping to recreate his glory days.  Or a washed out classic rocker (who would be Will's contemporary) ,turning out stale rehashes of his successes.      Easy to make up. Just cut education and social services again.    Yeah it's already been four minutes, the pro-gun boys must be off their game.    Sounds pretty close to the qualifications George W. Bush brought to the office. The record of businessmen in the Presidency is [unimpressive](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/02/17/sorry-mitt-romney-good-businessmen-rarely-make-good-presidents).    War and politics are inextricably linked, especially in a democracy.  A democracy can only fight a long war with the consent of the citizens.  And if you want to see an example of the civilian President knowing how to fight the war better than the military expert, read about Lincoln and McClellan.    You know who was a really successful businessman?  Herbert Hoover.  Success in one field doesn't always translate into political skill.  A politician needs to be a different kind of leader than a business executive.    Poor Eric.  Maybe the House can have another vote to repeal Obamacare.  That always seems to make him feel better.   Franklin Roosevelt bent a few rules getting the US ready for WWII, especially in aiding Britain and the USSR while the US was still neutral.  I don't think history has accused him of trampling democracy.  Probably saved it.         [Something to that, it appears.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/03/bowe-bergdahl-release_n_5439644.html )   Getting what you paid for seems to be SOP in Scott Walker's Wisconsin.    Check the credentials of the authors and co-authors at the [end of the report](http://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-IIb/Full-Report.pdf).  Only 1 of the 4 might qualify as a climatologist.  Oh, and the Heartland Institute also thought [this billboard](http://www.livescience.com/20107-heartland-climate-change-billboards.html) was a useful thought in the debate about global warming.     Sure they're serious, but as the article concludes:  But reform conservatism must still prove itself to be more than a slogan, more than a marketing campaign, more than that new pizza box. The Reformicons can be part of the historic correction the conservative movement badly needsor they can settle for being sophisticated enablers of more of the same.  Right now reformers have no meaningful influence in the Republican Party.

"American education" isn't failing. Education in parts of America is a disaster.    Hard to say. Might be he snatched it out of the air, might be he pulled in out of his ass.    [Every income group pays taxes.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/)   Around 1 out of 13 voters showed up in Texas, and our first lesson is that strange things happen when you hold an election and nobody comes. You can, for instance, wind up with a hard-right nominee for attorney general who violated state securities regulations and then excused himself by pointing out that the law was very complicated.       I feel that a concentration of power in anyone's hands is a danger to us all. At the moment the biggest issue is the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of few outside government is a far bigger threat. At another time it might be the government.  Do you think Wall Street loves you better than the government?    I halfway agree with you.  The Republican Party is the only thing that manages to make the Democrats look good.   Opinions are so much more convincing when they're capitalized and in bold, aren't they?  Not to mention that it saves a lot of valuable time that you'd need to waste looking up sources or constructing an argument.   Well, it's hard to dispute logic and sourcing like that.  Also spelling.   The public is clearly with Republicans in opposing the law in its current form, and that's why the GOP's broad opposition is likely to continue. Republicans don't need to weaken their opposition to Obamacare**they need to find something they would like to do instead**.  I love these articles. The authors never seem to pick up that the Republicans **never find something they would like to do instead**. Or rather they always want to do the same thing instead, which is lower taxes on the wealthy.  Grammar edit   Considering Bush left him two wars, an economy in shambles and a civilization threatening climate problem (Sorry,but I think scientists usually know what they're talking about) , and he had to deal with a Senate that set the record for filibusters and a House that came close to causing a default on the national debt because it wanted to pitch a tantrum about the ACA, I'd say he's done all right.  Of course Dick Cheney is still eligible to run for President, if you'd like a repeat of the Bush administration.   He should start campaigning as 'A Politician with Flexible Principles'.     And he's having an affair with [Beyonce](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 es_th=1 ie=UTF-8#q=obama%20rumors%20affair).  And he's [gay](http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/claim-obama-hid-gay-life-to-become-president/).  At the same time!   It appears Republicans have gone past denial and reached the [bargaining stage](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/000617) about the ACA.  Here's hoping they make it to acceptance.   Allen West has a [very active imagination](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/apr/11/allen-west/allen-west-says-about-80-house-democrats-are-membe/).   If things follow the pattern of last couple of 'scandals', the denials will be refutations of Republican's dishonesty.

We can around and around pointing out our favorite hypocrisy on the other side, but it won't change anything.  We can decide we want a society that tries to include the less successful or pushes them down harder.  If we're committed to inclusion, their lives will improve. If we aren't (and I don't think we've ever made more than a half-assed effort), we won't .   Debates on guns in American lead me back to the old joke. 'Statistics are like people, you can torture them until they say anything you want them to'.  Pro or anti gun we can all find a study that proves guns make us safer or guns make us less safe.   I'm OK with that, (or a negative income tax or a guaranteed minimum income)  but I think it's the [conservatives blocking it] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_duckies).  Not every conservative of course, but there seems to be a sadistic faction that delights in making life harder for the least successful and unfortunate.    In general ...  I suppose there are exceptions, but when someone titles their article as The truth about 9/11, or The truth about Christianity or The truth about the Holocaust, or The Truth about  anything else, I expect an opinionated one-sided screed.   Maybe, maybe not.  [The Economist] (http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not?zid=309 ah=80dcf288b8561b012f603b9fd9577f0e) thinks that 'Moderate minimum wages do more good than harm'.     Sources that call themselves 'The truth about ...' usually aren't.   The minimum wage hike is causing Hardee's to shut down restaurants? Talk about your unexpected benefits!   Mr. Tol, a lead author on one of the panels working groups, said the field of climate research suffers from alarmist bias and groupthink.   This is the latest clever smear on climatogists. Instead of acknowledging a scientific consensus exists, dismiss it as "groupthink".    Why, oh why, don't the Democrats drive this issue?  90% of us live off our paychecks, and I don't think many of us like the idea that someone can be cheated out of their earnings.    ... the longtime senator also spent some time promising to push a constitutional amendment if he disagrees with the Supreme Courts ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, vowing that everybody will support his new constitutional language, except the nuts. Hatch also reportedly took the opportunity in his remarks to assail the nations courts and urge voters to cast their ballots for Republicans in 2014 and 2016." The senator added, I shouldnt talk like that, but Ive reached an age that I can say whatever I want.  Apparently "I'm a rude, old asshole." is now an excuse.         I'll be OK with it, as long as the terms include Walker's exile from Wisconsin.    Cheney is a particularly puerile, putrid , peccant, prevaricating pissant.  And if you don't limit yourself to the P's, [the possibilities are abundant](http://grammar.about.com/od/rhetoricstyle/a/How-To-Rant-Bernard-Levin-S-All-Purpose-Invective.htm).   Now if only they'd admit that they're similarly unable to understand economics, defense, or basic human decency,voters would stop listening to them.     I sure hope voters figure out that Paul isn't much of a libertarian.  He's more of a boy-toy for the bankers and billionaires.    Most conservative politicians want to, above all,  protect the interests of their monied supporters. They'll jettison their culture war positions when they're no longer useful.   Or in other words, 'I don't want to be the last rat on a sinking ship.'   In addition, Gerber is encouraging all the areas Dutch Oven chefs to plan on attending and preparing their favorite recipe to share with the crowd. Andy Boyer of Elko will be on hand driving a chuck wagon pulled by a pair of mules.  The parallels with Gandhi's march to the sea are uncanny!    In the Washington Post's 2016 Candidate [Fact checker page] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/tag/2016-candidates/), Rand Paul now leads all contenders with 18 Pinocchios. Next closest in Ted Cruz with 8.  Hard to believe there is someone more that twice as dishonest as Ted Cruz, but I guess Paul is the man.   Paul Ryan has never had a meaningful piece of legislation passed in all his years in Congress, but I'd say he's had a big impact.  Like Ryan, Warren is forcing these issues into the public discussion.   I think he misunderstood.  People are most likely asking him why he's such a wiener.   Repeat until understood.   Why not both?    It's hard to imagine, but Wisconsin once had a reputation for aboveboard and clean politics.  Looks like we've got that turned around completely .  Edit: grammar.   Sam Wang is the best data analyst studying elections.  And he does it [on the side] (http://bigthink.com/users/samwang) .       My family is from a northern Scottish island, and I'm not built for Mississippi  weather.  How my fellow Scots adapted to the weather in the American South, I can't imagine.     I was once in St. Louis in August, and cool is the last word I would use to describe it. I'm a Midwestern fellow so I was accustomed to the heat, but the humidity, brutal.   You're assuming that all the people with guns would join in fighting the government.  I imagine some of them will join the government in wiping out the revolutionaries.    [Maybe, maybe not.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/books/in-gunfight-adam-winkler-traces-the-gun-control-battle.html?pagewanted=all) Although some gun-rights advocates talk as though gun control were a modern, 20th-century invention of an increasingly meddlesome government, the historical passages in Gunfight suggest otherwise. Not only did the nations founders balance gun rights with public safety needs, Mr. Winkler says, but the wild, wild west wasnt all that wild. According to the research of one scholar he cites, almost everyone carried firearms in the untamed wilderness, which was full of dangerous American Indians, outlaws and bears, but in the towns where people lived and businesses operated, there were often blanket ordinances against the carrying of arms by anyone. One of the towns with strict rules was the notorious Dodge City, Kan.   Perhaps a mass murder takes the edge off them for a few days.   Really?  Then perhaps I'll start posting more.   Thus the unsurprising discovery: Virtually every reference to the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  the second part of the Second Amendment  was in reference to military defense. Waldman notes the House debate over the Second Amendment in the summer of 1789: Twelve congressmen joined the debate. **None mentioned a private right to bear arms for self-defense, hunting or for any purpose other than joining the militia.**      American agriculture could adopt new technology rather than focusing solely on immigrant workers, Krikorian argued. "When you have unending sources of low-skill foreign labor, the incentive to automate is weaker."     Looks like Mitch McConnell has moved on from evasions and half truths right on up to the straight lie.   At five months out, nothing is a done deal in US elections.      I think OWS accomplished more than you give yourselves credit for.  Income inequality was a fringe topic before OWS, and you brought it into the mainstream.     For an argument that will anger an entire section of the country, here's [hypothesis that argues that American violence rooted in southern culture] (http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/July-2012/American-Violence-and-Southern-Culture/).     Dammit, and I was so proud that I managed to spell Feingold correctly.    Wisconsin is the home both 'Tail Gunner Joe' McCarthy and 'Fighting Bob' LaFollette. We're the state that failed to re-elect the progressive Ross Feingold and two years later, elected Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay Senator. Pretty much anything can happen here.   And ha!   Never thought of that.  Republicans are always claiming they want to return America to its origins.  I guess they're going a little further back than we suspected.    They're just covering all the bases.   If voter ID proponents we're truly interested in making sure we had honest elections, they'd address this issue as well.  But somehow, they never quite seem to get around to it.   [Insurance companies] (http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0517/Climate-change-lawsuits-filed-against-some-200-US-communities) are starting to worry about the payouts climate change will cause.  Nothing like a change to the bottom line to get business groups interested in a problem.   I'll never understand why the Democrats don't make an issue of wages (and not just minimum wage).  90% depend on our paychecks, and the Republicans seem largely interested in keeping them smaller in favor of larger profits.     The Republican Party = Making America a high profit, low wage Paradise.   Apparently, insurance companies are now falling for the climate change hoax as well. /s      I've been wondering about this for some time, and Igbo provide another data point.  Are there any societies that 1) place a premium on education and 2) haven't been successful economically?  Even if there are a few counterexamples, it does seem dedication to education is a leading indicator of how successful a ethnic, religious, and even geographical (compare Massachusetts with Alabama) group is likely to be.   Or addressing environmental issues?  Or income inequality?  The sudden change of opinion on same sex marriage gives me hope that American opinion might turn quickly on other issues.   He sure does 'evolve' quickly to the prevailing political trends.  He ought adopt a jellyfish as his mascot.   Ripping off a song you heard by another performer and trying to take credit for writing it? Here's [somebody else](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_My_Mojo_Working#Litigation) who did  that .  It's as old as the blues, and probably almost as old as music.  Still I think Led Zeppelin has been notably egregious in borrowing and not giving proper credit.  The worst case  was "Bring it on Home", where Robert Plant imitates Sonny Boy Williamson for the first verse and chorus and the song's ending, yet Williamson and Dixon received no credit. (Jimmy Page tried to dismiss it an homage to Sonny Boy, and claimed it was 'only a few seconds of music'.) Compare them to the Rolling Stones , who covered many old blues songs and always gave credit, used blues bands for their opening acts and even got Howling Wolf a slot to perform on Shindig!    If you want to know what a study concludes, look who paid for it.  This study was paid for by the American Enterprise Institute.    There has always been a strain of [anti-intellectualism in America] (http://www.amazon.com/Anti-Intellectualism-American-Life-Richard-Hofstadter/dp/0394703170).  Fox News and such are the latest manifestation.     They'll never wise up.  You can fool some of people all the time ... and those are the people you want to concentrate on.   If they follow the same pattern as they have on Medicare and Social Security, give them a few election cycles and they'll be claiming the Democrats are undercutting the Affordable Care Act,   Assuming we have a just God, I'd say that's about right.   Really a remarkably disingenuous article. When Medicare D  was implemented  [there were a significant problems as well.] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/13/steve-israel/medicare-part-d-and-obamacare-health-care-gov/) . Like Medicare D, ACA will improve over time.     I believe the study you cited (from the Cato Institute) is what we usually call [B.S.](http://www.businessinsider.com/does-welfare-really-pay-better-than-work-2013-8).  Do you think we'd have a 15% to 20% poverty rate if welfare paid that well?   Karl Rove is the dung beetle of American politics.   Next time someone tells you both parties are the same direct them to this editorial.        I didn't say he was particularly smart (or particularly stupid, if it's the rest of US congress we're comparing him to), just unpredictable.    Edit: Parenthetical remark added  	116

    Outro by M83      Good summary! NOT!   This happened a few days ago. I'm re-posting for weekend rules because this got deleted the first time. At the time I wrote this, it was around 3am. Normally at that time, I'm sleeping peacefully in my bed, but I couldn't sleep anymore because of the levels of adrenaline in my bloodstream. My fingers were literally shaking as I wrote this. The rest of the story is unchanged from when I wrote it, so when I say 'tonight' I mean the night that it happened, etc.  As a little bit of background, I normally go to sleep around 10 or 11pm and my wife comes to bed much later, around 2am. Tonight I guess I heard her starting to come to bed and it woke me up. I realized my bladder was full, and right as my tired brain was making the decision to get out of bed I heard the toilet flush. All I thought was 'Great, now it's available!' so I got up. I wanted to expend as little energy as possible so that it would be easy to get back to sleep, so I was walking towards the door in our bedroom when it opened suddenly. All I see on the other side of the door is this bright light which makes me squint and stop in my tracks. My wife, who didn't hear me get up, only sees someone standing right inside the door when she didn't expect anyone to be there. She sees this figure standing there with its arms completely at its sides, totally still, and eyes appearing to be closed. It was at this moment that her brain broke (or rather worked as it's intended to).  She initially stepped back a little, mouth open, arms tucking in, gasping slightly, and then she went full on panic mode and started screaming. She yelled my name three times, each one louder than the last, while recoiling in horror at the sight of someone creepily waiting for her. While she was yelling, I still didn't know quite what was going on, only that I was still extremely sleepy and that I wanted to expend little to no energy so that I could just go to the bathroom and get back to sleep. This changed quickly as I saw her scream into her hands and collapse onto the floor, crying and hyperventilating. She later told me that she didn't collapse until she recognized the stranger in her house was her husband.  I thought she would calm down rather quickly. It didn't happen that way though. She must have used up all her fight or flight instinct for the next 50 years, because she was just shaking and crying and breathing erratically for several minutes. She described it as her brain recognizing that everything is ok, but her body was still in full-blown panic. Meanwhile, I was holding her and apologizing, telling her that it was me and that it was ok, I wasn't going to murder her. Around then she said 'You scared the shit out of me! ...NOT LITERALLY!"  I still really had to go to the bathroom and I was scared that I would literally pee on her, so I left her for a second to go take care of business. Our dog recognized that something was not right and came up to my wife the way she greets us when we come home, with her head low, ears back, and wiggling. She nuzzled my wife with her nose and anytime she stopped getting petted she put her paw on my wife's arm. She's currently still on the bed even though she normally chooses to sleep downstairs.  After things had calmed down a bit, we had to talk to each other to figure out exactly what happened. I told her I wasn't trying to induce a full-blown panic attack, or even scare her a little. I was just sleepy and needed to pee. Now we're both coming down from adrenaline highs, and neither of us is going to be able to sleep for awhile. My wife says she now knows how people feel right before they're murdered.  TL; DR- Went to go to the bathroom, almost ended up with poop everywhere.      I don't remember, but it was over 5 years ago. They were prescription meds given to us by the vet. As far as the dosage, we would only give him a fraction of a pill. They didn't really stop his car sickness, and in addition to being covered in drool he was cross-eyed, lethargic, and it took too long to wear off.   We used to give him meds, but he was always so loopy afterwards that we discontinued it. He's actually gotten quite a bit better. He's kinda drooly for about a half hour and then he stops and settles in. We also stop feeding him the night before big trips which helps, but we give him food after he stops drooling and he does ok.      That's beautiful. I made the same choice, and regretted it only until I found that through my job I was able to live my dreams without being burdened by them.  	10

The evening view from their terrace is really priceless.   I pretty regularly use a National Express coach A6 from Stanested to Victoria (it stops at Golders Green, Finchley Road, Baker Street before it reaches London Victoria). There is also a Stanested-Stratford rute A9 http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/Airport/stansted.aspx It costs 10, and return costs 17.

I fully share your feelings and I need to admit that I get very emotional at this point: "upon returning from another country, looking out the aeroplane window across our neat and orderly patchwork of fields/hedgerows"                                                                                          I've taken a side.. as a part time photographer, I simply never upload my photos to stock sites anymore.. the copyright theft out there is insane   Spot on.

The price of a daily ticket is about 7+ if you buy it in the morning, and you can use it on all buses, DLR, and overground trains in the same zone.   and now is falling to pieces again...what a frighful experiences on Jubilee line almost every day...and they never forget to charge more and more   Use it badly, pls   they'll ignore him   more links like this, the better - "Louis Vuitton Whores"   I see what you did there, Sir   OMG ... "But while Manning's punishment is cruel, it is far from unusual. According to available data, there are some 25,000 inmates in long-term isolation in America's supermax prisons, and as many as 80,000 more in solitary confinement in other facilities. Where is the outrage  even among progressives  for these forgotten souls? Where, for that matter, is some acknowledgment of their existence?"   Thank you, Sir! (if only my teacher would have read your words some years ago)   ...just imagine how fast they could sort out all those tax havens if they really wanted to   This somehow reminds me of PM Gordon Brown and the UK gold reserves he had sold so badly... (at the worst possible moment at least)   Seconded...I'd love to, but...(like we're not from the same material)   Pretty cute, indeed   RIP Benoit   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8612457.stm  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8612596.stm  http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html  http://documents.nytimes.com/reverend-lawrence-c-murphy-abuse-case#document/p41    I'd love to Upvote this comment twice   I wouldn't trust to Karzai either...   a bit gayish of course...

 Laminate that looks like granite. Don't care about cost really, I'm just looking for what style/colour will go well. It's a medium size area, my entire kitchen countertop.

 He seems to fancy roles where his character spends lots of time in the water.      Yea, you hit upon several of my assumptions, especially the fact that she's likely to associate certain feeling of guilt with me no matter what.  So we'll see how it goes.  She's not the first girlfriend I've had an abusive childhood.  They always say they feel safe with me.   You're welcome and thank you.  Peace would be nice.   She seems to be improving.  It'll take time.  Thanks.   They're not repressed memories in the sense that the trauma was so great that her brain hid them away.  She just never dealt with the pain and emotions of the memories which swim through her head daily.     [Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/xui4l/girlfriend_told_her_friends_that_im_hung_now_our/)   Just thought some of you might be curious as to what happened after my post.  After it seemed nothing else would help her feel better about what happened, she decided to use a counseling service through the university where she's working on her PhD.  (since it's a free service)  After a few weeks, the sessions began unearthing dormant issues of molestation and other terrible things from her childhood which the counselors are convinced are the reasons she has these debilitating feelings of guilt and shattered trust.  I encouraged her to focus on those issues without worrying about our relationship and we ended up going on a break.  I had suspected there might be something akin to molestation in her history, but I never brought it up.  Hopefully more counseling will help.        **Top Five**  1.  Gerard (MIKE)  2.

John Justice Wheeler  4.  Bobby Briggs  5.  Josie Packard   Ha, confidence and swagger seem to be aphrodisiacs, yes.  I'm not worried about women who hit on me when they know I have a girlfriend.  I can swat away flies.  Just looking for ideas on how to make a shy girl feel less embarrassed.   Yea, but just a few of them.  And honestly, the ones that I couldn't understand why she was friends with.  Mostly girls from her high school days who she doesn't hang out with much anymore (or any now).   She was actually very proactive initially, messaging everyone trying to be light-hearted and underscoring that what she said was a secret just amongst friends, then I started getting messages from girls that weren't there.   The women that were forward with me would generally be the ones I assumed would be cheaters.  The ones that seems a little bit more selfish, narcissistic, and impulsive than the others.  Also virtually all of them already had significant others. Not a fantasy to have my girlfriend consider ending the relationship because of embarrassment.   I appreciate your words.  She lives off my reassurance, but the problem is she has to think about it every time we're intimate since my manhood reminds her of her guilt and mistrust in her friends.   The running joke with my girlfriends is that size doesn't matter but it certainly can't hurt... unless you're as big as me.   Grazie.   Yea, I'm confident things will return to a healthier level of comfort eventually.  I believe it also has much to do with how her public and private lives collided.  She feels exposed.  Just trying to see if there are other shy girls out there who can see things from her perspective and offer some ideas on what might help her see things less negatively.  (and also help her not be so PTSD-esque when she's being intimate with my manhood.  it stirs up memories of feeling betrayed by her friends)   It's actually a reoccurring problem.  Previous friends of previous girlfriends have tried to get me to have sex with them.  (Unsuccessfully.)  And the reverse has definitely happened a few times where male friends of mine (who obviously aren't friends of mine anymore) tried to get my then girlfriend to sleep with them.  It always seems to start with Facebook.  A friend of my girlfriend will friend me and occasionally IM me to see what's going on and start getting really chatty and friendly.  Perhaps I shouldn't list Secretary as one of my favorite films.  That seems to give them an icebreaker.  	18
 There are a lot of little tricks you can use to help you feel better when you are depressed.  Set a small attainable goal for yourself.  Like baking a cake from scratch.  Focus on researching the perfect recipe, focus on going out and getting the ingredients, measure and check for advice on good techniques.  You make that cake.  You eat some of that cake.  Think of your next challenge.  The best friend of depression is inactivity.  We feel tired and so we think what we want is to lie down and not think, but we just feel sick at the end of the day.  And we think, and think and think.  If you focus on doing something, any little thing, you can get out of your head.  If you can't manage to do it for yourself, read.  Read a novel.  Be someone else.       My advice is to:  Travel (See this world that holds no charms for you!)  Volunteer (Do things out of the goodness of your own heart with no selfish motives.)  Make goals for yourself (See it as a challenge, play a game with yourself.  You seem pretty bright to me, or at the very least well-written... how far can that take you?  Can you trick someone into giving you a job you're not qualified for?  Can you write a novel?  Can you learn to cook a perfect macaron?)  MOVE.  (For the love of god, don't lie on the couch or sit in front of your computer all day.  Go out, go out in public.  People watch, laugh, see the sights, move your body.)  The world really is a beautiful, strange place.  We only get to live in it one time and there is a good chance that there is nothing after.  Try to reach inside and find that part of you that is curious about how things work, that can laugh at absurdities.  Try to find someone who understands you.  Try to find the things that appeal to you.  Please live.  I don't know you, not at all, but I would still be very sad if you died.      The only thing that I think you may need to plan for is whether ME has a great need for game wardens post-grad.  You may need to move to do what you love.  Never pay more than the minimum on your loans once you graduate, there is no point.  Save every spare dime you have for a down payment on your house and start establishing your credit.  You do that by paying for things (meaning bills) on time consistently and by opening at least one line of credit.  Once you're in the workforce, don't forget to put some money into your retirement.  It's very important to start that early. :)  Good luck, I like what you're saying here.     I think the determining factor is how important your family is to you.  Some people are very family oriented and are happiest living near them, I'm one of those people.  If I were you, I would regret not moving home.  Money is one of those things that's very transient.  As they say "If you wait until you have enough money to have a baby, you will never have a baby."  A pay cut is something you'll figure out if it means being near your family.  Now if you're not that close to your family, you've got the right idea.  You need to identify if you're happy with your current situation, and if you're not, do things to make it what you want!  Remember, we can literally die at any moment, annnnny moment at all.  Think, if I were to die tomorrow, would I regret anything or would I die peacefully?  Do what you can to deal with any regrets you think you might have. :)    Hello!  A few things:  -Make sure your resume isn't from a template, you want it to be unique looking in style, professional but memorable!  -When applying, always write a cover letter for your resume.  Consider acknowledging that you don't have a lot of history, but that your drive and skills are a great fit for the company and they only need interview you in person to see how passionate you are to being part of their team.  Be earnest if that's who you are!  -Volunteer.  If you need something for a resume but don't have years of work history to illustrate your talents, volunteer in fields related to what you want to do.  Hope this helps! :)   The tone of this complaint is very disturbing.  You're calling his behavior gross, insinuating that you've been confronting him, accusing him of being lazy, admitting that you've been locking things up from someone you're supposed to be taking care of...   You're the epitome of an unreliable narrator, but if what you're saying *is* true, he's probably acting out because negative attention is better than no attention at all.    Listen, children who come from broken homes are not always easy to deal with.  They may not come to you with open arms and open hearts and that has nothing to do with you personally.  You're clearly dealing with inadequacy issues to be this defensive towards someone who is so much younger than you.  You need to shelve it.  Be the bigger person, the adult.  Make up your mind to love him no matter what, no matter how hard it is, no matter if you're ever thanked, no matter if he looks just like your husband's ex-wife.  Just choose.  Choose the right thing.  Even if he never lets you in, being a kind, good person to someone who needs that in their life is its own reward.  I really hope you can turn this around.      You need to cut that emotional extortionist out of you life.  Block her number, change your e-mail address, cut her out!    You do not need someone like this in your life, no one deserves to be treated like less than a human being and from what you've put here, that's just what she's doing.    I'm not sure what exactly to say about how you can get back up, since I don't know much about your life situation (Are you graduating high school soon?  Terribly depressed?  Considering a move?  Stuck at home?), but if you would like to discuss any of that privately, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM and I'll do my best to help you work through whatever.      First of all, you should never apologize for working towards what you've wanted the most all your life.  You're a hard working, driven individual who should be lauded.... a wonderful example for the people around you.  Don't feel guilty.  This is your life.  You have to be your own advocate.  You don't need to break it off, and I know I'm about to say one of the worst words in the relationship lexicon, but here we go: Give him the ultimatum.  Just tell him in an organized, calm manner what you basically explained here: You have been working your whole life to build a wonderful career and life for yourself away from this place that holds so many bad memories for you.  That you want the very best for yourself and your family, and that means being in a place where you can excel professionally and personally.  That you want him to be your family more than anything, but you just can't go home.    He's probably going to break things off, maybe even for a bit, but he'll probably also come back.  And if he doesn't?  You'll know for sure that it wasn't meant to be.  He'll have done you a favor.  We always want what is best for the people we love.  If he really can't be happy unless he's home, and you can't be happy back at home, the two of you need to find happiness apart, but the truth is that a lot of times, guys just fear change.  He may well just give in when you make it clear that his refusal to move forward will cost him his relationship with you.   You either owe your friends an apology or you're being paranoid (so an apology isn't going to hurt).  I would just reach out via a text or an e-mail or even on the phone if you care a lot, a lot about that person and say something to the effect of "I wanted to apologize to you for not being as available as I've been in the past.  Your friendship is very important to me, so I want to make it very clear that while this in no way excuses my carelessness, it has everything to do with my wedding and the move and nothing to do with how I feel about you.  When all this is done, we should get together; I promise not to say one word about me.  I miss you and I'll see you soon."  Follow it up with a few random texts here and there between your apology and the wedding.  Nice things like "I saw an interview with George Clooney this morning, and it reminded me of that time, blah blah blah. You're great."  Just let them know they're on your mind. :)   The best way to handle stage fright and to make your speech better (not to mention get those extra points for time) is to practice your speech in its entirety, aloud, and time it.  You don't need to have an audience, although a tester will be able to give you pointers.  Hope this helps!     When you say "live on your own" do you mean you want to buy a house?    I met my husband at work.  Initially he was above me in the company, but I was not one of his reports.  Eventually I was promoted beyond his role.  A lot of people within the company had no idea we were married.  We made it a point to not be affectionate at work.  We talked about work related things when we needed to.  We had to go to meetings together and sometimes worked on assignments together.  It is important to report your relationship to your HR representative.  They will decide if your immediate supervisor needs to know.  Just keep it professional! :)   Hello ExDrK;  Almost all jobs have a 30 day grace period in which either party can terminate the working relationship without notice.  Sometimes this is included in the offer letter, sometimes it's just a disclaimer form, sometimes it is in the Non-Disclosure agreement.  I would got to your HR representative (or call the phone number for the service they use) and ask.  Just be very apologetic and professional and nice.  The truth is that most employers don't really want employees who don't want to be there, it's more respectful to just come out with it.    Hope this helps!    I guess my question would be why does she need to move 1000 miles away to study veterinary science?  You can literally do this anywhere!  I can understand that she might be in more demand in a large city, but that's neither here nor there until she's licensed.  Unless you're going to tell me she's planning to move in with a specific relative there, I would question if she isn't just looking for a way out of the relationship.  If it were me, I'd actually go along any way.  You only live once, and while all change can be scary, it is almost always worth it.  You could live in a new city, explore a new field, and if the relationship goes south, meet new people.  Worst comes to worst, move back.  The truth is that you're in charge of your own destiny.  Think about what would really make you happy and go for it!    Well, I'm guessing that you probably have folks on staff that could do similar work, if you need to know now, you could bring them the examples and ask them to guestimate how long they would take to build something similar from the ground up.  I'm sorry I'm not able to give you anything more concrete!  I'm sure you'll figure it out. :)   This isn't particularly scientific, but if it were me, I'd take the documents to their contributors in person and ask them to estimate how much time they put into them, conservatively.  Unless you have access to the original files, that's probably the best you'll be able to do.     Exit only, bro.   Hey, thank YOU for posting the awesome reference link.  I get really jazzed about this sale... I typically can't afford their eyes (in good conscience) until this happens, so I figured someone else might want to know. :)   Sorry to piggy-back, but that's another great thing about Amazon.  A lot of the albums you buy physical copies of come with a complimentary digital copy via auto-rip.  I love that I can order vinyl for my collection, but still have the convenience of "traveling copies" at no extra cost.  Before anyone asks, I'm not a paid rep for Amazon, I just really like it!   Thanks for the suggestion.  I'll check it out, maybe.  Have an upvote. :)   I think you're just being downvoted because he specified that he wasn't looking for iTunes in his question, but here, have an upvote on me. :)   Oh, no, don't worry about it man.  I can definitely see why you would think that. :)   I would imagine this would be a good combination... he probably gets you to experience things you wouldn't otherwise while not being such a Pollyanna that you'd get annoyed. :)   Two craziest things:  1) Someone had set up a glass of water with two perfect plastic REPLICAS of Beyer Asprin.  I've done some digging on the internet and still can't figure out why such a thing exists.  I have them in my jewelry box still almost ten years later.  2) We moved the credenza for spring cleaning and under it was a bag from the local sex shop.  It was full of those cheap dirty paperbacks and an un-opened package of huge anal beads.    There's a lot of hate for country music since people just think of Toby Keith or some other ignorant asshole.  There happens to be good country music out here.  I like Whiskeytown, Loretta Lynn, Neko Case, Shovels and Rope, the country Neil Young albums, Ryan Adams, I could go on...    I'm actually surprised at how much neutral there is... I can't really relate to this:   A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.    Well, truthfully, he would never cheat.  I know that probably sounds like I'm taking him for granted, but, I mean, he never leaves the house and refuses to have anything to do with any person who isn't his immediate family.  Short of skipping work to have an affair (someone who loses 20+ hour a year in PTO because he refuses to take a day off, right), it would be ultra mega obvious.    But we're playing pretend here.  If he did, I wouldn't really care much, but I would probably still leave.    So many stories about this guy, but one of the better ones what that we had a sheet of water running down into our living room (like two feet across, a literal sheet of water)... his explanation?  The water comes from Lake Superior, so it's extra cold... that water is condensation from the cold pipes and the warm air.   Turned out to be the upstairs neighbor's bathtub overflow... she was just leaving the water on while she was in there.     Real Talk: I don't think cheating is a deal breaker, but if my husband cheated on me, I'd probably take it as a get out of jail free ticket and leave, never to re-marry.     I'm Chaotic - Good. :)  Edit: Description: A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.    This is pretty awesome if you're not sure: http://www.easydamus.com/alignment.html    In MMOs, I like to be altruistic.  If I see a newbie, I ask them if they have any questions or need anything.  I like community in an MMO and eventually that little player you helped gets really good. :)  On Facebook, I think it's best to only use it as a virtual photo album for your long-distance family.  I tend to try to only post supportive things and photos for people who can't be close enough to see my family in person.  LinkedIn is something I only recommend you use if you have impressive networking contacts.  It's rather pointless if you don't.  My tactics on Reddit is mostly to just be nice.  It's worked out pretty well, everyone seems a lot nicer than I thought they would be going in. :)  Hope this helps!   Here you go, folks: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vvijiNjplLs/Uj26mtv3_sI/AAAAAAAACNA/n3gxV5xgj_s/s1600/harry-potter-chart.jpg  I'm actually an INFJ, so this isn't really a question to me, but, hell, three out of four is pretty good, I think... I don't really have an easy time doing social networking.  I have to talk myself into calling strangers.  The best advice I can give you is to keep your arms uncrossed, have a pleasant look on your face, if you're in a group, invite loners in, think of a few questions that you wouldn't mind being asked yourself and ask them.  This is pretty specific to how to network in a large group, so if you're looking for something else, just hit me with a reply and I'll help. :)   Well, I think your question goes to show that you actually think you should pay for the music you listen to, and good for you.  The average musician actually makes less than $50k a year.  I get my MP3s from Amazon.  Unlike iTunes, it's an actual MP3 file if you choose to download it.  You still have cloud storage and can get applications for both iOS and Droid.  You can even listen on your work computer from the website without downloading anything.  Hope this helps!    I think it depends on what kind of person your parent is.  My own mother is one of those people who is convinced that the way she thinks is the only way to think (not just with me, but with her husband... the phrase she uses is "yes, but they're wrong!"), as a consequence, she's a very poor listener.  I can tell her things flat out and she's trying so hard to hear things she can relate to, she never remembers a thing!    I would imagine if your parent were one of those people who is constantly seeking a different point of view or who is curious about the world at large would have observed a million and six things about you without your noticing.  ;)   I think the biggest thing I'm dealing with right now is recognizing what people mean when they say "marriage is hard."  Like, I heard that and assumed it would be obvious, like you will argue and you need to make up or compromise or whatever.  I had no idea what was meant was that you're probably going to wonder all the time if the negative things are "normal."    My husband doesn't really like to engage in conversations or discussions, he doesn't like to do things or travel, and he has a very low sex drive.  For a jag there I was thinking "Is this what a neglectful marriage is?  Should I leave?"  But I'm starting to recognize that what I make of my life is still my own responsibility.  I've abandoned waiting for his participation to do things that I want to do, I've started going out for drives and seeing things of visual interest, watching movies alone, going out to eat, volunteering, basically doing the things I seemed to think for some reason were off limits since he didn't want to do them.  It's not like he told me I can't, so only my own pre-conceived notion of what marriage is stopped me from doing these things.  I am starting to recognize what ha925 mentioned in their comment: Being able to control yourself during the downtimes.  Recognizing that there is a middle ground between all or nothing.  But I also agree with not-quite-obscure in a moderate way.  I don't think I'd ever do this again.  It seems to be a bit unnatural a lot of the time.     Ahahaha, my former boss joked with my husband about arranging a marriage between our babies (his son is two months old, my daughter is 7 months), he told me my husband's eyes went totally flat and he said 100% seriously "I don't think she's ever going to date."     Also true... a kid is like an automatic extra $3000 back on your taxes... of course, that doesn't really approach what you're spending on them, but you know.... Surprise you have $3000 is nice for paying back your co-pay for the delivery or getting a new roof on your house.  Thanks, Uncle Sam!    This is so true... my best friend had warned me that this would happen, and I was like "whatever, I'm going to watch a Serbian Film now," but I was so wrong.  I can't read or watch anything involving abuse to children!  I can't even read the damn newspaper!  Why did I never notice how much infanticide is in the newspaper before?!    I wholeheartedly relate to your first point... I don't think I've gone to the bathroom when I've wanted to or eaten a hot meal at an actual table in 6 months!  However, you don't even hesitate, this is what you do now.  You learn to love the cold coffee.  Ha ha.   The second was longer in coming for me, it actually only hit me about a month ago.  I think it's because she has a personality now.     We never argue and here's why: My husband doesn't ever engage.  I'll say I feel x, y, and z, and this is why.  He'll stare at me.  Sometimes an hour later he'll come back and apologize for "being an asshole," or not knowing I felt that way.  That's how it works.  Very dramatic, huh?  Edit: Sorry, I ignored part II of the question.  My big points of contention are basically that he doesn't hear me.  How many times do I have to tell you that I can't stand not being able to see a damn thing in the house, but I still come home to find you swapped all the lightbulbs for colored ones that don't light anything?  Or why is it that when I'm trapped in the car with you we have to listen to Pig Destroyer three turns too loud and when I ask you to turn it down, you ignore me?  I know women get a bad rap for expecting men to read their minds, but I tell him what I want all the time, and it basically only guarantees that I won't get it.  It's exhausting.    Initially, there is no autonomy.  I know as a mother, my immediate feeling when I came home was that no one could swoop in and save me, this creature needed ME to feed her and no matter how tired or sore or scared or anything I was, it was too bad, here we are!  That was an odd feeling, I've never felt it before or since.    I recommend that you just start doing small things by yourself that give you room to breathe.  I volunteer with a hospice on the weekend, and my assignments require me to drive for an hour both ways to see my ladies.  This time by myself in the car with music I like to listen to greatly quells my wanderlust.    A lot of the things that you've mentioned aren't really things that you can simply go out and do without there being some damage, but you know, I said to my husband (who is a major homebody and allergic to spending money) that I wanted to travel when our daughter was older.  I told him that I would love for him to come, but that if he didn't, I still needed to go.  I think a lot of young people go into marriage thinking that it means you'll do things together all the time, but the truth is that you might not ever do a thing if you wait for the other person to participate.  It's okay to do things alone! It makes you feel capable and smart and free.     Sorry for being redundant in the way this is worded, but how has being married changed what you thought marriage would be like as a single person?   I legit think it would be like the movie series the Purge.  It was be wayyy fucked up.     Pig Faced Women!  Specifically that there was a rich philanthropist who was believed to BE ONE and she couldn't even dispel it by making public appearances... It had to be an actress that she hired since we actually believe she has the head of a pig.... Also getting bears drunk, shaving their faces, putting them in dresses and then claiming they are pig-faced women in your freak show?  Is this all made up?  What on earth!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAj3lOyv3s   I had no idea that this was actually a THING, I thought this commercial was SATIRE.  Thanks for making it funny!    I feel a sense of community.  I like that I can give my opinion on things and not have it dis-counted because of the way I look... no one knows how I look!  I'm less lonely, I laugh more, and I think about things I might never have considered before.  I love reddit!     Mostly trivia in very specific areas.  I don't even know any Warren Zevon fans in real life but if I do I'll be able to regale them with all kinds of chestnuts!  Or what about the birth order and sun signs of the entire Culkin family?  Do you want to know everything I know about the North American Bison.  Sit down, sir.  I'll help you with that.... Now serial killer trivia, I use that SOMETIMES.  Like twice a year.  On Reddit.    People whistling.  In all seriousness, I don't even whistle to myself when I'm alone.  That's how disgusting I find it to be.  It literally gives me a facial twitch.    I occasionally reply with "Who is this?" to texts I receive when I know damn well who it is.    I can actually count on one hand the moments I've been passive aggressive, and so they're both pretty good stories.  1. At my first job there was this girl who would never switch shifts with anyone EVER.  But she would go to the owner and have get the boss to make her the closer when she wanted extra money.  When she would steal this shift from me while I was actively working it, I would pour sweet and sour sauce on the tile floor, knowing she had to mop it and it was a bitch.  2. My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall.  The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway.  I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor.  One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time.  The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it.  Ahahaha!     I'd be living very differently.  I'd get a motorcycle and go to Sturgis and live in a new city every few years and I'd be out camping by myself all the time.     This is pretty geeky, but whatever.... I wore a sweater I had knitted to work and someone stopped me and said she "Would buy something like that.... no really!"  It was like.... I spent about $100 on this hand painted yarn, and it took several hundred hours to make and you're condescending to tell me you would buy something like it, no really?  Go away.    Oh dear, he missed his reflex check to catch it in time. :(   Where were you when I was a kid? :)  I like your reddit contributions, technobarry.  You're a cool cat.    Shut up!  Really?  I had no idea.... that's really weird to think about.... 80 year old octopuses.... I'm going to have to Google this. :)   I would watch the fuck out of Steve Buscemi's! :)   What if it's in octopus years?  (Yes, I just thought you were that funny on that other thread....I'm still crying from laughter.)   I just got my pre-ordered copy... it's actually pressed in Germany apparently.    This isn't about me and my child, but I have one of my mom's:  In 1992, my mom was married to a construction worker.  He took her with on an out of town job.  The hotel had a fabulous pool, and my mom really wanted to go swimming.  She didn't have a swimsuit.  Her husband said he would buy her one if she'd have sex with him that night.  She stipulated that she wanted tequila too if that's what needed to be done.  This is the night she conceived my youngest sister.  My sister was the consequence of a sex barter for a swimsuit.  I'm never to tell her on penalty of death.    I'm the assistant to a lady-CEO! :)    It sounds like you have anxiety.  Hey! Me too!  But I'm conventionally very successful, I have a house and a beautiful baby and a husband and a respectable career where I make more than the average American (and much more than the average woman).    This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand. 2. Accept that it could happen. 3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome.   As my former boss liked to say, don't get crushed by the rock, break the rock into smaller pieces and deal with them as you can. :)   State of the Union Address Given : Most hilarious jokes in the world made.   Body: Lots of analytical text that boils down to how when you get beyond the hilarious jokes mixed in, the President just over analyzed several creative possible actions before dissolving into a tangent about how they are conscious this isn't helping.  Compassion and exasperation ensue.     Well, when I was four, my mom asked me what I wanted to be went I grew up.  I told her I wanted to be an artist.  She said "Artists don't get paid anything until they're dead."  So I kept my eyes open.  At five, I went to my first funeral and met a friendly mortician.  I wanted to be a mortician until I was, like, 14.  You can see I had a fucked sense of humor even then.    I'm not a mortician, but I have succeeded in making something to the tune of $200 in my lifetime for art.  Look out!     I really, really hope that your retirement is magical.  That you do all those things you wanted to but never had the time or felt guilty doing.  (100% sincere)   It's misplaced, but it's well-meaning.    I actually just had a moment of clarity thinking about this.  My mom and I were talking and she casually mentioned that my sister has just decided not to go in and get her prescription renewed for her birth control.  I was beyond dismayed.  She's 23, living in a rented house with a roommate, broke, and getting married in two months.  I want to tell her that she has her whole damn life to raise babies... that she should enjoy her husband and travel and live a reckless life before committing to a baby (I have a 6 month old with my husband, so I'm projecting.).  My mother pointed out to me that my sister was much better set up than she herself was when she had her first child (me).  And in thinking about it, my mom was homeless and my father was an abusive drug addict.  No one would advise pregnancy under those circumstances... but here I am, married, a homeowner, with a career, making more than the average American, and a mother to a beautiful baby... hell, I even have rescue dogs and volunteer with a hospice.... What am I worried about?      Actually, this brings up a great one for me: People always tell you that marriage is hard work.  I always imagined they meant that you will fight (and, hey, no problem! I can handle that) but the truth is probably a lot more subtle than that.  Sometimes you feel invisible and taken for granted.  You didn't enter into a partnership in which you will do everything together... you might have married someone who will never want to take that trip or whatever... you need to move beyond what you thought your life would be like.  This has been something of a rough, and altogether different type of hard than I was imagining when I heard about it.   Why exactly am I reacting this way?  It's important when you have anxiety to screen any knee jerk reactions to things for irrationality.  So if I'm putting off making a phone call to a stranger to get catering for an event, I need to recognize that's what I'm doing and talk myself into fixing it.   It used to be "What have I done for my marriage today?"    Just rapping on some theory here: I think the only reason you would cheat emotionally would be because, right or wrong, you feel lonely or disconnected with the people in your life.  It's a human impulse to want to be understood and valued.  Unless you're just curious.  I could see that too.   Assimilation of Native Americans and Internment of Japanese-Americans.   Passive aggression.  Or expecting me to read your mind... we are adults, you use your words!!!!    Yes, some variation on this: Older = Smarter.  This is pure ego on my part, but I feel so cheated when I see through people who should, for all intents and purposes, be better than everyone else, but aren't.  Like when my former boss, the CEO of his third company, tried to manipulate me by relating that we both grew up poor and refused to be victims.... Like, I wanted him to be able to manipulate me without my knowing that was what he was doing... He was all parlor tricks!  Where is the magic!?    I cried for a whole week straight when I started at a call center and realized that there were 50 year olds whose actual aspirations were to continue working their entry level jobs at $8.50/hr and pick on younger people.  Like, no!  Why did you stop growing at 14?! Why did you do that?  Be better!    Right, unless there is more to this scenario, it's perfectly responsible to have a life insurance plan.  I'm guessing that since you're going to grad school, you've already got a huge amount of debt.  If Canada is like the US in that regard, your parents could be saddled with that debt if, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you.  I have taken out term life insurance on my husband (in addition to the insurance I have on myself) because we have a mortgage and an infant child.  If anything happened to either of us, I wouldn't want my child to lose her home as well as a parent.  Life insurance is just good planning. :)   Quite right, we always make time for the things that are truly important to us.  I sometimes think that I should feel guilty for working full time and then volunteering for six hours at a hospice one day of the weekend, but then I have to remind myself that what I'm doing is making my headspace better so that when I'm with my daughter, I'm the best I can be.    Unfortunately, I don't think it will, you see he had to have a six month probationary period where he had to drive with another licensed driver, but he's married to one... So it wasn't an issue. Initially learning is going to be the tricky part, but I'm sure you could use online videos for the theory of it... Do you think you could maybe offer carpooling? Then in theory, a licensed driver would come to your house, and you would drive the two of you to a location like a school or shop? Or maybe you could look into community education? I took what we call "Behind the wheels" with an instructor that I paid.    Can you tell us what state you live in?  The laws and guidelines vary greatly from state to state.  If not, just say so and I can still help by relaying how my husband got his license at 38. :)   Please, don't take this as nay-saying, but I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention that in the time I was using the Nuvaring, I suffered recurrent yeast infections.  This is not uncommon (14% of women experience it as a side effect according to Google).  I never had this problem prior to the Nuvaring, and I was on it at age 24.  I didn't ever have trouble with it coming out on accident, like the other posters, I took it out during intercourse... it was uncomfortable to leave in during.   Nobody has recommended boric acid yet.  Please Google it before writing it off; this has been immensely helpful to me.  I started getting recurrent infections after using the Nuvaring, even after I switched birth control methods.  A yeast infection has an 80% chance of recurrence, so using anti-biotics is really just a risky band-aid that comes with a hefty medical bill after.  I got 00 size gel caps off of Amazon and a bottle of powdered boric acid.  If I have an infection, I insert two capsules a day (one in the morning, one at night) vaginally.  If you choose to do this, you'll want to use a panty liner.  I also do just a half gel cap after my period or after intercourse just to be safe.  I also use an oral probiotic: Acidophilus.  I get that at Wal-Greens.  I hope things get better for you!       Hmmm. You just described the first feature of "Family Portraits: A Trilogy of America."      This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand.  2. Accept that it could happen.  3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome.    After the sheer hell that was my failure at breastfeeding followed by months of exclusive pumping that lead to three bouts of mastitis and finally Reynauld's syndrome of the nipples, I had to accept that I was going to have to give up.  This process, writing down that I would have more time with my family, get more sleep, feel less pain, focus more on my baby, be happier, etc, helped me move beyond what seemed at first a crushing failure.  This is a major example of when I used this, but as a person who struggles with anxiety about pretty much everything, you can use it to keep things in perspective.    People with anxiety tend to be pretty capable when they know what is coming so thinking "If the meter runs out and I get a ticket, I know I can map the way to court house and that I can afford the ticket.  It will be annoying, but it is not the end of the world," can make a big difference.   Good luck... in reading through your Reddit contributions, you seem like a warm, funny, and intelligent lady.  I'm sure you'll figure things out.  I believe in you!    The fact that you down voted only the reply where I wrongly accused you of being obtuse makes me love you a little bit.  I'm sorry. (I'm being 100% sincere.)   Because I also work in a field where I'm stuck using a stupid style guide and it's updated all the time.  I do think you're being a bit obtuse here, my point still stands, and in fact, you're making it very more to the point... none of it is consistent or organic!     I'm sure they've since been updated.  "Iris" isn't plural, but "Adams" is!   I didn't go, just because I'd gone in 11th grade, so what was the point?  This along with my decision to not go to the all-night grad party or the graduation dinner or the Sno-Ball my senior year are things I regret on a moderate level now.  The truth is that the business of being young is incredibly fleeting, and you never get to go back and do those things again.  Even if they are terrible, they make for even better stories years later.  I spent a lot of my teenage years trying to be a little adult, and that is sad because I'll be an adult for the rest of my life.... you can only be young and do these things now.     The rules are not consistent.  "Mary's" is possessive, "Iris's" is correct, but "Iris'" isn't, even though "the cars'" would be if you mean more than one car that possesses something... meanwhile "it's" can only be "it is," with "its" being possessive, being at odds with everything I just wrote out for you above.  It is any wonder at all that people get confused?       You know what I love about this question?  It assumes that people don't have a 'type,' that they don't act like John Wayne Gacy and only pick victims that are tall, thin, and have shaggy blond hair.    Lack of "whole foods" meaning food that hasn't been chemically modified or otherwise messed with.  Putting a damn window in a chicken coop doesn't make the chickens in it "free range."  There is a reason why we have so many dietary issues in the US.  30+ flavors of pop tarts doesn't help.   I liked the graphic novel "Black Hole" by Charles Burns.    And even the reason we have the right to bear arms!   Every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it.   This is what I'm talking about!!!! THAT IS IRONIC.  It's ironic!  Why, why would you assume there would be a non-smoking rule in the smoking room?  That is the opposite of what you would expect!    How about things we have to see often:  "Just in case you thought Memorial Day was about barbecues" - Oh yeah, I totally have met that person who talks about today as national hotdog day.  That's a thing that happens! /sarcasm  "Why don't we have White History Month?" - I'm sorry, what do you think we're studying the other 11 months of the year?  "It's time we stopped apologizing for being American." - The person going door to door in Iowa demanding you drag our great nation through the mud has failed to come to my house.  "Like if you support drug testing for food stamps" - Guess what! Drug dealers don't typically accept food stamps for drugs, but you know who does take food stamps? Grocery stores. You can use the food stamps to feed the children who didn't ask to be born to the drug addicts.  You know, the ones whose food money was spent on drugs.   You know, I thought the big dissension about this song was very presumptuous.  The argument that things were "unfortunate" instead of "ironic" assumes that she didn't expect an opposite outcome.  I don't think it's a stretch to assume your wedding day would be perfect, or that on a single plane ride, you would be safe.  Am I crazy?   Just follow their sentence that ended in "sir" with a soft, non-aggressive "ma'am."  You know, correct them in a quiet sort of way.  Unless they're totally not listening, they'll apologize profusely.  I've got a bit of experience with this having done phone work. I hope this helps you. :)   Respond in a nearly inaudible voice so that if they want to hear what you have to say, they have to pipe the fuck down. ;)  I'd make it a rule not to acknowledge behavior you don't appreciate.    "Lucky Now" by Ryan Adams.  Why did he choose to not repeat the chorus after the last verse?  I love that song, but at 2 minutes and 30 odd seconds, you can't put it on repeat. :)   It is a word that can be applied to denote a situation that has opposite outcome of what one would expect.    I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you read my response as the fear being my own.  It is not.  One thing I'm learning is that people are conscious of their own memory loss and disconcerted by it.  I don't fear my own death or degenerative brain disorder.  I'm acting to try to alleviate the pressure these patients feel to remember things.  They don't really need to bother.  It's irrelevant.      Cinnamon Rolls and Chili! :)  	101
 How to play sion: ignore everything your team says and farm solo top for the first 30-40 minutes of the game, then show up late to a team fight use your ultimate to heal all of your teammates, get the ace, then push to win and kill anything that gets in your way. This guide only works if your team doesn't feed.   I love your songs so much. Since seeing your cypher I have heard most of your songs, please keep making them.   I agree Kat is not UP, I play her most of the time, and do good a lot with her, and almost always win my lane. If she gets fed early, she is very hard to stop unless you have hard CC, but even then if she is built she can be a problem for the other team.  	3
 I just noticed that Waino is starting for the Cardinals today. That's HUGE!    Also meaning Volquez would pitch a potential 163rd game against St. Louis if it's needed.    I parlayed ATL with PIT.   I've been a fan of the sport for a while, but I never had a club team that I felt attached to, which kept me from really getting into it. Republic FC Is my team now. Looking forward to many more great seasons ahead (hopefully in MLS).    Sad news everyone. Someone broke into the LA Dodgers trophy case last night. The thieves were last seen fleeing the stadium carrying a blue carpet.    A Dodgers fan doesn't understand what "World Series" means. Sounds about right.       Can we get a gif of Amy G getting sprayed in the face? I, uh, need it...for stuff.    You mean you almost ji22ed.    **St. Louis Cardinals ML** vs Arizona Diamondbacks    St. Louis is clinging to a one game lead in the division going into the final series of the season, so they still have a lot to play for. Arizona has all but given up. Michael Wacha is pitching for the Cardinals and I think he'll have a good game.    We're on fire right now. Yesterday's potd, Metallurg Magnitogorsk -1.5, hit, which makes three correct picks in a row. Let's keep it going!      RULES    No picks that are favorite by more than -200     No parlay or teaser bets, single bets only, prop bets are fine     Please include what sport you are talking about in your pick     Pick with most points at the end of voting is our pick of the day    I've been a Giants fan for 15 years, but Derek Jeter has been a constant in baseball for as long as I can remember. This is kind of like saying goodbye to a part of my childhood.    Trying to stay optimistic here:   1. We're still in great position to win the wild card.   2. The goal of the game is to win the World Series, not the division. We're still up 2-0 on the Dodgers there.    Kershaw looks like Sunshine from Remember the Titans.    Andrew Susac is the go ahead run...the next time through the order.    His arm has been thrown out for 2 years.    The joke is on you. You can't clinch if the game never ends.    Bochy might as well ask if any Giants fans in the crowd can throw strikes.    I'm assuming if you have $749 to spend on Candlestick seats, you also have a man cave to put them.    I should win a Cy Young...   What is Uribe's walk up song? It's catchy.   I once bought a growler of IPA from Stone. The woman working there said I should drink it within 48 hours of opening it. I decided to drink all 74 ounces in one night. Big mistake.    You have to finish your 6 pack by tomorrow. You can't have a San Diego beer in the fridge during a Padres series.    This really has been a great season for the rivalry. There's a perfect combination of fear, respect and hatred for each team.    [How Arias feels in the dugout right now]( http://i.imgur.com/3leLBzY.gif)   Slightly above the mean^for ^^a ^^^white ^^^^guy   I'm guessing we want the lefty-righty matchup with Kershaw against Arias.    I'm betting on a lot of baseball games on Thursday, it's hard to pick just one potd. I'll go with the **Giants/Padres under 6.5**. The Giants have not been hitting the ball well lately and the Padres haven't hit the ball well all year. On top of that, Andrew Cashner is pitching for San Diego. He shut down SF last week. Yusmeiro Petit has been one of the most consistent pitchers for the Giants over the last month and a half.    My other picks for the day are **DET ML**, **MIL ML**, **WAS ML** and, **TB/BOS over 8.5**.   We have a two day win streak going as yesterday's potd, the Angels ML, hit. Let's go for three!    It got scary in the late innings, but the Angels hang on. Good call on this one.    That's what happens when you meet girls at Wagner-fest.    If he goes 3, then Lincecum will come in, which probably means another run or two.    In the last week, the only two Giants hitters who have shown any consistency are Gregor Blanco and Joe Panik. Posey, Sandoval, Pence, Belt, Crawford and Perez look lost.    Edit: I considered the over 6. Hudson's last start against LA he didn't retire a batter in the second inning. He looked bad against the Padres last time out too. The problem I have with the over 6 is that he's going to be on a short leash. He won't be in the game long enough to allow 6 runs. On top of that, Kershaw is pitching for LA.    Edit: Decided to parlay Dodgers ML and over 6.     I like the value of the **Chicago White Sox** ML. Chris Sale is pitching against Verlander. I think the Sox at +108 has good potential.    Hudson's been getting rocked for a month now. This is a safe bet, but my book has LA at -250 right now, so the pay out isn't enough for me, a Giants fan, to bet against my own team.    For the Giants, that's been the case for close to two weeks. Even when Bum hit his homerun, the dugout wasn't nearly as excited as they should have been.    This is a frustrating team to watch right now. There's no energy.    Yes, but we can't afford to have him hit like this while he figures it out. These games are too important.    Right now we have offensive black holes at 1st base and left field. We'll have to figure that out by next week.    0-2 count in a one run ballgame against your biggest rival? Time for the wave!   I've honestly seen nothing but respect for Vin in r/sfgiants.     I honestly believe that Curt Schilling only has a job with ESPN because they feel bad that he went broke and then got cancer.    [We know how good he is ;-)](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/10252010/15826076/250x350_Uribe.jpg)   Maybe the most satisfying home run of the year.    Little do you know, there are world series trophies in that garbage can.    I thought I saw him pull up limp as he hit first too.    Puig got hit in the first. Words were exchanged, benches were warned.    Hopping on the bandwagon to lose in the first round once every 3 years?    Does anyone know for sure if the benches were warned after that HBP?    Puig knows he couldn't take Bum. It would be like a kid getting beat up by his dad.    Am I crazy or does Carl Crawford get an usual number of rest days? Is there a reason for that? He's on fire this month, but it seems like he's out of the lineup for half of the Dodgers game I've watched recently.    The reason I keep coming to this subreddit is because there's always a pick of the day that is two teams I've never heard of, in a sport I don't watch, in a league I've never heard of. I love putting a bet on Japanese level II women's soccer and waking up to some money. Warms my heart.    We got back on track on Tuesday with the Kansas City Royals ML. They won 7-1 Let's extend the streak to two.    My 5 team parlay was in tact going into the CAR/PIT game last Sunday. I thought the Panthers were a sure thing, but they totally blew it for me.    I'm on board with this as well. Good pick.    Me too. And that thought made me sick. I think what's so great about the rivalry right now is that there's a mutual fear of each other's team.    Off the top of my head, I can't remember a more exciting game. LA has so many guys with power, I was certain one of them would hit a walk off homer. That was pure torture for 4+ hours, but I loved every second of it.    He couldn't have picked the ball up and placed it in Butera's glove any better. Incredible!    It's a good thing they won, because I don't think I could have handled a loss. See you all tomorrow night, boys and girls.    Auburn checking in. He went to Jesuit.    Susac was held at third, but Blanco didn't notice and went for the triple. When he finally saw that third wasn't open he was in a pickle. When the Dodgers tried to get him, Susac ran home.    Crawford channeling his inner Chris Dominguez with that throw.    Puig could not have walked the ball to home plate and placed it in Butera's glove in a better position than that throw. Amazing.    Is there any doubt that this is the best rivalry in baseball right now? Yankees/Red Sox hasn't been exciting for a few years.    This is the rivalry at its best. I love it, ^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it   The Giants have 9 hits and the Dodgers have 3 errors. This game is being handed to us. We just need to take it.    You didn't think anyone would know who the greatest of all time is?    #RedMamba    This is the Giants/Dodgers rivalry at its best. I love it^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it   If he had held Belt there, we would have been freaking out on him too. Literally the only way Belt is out at home is if Puig's throw is perfect, and it was.    I don't see a better option at 3rd unfortunately.    Too much butter, not enough finger.    I like the hustle.   Look at those empty seats behind home plate. Disgraceful!    Free baseball!!!   Instructions for Dodgers fans.    Good morning ^good ^afternoon ^^good ^^night   We liked him when his schtick was new and exciting, but I think most of us were tired of defending him by the time he left.    The only thing bigger than Brian Wilson's ego is his era.    This pitcher looks like he's about to join ISIS.   Last week of the season, Bottom 7, one on against your most hated rival. Better do the wave!    There's a free version, but you only get a limited number of skips per hour and you can't select which song you listen to, only the artist/album.   I pay $10/month to be able to listen any song at any time. You can get a free trial to see if it's worth it. I even got a 3 month's for the price of one deal when I signed up.    Good morning^goodafternoon^^good night   Edit: Fuck it! I don't know how to format.    Your mom took her shirt off?!!   Your rock hard Peavy is giving me a Peavy.    What should we do? Cry about it?    That's frustrating as fuck when that happens in Road to the Show. It's got to be even worse in real life.    I think any intentional HBPs are dumb. It's hard to say definitively that that was intentional though.    Matt Kemp was distracted wondering how Rihanna dumped him for Chris Brown.    Kemp called it. That one's on Puig.    I'm assuming there's bad traffic getting to the game.    Jake Peavy looks like he could have been an Irish bare knuckle boxer a hundred years ago.    I like the value of the **KC Royals** ML. They're the underdog and they're playing a team with a nearly identical record, but they have a better pitcher pitching. I think they're worth a bet.     I also like the **under 6** on the **Dodgers/Giants** game. Bumgarner has absolute ownage against the Dodgers in his career. Greinke is pitching for LA and the Giants haven't been hitting lately. It might also be worth putting a unit on the Giants ML. They're underdogs, but I think there's good value there.    What happened to the user who usually posts the potd thread?    I think this is the safest MLB bet of the day. St. Louis is a better team and they have their best pitcher pitching.   I got tired of my usual workout music. I had always been a fan of certain songs on The Dark Knight Rises score because they made made feel like Batman training in a prison cell, so I set out to find equally motivating music. I took mainly from the work of Hans Zimmer (TDKR, TDK, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, Man of Steel, Inception, The Lone Ranger), but there are a few other artists in the playlist. It's mostly upbeat, but has the occasional slower pace, which makes the eventual build up even more epic and motivational.     Give it a listen and let me know what you think. Tell me if there's a song I should add to or remove from the list. I'm by no means knowledgeable about this kind of music, so I'm sure there are plenty of awesome songs that I don't know about.     [Here is the finished product]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7). I hope it serves you well.   It's kind of late and no one has posted a potd thread yet, so I'll do it.    As you can see, my picks thus far are 12-1-1 against the spread   Wow, this guy *is* pretty good.     That puts me at a total of 17-12-1 so far this year     Oh...   Is this the only nationally televised morning game? Usually Fox will have one, but they don't.    I made a parlay bet that the Angels would win and more than 7 1/2 runs would be scored. Help a Giants fan out, will you halos?    Edit: Atta team.    I broke my own rule of not betting on games I'm emotionally invested in. I took the under 6 on this game. I have that much faith in Petit. ^And ^that ^little ^faith ^in ^our ^offense   I can't find an email about it and I can't redeem it on the app. Has anyone besides OP been successful? Maybe it has to be done on a pc.    Edit: Can't find it on my computer either. Maybe it expired?    I'm down to go out in Roseville most nights. We should meet up.    Posey has 15 RBIs in his last 15 games. That's second best in the league for the month of September.    If Timmy pitches well tonight, I say we start him for Hudson next week in LA.    His smile is so smug. You can tell he's proud of his idea.    [Broken bat Kuiper]( http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2013/0904/mlb_kuiper_kh_200.jpg)   Pretty smokey in the mornings in Auburn too.   	108
 I think it's great. The laughs all come from how horrible of a person Merchant is and a whole lot of horribly awkward / cringeworthy situations. Give it a shot.         The gif of Jennifer Lawrence making out with Amy Adams WILL make the front page.   /r/contagiouslaughter   No they won't.

Woah...when did this guy de-fat himself?   /r/justiceporn   On the other hand, I met Macklemore in the NBA store in NYC two or three days ago. Dude seemed really sad and didn't say a word as I asked for a picture. Made me feel like a bit of an asshole for asking although I've been a huge fan for a while. He was all alone and looked tired as shit.    Please tell me that was some kind of essay you had already written and not just a reddit comment.    Goddammit.

He used to be full of cringe and bullshit. He would make videos where he drank two bottles of vodka with no hands in 45 seconds and crazy stuff like that, and then he would upload videos saying he would never upload a drinking video again, swearing on his mother's grave. Then he would upload two more and delete the last video. Also he ran for that "KingOfTheWeb" thing where the winner would get some cash prize, and Shoenice had a smear campaign where he would trash the people who were beating him (usually teenaged make-up gurus), and he would encourage his fans to cheat and make multiple accounts to vote for him, and then he freaked out when he was banned. I used to message back and forth arguing with him and he would constantly lie and brag about his YouTube money and how he was so much better than me because he was making his living eat glue on street corners for YouTube.

So this works within the steam version of the game? Are you able to do other things while this is running or are you stuck in that active window like you're typical auto clicker? Thanks.   Does this also do ascensions to farm souls? Would love if you posted this script. I've been using a simple auto clicker, can't find any script that works with the steam version of this game unfortunately. (Just started playing a couple days ago).   OMG.

 I was looking around the archive for scottgames.com and noticed that theres been alot of recent saves of the hat.jpg picture which usually means its been changed. It could just be something else of course and im not going to take my time to brighten each and everyone one of them.    Also the bad ending has golden freddys head in the background,while the good ending doesn't.   Ill delete this post, then.   Oh, sorry. I didn't see.   We all know that Golden Freddy Appears in the fnaf3 stage01 minigame since you play as him. The file dump for fnaf3 was recently released with the sound files and textures. While looking through the textures i found this guy (its #290 if you want to look for yourself) So, where do you guys think he is. Its transparent so he probably belongs somewhere unless scott removed him. Anyone seen him yet?   Yeah but there's sort of a dead body inside of it. You'd think the person buying it would've noticed.  	6

Then there's some other thing called YogDiscovery which I've only found out about, apparently yogscast want indie devs to come to them, they'll make videos of the game and depending on how many views the video gets, and how many sales the game gets, yogscast will take a percentage of the profits from the devs.    that's a literary technique though  	76
 I just finished "Stranger in a Strange Land". A popular science fiction novel from the sixties, this delves into a deep examination of what we value in a western culture, particularly in regards to religion and sexuality.  More importantly, this book is funny. There's humor enriched in all the pages, and makes reading it a genuinely enjoyable experience.   After reading intense and complicated sci-fi, I chose this as a light option. I ended doing a serious examination about what my values are how people view things in western (especially American) society.  I'd suggest looking up some of the tremendous quotes from this book on a site like Goodreads, see if you find any intriguing, you may want to pick it up.      It took several moments for her words to register in his brain. The waves of adrenaline and euphoria hadn't finished passing over him. The knife...had he plunged it into a handbag my mistake? Certainly he felt the comforting sensation of cool metal sliding into that bloated sack of blood dangling off of her skeleton. Malcolm made efforts to maintain his natural steadfast, intimidating state, yet his face could not untwist itself from puzzlement.  "Take out the blade", she said softly. A whisper, drowned out by the wind as if not a  note had escaped her lips yet words he heard clear as crystal in his head. Her grey eyes piercing so deep into his own, it felt as if she was gazing at the entirety of his life.  Malcolm strained and sweated as he found himself gripping the chaffed, ribbed bronze hilt. Hot. More than hot, scalding. His eyes bulged with terror as he found himself tightly grasping and removing the scalding metal. Tendrils of smoke appeared above his hand. Nothing to hear but his heartbeat. Loud and hot. Nothing to see but her eyes. Grey and sharp. Drips of melted skin began to smack the pavement below.  The knife left her belly, a gaping wound left smoking, staring up at him.  "Now balance the scale", she commanded.  There was an instant, an instant after those words were uttered that he knew he was about to perish. An instant of complete terror, and a juvenile absence of any form of understanding. When that moment had passed the blade leapt from his fingertips and dug itself deep into his throat. Indeed, choosing this woman in particular to mug was a poor evaluation.  The woman stared down at the corpse, and drank in a deep gulp of icy, bloodfilled air, "I can't help but enjoy these moments", she mused. A faint grin crept along the side of her mouth. She decided to continue her stroll throughout the park.   Wouldn't offering to work for free be the most efficient way to get practice early on? Especially if OP is doing this as a hobby rather than trying to get by, he/she can probably afford a few free contracts.

Twixt was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen.    The scene I'm referring to is where Mcnulty is sitting in his car drunk. He's on top of a hill, some kind of commotion happens at the bottom of it and causes a car alarm to go off. He gets out, shows his badge, and slips and slides down the hill because he's so hammered. Then proceeds to start laughing when he sees mud on his badge and the obvious metaphor.  Anyway, there's a oldie playing in his car, sung by a woman- can't for the life of me think of the song. Can't remember the episode or season or I'd try to find it myself. Hope I gave a decent description and one of you can help me out. Thanks all.

I always end up reading about these games when they initially show up, and are naturally surrounded by a lot of hype. "This is going to be a tremendous RPG just like it was in the glory days!".

Going to some small classes is a great idea. I've almost exclusively done yoga by myself, and having an instructor critique me on my form would be quite valuable.

EDIT: Words   Why don't you just dump her?   I say this with the New York Giants in mind, but obviously this question could be in the context of many teams this year.   It's quite a popular opinion that Kevin Gilbride, their Offensive coordinator, needed to leave a long time ago.

There's going to be four of us total at my friends house and was looking for any suggestions your guys may have. Here are some ideas we're tossing around right now:  1) dressing up in old Halloween costumes  2) laying out paper/crayons/markers and partake in some arts n crafts  3) playing music throughout surround sound (not sure what to choose, possibly a medley of nature sounds, classical, funk, jazz)  Love to know what you all think! Thanks!   Think about how difficult it is to scout a player. You have to look at someone when they're 17 and determine who they will be when they're 26. Try doing that in any profession or school of thought. All of these guys have great athletic talent- imagine the enormous process of evaluating all the other factors that will affect these people not just as football players but as men. If anything they're going to be wrong MOST of the time. Every pick is a gamble. Something you just have to accept.   2011 week 14 against the Giants. At this point, both teams were in the hunt for the division. Basically the Giants were down 12 points with time expiring. They score their first touchdown. In order to have a shot at scoring their second, they need the Cowboys to go 3 and out on the next drive in order to leave enough time on the clock. On 3rd and long, Romo had a completely wide open Miles Austin who is just running with his hands up to Romo's right, around 15 yards down the field. Romo then lobs it about another 15 yards ahead of him into dead space. Giants go on to win the game.   Personally I think Romo is a great QB that gets way too much shit- simply a product of being on the Cowboys. He dug himself into a hole early in his career by embracing his celebrity status, but I think at this point he's moved past it. This is a guy that made a 4th quarter comeback with a punctured lung and several broken ribs- someone like that will always have my respect.  EDIT: Wording   When he spends his playoff BYE week in Mexico with Jessica Simpson.   The winners in this were the attorneys on both sides collecting fees for 8 months.   "This just in: the Washington Redskins have traded their 2015 and 2016 first round picks to the Green Bay Packers in a trade for Matt Flynn."   Stop being a pussy and get a divorce.   Bill Bryson has put out a lot of great work- I'd recommend browsing his other books online and seeing if anything catches your interest. This is assuming it's the style/voice he uses that made you like it so much.  As far as more on the topics of that book? Definitely A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and Cosmos by Carl Sagan.  'A Short History of Nearly Everything' is a fantastic read, glad you enjoyed it. I read it a while back, and about a week ago bought the Audible version of it. Every time I hit the gym now I have this great british voice babbling to me about atoms and stardust. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great audio book, you can pick it up at any point in the narrative and immediately find things interesting.   He's 100% starting, he just might not be that effective.   I'd definitely roll with Amendola in that one.   Standard Scoring. Please pick two: Jordan Cameron vs Bears, Charles Clay vs Patriots, Danny Amendola vs Dolphins, Chris Ivory vs Panthers.   Cocaine's a helluva drug.   Just keep in mind that he has a tweaked ankle and doesn't have his quarterback. He's a risky plau even with the start.   S Jax and Vereen are definitely the best out of that group.   TOUGH- you've got to go Alfred here. That's the smart move. But the ballsy move that might make you win a playoff game? That's starting Spiller. I'd roll high risk/high reward on this one.   Out of that group, Forte is both the better back AND part of the better offense. He's your man. My second choice would be Vereen, however that Patriots offense is simply too unpredictable to trust in a playoff game.   Standard Scoring, choose 1: DeAngelo Williams, Donald Brown, and Chris Ivory.    Standard Scoring, choose 1: DeAngelo Williams, Donald Brown, and Chris Ivory.  I'd love roll with Ivory, but I'm terrified of that matchup against Carolina. As of now I have Donal Brown starting, but I'm convinced he's going to put up another dud. Thoughts?  Thanks for doing this, you're helping out a lot of peeps and dish out some great insight.   Very impressive. Congrats, man.   Are you really just going to ignore what each of those receivers has done the past few weeks?  As for Miami having good CB's- look what Pittsburg did to them last week.    Call the police on her. She's guilty of almost every count of child abuse out there.   Gahhhdamn that's impressive.   I'm going to say Amendola. I think he's finally going to be as effective as was hoped in the preseason. Gronk out, and the defense honing in on Edelman and Vereen- I think this is his day.   Or he get's tackled on the second play of the game and explodes into a cloud of dust.  What do you guys think?   Edelman by a mile. He's been outstanding the past three weeks, and with Gronk out he'll only get more opportunities.  Nelson is utterly useless without Rodgers.   There's many similarities between the two. You learn a TON about the samurai and the culture that surrounds them. If these subjects interest you- this must be read. Imagine all the information that would be stocked into a textbook on this subject, you learn all of that in a completely passive enjoyable way, since it is all done while partaking in this amazing adventure. Book is a tomb but don't be intimidated- you'll want it to last as long as possible.   Pierre Thomas. Keep a close eye on news following Ridley though, if he's due for a larger number of snaps I'd give it to him.   Cotchery   Tavon Austin.   Rainey without question.   If it's just 1? I'd go Garcon. They're likely going to be behind and throwing a lot that game into a soft defense.  If you need two out of that...I'd have to roll with Edelman. he's been outstanding the last few weeks, and with Gronk out he should only sap up more targets.   Standard Scoring please pick 2:  Charles Clay vs Patriots  Jordan Cameron vs Bears  Danny Amendola vs Dolphins  Cheers   Sales!  Just kidding. Something you could do part time is customer support. Now I know this goes against what you just said- you'd be interacting with strangers. But I think this would be a more comfortable environment for you, and more importantly would help you overcome your fear of interacting with people.   EDIT: Spelling/Grammar   Growlanser has items you can purchase towards the end of the game that de-level your character but let them retain the same stats. Problem is there really isn't much end-game material, nothing challenging enough to beef up your guys for.   Try putting this in /r/writing.

 Hm.. hard to pick just 1... I think that trader joes' dark chocolate peanut butter cups are darn delicious.  Their cookie butter dark chocolate bars are addicting too.  Then there's chocomize where you can add whatever.  I like their premade salty bar.  Kit kats are bomb, and so are almond snickers.  I'm hungry... can you tell? Hahahahah   Lol I can totally relate.  My dreams are always vivid so all of the cheating ones still make me mad.  Scumbag brain.. Hahahah   I'm not sure if that has anything to do with your child having autism...   That happened to my husband a week ago!  He was still upset for a few days after :D  I was kinda flattered that I was so slutty in his dream, since usually it's the other way around in my dreams. Lol      Please clean it after with alcohol or something.... pleaseeeeeee   It's the same opinion I have for straight parents... If you can afford to raise the child, aren't insane, loving, then go for it!   I have no idea how anyone can be against gays.  Look at how cute he is!   His left hand looks way bigger than his right? I have no idea...I was never good at those "find what's wrong with this picture" games :(   Henry Cavill.  We were at the Immortals premiere and I saw him take photos with female fans in the theater.  So I gathered up my courage, walked over, and asked if he would take a photo with me... Well he turned around, took a look at me, and said " oh they are going to start  the movie" then went back to chatting with the hot girls.  I guess my t-shirt, jeans, and glasses wasn't very cute :( *edited to remove typo   Omg I'm freaking out.  I love flight of the conchordsssssss. :D   He doesn't seem very impressed...   A whole new world! I get very into it when I sing that song.   I like the Lindsay Lohan one where she played Hermione after hitting puberty.  Hilarious!     You've met some terrible terrible cats.  You're really missing out!    I love thissssss!! Lol   But cardio is cardio lol.  And i'm sure his heart rate is crazy high.   I'm scared.. but.. I didn't like Firefly... :(   You would think that with skills like that he'd be super lean.   Omg!!!  My fear definitely started after movies started showing the impact from within the car.  The worst for me was from the movie Adaptation.  Did not see that coming.     It has to be Ginuwine's Pony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJoQgixtR78   "I love to travel, go to nice restaurants, and shop.  I don't know why people don't spend money to buy nice clothes and accessories. " The girl lived in her in-law's converted garage with her husband. They spent all of their earnings on luxuries.  I wanted to strangle her.   Getting into a car accident.  I picture it in my head sometimes while I'm in a car.  Horrible :(   Exactly!  It's like a deep deep exfoliation session hahaha   He likes to lick my face... and just so happened to get my eye when I took the picture.      Aww I want to kiss those cheeks!!!    Thank you so much for your help.  Sucuri definitely found malware on my blog but when I went into my posts, I couldn't find any lines of text that seemed out of place.  I emailed my hosting to see if they could help but no reply yet.   Beautiful photograph!  We don't have an attatched garage so our dog stands outside of the restroom when I go in to use it ....    aw he loves it!  My whippet hates bananas.. lol   Hi guys, today is the 2nd time my wordpress blog has been redirecting to a porn website when you read it on a mobile device.  I've changed my admin password, I always update my plugins and wordpress versions.. and this still happened to me.  What else can I do?  Thank you so much!  Thank you for your help.   No problem!  Here's a list of bonfires in southern california http://www.beachcalifornia.com/beach-bonfires-california.html .  I love doing beach days though it might get crowded in July.  No bonfires but Venice Beach is always fun.  Other fun stuff would be hiking to the Griffith Observatory http://www.yelp.com/biz/griffith-observatory-hike-los-angeles or http://www.yelp.com/biz/runyon-canyon-park-los-angeles-2 if you want to catch some celebrities.  Tons of girly stuff to do here in LA.  I hope you gals have a great time :D   TV Anchors that just lose it or SNL cast members/guests that break character.   Hi!  Not sure what your exact budget is, but I would go to travelzoo or groupon and check out some of the deals they have for hotel or group activites.  Temecula (lots of wine tastings here) is only 90 minutes from LA so you can still party at a club on a day and checkout some orchards on another.  Another lower cost option would be hanging out at the beach for the day for a picnic/bbq and stay for a bonfire at night.  Cheap and fun!  Hope that helps :D   I really love Dog Haus!  It's affordable, delicious, and I love the relaxed vibe.  My favorite location is their Pasadena Biergarten one :D   Lol I am not a girl with a big butt but I remember being surprised at how much bounce I was getting.  The even more embarassing part was that there were people in front of me and I felt like a bowling ball.  Kind of like that chubby black kid in Hook.   Was touring a newly built 15 million dollar home while wearing a pair of booties over my shoes on a newly installed/waxed wooden spiral staircase.  My life flashed before my eyes as I started to bounce down the steps on my butt.  First thing I said when I stood up was "omg did I break the stairs?".  I did not want to pay to fix a staircase that was put into a home that expensive lol.   You were 2??? Ehhh I'm so old.. Lol   Watching Interview with a Vampire while lying on the floor leaning against the ottoman... while my dog is on the couch all tucked in with a blanket.   End of the Road = Junior High.  Basically anything Boyz II Men Makes me feel young again...   Mexican pizza from Taco Bell.  The only time it actually tastes delicious.  	41
    It depends, if it is a large order than yes, because I am responsible for making sure that every thing comes out properly, boxing it up, and getting the other stuff like silverware, to go drinks etc., but even on a large order 10% is considered the standard. On a small order (2 or less meals) no tip required but leaving a dollar or two is always appreciated.    I've lived with a few male roommates, for the most part they are a bit messier than the girls I lived with, but had less drama so fair trade in my book. Some girls are crazy as fuck.   When I was 13 I had a friend who was form Vietnam, she had been in the US since she was 6 months old so she spoke english fluently. Her parents however spoke very little English. One night we were at he house and these guys we went to school with were all having a sleep over a couple blocks away, we decided to sneak out of the house and go hang out with the boys, after a few hours we needed to get back to the house and the guys walked us home to make sure we got there alright. When we climbed back through the window her dad woke up and thought someone was breaking into the house he called 911, and then busted in her door with a shotgun. He saw me and his daughter fully dressed sitting on her bed and a group of boys running away from the house, the cops then showed up. My friends dad told them they could leave and it was a misunderstanding. He then called my mom and told her I  was a "bad girl" and she needed to pick me up. While we were waiting for my mom he gave lecture about how dangerous it was to sneak out and to spend time with boys who could rape us. He would lecture for a few minuets then my friend would translate his words. When my mom showed up it came across like he was trying to blame us sneaking out on me ( I am not sure if he was truly trying to blame me or if it was his limited vocabulary). My mom then blamed him for not keeping a better eye on us. My friend and I weren't allowed to hang out anymore after that. That was almost 15 years ago and we are still best friends today.    I love my job, it is the most challenging, and rewarding thing I have ever done. It pushes me to be a better person every day because I want to be better for my students every day. I  have kids tell me their darkest secrets and I am always happy to try and help them sort out what is going on in their life. I do enjoy my content area, but it pales in comparison to the students and how they touch my life. You are going into one of the most important professions in society, for some students you will be one of the only good role models they have, one of the only adults they trust, you will be able to push them to expand their mind, they will love you and because of that they will be willing to at least try to do the work. Do everything out of love, even when kids get in trouble, explain why the rules are important for everyone to follow so that the classroom is safe and that the punishments are their for the same reason . I very rarely yell, I find it is much more effective to talk to students in the hall way if we are having issues then to just jump to a detention. Often times kids still get the punishment but we have had the opportunity to talk about why they got it and how to change the behavior in the future . There is a ton of paper work , and there are law makers who come up with systems that make no since to educators , but fuck them. I love my job every day and I will do the paper work and deal with the shitty things because I am tankful to get to do my passion every day and have impact on the next generation. Best of luck to you.     He explained the similarities in his interview, he eventually became a manager and said it was very similar to managing a classroom , and that is why he was so successful at it. Just some things to consider before making the switch, pros the money is much better, their are certain perks that come with the job(company trips, nice dinners, and networking ), the down side its that every year is like your first year of teaching, my dad worked 70 hours a week most weeks. The company sets your sales goals and they always expect you to keep inflating sales even if the market is saturated. Another thing to consider is that in recent years drug companies have come under scrutiny and therefor aren't allowed to do a lot of the things that used to make the job fun ( bring doctor offices lunch, take doctors to see speakers , take nurses out to dinner ect) there is a lot less fluff than their used to be. My dad worked for the company for 20 years and has a nice retirement. My mom still works for a different drug company (she was also a former teacher) she said that now they like to see people with a science back ground, so if you teach any STEM classes I would say you have a good shot, also most drug reps would be happy to let you shadow them one day, to get a better idea of what it is like. My dad said that he missed teaching because of the human factor, a couple years before he retired, he started helping out with high school wrestling because he missed working with kids. hope this was helpful , best of luck to you    I was a bartender before I was a teacher, the best thing about bar tending is you can't take your work home with you. It took me about 3 years to get into a bar position that I really liked, (most busy bars want a few years of experience) but I made amazing friends had a ton of fun, and made damn near close to what I make as a teacher.    I think what set me apart is I have great resume and interview skills. I also dress very well, which seems trivial but getting hired is all about first impressions. One of my friends got hired because they had coached basket ball and the school needed some one to take over JV.  I think it would be unlikely that a school would hire you before student teaching, and honestly you wouldn't want to teach before you student teach. Student teaching is really where you gain most of your skills like classroom management , non instructional routines, and how to handle your work load.  Does your school offer certification before student teaching?   I have always had a theory that most great teachers burn out around 10 years, because teaching is a hammer of a profession and if you are giving it your all, then it isn't sustainable for most people. I admire you for recognizing that you need a change and not becoming one of those teachers who "don't teach" , or takes their anger out on their students. Both my parent were teachers and my dad left after 15 years and became a drug rep. Drug companies like teachers because they are good at learning information , and explaining it. So maybe give that a shot, best of luck to you .    I cater waiter a couple times a week , it is nice to have some extra cash and because I bar tended my way through school it is easy work. I go to the gym a lot, and I volunteer at the suicide hotline. Take some time and go visit family and friends that you haven't seen in a while, often times i am so busy during the year that I don't get to spend much quality time with the ones I love. Hope this helps!   I would suggest that if you haven't started your content area that you look into math, special ed, or science. These areas tend to have more job openings , I received a MAT is secondary social studies and was one of 3 teachers who got hired before the school year started. Most of my grad school friends are subbing or considering going to teach ESL in Asia. If I could do it over I would have gotten a degree in special education.  To answer your second questions most MA programs have student teaching as the last course before you graduate. It is nearly impossible to get hired anywhere without student teaching, even if you have a certificate, most employers want to have an idea of what you are like in the classroom.  hope this is helpful feel free to message me any further questions.   I too had an awful experience with k2 I smoked some after a night of partying with friends ,at first I just felt high then really parinoid, then my thoughts felt completely splintered. I felt absolutely insane I was with friends and didn't want to freak anyone out so I went into the back room and laid in the fetal postion for hours my friends came to check on me I couldn't speak in complete sentences. I was very worried that I had done permanent damage to my brian after 8 hours of feeling like this I started to feel better but it took about a week before I felt normal. K2 is horrible and should never be compared to actual weed.   Freakenomics suggested that part of the reason that crime decreased was because abortions became easily available after Roe V Wade, and because their we less unprepared parents, and everything that can go a long with that (poverty, less education, less resources ) their were less criminals produced. They used statistical information form the US and Romania to show the link between the availability of abortions and crime rates over the next 30 years.       Rule number 1 of being a vegan is bring your own food and bring enough for others to eat. It sucks to get picked on for wanting to live a compassionate life, the way I have handled it is by killing people with kindness. I never expect there to be anything for me to eat unless I am at my house. I keep dried fruit and nuts in my bag at all times just in case I get in a predicament. I very rarely mention to people that I am vegan. If people do know that I am a vegan and ask me a bunch of questions about what I eat I offer to bring them a vegan lunch the next day  a lot of people enjoy it and then asking for vegan options becomes more of a group thing and not just you "being a demanding vegan". I remind my self that becoming a vegan didn't happen overnight for me ,so I can't expect people to understand it overnight.   TL;DR make some allies in the office , make them see veganism differently through your actions. edit :words   I used to work at 24 hour suicide hotline, you would be amazed at the number of calls I would get on an over night where guys were trying to get me to have phone sex or get me to say things that they could jerk it to.    Bald men are sexy, from my experience they have a good since of humor, and are fantastic in bed. Own your bald head, if you wear a hat make sure to take it off at some point when you meet someone for the first time so that they aren't shocked or don't recognize you next time.   I too teach history, you are entitled to your opinion. But it really bothers me when teachers complain about their salary. You knew what you were signing up for and there is more than one way to get paid.    You must not be a history teacher.   I would hypothesize that life expectancy stayed about the same. Slave owners saw their slaves as investments and they wanted to keep them a live as long as possible. After the war the Union controlled much of the government regulation for the first few years, so lynching of freed slaves wasn't very prevalent. Most freed slaves had little education or skills, many became share croppers which is very similar to slavery.    How long some one had left to live , but they couldn't see it and no body could tell them , but every one would know.   When students slack off all quarter and then try and make up 9 weeks worth of work in 2 days , and bullys fuck that shit . I am pretty laid back but if you are rude to me or mean to another student I will bring the reckoning down on you.   It depends on if the gold bricks were redistributed from the gold that already exists or if new gold was some how made. If it was just redistributed and still held its value then it would close some of the income gap. If it was created  then it would become devalued.most likey used for electronics. It would not effect fiat currency , because this money is separate from the value of gold, and the  government it what determines the value. It would proably have a negative effect on any gold based currency   I have a bachelors  and a masters degree both from regular university to get an addional certification in my field I took two online classes , they were no were near as difficult or engaging as the classes I took in a real classroom. I don't feel like I learned as much from them, based on my experience if  someone had a degree that was done completely online , I wouldn't consider their education to be as thorough.    I would say it is not a good first date question, see how it goes maybe you'll hit it off maybe you wont, and if you don't no need to ask. i think most women who aren't trans would be somewhat offended if they were asked , and then you become one of those "worst date ever stories"   What are you contributing, to the causes that you hold dearest to your heart? Made me change my career.   that is an good point   One of my best friends is transgendered, and she feels like it is dehumanizing to ask if she has had surgery to become a woman. She said if you wouldn't ask a non transgendered person about their genitals why is it acceptable to ask her. I also know that she is very open with everyone she dates that she wasn't born in a woman's body. I would get to know the woman if you like her keep dating her and she will probably tell you about it when she is ready. If she isn't trans then you'll most likely find out when the relationship becomes physical. If you aren't cool with dating someone who is trans then maybe you could bring it up in conversation with her and gage her reaction with out straight up asking her. But if you are cool with dating someone who is trans, then just keep dating if things are going well and like most secrets she will tell you when she feels she can trust you. To me it sounds like you find her attractive and like her enough to ask her out again so why are you letting your friend mess with your head ?   what artist would you like to see cover one of your songs?    I was a bartender for a long time , so I've hear pretty much everything but a guy came in one night kept ordering whiskey on the rocks, and then he ordered a red headed slut, I brought him the shot. then he said "I wasn't talking about the shot I was talking about you" and put 200$ down on the bar, and his hotel key. (I guess I should mention I am strawberry blond) Still grosses me out to think about it.   He's running a marathon, I follow a blogger who snapped this photo. Here is the link with an interview with the guy pictured for those interested.  http://trexrunner.com/2012/11/27/i-found-him/   There are plenty of intellectuals who smoke. I have a masters and most of the people in my career field are well in formed educated people. Most of us smoke weed in moderation. We hang out, cook dinner, play music, talk about societies issues, and laugh really hard about silly things. It can be a great tool to unwind and relax with friends. I completely agree that stoners, like any one who abuses a substance give it a stigma that I wouldn't want to associate with either.   tl;dr find cool people to smoke with instead of stoners edit typo   I went to college, got a masters, interned and volunteered in related fields, ...then I accidentally on purpose let my boss see my boobs . I shattered the fuck out of the glass ceiling with my boobs       fetch  	35
 This girl liked me on okcupid, so I checked her profile out and she was great. Looked like she knew what she was doing in life, was really beautiful and we had a few likes in common. So I message her and no luck. Similar things have happened with 3 girls in the past night alone. I try not to get hung up in one person, but it's sometimes so confusing. Do you guys/girls have any messaging tips?    Well this outbreak has been going on almost year long and it just became news recently. Yeah you're right though.   It isn't. The genetic code is 97% similar, but I haven't seen many places refer to it as the ebola strain. That doesn't change anything I said though.    I said there is a very small chance it would spread to someone through a sneeze. If someone sneezed directly on you that's different. If you're in a room with someone who has ebola and they sneeze, you have a small chance of catching it. What I said was not false information.    Yeah I think you're right, but I wouldn't suggest being in contact with much urine regardless haha.  It's really good that people are aware this is happening now, but more people need to understand how little of a risk first world nations face.    Healthcare workers get infected because they aren't always trained up to first world standards in Africa. Some of the doctors are great over there some of them aren't. Ebola patients require 24/7 monitoring and are often stressful patients to work with. A lot of them get sick because they don't always properly clean rooms or isolate patients. If this were a flu you should be slightly worried. Ebola is held to mainly villages and quite frankly village people can't afford to fly over to the US or any first world nation. I wouldn't even be worried if I was working in Penn station. Now my knowledge of this is limited to my schooling. I'm going to school hoping to work for the CDC when I graduate so I only know this from what I've read and learned. I have 0 hands on experience with ebola. It does sound like an experimental cure has been very successful down in Atlanta. Avoid bodily fluids and you will be fine. What I've learned is to get people educated on the disease they're worried about and get them away from ignorance. Ebola isn't a big risk.   That's good because you can literally worry yourself sick. I'm glad I can help! Stay healthy!    There is a very little chance it would. It isn't a respiratory illness so there's a very small chance of that. If there is blood in the sneeze, it's a little higher of a chance if the blood touches you. I wouldn't worry about a sneeze. If someone pisses on you, shits on you, bleeds on you or vomits on you be worried. It really only spreads to family members, village members and health care workers. If you see anyone who looks like they have the flu, avoid them. Which I think is just common sense. Ebola starts off with flu like symptoms, then progresses rapidly. Don't worry about ebola unless you've come into contact with someone from west Africa or someone who just came from west Africa if they are sick. Very little reason to be worried. I cannot stress that enough.   The way it spreads shouldn't worry someone unless you eat bushmeat or are directly caring for someone with ebola. It doesn't spread easily. It's spreading because family members try to care for those infected with ebola. It wouldn't spread much in a developed country. You should only worry about your safety if you're dealing with a sick person who just came from west Africa or was in contact with someone from west Africa. Even if you don't live in a very developed country you shouldn't worry about it. Avoid those who are sick and throwing up. Don't touch urine, blood, saliva, feces and other bodily fluids that aren't your own. There really is no reason to panic about ebola. A flu panic is something that's reasonable in a developed nation. Ebola is not.    Ebola Zaire which isn't responsible for this outbreak kills 90%. This one is 60-70% which is still nasty. A lot of people are freaking out because of how fast it is spreading for an ebola outbreak and how long it is lasting. People jump to ill-advised conclusions that it might be airborne now, but it's surely not. The outbreak would be larger than it is now. This outbreak is spreading at this rate and for this long because it isn't killing that quickly for an ebola strain so more people can come into contact with an infected person. No need to panic if you're in a wealthy country or outside of Africa.   Ebola can still spread for about 2 months after infection via semen. I would advise he doesn't have sex for 2 months after he's 100%.    You shouldn't worry about getting ebola unless you plan on coming in contact with a sick individual's bodily fluids. This ebola strain is very similar to the Ebola Zaire which means it is very unlikely it's airborne. This strain is spreading faster because it is killing a smaller number of people than the Zaire strain. I believe the Zaire strain killed 90% of infected, this one is killing roughly 65% of infected.  Unless it becomes airborne don't worry.  If for any reason you believe you could be sick, stay hydrated and see a medical professional.    That I'm a very angry Jewish person.    Reston ebola, it didn't spread to humans though.   Exactly this. Vaccine companies wouldn't make enough profit considering all the work that would need to be done. Sadly creating a vaccine is only going to happen if profits will be made. The big buyers are going to be from first world nations and quite frankly, ebola poses little risk in those nations at the moment. The demand is simply too little for who is going to be able to buy it. Vaccine creation would take some time also. It doesn't exactly happen overnight.    DUDE SAME! Except I did mine in 10th grade. It's exciting. It's almost an adrenaline rush when I see these updates. It's like a movie with real consequences. It hurts to think that people suffer mightily from ebola, but we must understand suffering is something that happens. I've read books on infectious disease since I was like 13 and I want to try to do work for the CDC when I finish my education. I don't really want to see this become a huge pandemic, but the thought of living through one is exhilarating. If it spreads worldwide I pray everyone to have the best luck. Maybe better sanitary conditions can prevent it in western countries, but maybe they won't. We don't really know how powerful ebola could be. We might be on the brink of witnessing it's potential.    Do you think FIFA would fine countries football programs or players who said they would choose to not play in this World Cup?    Made me think of Larry David   Maybe she asked out of pity   Really? Two years ago a banker came into a class of mine and was telling us that identity fraud was incredibly tough to prove. What a douche bag trying to bait potential criminals. Thank you for teaching me the correct thing, not that I would ever break the law like that.   Edit: somehow identity turned into indentured...    I heard fraud is one of the hardest crimes to actually get caught for    I think OP watched Die Hard with a Vengeance on AMC yesterday.     As someone moving to brookyln soon I'm glad I saw this thread. I would think walking around looking bummy would work. That was going to be my strategy until I got more accustomed to the city.   Hey I've been home for about an hour now, to find that my roommate ate the last of my food. A pizza right now would be spectacular.    Well now you're just being vulgar.    I'll find it, thank you very much!    Seinfeld. It's a show about nothing, yet it is very relatable.    So striking.   What is that drink, is that a sort of coffee? I've never seen it. Where can I get some?   Let's address the real issue here: what kind of asshole points out that someone has a boner?    Somewhat bad? What the hell does that mean?    Ya know, I only get this once in awhile. It's like my dick has selective pissing around other people!    Virgin here: masturbation.    And the cow says booooo because the joke sucks.    Well now people will get so excited they pissed that they will forget to breathe again.    I think I would try to drink the screen if I was playing that game!    The only faith you really need in a time where you're questioning religious faith is faith in yourself.    Relax, you're making pranks out to be some kind of existential crisis. I mean, I follow "live every week like it's shark week" as much as the next guy, but sometimes we need to let the sharks go by.    Hey, I feel this way every day. Just try to be happy and positive. You'll be surprised at what this can do. It sucks at first, but you can do it. "Live every week like it's shark week." That's the best advice I've ever heard.    Let's keep my faith quiet. I won't use a throwaway though, too much work. What you're going through is common. Just look towards the sky and as long as you can see the sky you have a reason to be happy.   You might wanna get that checked out. That is a high level of pranks per day. The cut off is 345. If you're committing more than 345 pranks per day, you have a problem and should seek professional help.    Proud of you, bro-man.   Yeah man, she's not your ship so don't go with the captain goes down with the ship mentality. That can be painful. Just jump ship. Don't mention it though. Just cut her off. I mean, if you happen to see her say hi, nothing more.    Just stop. You're being an unnecessary asshole. Next thing you know the dog is going to be at a shelter because of your little prank.    She starts to be curt with her responses in conversation. You can sort of feel a negative vibe coming from the other person when you're texting, at least I think so.  	45
 Close. Thanks anyway, mate! :)   Wait wait wait wait. GUYS I FIGURED IT OUT. IT IS LT.DAN HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT FINALLY YOU GUYS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!   	2
 See I'm on both sides. Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives are two of my favorites of the year.   But the thing about voice acting is, is that you can really only covey emotions through your voice. Some of the greatest acting performances are more than just saying things with words. It's also saying things with your body. Your mannerisms. You brought up Mark Hamill's Joker vs Heath Ledger's. Yes Mark Hamill's Joker is great, and I'd say probably more iconic, but what makes Heath Ledger's Joker incredible is his mannerisms. They way he walks, moves his hands, his body language, how he licks his lips. These are things you just cannot do as a voice actor.    Because I can think of a few actors/actresses that deserve to be nominated more than someone who did voice work. I understand voice work isn't easy, but it just wouldn't be fair to nominate someone who did a voice over instead of someone who actually was physically there. Physically acting with more than just their voice. Acting includes not just voice, but expression of the face and body. Some of what makes acting performances great are the subtle things they do with their face and body.   Edit: I should clarify that I DO agree that voice actors should be recognized. What they do is incredible and not everyone can do it. What I'm saying is that *acting* acting and *voice* acting are two different things. They require different kinds of performances. Voice acting is about how you convey a character through voice while *acting* acting is about how you convey a character not only through voice, but through your mannerisms. They way you walk, move your hands, the way you look and so on. Things you simply cannot do as a voice actor.  It might be weird to segregate a Best Voice Acting category and a Best Actor category, but it makes sense. We have two separate writing categories: one for original screenplay and adapted screenplay. We have two separate Best Picture categories: one for animated and one for live action. Why can't we just have two separate acting categories? That way voice actors don't have to compete with *actor* actors. I don't think voice actors should be treated differently, but they do. Given a choice between a voice actor and an *actor* actor, the Academy will always choose the latter. Is it fair? No, but that's the way it is. If you lump voice acting in with Best Actor, they will almost always never get the award. They might not even get a nomination, but if there were a category for voice acting then they would get the notoriety they deserve every year.   What ever happened to Killer Crow?   We do agree but we don't. I agree with everything you've said, but I think where we disagree is the whole "good movies are good movies" thing, and I'm okay with that. I still think that as long as a movie is good, it's good. I don't care if it's a remake, or whatever. I'd rather see a really good movie that isn't the most original thing than an original movie that's bad. And that's just my preference. I'm not saying that all original movies are bad, in fact, some really great movies are original. But at the same time, there have been some really good movies that are remakes, sequels, prequels, reboots, adaptions or whatever.   You do realize I said basically the same thing, right? I never said anything about shot for shot remakes.   If this is true then this is sad. Good movies are good movies. It shouldn't matter if it's a remake, sequel, prequel or whatever. It's not fair to just write off a movie and give it a bad review simply because it's a remake, sequel, prequel, reboot of whatever.    Side by Side, Senna, Samsara, and Dear Zachary are incredible documentaries. Especially Samsara.    Are these legit reviews and is it really that bad or are people prejudging this movie? I haven't seen any reviews yet. This is a movie I'm really looking forward to and it bums me out to see it at below average because that means that it's either genuinely bad, or people don't want to like it and are hating on it.       So I'm making a Christmas sweater. [This](http://therightprofile.blogspot.com/2011/12/now-i-have-machine-gun-ho-ho-ho.html?m=1) one to be particular. My question is what should I use to write on it to achieve that clean, bright look? A sharpie? Paint? Or what? Thanks in advance!    So in English we watched a documentary called [Salute](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874317/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). You can read the story [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute). Basically, my teacher wants us to write an argumentative essay about something from 1968, using the movie as one of our sources. I decided to compare the black power movement to the gay rights movement. So far all I have is a thesis statement, but I'm having a hard time coming up with points and how to structure my introduction paragraph.  My thesis statement also needs to be improved in terms of wording. My thesis statement says: "Racism in the 1960's was so strong, that it would have been better if it was a gay rights sign instead of a black power sign." I can't figure out how to word it though.  But I really need help coming up with arguments to support my thesis. Any help is greatly appreciated.  Tell us what is holding you up.   **Rock Band 3**: This is a game I never really stopped playing. I play it like every week. Man, this game is great. Definitely one of my all time favorites. So many songs. But as I was playing this past week I started thinking about if we'd ever see another Rock Band game. With the new consoles and everything they're capable of, it'd be interesting to see a next gen Rock Band game. But only if they allow us to import all the songs we've bought. I don't really know of anything they could do better in Rock Band 4 or whatever they'd call it other than graphical stuff and maybe allow us to upload our own music?  **Fallout 3**: This is a game I played when it first came out. Got to like level 5 and wasn't having any fun so I stopped. I guess it was because I had never played a game like it before so I didn't know *how* to play it. So a few years later Skyrim comes out and I try it and fall in love with it. Over a hundred hours of Skyrim later, and I decide to go back to Fallout 3. I am absolutely loving it now. I've been playing it so much this past week. I guess Skyrim was sort of a good introduction to that style of game, and because I was use to it, Fallout went from feeling so foreign to feeling so natural and fun. Now I'm looking into playing New Vegas, but yeah, Fallout 3 is so incredible.   No one will stop you.   That'd be a fantastic feel-good movie!   What does that have to do with anything?      300 - Prepare for Glory  No Country for Old Men - There are no clean getaways.  Cobra - Crime is a disease. Meet the cure.  Evil Dead - The most terrifying film you will ever experience. (Even though it wasn't, when that tagline was released it was so bold and got me so hyped.)   Brandon Lee's accidental death on the set of The Crow.  "In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 12-15 feet, the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. He was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, NC where he underwent 6 hours of surgery. However, attempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead at 1:03pm on March 31, 1993 at the age of 28. The shooting was ruled an accident."   That's why I said "I'd". As in "I" would.   Things like cameras, tripods, lenses, mics, etc   Yeah I use to rent this movie like every weekend! I'd love to see it again. And thanks for the gold, it was so unexpected!   Lawrence of Arabia is fantastic, but I'd say 2001 owns the 60's.      It'd be funny though if they gave you the gold instead of /u/Vendredi8   Man, that movie's the sickest!   Don't they check your receipt at the door when you leave Walmart?      Hmm maybe he did mean Chang. I thought it was interesting though some of the similarities Julian and One Eye had. Like the fact that they both had one eye and SPOILERS!!!!!   how Julian cuts open someone's stomach just like One Eye also how Julian was pretty much silent.   But it could be Chang. One Eye was basically Odin and Chang is also God like.    I think its hard to say without knowing what you like, but Holy Motors is a truly strange and unique film. That movie is so strange and it just sticks with you.    I think Nicolas Refn hinted that Ryan Gosling's character in Only God Forgives is the character One Eye from Valhalla Rising reincarnated.    I don't know what it would be nominated for but The Place Beyond the Pines was great.   Also regardless of what people think about Only God Forgives, that movie has some great cinematography and music.    Okay one more quick question. What does it mean by EA disk? Can I go to gamestop and find it? Is it easy to find?   That video makes it look easy. Is it as easy as it seems? I'm not great with computers. Also thanks!   How *do* you get custom songs?   Sorry? I couldn't find one on Amazon so I looked elsewhere and that was the only one I found. If people can find it for less that's great! I don't know why I was downvoted. I didn't pick the price.  I was just trying to be helpful :(  Edit: Wow first I get downvoted for trying to help then I get downvoted for apologizing. Real cool guys.    A weird question, but I was wondering if there were any songs that are similar to Nine Inch Nails songs from the album The Fragile. I know there are NIN songs available but none are from the Fragile.   Like songs that are kind of epic style rock and loud?   Why not?   [Here](http://www.retrofestive.ca/grumpy-cat-jingle-all-the-way-to-hell-ugly-sweater/)   I think if it is real they revealed too much with the logo. If they wanted people to be guessing what it was they wouldn't have such a dead giveaway to fallout. That logo pretty much kills the surprise.    I'm looking for some good thanksgiving movies to watch with my family. It doesn't have to explicitly be *about* thanksgiving but it can also take place during thanksgiving. Just looking for some good movies that go with the thanksgiving season.    It's always kind of bugged me when actors complain about how hard their job is. I get acting is hard, I've done it before, and it's okay to say it's hard, but don't complain. You make millions of dollars. There are millions of people who would kill to be in your position.   Man this is sad to hear. I loved his music so much.   I actually think it'd be pretty cool to see "Wicked" versions of other Disney villains.       I love how people call it a dog game yet there are like only two parts where you use the dog.   Mystic River is absolutely fantastic.    Immortals. I'd recommend it to my friend who likes Greek mythology and loved 300.    That movie was the sickest!   I dunno man, if they collected phones at the beginning of detention I could still see it working.    In all honesty though, I feel like Breakfast Club is one one of those movies that *could* be remade like every thirty years to appeal to that generation at the time. The basic idea of that movie is timeless. There will always be kids, always be high school and always be detention. Just update the slang and fashion and BOOM! You have a competent and relevant remake that will always work.    It's totally fine to think the Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies. People get a lot of crap for thinking that, but TDK *is* a great movie. It's exceptionally well made, well acted and well directed. The only reason people say it can't be one of the greats is because it's new. But in like fifteen years when it gets "old" I think people will be okay calling it one of the greatest movies made.    Not really. A movie can be mind blowing or awe inspiring and still not be your favorite. Avatar is nowhere near my favorite movie, but it's something I'd love to see again for the first time.   Oh wow! This totally might be it. I'm about to watch some videos of it to find out for sure. But this might be it!   This isn't it. What bugs me is that I'd immediately recognize its name if I heard it.       So in this animated movie, probably early 90s, there was a talking puppy and a talking owl. Maybe more animals? And maybe in a castle? House? It's not a lot to go on but all I remember.    I thought the scene in Watchmen when a younger, less experienced Rorschach finds the pedophile. That was pretty intense.    Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.    Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.    Yeah, of all the things people complain about in terms of Xbox One, this is seriously the thing they should care about the least.    I'm right handed and I've always gotten disks out with my left hand.   It'll feel weird on the left side at first but in a few months or so it won't be a big deal and people will get use to it I think.    I don't know the law well but can cops shoot me if I punch a bunch of people? I love fist fighting in this game but then the cops come and shoot me and ruin it :(  Also screw the cops that hang on the side of SUVs and box you in and shoot you to death.    Or a system that let's you explain yourself to the cops and be like, "Yo sorry man this was totes an accident!"  Or at least just get a small fine instead of it being either cops die or you die.    I always hate though how slowly you break into cars. You have to go through the entire "look and make sure no one sees me, bash window, slowly get in and slowly hotwire the car" animation. The cops are after you! They are shooting you! Don't check to see if they are watching you break in! Just smash the window, hop in and start it as quickly as you can!!!   Then box you in, preventing you from going anywhere then shoot you to death.    I feel like the only way to escape five stars in GTA V is either by train or underground tunnel.    I will say though occasionally there is that super awesome moment of suspense when you're hiding at the end of an alley and the cops walking towards you. Then right before they get to you, your wanted goes away.    I got five stars and went to Trevor's airstrip and got into a plane because it seemed like the only possible way to escape. It was a HUGE ordeal getting in the air. But once in the air I thought I was home free. Nope. Helicopters kept spawning in front of me. Gave up trying to lose them and just flew into a building and died. I'm not giving them the satisfaction of killing me.   Someone summed up the cops in GTA V perfectly. "The cops in GTA V would murder their families if it meant killing you."   Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie   I'm playing through Fallout 3 for the second time. The first time I really didn't enjoy it. I think it was because it was so different from anything I had played before that I didn't know how to play. So then I played Skyrim and loved it! So this past week I went back to Fallout 3 and I'm really loving it now.  So my question is, what's the word on Fallout 4? Has it been officially announced? Are there any details or leaks about it? The technical leaps Bethesda has made since Fallout 3 really get me excited about Fallout 4. If it's happening that is. Any info about it?   Looking for someplace that has pork buns.    Just what is your favorite tv show theme song or opening credits?   Looking for Christmas songs. Doesn't matter what the song is or who it's by. If it's Christmas themed, I want it.      I love movies where the main character(s) hallucinates and the line between whats real and fake becomes blurred. They lose their grip on reality for whatever reason. Like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or The Shining or Pi. What are some good movies like this? Movies where they hallucinate and lose their grip on reality and can no longer separate what's real and fake.   I'm looking for some good movies with religious undertones. Maybe movies about someone finding or rediscovering their faith in God. It doesn't even have to explicitly be about God, but someone finding or rediscovering their faith in a greater power. Maybe destiny? I'm thinking specifically like Terrence Malick films how they have beautiful religious undertones like The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life and To the Wonder.       I love M83 and am looking for similar music. I'm mostly referring to their songs [My Tears Are Becoming a Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuc8vjny5c) and [Outro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWdiaS3uq4)   I really love Nine Inch Nails' album The Fragile. I don't know what it is about it I like, but what are some other albums, artists, or songs with a similar style and feel to The Fragile album?   I really liked whoever opened up for NIN in Nashville but don't know who they were or what songs they played.       They don't even have to be your favorite ones. I'm just looking for some decent movies that are about Thanksgiving or take place during Thanksgiving.   I'm looking for a post that was on here. Although it might have been posted to r/pics. But I'm pretty sure it was posted here.   It was a pic of a gorilla with a weird look. The title said something along the lines of "He gave me this look after I mouthed something"   What movie do you think does the best job at character development? Like fleshing out their characters to where they don't feel like characters anymore, but feel more like real people. A movie where by the end of it, you feel like you've known the characters for years and therefore feel a connection to them.   I don't watch horror movies so I've never seen any of these but I've heard good things about them.   Inside  Martyrs  Rec (original one)  The Descent  Could you tell me which of these would be best to watch? Or if you have a better suggestion? Newer horror movies from like 1998 to present are preferred unless you know of an older one that still holds up well. Like I said, I don't frequently watch horror movies so I don't know which are good.          I feel like it's been a while since we've heard anything regarding it. Anyone know when it's supposed to be released? I know Volition said it was going to be released close to the games release, but it's already October 9th.   Anything from clothes, mannerisms, and everything in between.      Is there really even a point to wearing a mask in single player free roam? I remember before the game was released they were talking about masks and made it sound like Red Dead Redemption. Like you would go into an inventory, put a mask on, cause some mayhem, then once you get out of the line of sight of the cops you could remove the mask and lose your wanted level.   The only way to equip and remove your mask is by going in your home. So is there really even a point to having a mask in the game?    What movies do you think have the best sound design and sound effects?      I love movies like Starship Troopers and Jarhead. War movies that focus more on bootcamp, living with a troop and the life of a soldier. War movies that don't really focus on the war and action pert but more on the training and life of a soldier. Not like Saving Private or Black Hawk Down where the focus is on the battle. Any movies or TV shows like this?         Purpose: It's mostly going to  be something to carry on a daily basis. Used for things like opening stuff, basic uses, and even, god forbid, self defense if the situation calls for it.(I live in a very rough neighborhood)  Size: I'm looking for something not too big, but still a good size. Something that fits comfortably in a pants pocket.  Knife type: Folding knife is best  Price Range: I'd like to not spend more than $100 if possible.  Type/Style: I don't go camping too often, but I'd love to have something pretty rugged that could handle the great outdoors.  Blade Type: Plain edge is preferred, but a combo of plain and serrated is okay too!   Blade Steel: I don't know or understand enough about steel to make a good educated guess on what steel would be best. I'm not picky. I guess something that stays sharp longer, but without being too pricy.  Anything else: Nothing else really. Just need a good, durable everyday knife that will last a long time.  If you need anymore info I'd love to give it. Thanks for any and all help!   I have very straight and fine and thin hair so I often run into the problem that every product I've used so far makes my hair look and feel gross. Like really greasy. What are some good styling products that work well with my kind of hair and won't make it look and feel gross?         I re-watched The Strangers yesterday and that movie may not be the best (I love it), but there is one scene in that movie that's so great. The woman is just walking around her kitchen then out of nowhere the masked dude just walks up on the back door and watches her. No loud music, no sudden movements, no jump scare, just great subtle horror.  Now I'm looking for other horror movies that have great subtle horror. Any ideas?   So I was dropping off Jimmy somewhere after switching to Michael and was wondering what would happen if I ran Jimmy over. Turns out that when I ran him over, Michael yelled, "No! No! No!" I got out and Jimmy didn't move.  A day latter I called Jimmy and it was busy. Did I kill Jimmy for good?   I just want to screw around in the world with no consequences. I've heard conflicting info on if this cheat is real or not. Is it just no one ha discovered it yet?   And what would it basically be about? Buddy cop, road trip, etc.  This question was inspired by a question /u/ctopherrun asked on here regarding a Michael Clarke Duncan/Terry Crews buddy movie.   But yeah, who are your picks, alive or dead, to see in a buddy comedy movie?   I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about when we might see a trailer. It feels weird that there have already been two trailers shown at comic con yet nothing for the public and it's released in May next year.  Godzilla is one of my most anticipated movies and I just want to see something. Does anyone know when they plan on showing a teaser or something?   I'm looking for a subreddit like battlestations where people post pics of their setup, but for more home entertainment like stuff. Like console gamers or pictures of entertainment set ups. I don't game on a pc. Mostly xbox. I'm about to redesign my living room and I'm just looking for inspiration, but all I can find really on battlestations are pics of desktops.  Is there a subreddit like battlestations geared more towards console gamers or home entertainment setups?   I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about when we might see a trailer. It feels weird that there have already been two trailers shown at comic con yet nothing for the public and it's released in May next year.   Godzilla is one of my most anticipated movies and I just want to see something. Does anyone know when they plan on showing a teaser or something?   I haven't really heard anyone mention easter eggs so I'm wondering if anyone has found any.            [Pic](http://imgur.com/myNcyrG)  We stumbled upon this picture of my grandfather and uncle. They passed away some time ago. I was wondering if someone could colorize this photo for my father. Thanks in advance!      I don't ever play strategy games but kind of want to. What are some good strategy games for the 360 for beginners that aren't too complicated? Something to ease me in?   Like real adventure movies were someone goes on an adventure or journey or something. Like Up or something. I just can't think of many good adventure movies besides the obvious ones.  So what are your favorite adventure movies?   So in the mission where you rescue Asha, the one where you fight your evil twin, I noticed something great.   When you sneak up on the dude talking to his wife/girlfriend, I just sat there for like more than five minutes just listening to him going, "Mmmmmhmmmmm." crying from all the laughter.  Did anyone else notice this or get as much joy from it as I did?         College professor of film or Forensics? There really aren't any specifics. I guess just assume anything and everything. I want help thinking of all the pros and cons of these two career options. I'm at a crossroads in my life and need help understanding the pros and cons so I can better figure out which is best for me. Forget about which one I prefer. All I care about is which is better in terms of the pros and cons.  If there is a better place to post this please let me know.          I wanted to use the slowmo cheat because it sounds cool, but it doesn't work. It's listed as a cheat on multiple sites. There is also a fast forward cheat, but it does work. I found out that the slowmo cheat is "Silverlink"? What does that mean? Someone said it was unlocked when you finish the game. It didn't unlock for me and I can't find any videos of the slowmo cheat. So is it real?    So yesterday I asked what your favorite mission was, but I figured that there are some missions that weren't my favorite, but had some of my favorite moments. So I'm asking a slightly different question that should allow more of a variety of answers and discussion.   Pretty simple question. What was your favorite mission?      For some reason I love watching love story dramas, where the relationship is tragic. Something like Blue Valentine or A Moment to Remember. What are some films with heart-wrenchingly tragic love stories?       I watched Pain and Gain the other night and I was thinking the entire time, "Man, this is some super dark humor." But I kind of liked it. I enjoy dark humor, so I was wondering what movies you guys have seen that has had some really dark humor. What movie has had some of the darkest humor you've seen?         I have the link to the video. It's been cut down to the right length, I just need it in gif format with text matching the words, but no text with the "Haha", just the part where he says words.   [Video](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1403787)  Thank you!   I saw this short film purely because it was suggested in the "Related" section. It was about an artist whose wife dies. Then he builds a sculpture to remember her. As the short progresses, he slowly becomes a statue while his statue of his wife slowly becomes human. Really weird, but beautiful short film. Anyways, can't remember the name and want to show it to someone. Can anyone help?      I watched Spy Kids 2 the other day. I loved it when I was a kid, but as a teen I just thought it was terrible. However, as an adult I loved it! I thought it was kind of genius and couldn't help but to love it. I think it's because as an adult, I realized it wasn't really meant to be taken seriously, but instead is suppose to be cheesy. I haven't had that much fun watching a movie in a long time.   So I got to thinking, what kids movies do you enjoy or understand or appreciate more now that you're an adult?      When I heard there were going to be voice sliders I got super excited. But when I fired up the Inauguration Station, created a character, and went to choose his voice, I was sad to see that the voice slider, while it does adjust the pitch, unfortunately gives your character a robotic sound whenever the slider is on anything other than normal. Maybe it's not that big of a deal, but I was just kind of disappointed.   Also, what areas should I stay away from when looking for a place to live? Also, would it be cheaper to rent an apartment or buy/rent a house? And what neighborhoods are not only good, but have a reasonable cost of living? If you need any more info, please let me know. I've only been to LA once when I was little and don't know what to look for or where to look. I'm extremely grateful for any and all help/advice! Also, do you know of any great online resources I can find with info on real estate as well as other housing. I live across the country and cannot afford to visit LA frequently.      My birthday is coming up this week and me and a few friends are just going to hang out and eat pizza. My question is, what place in Memphis or surrounding areas has the best pizza? Doesn't matter if they do delivery or not. Just looking for the best pizza in the city and neighboring towns.   Like the blood effects when someone is shot. I'm interested in which movies you think have the best blood hits. It doesn't have to be an action movie. Even if only one person in the movie is shot, if it's good, I want to know about it. Doesn't matter how realistic or over the top it is, practical effects or CGI, doesn't matter. However, I prefer something visually appealing, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm just interested in the different styles and looks of blood hits there are and want to know which ones you think are the best.   I heard a song recently, maybe a pop song, but it's recent. It features what sounds like either a marimba or steel drums. It's not fast paced though, but not too slow. That's really all I know about it. I don't even know the lyrics other than part of the chorus that goes something like, "She something something something." Obviously they don't say "something". The somethings represent how many words there are in the chorus. So he says, "She" then says like three more words. I know it's not much info, but I appreciate any help.   I heard a song at work today and loved the beat and rhythm of it, but don't know what it is. I know it's fairly recent because we only pay recent music, but not top forty stuff. I've never heard this song anywhere else before. I know one lyric, "I'll love you until the end of time." Or something like that. It's a pop song with a sort of middle eastern beat/rhythm to it however the singer sounds American. I know that at the end of the song he says, "Until theee eeeeennnndddd ooooof tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime."  The song has a pretty chill sound to it. It's not a slow love song. Definitely more of a pop song.  I know this isn't a lot to go on, but it's all I got.   Edit: New details: Most likely male singer. Also I should clarify what I mean by recent. What I mean by recent is like this year.    So I watched Samsara recently and two shots struck me with how powerful and how much they said without saying anything. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=3660) one of a geisha shedding a tear, showing how hard her life must be. And [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=4602) one of a disfigured war veteran at a memorial cemetery, showing the price for peace and the cost of war.  Are there any other great shots like these? Ones that say so much without saying hardly any dialogue? You know what I mean? Sort of like how a picture is worth a thousand words kind of thing? What are some great examples of this in film? Shots that are so powerful and say so much with so little. I hope I explained myself well. I'm not really looking for scenes per se, more so just single shots.      What scenes are your favorite uses of the quiet scream? Where a character screams but the sound of his scream is cut out. Think Dark Knight when Harvey is in the hospital bed and he screams but it's muted out. Or more recently The Artist where the main character has his hallucination and he drops to his knees and screams but is not heard.    I'm trying to find movies where the opening scene is basically a quiet, typical opener, then BAM! Something in the vein of the opening scene of [Children of Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCTgUq6hzUk). Clive Owen just gets some coffee walks out of the shop, then BOOM! a bomb goes off then title card.  Or Reservoir Dogs. Starts with them having a comical, friendly conversation, then all of the sudden it goes to Orange in the back seat bleeding to death and screaming.  Or think Dark Knight when SPOILER!!!!!!!!! Rachel dies. Shes talking to Harvey, everything's fine, then BOOM, out of nowhere the building explodes.  Another great example isn't a movie, but rather a video posted a few days ago. Where a woman is driving for like 20 seconds then out of nowhere without warning, a car comes flying at her.   I'm really looking for that contrast of when a scene goes from quaint and quiet to fucked in less than a second.   I guess it doesn't have to be an opening scene, but it's preferred. The only real stipulation is that it has to be a pretty normal non action scene at first then out of nowhere something happens.       So me and my mom watched this Korean movie on Netflix called [A Moment to Remember](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428870/?ref_=sr_1). I have to say it is one of the best movies I've seen as well as one of the saddest, most heart breaking, yet beautiful. We bawled our eyes out. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and see this film.      I work at American Eagle and supposedly all American Eagles play the same music, so that might help. I only know brief parts of the choruses of the two songs.  The first is a punk rock sounding song with a female vocalist (or at least they sound female). The chorus goes something like: "She said don't forget your friends, I know; Don't forget your friends, I won't; don't forget your friends." Or at least it sounds a lot like that.  The second song I have even less info on. It's a pop song sung by an extremely British guy. So much so that when he says "No" it sounds like, "Now". The chorus goes a little like: "Never gonna get, never gonna gt it, no." I know that's super vague, but at work I can't focus on the lyrics plus it's not ever loud enough.  I only hear these songs at work and I've tried looking up the American Eagle playlist, but still can't find them. I'm grateful for any and all help! Thanks!    I was really into this movie I was watching but then when someone died, it was really terrible cgi gore. So I was thinking, what are you're favorite uses of practical gore effects? What scenes really stick out to you when it comes to practical makeup effects?   Saw it yesterday and wanted to read some discussions on it, but there are no threads.   I don't really enjoy horror, but I wanted to see it purely because I heard it was a well made film. I have to say I thought the direction was really great as well as the acting. I thought the first half was fantastic, but I thought the second half, while still good, felt not as great or scary. All in all I thought this was one of the best horrors in years.   So what did you guys think? Really want to get a discussion started!   I moved away recently and don't know anyone where I live now. My birthday is in a few weeks and I got a little depressed because I have no one to spend it with. Then I thought, "Hey, this doesn't have to be a sad thing!" So, now I'm trying to figure out what I can do on my birthday by myself that will be nice, fun, or enjoyable. I don't want to spend my birthday thinking about how alone I am. I want to enjoy it!  So what are some cool/nice/enjoyable things I can do on my birthday without being sad?  	153
 Sure, I live in London, in the UK :)   Oh really? I do find that most AB redditors say that they normally wait around 14 days for shipping. It may be Canadian customs that are holding onto it. Did you pay for the 'K-packet' shipping?   I honestly didn't expect them to arrive for another 5 days at least and I'm already preparing my next wish list! I was in such a rush in getting the door one of my contacts actually popped out from rubbing my eye...(these exams, seriously)  I'll definitely let you know how I get on with them, the peeling gel is actually for my dad so we'll see how well it works for both of us (he is 50 with wrinkles and I'm 18 with hyperpigmentation).   I paid for the items on 18/05 and they both were shipped on 20/05 and arrived today (27/05).  I now finally know why people post their hauls, waiting 7 days for shipping feels like a year compared to domestic services!      Ahh!! I've never hit up their standalone stores before, I'll be sure to check them out when I'm back in town. Oh I know the Viva mall, its right opposite station!  Thanks so much, so excited to go!!   You don't believe me?   Beijing isn't so bad most of the time, although older buildings (anything but apartment complexes) always have a few lurking mozzies in my experience.   Buy yourself an electric mosquito swatter, those things are great to wave around the place to kill any.   Buy yoself a tonne of Tiger Balm once you arrive, they're sold at any pharmacy. Try to buy the 'Dragon and Tiger' brand and use this to rub onto any new mosquito bites. Slap that stuff on.   I would recommend a plug in over the burner spiral type, you can find Raid ones in supermarkets always have the burner and the packs together for like 15 RMB.  DEET has been the best thing in my experience, when I stay my Grandma's place (her building was built in the 40s so its packed with mosquitoes), DEET is the only think that can protect me. Try to limit where you spray it, i.e. only on arms and legs and exposed skin.   That's usually the reason a Chinese gets with a non-Chinese guy. Places in Beijing like Sanlitun are now filled to the brim with girls stumbling in their heels to draw the attention of foreign guys.   Marriage is like some game in China right now. Elders in the family feel like after 35, the woman is a leftover.   Seeing as there are more men to women, is it not wise to use a 'skill' of sorts to get to your ideal man and show off to their families, friends, coworkers etc.? I'm sure a lot of Chinese women have sex regularly, and have sex before marriage, but like a lot of countries in Asia, seeming 'pure' and virginal is a large attraction.  I don't think Chinese girls and women are asexual but most girls probably still associate sex as something difficult to bring up, especially with family, and school whilst there are women who also enjoy regular or casual sex.   Can I ask which stores in Beijing you went to? I've been to the Sasa's and Watson's around but I'm running out of other places to go to. Out of the stores I've been to, I don't think I've seen much of the Korean brands around :(   The MG masks are really nice and also go for around the 20 RMB mark, which is around 2 or $3.25 mark (rough guess). I've also tried Watson's own Bird's Nest sheet mask that I really like, it left my skin feeling very hydrated after the drying Beijing air (its so dry I get nosebleeds).  Most Chinese women I know use Korean brands as there are plenty of poor quality ingredients that Chinese manufacturers use, so there aren't too many high quality Chinese beauty products I'm afraid.  Shenzhen stores will probably carry lots of imported goods that you may find are cheaper and also, sometimes if you buy products as samples, they come out waaayyyyy cheaper. My aunt buys like 10 of Lancme's Toner in 30 mls and it works out to be far cheaper than the 200 ml bottle.   This varies from region to region, in Beijing, we have it for breakfast and its a lot thicker, consisting of tofu, mu er and huang hua and has a deep, almost smoky taste to it   Yeah I agree, I have also had issues with EMS abroad too, which sucks. I'm pretty sure Jolse and RRS state that they mark down the value.   I'm really worried about my order too, even though I didn't pay for EMS. I ordered around $90 worth plus $16 shipping on RRS so I really hope Customs won't believe that its a 'gift' and crack it open, even though I've heard RRS lowers the value of the items. It's my first AB haul too so here's hoping...   Hi, congrats on making the move!  I can help on a few things here for you:  2) Try to buy non-import goods from supermarkets (the prices are crazy) and try stick to local markets. Local communities tend to go to a few local shops or stalls, particularly the elders. My local shop has very fresh eggs and seasonal produce, particularly watermelon. Ensure to wash all food before consumption though and peel foods when you can, e.g. apples etc. due to the sheer amount of pesticides, fertilisers etc.   With regards to milk, I don't know if you've heard of the many milk scandals, but my parents have told me to stick to San Yuan . As far as I know, they're the only ones without any big issues so far, but to be honest, all milk tastes bizarre to me in China so I tend to just drink Soy.  If you are around the Wang Jing area, there are many Koreans there so maybe you will get a chance to enjoy some local Korean food too.  AVOID SUPERMARKETS ON WEEKENDS ESPECIALLY SATURDAY MORNING -thats the biggest piece of advice I can give you with regards to shopping. Supermarkets often have fresh stock on Saturday and so cut prices or have deals on Saturday morning. Trust me, the price cuts are not worth the pushing, shoving, yelling, and dirty looks you will receive. Try to shop local at smaller markets (better for the economy too) for the easiest.  3) I agree with [heavy_petting], try to shop at large supermarkets for better deals, Walmart, Carrefour etc. are great for household items. I often go to Tian Yi in XiChengQu (its a large market with loads of stuff and sellers, so you can haggle for various goods from paper card to fly swatters to jewellery. I would advise against buying electricals there though, they're probably fake or will break very quickly)  4) Try to barter or haggle whenever you can, not in actual shops obviously but at places like street foods or vendors in large markets. If street food is already cheap for you or you feel generous, go ahead but for reference I normally pay ~4 for a jian bing (go try these, I crave them all the time) and if you are heading the Wang Fu Jing Xiao Chi Jie don't hesitate to haggle for a skewer. I remember when I was 16, there was an American in front of me paying 15 for a fruit skewer and I paid 4. As a British man, I assure you people will try to rip you off so don't be shy to haggle.  Also, don't be afraid to try new foods, things like chickens feet, pif trotters are delicious and have benefits for the body. Don't let the fear of food poisoning stop you from eating new foods.   As a fellow Brit, I also must plead with you not to be annoyed when people don't queue or apologise when pushing you out of the way. Don't be surprised when people race to get a seat on the subway and just stand there enjoying the air con, reminiscing the days spent on the hot stuffy Tube.  Try to dress appropriately, the weather changes a lot in August, it will be sickeningly hot and humid in August until around the 22nd then get cooler then BAM its suddenly autumn with the breeze.  Thats all I can think of for now, its time to go back to A Level revision. If you have any other things you want to ask, feel free to.   The weather in Beijing is hot, how hot? How humid, how much heat does the smog add?  Its hot in summer, the hot days are about to begin and will only relent at the end of August. Some days are crazy dry and some days will be disgustingly humid- beware, if you are going to the South, especially Nanjing, or places in Sichuan, you may feel like you're suffocating. Beijing gets temperamental through June to August so one day may be really dry and hot and the next can be humid and stifling.  The dry days are coming soon and can really dry your body so you may need a humidifier, I can often get nosebleeds the air is so dry.   Please, please, please remember to wear sunscreen, preferably a sweat proof one, if you will be walking and doing 'touristy things' under the sun without sunscreen, your skin will hate you. For extra UV protection, be very Chinese and buy a UV parasol once you're there.  Any types of clothing that I should specifically not bring? Any colors that are looked down upon or just not worn?  Not really, don't wear anything crude or discriminatory and I would suggest light fabrics e.g. linen, viscose (wears a dream and will feel lush on humid days). You will be more amazed by what other Chinese people wear, I know I am fascinated by the sheer amount of incorrect grammar on most people's tshirts and items.  Enjoy your time!!   Go to a pharm at night and ask. I went in the morning and refused, telling me to come back at night, so I went back burning a 40 degree celcius fever and popped a few Amoxicillins they sold me.  Night time = shady time.   I'm Chinese and was born In Beijing but raised in London so here are some places my family and friends go to, usually for ~5-10 people, with a small summary of what I remember:   **Food**  - Cats eye pizza (various locations) -Supposedly opened by a guy who used to work at Pizza Hut then opened his own place.... But decent enough western food and very cheap, pizza is about 25-40 depending on toppings. I love their desserts and always order plenty to share.  - Gong de lin  (Qian men, Dongcheng) VEG  Personally not for me but the vegetarians in my family love it, lots of mushroom (bai ling gu ) dishes made into meat like dishes. Its usually really cramped there though but they have some signature Buddist dishes.  - Jin Si Shu Shi Fang  (Xizhimenwai, Haidian) VEG  LOVE THIS PLACE, its a tad expensive for just vegetarian dishes but they also cater for vegans. They make a really good sausage out of  as well, as well as a 'jiao liu rou pian ' out of the mushrooms too. Sadly their Dongsi branch has closed due to government demolition (perils of being in Beijing) but the Dong Zhi Men branch is just as good. I would definitely buy dinner there, vegetarians or otherwise.   - Quan ju de  various locations, Qian Men is OG)  Not Beijing if you ain't eaten their duck. 'Nuff said.  - Song he lou   (Nanlishimen, Xicheng= my ends or Zhizhuyuan, Haidian)  Excellent  song shu gui y, definitely something to photograph. Veers on expensive side but one of Ba Da Lou, so basically, a must. Very enjoyable Huai yang cai, try their meatball soup, extremely tender pork and 'melts in the mouth' as some may say. They also do a lovely Shui Jian Bao, very crispy and mince inside is well seasoned.  -  Dong Xing Lou (Tongxian, Tongzhou)  Another nice place to eat, they have quite a few sea cucumber dishes that are nice, but its a bit of a trek seeing as it's in Tongxian  -  Tong Ren Ju (Haidian)   Open space with large upper floor. If you go, appreciate the high ceilings and the balconied corridor of the first floor rarely seen in Beijing restaurants. I had the best spring onion pancakes *of my life* (they are 'pull apart-esque'), a huge statement as I eat spring onion pancakes almost daily.  - Sizzler (various locations)  For when you're just craving a steak, took an American friend I met in Sanlitun (surprise surprise) who was craving TGI Friday's. Very basic, but good western style buffet salad bar.  STREET FOOD IN GENERAL 3  **Drinks**  Honestly, Sanlitun is for foreigners (no offense, but really, c'mon) and I have been to a fair few bars there few underage, so I really can't say I have enjoyed many bars in Sanlitun.   Seeing as booze is so cheap in Beijing, why not just buy a bottle and stay home? If you want to go out and drink though, I think just ordering drinks with food or best of all, with small eats and KTV!!  I would recommend to stay away from the Western food though, theres nothing better than Xiao Chi in China (trust me, I used to go eat Western food a lot in Bejing and you just feel like you've missed out on a chance to try great food, especially as the Western foods aren't as authentic as the original)  Apologies for the mix of Pin Yin and Han Zi, I have being studying the whole day for the next 3 weeks of A Level exams but I really wanted to recommend some places.  Enjoy eating!!   Sanlitun is known for being 'foreign', full of Euro and American style bars, its fun for meeting foreigners but I wouldn't call it a Chinese experience, especially when a drink can cost the same as a food dish!  But still, define what you like as 'fun' and maybe its for you!   I agree with doing what makes you feel good too. However, just to let you know you may find that if you're living in a small town (Changping even has some villages) you may receive 'funny looks' when going out just because people aren't used to seeing such behaviour. Even still, if it were me, I would just do whatever hair I liked.  With regards to how people perceive you though, don't get offended if people point out you're foreign or look more foreign: I'm fully Chinese, born and originate from Beijing and I get asked by strangers if I'm mixed race due to my darker skin (compared to other, paler girls in Beijing) and lack of accent.   Last year, I decided to get my hair digitally permed in Beijing during my summer there and it was far cheaper than in London, so if you're looking for a perm or professional dyeing, I suggest you do it in China (I'm assuming your Mandarin is good enough to communicate well with your hairstylist) and like always, bring photos to show your them what you want.     I have read up a lot on Vit-C as a brightener and currently have about 3/4 of a bottle of Instanatural's Vitamin C serum, which has 20% Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (the second ingredient right after deionised water).  I know that the L-AA Vit-C's must be used before any other actives, directly after cleansing, but seeing as I'm not using a L-AA, do I still need to use it before my acids?   I've also made my first purchase from RRS today so hopefully I can get a proper routine going soon!   I use Piz Buin All day SPF 30, it has a pleasant scent to it, dries well and is great from sunny days to skiing, although I'm a fan of the Hawaiian Tropics Silk too  	22

 In the 1980's, KFC use to be good.   I think you are correct. Wow.      Wonder how much this fancy VCR was in today's dollars. Good askredditt question. I want inflation factored in.     Y2k. Oh wait. That was over a decade ago.    You going to fix it      Don't need too understand the language to get the point.      I used a combination treatment of 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, a topicial mixture of bezethonium cloride and epson salt, and alternation hot and cold. Each of these ideas have some known medicial benefit and are covered in peer reviewed scientific papers. My idea was to combine all three and get the 400nm blue spectrum light from a 1000 watt hydroponic grow bulb. Treated my last three MRSA infections  this way.       Someone should talk about the lady who helped these dogs. Bravo lady.    Please be civil people our furry friends would want us too be.     If China can regulate population through there one child policy surely they can regulate the treatment of dogs. They lack the political will. The west should force policy change and connect trade agreements with policy change.    There was a scientific study that concluded that for every dollar we spent on NASA we received over 9 dollars on long term GDP growth.   This is a perfect example of why we need to fund large national scientific projects. This is why we need visionary leadership who understand the long term return on investment on projects like CERN.       They are brother/ sister. The black one is the girl and the white one is the boy. They both had worms really bad when I rescued them. After a couple of visits to the vet, they are both currently ok.   Who cares. They have nothing better to think about. How about thinking of ways to bringing manufacturing back. We need a visionary President like Kennedy.      Brother/sister littermates    Enjoy the pic.          Interesting article but not sure this will work.   I want one!      These pics put me in a happy mood.   Favorite comment of the day. It paints an awful mental picture.   http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/   Good positive story.   Kitty need some love.    Work of love.   Does not look good.   Please do and give me the results. Google 400nm light and look at the peer review research. It is called blue light therapy. It is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne.   I used three ideas that are known to have some useful benefit but when combine together work amazingly well for me. I am trying to get the scientific community interested in idea. Don't want any money. Jonas Salk style.   Yes it is a combination of three things. I invented it myself. Check out link. http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/   There is peer reviewed studies that say that 400nm light may help kill MRSA. I am the first person too think of using a grow bulb to produce this type of light.  Works like a charm.   It is a blue spectrum grow bulb when used in conjunction with bezethonium cloride treated my last three mrsa superbug infections. I am not joking.      Please no trolling       Yea and he will save 100 million in labor costs over the next 10 year from lower payed undocumented labor.   Good news.    Kefir drink      Super creppy.   True. Balance is hard in today's world. I just don't like to follow absolute advise. Life is messy but that is ok.    In my opinion, the body language is different in a dark triad and sometimes the eyes are a tell.   Dark triad personality people think normal emotionally healthy people are fools. What they don't realize is that they are the ones who are emotionally defective not humanity.  Sure the dark trial is better than average with logic but the universe is not governed solely by linear cause and effect logic. The emotion of love transcends logic.    But many caring genuine people are charismatic and caring. Can you tell right away or does it take time. If you can, how.  	51
 The half blood prince, fantastic? I hope you're being sarcastic...  or some reason they decided to jump on that and focus more on the relationship drama and less on the actual storyline.  whelp, that might be why. The relationship drama is the storyline, even in the book.   This probably wouldn't be in the shulchan aruch, but is there any discussion on what a mourner who goes to two different shacharit services on the same day should do? That is the closest to this situation.     You can say that as many times as you want. I have it open and don't see that. I'm in siman 55. Can you point to where it says that saying kaddish with less than 10 is assur, or where saying a d'var sh'bikdusha with less than 10 is assur?    You are saying it is assur, but I'm looking at the mishnah brura and it doesn't mention assur anywhere. Is it preferable to say it with a minyan? Yes. Must a minyan say it? Yes. But nowhere does it say it is assur if there is not a minyan. Again, it's great you're studying it, but I haven't, so if you could please cite your sources it would be very helpful.   This doesn't even get into the difference of saying it to yourself versus a public declaration among less than ten.   Alright, I see  , but no assur. I also see no discussion on what a single person can or should do. I also see that a Katan does suffice for the tenth, unlike kedusah, meaning this is on a lower level. (Actually, I think I might have misinterpreted this--it's unclear whether these are laws for just kaddish or also brachu, kedusha, etc.) From my limited knowledge is seems totally fine to say the words of the kaddish by yourself, but it does not yotzei you.  Maybe the Aruch Hashulchan discusses it, but I can't look right now.   Don't worry about it. We're having an argument on the fine points of a specific law.  A minyan is ten Jewish men by Orthodox standards, ten Jewish men and women according to more liberal movements. Those of us who are more liberal/egalitarian also say there is no difference between men and women in this.  Edit: Just because the most stringently observant on here say certain things doesn't mean they are always true for everyone. :P   One second, the kaddish doesn't even have Hashem's name. What is the difficulty?   thanks. Unfortunately I only have the Mishna Brura and Rambam here.  Edit: Oh, you are referring to the mishna brura! stupid latin letters...   Is there a source? Also, remember the principle of teaching when saying God's name.   Some synagogues do sell them. If they don't, they can definitely refer you to someone else who does.   That's very appropriate. :)   It's not a mitzvah to do it, but I do not believe it is forbidden.    Hmm, I thought you said Lamarckism, and Lyskenkoism seemed to be a political structure that used it as a basis. So to be clear, I'm talking about the heritability of acquired characteristics.  I'm also a layman, so I can't say very much; I'll explain it simply with more technical words in parenthesis, since I don't know your knowledge level. The basics of it that I know is that experiences (stimuli) over the course of an organism's life can change whether genes are turned on or off (expressed). Since genes are usually just codes for a cell to make proteins, expression simply means whether or not the specific proteins are made.  This is mostly caused by the way the genome is folded/held together.   For example (and this might be relevant for people here), the gene for lactose tolerance in adults can frequently stop being expressed (i.e. the protein it codes for stops being make) if you stop drinking milk. So an adult with lactose tolerance who does not drink milk for a few months would find it difficult to start again because there are no more proteins to break it down.  The theory is that the expression of genes, in addition to the genes themselves, can also be passed down by parents. How exactly it works I'm not clear about. It's not Lamarckism in its original and expansive form, but it does share similarities.   Well, an altered version of it has been making a comeback recently.   You can also say the Mourner's Kaddish if you want -- it's a prayer in Aramaic, but most prayer books have it transliterated. You might or might not find it meaningful.    Edit: [Here's a link](http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/kaddish.htm) to the Hebrew, English, and transliteration. [Here is wikipedia's explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish#Mourner.27s_Kaddish).  Edit: Also forgot, is there any site or sub were I can learn more about my heritage?  That's what this sub is for! Read the wiki and people would be happy to answer your questions. I also recommend jewfaq.org   What are you going to do with it?

A ceasefire was only put into place once Israel started winning.   There are two different interpretations.   'We must never again allow a genocide to happen."  Vs.  "We will never again be like sheep led to slaughter."   And I'm saying that this "he" refers to all of mankind. My support is that seed is always plural, and that both Adam and Eve are referred to as you when it refers to all their descendents.    It doesn't say anywhere that the "suffering servant" would be pierced, nor that the suffering would "bring" salvation.   Other biblical texts clearly identify the snake with Satan (i.e., Revelation)  Fan fiction, doesn't count.  The text specifically says that your head shall be crushed -- not a generic snake, not the snake's descendant, but that particular snake.  It also says you to Adam and Eve, and that clearly refers to them and their descendendants. Why is this different?  There seems to be a particular descendant referred to by the "seed" -- it's a singular "he" who will do the crushing, etc.  "seed" always means "descendents" in the Bible. Is there a time it is not plural that you can point out?   Oooo, oooo, I know this one! Hocus, pocus, [balobocopypaste](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/29dzp2/why_is_jesus_always_depicted_as_being_white/cikvnv9)!  Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.  Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.  Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here.   Vanilla morrowind was good for its time, but modded morrowind is amazing. This is from someone who only started playing a few months ago.   Has Hamas not essentially declared war on Israel? Or did they provoke Israel into declaring war on them?  Hamas' declaration of war with Israel is in its founding document. This recent violence between Israel and Hamas began with Hamas firing rockets, yes.  Either way... if one side continually declines a ceasefire, how can the other be held accountable for any casualties of war? Surely Israel would prefer to not catch any civilians in the cross fire, but if their opposition chooses to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with civilians, then what option do they have?  Good question, ask all the Hamas supporters around here.  That said, I'm disappointed in Israel's strategy; why not attempt to use Hamas' tactics against them? Spread the word that Hamas leaders/militants only intend to use your (civilians) lives as sand bags and blast shields. Consistently and constantly plea with civilians to flee. Offer salvation and safety on the border, risk Israeli lives to save those that are disenfranchised by the Hamas - let the world see Hamas firing on their own fleeing peoples... on IDF trying to help civilians leave.  They've done all of this, doesn't change a bit.  On another note, why not attempt to gas such a densely populated area, where there is no realistic escape for your enemy, with a sedative? Get in, grab civilians, capture Hamas militants. Rinse and repeat as needed. Can't we do something besides lobbing bombs at one another? Not much of a farcry from trebuchet times - where the Homo Sapien species barely understood... anything.  New headline when a 90 year old tragically dies: "Israel is gassing Gaza!"  What is Israel doing to ensure civilian's safety, aside from giving them notice that they're about to drop bombs all over their neighborhood? Is it so much to ask that the IDF stick their necks out? What if Gaza was packed with Israelis instead?  A house is typically only bombed after a call and warning "knock." The IDF *does* stick its neck out -- it doesn't have to send soldiers into Gaza, it could get everything done by air, but with severe civilian casualties. Then you would see an actual 80-90% civilian casualty rate.   No, no, israelnationalnews is the best website ever!!    The Zionists were a terrorist group to the world.  Citation needed. Zionist leaders welcomed in the US say otherwise.  The Zionists believe in one state for Israel and control of the entire holy land.  Citation needed.  After the British left the Zionists turned their focus on controlling the holy land.  No, there didn't happen to be a civil war right before they left and armies invading afterward.  They gained control by forcing native Israelites out of the land if they weren't Jewish.  Yes, yes, that's why Israel has always had a 20% Arab population, right?  The people forced out still felt a right to the land since they were on it since the ancient Hebrews.  Arabs have only been there since the 7th century; they're proud of that conquest too.  Six Day War occurred and people ignored that the new Israel state has grown past the partitioned lines it was. given.  "Occured" is such a lovely word, isn't it? Allows you to ignore why Israel conquered those territories.  The people in Gaza form Hamas in order to get the land they felt was theirs.  This ignores all history between 1967 and 2005, lucky you.   The battles 60+ years ago were to kick all the Jews out. Hamas is still fighting for that.    The grievance being that the Zionists when taking over Israel forced the native Jews and Arabs to assimilate or out of the state into Gaza and the West Bank and thus created the tensions that aren't being absolved today.  This is so incredibly simplistic to the point of being wrong, I don't even know what to say.   I think that just because Hamas is bad doesn't make the grievance any less important.  Their grievance is that there are Jews in the area at all. If you agree with that, you are condoning them.   So are they fighting today's battles or the ones from 60 years ago?   Ah, so you agree with them?   You do realize that there was no siege until the rocket fire started? And that it will end once the strip is demilitarized?    They call all of Israel "occupied." Get your head out of your ass and realize they want to ethnically cleanse the area of all Jews.   http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-gaza-conflict-2014/1.609116   Ha'aretz reported it too.  http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-gaza-conflict-2014/1.609116   Probably less so than ynet and jpost, which are posted here all the time.   And when people ask why everyone can't just stop shooting and live together peacefully, this is the answer.   They didn't publish that any more than reddit publishes self posts. The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed and then banned him.    It wasn't even an op ed, just a random blogger who they host.   How about the fact that they didn't publish anything anymore than reddit does? The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed.   jewfaq.org is good for reviewing things you might have forgotten, but it doesn't go in depth.   As long as there is a giant explosion and darkness when it hits the ground.   No idea. Maybe the yeshivish people here can explain it?   So your argument is that the method of execution (stoning) is immoral? Again, define your argument.   Your example is like saying you forced someone into an electric chair and electrocuted them, and by the laws of Oklahoma that is ok. :P That's murder, not execution.  That's a moral execution, which isn't murder, and the bible didn't say to put the person on trial, but to just do it, so no laws broken.  Notice the example given has a trial first. The bible does say there and elsewhere that there has to be a trial before an execution.  Job is clearly an allegory, and one way of saying that we cannot necessarily find a reason for suffering.   How much longer until you agree that stoning is a torturous way of ending the life of another person,  I disagree.  and that it wouldn't be ok for anyone to order it be done.  I agree!     Oh, not a full takeover, but a limited one just near the border. The "I keep bombing you as long as you shoot rockets" and "I will keep the blockade until you get rid of the rockets" are pretty strong cards in my opinion.   Nope, it was the air force, not the navy.    No it isn't - you don't get a free pass to kill as many human shields as you like. Proportionality still supplies. You can't kill a hundred civilians to destroy one rocket being hidden in the same building, for example.  True. Most people mistake a war's proportionality for a strike's proportionality though. I have yet to hear of one airstrike killing one hundred civilians.  Isn't that just a tu quoque?  No, since this is said to people calling for Israel to stop bombing. Why should Israel be held to a standard that no other western country is?   You try doing so from an airplane or drone 1000 feet up in 15 seconds using heat imaging.   I'm not, I'm letting you define the scenario. Who are you aiming at?   Right so what we should stick to Palestinian endgame of forcing all the colonists to go elsewhere and the rest of the Jews to live as second class citizens, seems fair.    And if you shot at someone you would be arrested.   What about all the Arab states that kicked the Jews out? Should they be forced to take them back too?   Then yes, you are using the family who lives in that house as a willing or unwilling human shield. And who are you firing at? Soldiers of a dictator are very different than civilians of an enemy state.    Israel said that it targeted a militant site, and it was thought that the kids were Hamas fighters running from the shelling.    Israel won't accept it though. Since Israel withdrew voluntarily and is ready to return to Gaza if need be, Israel holds most of the cards.   What was the other peace process in which Bill Clinton intervened?  Oh, [right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords), that [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords).   The boys on the beach was a mistake, and Israel admits that. Unless it was fired knowing that they were all children, then it's not a war crime. War is brutal, and maybe Hamas shouldn't have started this one.  And none of those three schools were actually targeted.     Maybe just maybe there were actually many rockets fired from Gaza.   120 years' worth   Responsible for the action, yes. Responsible for the result? It depends. And certainly the person putting the civilians in harm's way can't be the one doing the complaining.   The rule 97 that I quoted from. And what is your point? Proportionality does not relate to overall casualty figures, and I would like you to prove that israel is not taking precautions in attacking.   You're just avoiding the question. What should Israel do in that scenario?    You can't blame the opposing force for killing the civilians you're hiding behind.   Yes, but you would usually not keep a crowd of civilians behind you while you are attacking, for two reasons.  1. You care about your people.  2. The tactic only works when the other side also cares about not killing them.  I'm not disputing hit and run tactics, but doing them next to civilians, whether they are willing or not..   Um, yes it is? It might not be permanent, but it is being used for military purposes.   I'm pro-Israel and I mostly agree! I would like to comment on a few things though:  With that said, they have at times acted carelessly and overly aggresively. Their response of "Hamas is worse" does not suffice, because a legitiamte state should hold itself to a higher standard than an extremist group.  The response is not "Hamas is worse" but "since Hamas is using human shields, we are not at blame when those civilians die," which is true, legally, under the Geneva Conventions. You might argue about the morality, but it is not a war crime   Also, Israel is usually saying "but America/the EU does the same/worse with lesser threats" which I have yet to see a coherent argument against.  The non-Hamas Palestinians and their more moderate leaders such as Fatah/PA are caught in the middle and the ones who deserve our sympathy  Eh, the thing is that Fatah is utterly corrupt and is just out to line their own pockets. The civilian population which does not take part in hostilities or riots is in a much worse position.   Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. Usually a resistance is trying to minimize their own civilian casualties, not make more die.    Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters.    Yes, it is.  It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.  http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97   Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters.   Ok, Israel lifts the blockade on Gaza and two months later there are 20 rockets every day, and several suicide bombers have gone off in towns neighboring Gaza. Now what?   What's your point?   And all the reports of them doing otherwise this time are hogwash? And that still doesn't address the fact that setting a military installation near civilians is also using human shields.   That is what they are doing, as per this article. My personal opinions are beside the point, I would just like to know if he would be using human shields like Hamas does.   If you were in Gaza now, would you hide behind ~~a mound~~ an apartment building, pick up a ~~gun~~ rocket launcher and take pot shots at Israeli ~~soldiers~~ civilians?  FTFY.   1. They're in danger as long as they're in Gaza, not because the firing has stopped.   2. Other journalists are still in danger if they are caught doing similar things.  3. Hamas might take action against the news company still in Gaza or in later reporting, even if that specific journalist doesn't return.   Nope.  [It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.](http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97)    [Look at how many bases are not embedded in cities among civilians!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israel_Defense_Forces_bases)   What would a proportionate response be, then?   No one sane in international politics thought it was a false flag operation; the two suspects were known members of Hamas and went missing since the day of the kidnapping. A week or so into the search, Israeli intelligence said that the suspects probably acted at their own initiative without a direct order, but that Hamas leadership did encourage their operatives to carry out more kidnappings.  Did Netanyahu use it as an excuse it to round up Hamas members in the West Bank? Absolutely, but that doesn't make it a false flag.  Hamas, if it knew that one of its leaders in the west bank was arrested, might have refused the ceasefire that Israel wanted now that the tunnels are destroyed. Israel revealed it today, after 12 hours or so of the ceasefire being in effect, because they did not think Hamas would take action now that the whole world would blame them for further escalation.    Israel bombing a rocket launcher near a home makes the fact that civilians died, though tragic, not a war crime unless casualties are disproportionate to the military gain   edit: for the specific military strike, not the whole operation/war.   [The reaction to Israel using soldiers instead of airstrikes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2b8bd7/at_least_100_palestinians_from_a_single/)   A 1:1 civilian to militant casualty rate is the best in modern warfare.   By this logic, you are encouraging Hamas to continue these tactics since they know Israel won't fire back. In this case, what should Israel do instead? Because no population will allow its government to sit and do nothing while rockets are being shot at it.   Ok, that's step 3. There are three different levels here:  1. When is killing justified? Answer: War, self-defence, and execution.  2. What are valid reasons for executions?  3. What are valid methods for executions?  You have to agree to the first before we go to the other two.   This is debate is about specifically the commandment from god to not kill, and the commandment from god to kill.  And my original comment was saying that **there is no commandment from God to not kill.** the verse says do not murder. You can argue about whether it is humane or capricious, but it is not a contradiction. Saying so only hurts your argument.   And this is why the Israeli censor is sometimes important. If this had come out three weeks ago instead of after the ceasefire, Hamas might have taken more drastic action.   They're still in danger, unfortunately.         You're arguing that killing during war, self-defense, and execution is morally acceptable, because god ordered it.  No, I'm arguing that these are the acceptable situations in which killing is permissible the world over and always have been. The argument over whether these laws should carry the death penalty (and why) is the second argument, but the other one has to come first. So do you accept the death penalty and other forms of killing are permissible (if not ideal), at least for this argument?   [But it is in line with the reporting of past conflicts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008%E2%80%9309\)#Casualties)   No, it just means that Israel is better at protecting it's civilians. I would not want to see the number killed with no sirens, bomb shelters, or Iron Dome.   Are we arguing the death penalty now? Because that is a different subject entirely. We can do so if you want, but it's not the same argument as you had above.   It is an execution if the person is brought before a court of law and tried according to [procedures outlined here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism). Otherwise, it is murder. That's why the story of Jesus stopping a stoning is so nonsensical.    Ground invasions actually have worse civilian casualty rates than air strikes do, since artillery shelling shelling is much less accurate. What if that strike team was surrounded? Shells would fall on that entire neighborhood, killing dozens. Would you condemn Israel for that too?  And that justification is much, much better than the the justification for Hiroshima and Nagasaki: We won't be able to conquer Japan because there would be no support for mass troop deaths, so lets bomb the fucking civilians and kill thousands instead of attacking soldiers.    Ratzach = Murder  Harrag = kill  Executions, war, and self-defense are killing, not murder. It's the same thing today.   I don't care about the points, but about the post being visible. I don't complain if it's above 0.   Journalism before video was a thing, you know. There are still these thing called "written articles" which /r/worldnews sometimes links to. Amazing, right?   God never says not to kill, but not to murder. If you're going to argue this, do it correctly.   And this is how polytheism started! :P   Innocent civilians will be killed and the world will be up in arms not matter what, so let's not risk soldiers if we don't have to.   Allow them to take it and report on it once you leave.    No, the bible is infallible because words are used consistently. In this example, "face to face" is always an idiom for "directly," while "see My face" is compared to "see My back." I don't need to deal with the NT.   Yes, the work they do is dangerous, but they should say that Hamas is intimidating them.   Then they should say so instead of meekly parroting Hamas' talking points.   So they dutifully parrot Hamas' talking points instead. Not doing so isn't Pulitzer worthy, in normal circumstances.   If they're scared, they should say so instead of covering it up.   It really shouldn't be. They were just at the right place at the right time. There should be many more of these types of reports coming out of Gaza.  Edit: really guys, downvotes? I'm not saying they need to have the balls to film it while their in Gaza, but they should at least report on it once they leave. If they are staying silent outside of Gaza for "access," then they are acquiescing to this war crime.   [The last Seal Team Six style operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid). And that was outside of Gaza, not surrounded by hostiles in enemy territory   I'm not in DebateReligion, so I'll make this quick. "Three persons, on God" is polytheism *according to Judaism*. The range of permissibility is from "complete idolatry" to "acceptable for non-Jews."

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           New books in Israel are published with a cover price of about $25. You probably think thats too expensive for a book. You are correct. So did the readers in Israel.   The retail market is dominated by two major chains (have about 80% market share together). In order to compete and sell more books, they started selling them in bundles. Prices dropped constantly, until it settled at 4 books for $30. Thats right, about  of the cover price.  At that point book writers complained that because of the power the publishers have over their contracts, they barely make any money from books sales.   Writers are paid about 10% of the paid price. So less than $1 for a book. In a very small Hebrew reading market. A best-seller book sells for about 50K copies in 2-4 years span.  Then the government decided to intervene and save the day. The parliament passed a law last year saying that new books cannot be sold at a discount for the first year. Thats right. The arbitrary number the published picked cannot be changed by the retail seller.  The law came into effect this February. 3 months ago. Thats it. The situation became dire very quickly.   Books sales drastically dropped. One of the 2 retail chains is in financial troubles, stopped paying suppliers and will probably declare bankruptcy soon. Publishers stopped signing unknown writers. New books became expensive again, publishers and stores willing to bet on well-known writers only. Some publishers stated they are on the way to close the business. Most of the books that are sold now (75%) are those published before the law took effect and can be sold at deep discount. Independent and small book stores almost dont sell any new books now.  Some customers are saying that 4 books for $30 is too cheap. They say that a book is a cultural item that shouldnt be sold in a deep discount. The say writers should be able to make a living. They got lawmakers on their side, because supporting writers is the noble thing to do.  Well, the market proved them otherwise.                                                                                               Only now I found out there are two more episodes. I'm very pleased with that too.                                                                                             Edit: just adding a bit of a content here, as I never meant it to be love/hate post.  I like the Heat, they are playing my kind of basketball. But I never thought of them as a *steady* team (as opposed to another favorite team of mine, the Spurs, which surprisingly, never even made it twice in a row), so I was surprised to learn that fact today.  I'm not big on basketball history before 88-89, so I can't compare this team to 82 Lakers or 84 Celtics (those are just blurred memories of NBA games I watched as a child, in which the cool kids liked the Celtics, don't ask me why).  Also, I don't think the east is particularly weak in the past 4 years compared to the past 15-20 years. In fact, it looks much stronger. But I may be wrong here.  Anyway, they still got 2 wins to go, and this stat implying it's really not that straight forward to go over this hump.                                                                                   	200
 Att du ens svarar hr r som att du ber om mer... Haters kommer att hata. Lr dig vnda andra kinden till. Du hr aldrig av oss som tycker att ni har intressanta videos p Youtube och uppskattar ert engagemang otroligt mycket. De som gr ljud ifrn sig r kanske 1  av alla lsare, att att mata dem med mer r verkligen motsatsen till taktfullt.   I have a feeling all the haters are jealous because they are so close with George. People often call them arrogant and stuff, which I think is misinterpretation because they do know a whole lot of stuff that we don't.  **Not to say my countryman Linda has not made some really clumsy and/or rude statements about things she shouldn't talk about in public..** When you have a whole fanbase watching, you should feel some kind of responsibility to keep moods up. Responding well to criticism is not her strongest side it seems.   Wow... Is that the described size? He feels a bit big. Awesome picture tho'   What platform are you planning to make it for? :) Desktop or Web?   HBO has taken breaks with a lot of popular shows. I just wish they would do it again. Two or three seasons of Dunk and Egg after introducing them with TreeBran would be spectacular..  They seem stubbornly firm on not taking a break though.   If u don't feel like read it all. Absolutely. I've done it for tyrion, Arya, and The Wall and Mereen. Only asos and forward. Though.    Would be possible fo'sho'. But haven't Bran thought about Meera that way before?    How did it go?   I have introduced close to 10 new people, new to advanced Board Games, though they are fans of the shows and the books.   And even though it takes several playthroughs to get a good hang off all the rules, new players seem to get a basic knowledge and after 3 or 4 rounds (if they are not afraid to ask their questions when they wonder about something). Past those rounds they can place their orders and such without any problems.   the largest part of tToB-cards adds no bonus/+1. There are only a few +2 and +3, and I really like that you can get fortification, sword and the skull, which can make the losing army still kill one enemy unit.   Actually not a very bad theory.   Paralyzed from the waist down means no boner and probably other problems with proreation. I believe that is a medical fact. But I would be glad with a second (qualified) opinion.   Not sure if you are shitting on my wall of text or if I have made your **head spin round, right round.**   If you are to believe to sub, I'd say if not over. Close to 9000.  Yeah BR barely counts but you are correct. Will be exciting to see if any others are secretly Targs.  There are quite a lot of those theories.    Not live maybe, but after warging Hodor for a year(I'm really bad at how much time is passed) he will know how to do it just as well as he knew all the stones in the walls of Winterfell. If it's possible for him to learn to slip into his skin, staying in the back not controlling him. Particularly since he will know Hodor so well. Well  **I would like to hear theories for the reasons behind Hodor being Dunk's descendant if you don't agree if only to encourage more discussion**.  George would have a good reason for such a twist. Hodor seems like a nobody, just there to help Bran North. Why would the plot need him to be related to Dunk? Someone who probably spent a lot of time with Brandon Rivers back in the days.    **Now, are you not prepared to read a long controversial theory.** "Leave now, and never. Come back".  Firstly. Bran and *George R R Martin* shares a huge (apperently gigantic) interest. And that is **Knights.** http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/ Also note Bran was the first point of view character George wrote. And in that chapter it was the finding of the Direwolves that came to him Martin first. Warging obviously was a huge part of the whole series from the very start.  And secondly, if you are active here you have seen this theory a couple days back. I have deleted that post, rewritten some parts, and added a whole lot of foreshadowing-material and things that **could** point the right way for this. I must say though. Ever since I first thought of this in August I am getting more convinced the more I dig, so **I need people to read what I have with an open mind and say that this is not possible.**    nbsp;    nbsp;  *"Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow"*   **PREFACE**  This theory that I have polished for months **stands and falls with Hodor being the descendant of Ser Duncan the Tall**, (which I strongly believe he is, even if my own crazy Crackpot turns out false.) **And it would also suggest George's fantastic reason for him being the grandson/great grandson of one of the finest knights the realm ever saw.** Here I would also like to point out that Duncan lived almost 100 years before ASOIAF, and yet we will probably know more about him life than Ned Stark when George has finished his planned material.  I also want to say I am not suggesting different timelines here. What has happened has already happened. There won't be any paradoxes.  And I must say. If my theory is correct. George is hands down one of the most genious storytellers who ever lived.    nbsp;  **PROLOGUE**  To get started, here's 7 feet of tinfoil, make yourself a rugged but practical Greathelm and get in the saddle. Because we are are going on an adventure.   I think it's safe to say we are all waiting for The Winds of Winter. Before reading any further. Contemplate this for a moment. Who do you think sends the Winds, little lord?  We can all agree that tWoW will take Bran much deeper into the magical world, and I have always (even before I came up with this theory) believed that will be on such a scale the reader at this point has never witnessed or even dared to imagine. The winds he sends will be so significant they will be an entire aspect of the title of the whole book. While the whole idea could and most likely will be complete nonsense. (one cup of self-distance every other day is healthy for your mental stability) It would be super-duper-mega-cool if this where to be proven right. So I beg of you. Bear with me for a moment.    **THE THEORY**  The magical abilities Bran possess is undoubtedly incredible. Jojen shat his pants when discovering he could take control of Hodor. Something even he had never heard was possible(?) Bran has had very little real training up to this point, and he has but gotten a few glimpses of what warging and Weirwood.net is capable of. We have seen him go far back in time, watching his father and sending him some rustling leaves, and Theon even heard him speak. I have a I think that will change. Bloodraven most certainly will teach Bran everything he knows, and I would bet he knows more than anyone (for now). How BR will show and teach Bran what he needs to know is totally unknown at this point though, and that is what my theory is all about.  I think he will take Bran back in time to when he was Brynden Rivers. He will get to study the life of a Targaryen prince. And, most importantly (for Bran and this theory anyway) is to let Bran do that from the eyes of a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.. And what a Knight he will be/was! "Three whole pages for Ser Duncan the Tall.." The few times Dunk is mentioned in the novels they speak of him as one of the most honorable Knights who ever lived.  Towards what ultimate goal is Bloodraven doing this then? He will gain Bran's trust when fulfilling his deepest wish, he will show Bran that he is Brynden Rivers, A Targaryen bastard and not just a dude in a tree. Bran will be the one escorting Branden Rivers to the wall and he will also be at Summerhall, one of the series larger mysteries and the reveal will most likely be some sort of twist. The weirdest thing about this must be that he will fall in love with young Old Nan...  It makes me think Bran might learn to do what Hodor does when he's getting waged. crawl up in a corner where he cannot reach him. But he can vaguely feel his presence. Just controlling minor things that doesn't scare the crap out him.  Now, I have gotten the subtle impression GRRM has a secret love for foreshadowing. So here's what I can remember. Making it all fit together if you tilt your head a little to the left while squinting your eyes.   nbsp;  **FORESHADOWING**  - "The Sworn Sword", Duncan the Tall: *"Go home! All of you! Back to your villages, and see if the fire's spared your homes and crops." "It was if some God had put the word in my mouth.* **Not the warrior.** *Was there a god of fools?"*  That bold line felt so out of context and the *"Not the Warrior"* -part was what sparked this whole theory when I read The Sworn Sword on my way to Spain for a vacation.  This happens when they are drilling the farmers, and is the most notorious foreshadowing I will present. And it is certainly not the first time Dunk has behaved impulsive. We know Bran is very kind to his smallfolk when serving as "Lord of Winterfell" And I can not see why Dunk would think about the gods in a moment like this. He is not a very pious man what I can recall.  **farfetched you say?** well this is the Hound to Arya: *"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe we'll make it in time for your uncle's bloody wedding."* I try to remember that this is George, and he is the grandmaester of subtle (subtle) hints.  - **"Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall."** That is something he gets called, and often think about himself. We don't know really except it insultes Dunk's intelligence sounds extremely catchy. Him being a big fella makes it really fitting.   nbsp;  **But let's take a step back.** In A Game of Thrones first chapters, a lot of focus lies on Bran's climbing the Walls of Winterfell. Of course it all leads up to the fall, but it is very explicitly describes how Bran has climbed them so often he knows every stone in Winterfell so well he could probably climb them sleeping (paraphrasing). With the loss of his legs, he can't climb the Castle Walls anymore which he loved almost as much as his dream of being a Knight. But he get's part of his ability to move back with the help of Hodor. And even though this is a long shot. I can't see "Thick as a Castle Wall" as just a joke on his name. Not after I was taken from behind by "Not the Warrior"   - *"You will never walk again, but you will fly"* It is established in the first chapter of A Game of Thrones that this boy is dreaming of the glory and the tourneys. But it doesn't end there. I would say Bran thinks about his crushed dream of becoming a Knight more times than you could count, and I see that as a reminder that it is something he has not gotten over yet. Bloodraven quote here has the literal meaning. "You will Warg dragons". And it has the hidden meaning. That he will do more than he ever dreamed was possible.  - Bran's last chapter has some crazy visions. Ned basically confirms R+L=J, we get to see Lyanna fighting (I think?), possibly foretelling that she is tKotLT. We see a mystical pregnant woman who wants revenge. And we see The First men about to make a human sacrifice. (All these could and most likely is Bran's family and ancestors)  And then we see Old Nan kissing Dunk... (I suspect) Why is that important? Why are we shown that along with his family? What is Hodor if not just a way for Bran to get to point B? Why does BR first show him members of his family, and then a Hedge Knight secretly travelling with a prince?  - ASOIAF is pretty unique in it's point of view storytelling. And while the complete history of the Targaryens (tPaTQ and tRP) is written as an in universe history book. The Stories of Dunk and Egg is written from the perspective of Dunk.  - The first scene in The Hedge Knight. Ser Arlan is dead, leaning against a tree. I don't see GRRM just making it so because it's cool. It must have a purpose, like everything else he writes.  **GRRM is planning 9 novellas about Dunk's life as a knight.** He released The Hedge Knight the same year as A Clash of Kings, 1998. And I can not fathom why he would begin writing a separate story at the same time. If the two stories were not heavily intertwined and important for the whole story I don't think he would have written the whole thing as a separate trilogy. (that is what Dunk and Egg will become when it's finished) Releasing it parallel with the novels could implicate it is really important to know about Dunk and what he did when you get to reading the later part of asoiaf.  **Also remember who has the first chapter, and remember GRRM's and Bran's extreme love for knights.** http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/  P.S.  This could actually fall under the same theory as Bran in some way being Bran the Builder and/or some of the other notorious Brandons. Particulary Bran the Burner. His father went away and didn't return. His son Bran the Burner reacted pretty childish to me.. Setting all remaining ship ablaze. That sounds incredibly impulsive and something he probably regretted dearly after, just as Dunk regretted causing the trial by seven.  EPILOGUE  Now it's time for everyone to shoot my imaginative ass down (I put a lot of effort into this, so shoot me gently). Otherwise add something. (I would like to read every Bran chapter word for word.. Got any knowledge of him wishing to be taller?) **Discussion is all we have until date unknown, and I wish to cherish that.**  **If you don't agree** If you don't agree with this at all (say so, and then join the discussion about Hodor and Dunk. I would like to hear other theories about what the point is of him being the descendant of possibly the most honorable knight in history and why that never being discussed!   How could I not make that connection... Oh well. The answer is my sigil.   I know that. I didn't base this on the data, I based it on my own personal experience. Someone posted it in a comment and I added it because it was a terribly relevant study that seems very well done.   lol. My thought exactly when reading a third of all posts. (But we are still here aren't we :D)  I will cherish the day an announcement arrive. This sub will be **on fire**, and the spirits will be as high as the wall,  (**touch wood**(more like banging my head against my coffetable))   What a wingman I have. I was ready to give up that argument!   I agree, you shouldn't vote on every post. You should vote if you think the post should to be acknowleged. And you should vote thereafter.  It feels like people think I made this thread fishing for upvotes. I just thought it worth to point this out.    Thanks! So I may be on to something here? I feel people are mostly serious on this sub (hypethreads aside) Ironically enough, this post has lost about 7 golden dragons in the last 30 minutes...  **It truly is useless to try making the world a better place.**   Because Baelish says "I know, I know" in a certain way. Could be nothing though, but I made the thread because there are bound to be others I have missed, and someone has certainly picked one or two up.   Yeah, of course I hope ^^But I am so tired of being disappointed. People must have thought he would write the next book quickly since the end of aSoS...   Oh, didn't think about that! Three is a good number, but it could very well be a little nod towards it!   If you think it is troll, absolutely. If you think he is serious, **correct him or let someone with more energy do it. Someone most likely will.**   I think they should add it as a possible murder-weapon in Clue.   Really?! Well. Yes I could very easlily see that as true.   I first noticed how people did this after typing up my own tinfoil theory for two hours in bed on my Padphone.... I think I would have at least 30-40 less downvotes if people knew about how to use the buttons.  **And I am pretty sure I'm not the first to have typed up a long post** really putting in an effort to make it readable and easy to follow. Just to have it downvoted because people disagrees, making it slide down the pages much faster.   **this is exactly what I mean!**  it doesn't matter if your post is misinformed, far-fetched or dumb! As long as you make your point, don't break the rules or make a rude comment and most importantly **DON'T TROLL** people shouldn't downvote you no matter how stupid the post is. (Well.. There are exceptions confirming the rules)  **And that is what you and many others hasn't understood.   People downvote posts because they think what the OP asks, states or thinks is misinformed and or just doesn't agree with their opinion.  And all this brings down interesting discussions.     And for some time to fuel the flying flamethrowers.   nice one!   And he writes slow.   Great post, but thinking aDoS will be easy for him to write is pretty naive of you. **If it will truly be the last book** he will want to get everything completely perfect. That's just the way he is. We've known that for a long time.  If he isn't pleased with what he has written, he will rewrite it. And he will do it again, again, again, again, again. Then he will change it completely.   I don't see her having time to conquer north Essos before the series end. I hope she unites Slavers Bay and make it Unslavers Bay. Setting in motion the abolishing of slavery in the entire world. Then leaving for the east.   I'd say skipping the first book is the worst book to skip!   A lot of cool characters are cut from the books, but I think the writers plant references and homages to characters they had to leave out. My find is the scene when Tyrion and Littlefinger are talking about rewarding Podrick Payne in S03E03  This caught my attention.  T: "did fuck her once."  B: "I know."  T: "But we don't."  B: "I know"  Baelish changed his voice in a way that made me think it was a reference to Patchface. I don't know if it is something everyone noticed but I was pretty astonished!    I am still hoping Benjen will be a prologue/epilogue in a future book.   Ilyn Payne would indeed be really cool! Would love to know what goes on inside his head.  Those chances are pretty slim though I suspect.   Hoping tWoW will shatter this with Bran! The magic is one of my favourite aspects of the universe, but maybe that is because it is so mysterious.   I would think others who are well versed in english history (I am not) has already made this connection, but I havn't heard about it anywhere.  It sounds to fitting to be a coincidence, particulary since I am pretty sure Richard III is an inspiration for a couple of characters in the series from what I have read elsewhere.   Well of course. I was of the impression that was obvious considering it's a 700-page book shown in ten hours. But it was my mistake I wasn't clear in what I meant.   Well, I put it wrong. Almost every scene in the show is take directly from the book. Even the dialogues are pretty much the same.     I agree. It's far more vague in the show though. Some showwatchers who aren't as hardcore as us hasn't figured out the difference at all...   With the shattered sword in the prologue, I think GRRM tried his very best to make it as noticeable as possible ;)   When I first saw that name I thought it was a wink to Tolkien and Frodo's alias **Underhill**. That was before I knew that he reffered to Hugor of the Hill though.  Honestly, I still think it is an homage!   I'd say "all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again" is already happening. More or less?   And I know the reason why that is.  **Upvotes/Downvotes are NOT Reddit's version of Facebook's "like button" (Or the much wanted dislike-button).**  (**Yes, I realize this post could be subject of extreme irony**.)  I think people on this subreddit misuse the downvotes incredibly often. People put a lot of effort in putting out theories, asking good questions and starting discussions about this and that, only to have the posts downvoted to the bottom by people who just doesn't agree.  **And I think that hurts this sub a whole lot!**   So, I provided the rules (not more like guidelines. actual rules) for votes. Which actually are pretty hard to find if you are not an experienced redditor.   - **Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, **rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.**  - Please don't Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.  - Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.  **FAQ**   ##24. Someone made a mistake in their post or comment! **Did they even read the book? Should I downvote them?** No. If you can do it nicely, feel free to correct them and move on. If you cant do it nicely, just move on.   **To my astonishment** jsdistasio **pointed out that this sub is one of the most downvoting on Reddit as a research done about a year ago points out.**  http://blog.getredditalerts.com/reddit-sentiment-analysis/    I'd say all of essos payed up together, hiring the FM to make it go kaboom.   Warg Bran teached him / Was Brandon the Builder all along.   Missing the House of the Undying, "promise me Ned", book Stannis and Patchface? Shame on you :)   First book is almost scene by scene. By the third book most things are changed, although they mostly arrive at the same point.  I know you are tempted to skip forward. Some of my friends have, and they have missed so much **You must bring yourself to read the books** though. You need to learn what Daenerys is thinking. Emilia Clarke doesn't portray her character as well as I wish she would. And Ned's chapters are gold. Just pure gold!  And of course what everyone already mentioned. All the prophecies, foreshadowing and backstory. First and second book as a lot of those. Particulary House of the Undying is very different from the show.   If they are talking about dead men, it's a **wight.**  And every time **Others** enter the stage, everything freezes to ice unnaturally fast. And when they are spotted, the POV-character pretty much shit their pants.*   I would say it's slower. But I prefer listening sometimes. Awesome while driving, making the dishes or cleaning the apartment.  **Some people doesn't like Roy Dotrice as a reader though. But I quite love him!**  I would say it is not the best way to consume the series if you are interested in theories and such. You miss hidden details whie listening and can't stay and go back a line to analyze.   Quite possible. Had not heard that before. A little like how the peace with Dorne was brokered?   Dragons    Holy shit. Didn't he burn the ships because his father died or something?!  Burning your whole fleet seems just as impulsive as punching a prince in the face.  Would a grown man really do these things?    This is certanly new, but I would think there would be at least small foreshadowings and/or hints towards it. I am a bit of a theorizzeeer myself though, so I don't blame you for letting your imagination run wild!  I don't see George introducing people aging backwards more than halfway into the series. That would be super weird.   There are probably a lot of huge fans out there who read the books but hasn't experienced the greatness of **The Tales of Dunk and Egg.**  I want to take this moment to fully acknowledge the fantastic quality of the three published novellas and I urge fans who have not read them to do so.  It is a much softer read than the novels and I would say the quality of the stories are spectacular. You really sympathize with Duncan, and I would say they are mostly pretty feel-good. Something that is rare in this universe we all adore so much.  No one of my friends who are fans have read The Tales of Dunk and Egg yet (despite my warm recommendations), and  I suspect because it is because they have no idea who those characters are (only being mentioned a couple of times in the novels).  **Do yourself a favor and read them. You won't regret it.**   Read Dunk and Egg asap. They are weirdly by-looked.   Yes. Mace Tyrell is not fool, as the show want's us to believe. And I think their words are really fitting. They are ambitious as hell. Probably more so than the Freys. But they have patience.   He was called that because he was the last Dayne King.  It's like "The King Who Knelt"   Healthy perspective.   Isn't passionate about them? I'd say he is incredibly passionate about promoting new writers in Sci-Fi and Fantasy so editing collections and anthologies seems to really be his thing. And he totally loves Wild Cards what I understand.   I'd say the Manderly's have more money than the Starks. But that's just a wild guess.   What has happen has already happend. Timelines would ruin everything and will not happen at all.   I'll take it!   Really!? Didn't notice that one! Anyone wants to find the paragraph? I don't have the book with me home over christmas (It's actually already released as a bound book in Sweden) :)   That would make me happy, and sad.    You make me feel so shiny!    Really?....    That's how a season begins though right? :)    Read Bran's last chapter when I sees Winterfell. He sees Eddard and it practically confirms Jon Snow to be the dude we all know.  It's regarded as a fact for a reason   No. It doesn't spoil the events it's spoils the history.   **I'd say reading it as a watcher-only would enhance your view on the entire saga.** It's such a vast world.    Stop. I don't want to think about this..  II'd like to think the ask George stuff, but mostly I think they are going on it alone. D D knows the rough outline, and considering many of the deviations in S4 I'd say they are doing their thing to get to the end In a way possible for them.   Oh yes! Ser Duncan the **Tall** probably the furthest you could come from a cripple, simple minded. Possibly Hodor's great-grandfather or something, making it more (somewhat more) believable for Bran to be able "warg" a person from history.   We also know he has interactions with BR.  More crackpot is that it may be revealed in the next book, and that's why Dunk and Egg 4 was postponed and replaced with The Princess and the Queen. Supposedly the next Dunk and Egg will take place in Winterfell/The North    So you have reached denial huh?    If you read twoiaf you will appreciate the books history references so much more!    It is known.    Dany says fuck Westeros, I will stay in essos and banish slavery everywhere.    Varys. Oh, and Hodor.    'cus she wanted to get rid of that bun in her oven before telling?    My own precious tinfoil theory spins on your comment a bit.   It has been stated several, several times Bran wants to be a Knight. And I think Bloodraven will let him be one in the past as a lesson in treestuff.   My theory actually has one line that vaguely hints at this being true.  **Please, ask me who the Knight is. Please. Please.**   Since Christmas origins from the pagan holiday occurring when the days begin to grow longer again, I would think it unlikely, since there is no way to predict when that is going to be in Westeros.    To ensure he would not incite a civil war, he made it doubly impossible for him to take the crown. Probably even more honorable than Ned now that I think of it.    Well, Homo Sapiens used to screw the neanderthal, but that was also a long time ago...    This here is a perfect example to show you that you shouldn't listen to everything that people posts about this series. No matter how well read they may seem.    Brandon the Builder, AKA GRRM's cheap way of explaining why Starks have no naval power.   As the gate is on my doorstep, I send 1000 men to strengthen Vale's defences.   Your Grace.       You have 1000 men from Strongsong my liege.   I will send 1000 men from Strongsong to accompany you.   There should be a max amount of tradeagreements simultaneously. And there should be resources. Stone, Steel, Grains, Fish, Wood and Gold? 6-10 resources should be enough? Cattle and horses?   If this should lead to aggressive negotiations, the Cinder's would be glad to lead the vanguard of the Vale to victory. I am certain the north pretenders will bend the knee to the Starks though.   I greet you my lord. Know that the men and women Strongsong stand behind you.   The Cinder's of Strongsong stands behind Lord Sheridan of the Vale. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell, and the Starks has ruled the North since before the Andals arrived.   [OOC] I am a first time player as well, and has taken a holdfast in the Vale, playing as a "new" family.    The Vale will prevail.   We have united the clansmen the in the valley of The Vale, what dangers may lie east of the mountains is unsure. A small escort of a dozen knights and squires may seem appropriate for seeing lady Baratheon safely though the east.   Lord Royce, we share the same ancestors in the first lords of The Vale, and we salut you as family.     too soon.   I will try this out. Hope fore some good developments in a week or so ;)   With the growing tension in the realm and concidering the incident at Duskendale 276AC. I Lord Burk Cinder of House Cinder wishes to swear fealty to you, Lord Sheridan. The new Lord of the Vale. My ancestors have lived in these mountains since the Dawn Age. And we wish you to consider us some of your most loyal bannermen,  The King has not been seen leaving the Red Keep for 4 years. Stange tales are being told about his mental health. We must stand together to face the times to come.   **The Vale must prevail!**   A rugged, very tall knight from across the table gave him a clout on the ear. And Bern dared not look up to the hosting families. Ever Again.   Some southern jester with colorful clothes.   Well Lord Cinder has been mindin' his own business, pinching his wife in the ass and laughing at the drunk fool at the head at the table. T'was the eldest son of Lord Cinder who laid eyes upon the fair Lady Lorella. Noone except Lady Lorella notced the incident and therefore no one could blame him for it.   Or call them Japes or a sign of disrespect of any kind.  	105

I shared my experience and opened the conversation for him to share what is great about the place. Reddit can get really knee jerk stupid sometimes.    Queue the tumblr this pill is rape claims   1. Did you even read the 2nd amendment.  It clearly says "in a well regulated militia"  2. To be fair, internet, modern postal service, and the likes aren't really able to be used to deprive people of life.    3. Yes... they wrote it exactly for that, I already said that more than once. except most of the threats at the time were bands of indians, and military units (both rogue units and enemy units).      Why?  Each amendment stands alone.   The wording of any other amendment has no bearing on the 2nd amendment.      It clearly says "well regulated militia"     That does [not] mean to our forefathers that people need assault rifles with shitloads of rounds in them.   There was no such thing as a machine gun when it was originally written.   To them. a firearm was slow... heavy... and not very deadly in a singular form.  It wasn't until entire miitary units, firing muskets together as one, that they became effective in bringing death.    So you have to think... they didn't write the amendment with the idea in mind that one weapon in the future could kill far more people than 50 men firing muskets could.  They wrote it with the idea that communities could defend themselves without waiting for a military unit that could be weeks away (or never coming).  The idea was that public communities would own and regulate the weapons use... rather than allowing single individuals to build stockpiles of powerful weapons that were in no way managed by anyone other than that individual.   The forefathers were VERY MUCH about preventing any ONE MAN from holding too much power, but that MANY MEN TOGETHER (the people or the public) would hold the power.        The locked down devices prevent you from continuing to use your device on a new carrier.  So even once your agreement is done, the carrier still controls your phone.  So you paid money for something you don't fully own.  If you bought the non carrier unlocked model...you could still enjoy your device.   Many of the non carrier models have a wider range of bands they can use as well.      Triple shot u pussy.  And it has to be shaped like a boot for no fucking reason at all.   yeah but spread out over 30 sec   I always thought the 2nd amendment wording was strange.   To me it reads not as a right for every man to have a gun, but was the right for a civilian population to organize into a well regulated militia and stockpile arms for that militia.     The supreme court had other ideas I guess.    Edit: I'm not saying the supreme court is wrong in their interpretation.  I just think the original wording indicated a little bit more organization to owning weapons than simply straight up no checks or balance of power between individuals.    I don't think they wanted the GUNS GUNS GUNS dystopia the NRA (and their arms dealers support) would prefer having.    I say this as both a gun owner and member of the NRA. (which was a very different NRA when I joined)   Well it's too late for that now.  For all we know the manager could have been in on it... no matter what their gender is.

You can't sue when the police arrive and find zero evidence to your claims.     Don't be a weak little shit.  When somone does this shit.  You go outside call the police and wait for them to arrive.  Don't challenge the violator because they'll just delete the pics.   YOu want evidence.          Why would you have NOT called the police immediately????  Way to go.  You're exactly the kind of victim he was looking for.    Now it's a LOT harder for them to actually do anything about it.  Especially now that his manager gives him the heads up to delete it so that the store isn't liable.       Now this is what I was looking for..  Instead of "it just does" answer.     Thank you for your great information.  I can now safely vote on this issue without feeling like my ignorance can do more harm than good.       I just thought i'd share that someone standing behind me saw the thumbnail to this and said "that guy is looking at big black cocks on his phone."      Thanks.....   My reply "that's texas beef!" didn't really make it sound any better....     It would be nice if some people from /r/dataisbeautiful could get in on these numbers and make us some visuals.

Can you show me where this inheritance tax benefits lower income people or reduces wealth disparity.      This is awesome info thanks so much!     You don't buy the carrier phone.   You buy the unlocked models sold by third parties or Samsung itself.    There is no bloatware on these devices.     The fact that it was a problem in the past makes the problems you illustrated more able to stand unresisted.      SO I get a little miffed when I see people saying "This has been happening for a while" as if its just some small standard annoyance to our civilization.  When it should be MORE ALARMING that it's been going on for so long.     You're not buying a 2 year agreement when you buy a non carrier phone.     And you don't have bloatware.    You know why bloatware companies pay to reduce the cost of the phone?   It doesn't matter if you don't use their software.  They still make profit off the data the software on the phone is allowed to acccess.    So no...it's not FREE.  They FORCE you to give them something.   And you don't even get a device you fully control in exchange or the freedom to change carriers with that phone once you're agreement is done.   So you don't own it.... you paid verizon to own your phone for you and tell you what you can and cannot do with it. And in this case... the carriers are telling people that their devices must not be secure.   That's a big fucking expensive problem.   The money you save from not being locked into a contract alone is enough to cover the subsidized nonsense.   Before I quit that I couldn't get new phones.  Now, I pay my full price phones down in 6 to 8 months (sometimes less) and get an upgrade.   And my monthly bills for phone service have been about half on account of the buying power I gained from freedom.        Ugh... every place I'll be near I just barely miss it!   ARggg...     Yeah, nobody wants a dick with a vagina on it.     That's why you cheat on her.  Then she won't care about the grandma thing anymore.

I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines.  Woman comes to me asking what she should do.  Woman is in her mid 50's and obese   The wound was full of green and yellow puss before I washed it out with a bottle of saline from a first aid field kit.    It took a good hour and half to get all the crap out of it.  I expected it to look a lot worse before I began cleaning the gunk off but here it is clean:  http://i.imgur.com/fUN36HG.jpg  She says the wound is from Cellulosis.  She had this hole in her back for 4 or 5 weeks before visiting a doctor; who upon seeing the injury administered to her a pneumococcal vaccination as treatment.  Seems odd to me but I'm no doc so...    (In a seperate case, this doctor gave a diagnosis of "weak lungs" to a 5 year old boy and placed him on anti-tuberculosis medication.  The boy was not recovering and during a visit to the emergency room was diagnosed and treated for pneumonia.  He recovered quickly at that point)  Back to the woman... After her vaccination she then came down with high fever and was generally unwell but managed to recover after 2 weeks of illness before coming to me.     This is the wound now at 7 weeks old.   Is this something that needs to be stitched closed?  Do I need to transport her 8 hours away to the big hospital?  I don't really know what I'm doing... or how to bandage anything properly.  I just made a flat square of guaze and tape to keep it covered.  But I'm afraid the guaze will stick inside... eek.     This is why I work Logistics.     That's the best entourage money can buy!  It's like they are all panting and following him around, just waiting for him to poop out another little golden dingle berry, so they can all dive for it at once.       It really does look like the ill fitting suit store just ran out of merchandise.      Where do they get their hair cut?  [Fantastic Sams](http://assets.bigdealsmedia.net/images/13452.JPG)?      They probably didn't even contemplate making it this far.  It was all "repent before thy Lord" and Judgement Day.      Hello World.    There I did it in notepad.   It works.     Zzzzzzz   You misunderstood.  The wave is not pushing it back and forth.   The point of convergence between the two interstellar medium and solar wind is what changes; moving past voyager while voyager maintains is heading.    This turbulent nature of the convergence of the two mediums is the most commonly expressed reason here.        THe water and air simulation is just to visually represent the fluid dynamics that happens at the convergence point where the two separate mediums collide.    What the simulation shows is that the border between the two is turbulent and not just some instant border change.   THAT'S IT.  It never LEFT as the media expressed it.  It just explains WHY the readings are occurring(and being misreported) while it passes through the convergence point.     If you're going to refute a point, try not to change it entirely from what it is first.  Trying to act like I was saying it pushes voyager back and forth.... LOL   Never once did I say it was exiting and re-entering.  I only referred to its time spent in the turbulent convergence zone of the two mediums.        .   He really is right.  I remember being young and having the perception of a song that I had been listening to on my walkman... and then have my view totally changed after having seen the video.     Then, whenever I heard the song, the imagery was just echos of the video.     Really kinda takes the magic away.   I'm super nerd and super leet cool guy that should be allowed to use both flare at same time.  Edit: on a side...ehem... *note*:  The Exynos is better than SD.   /ducks and covers.      Awww look at the lesbian couple behind them!     Edit: Why would you down vote this?  They have the same sweet expression of young love as the hetero couple.   Its CUTE!    True.  But the LOSS occurs from being locked into 2 year agreements and not being able to shift carriers as desired to take advantage of promotions.    Also, the alternatives to subsidized (like edge) come with a huge hidden interest cost where the user pays MORE for the phone than it's regular cost than they would if they just utilized the interest rate on a credit card.   (not to mention the payment flexibility)  And then there is the added loss of dealing with problems caused by purchasing a locked down device that has bloatware on it and you're stuck with a broken device.  Sometimes the bloatware causes such huge problems with battery life the phone has to be replaced.   Again... time lost and time is money.    If you are unable to afford a phone without selling your soul to a phone company for 2 years (or paying HUGE early upgrade fees) then you should not be purchasing a premium phone.     The subsidized phones do two things.  Make 3rd parties free money and imprison customers to their carrier.   That's it.  (3 things if you count not being able to be fixed at home)   Its much cheaper to buy it through credit card.  *And also many non carrier phone dealers will have payment plans on premium unlocked phones.*  Many of these dealers will forgive credit problems with a small downpayment.  Also, waiting to buy 4 or 5 months after release is a good way to get refurbished phones that are in brand new condition for a fraction of the cost.     If he checked and confirmed he should have broken up right then.     There is no excuse to ever intrude upon a persons private space and snoop through their things unless their VERY LIFE is in danger.    If it ended up she was completely innocent, then he is just some crazy snooper stalker guy.   How creepy is that?      What?    Its wrong in showing how fluid dynamics work in a turbulent shockwave?  Uhhh no.  It was something shown at a Nye and Tyson talk to kids to get them to understand about theories behind how the shockwave works.   The water represents the interstellar medium of space.  The air blowing outwards represents the solar wind pushing it back.     Is it EXACTLY what happens?   NO..... duh.   but it is good at showing some of the laws behind how it works.      Next time don't just say "you're wrong" and walk out.  WTF is that????    The article was quoting a forensics investigator who stated that this was about how long it took for them to develop the exploits.    Which is true about... We see the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 being revealed today a huge exploit allowing remote access to data even if it is encrypted.  That phone is about 9 months old.   No security is perfect.  [Source](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/03/25/291925559/your-smartphone-is-a-crucial-police-tool-if-they-can-crack-it)      there was a longer article I am having a bit of trouble finding.  It appears some debates got out of hand and deleted.      Why would it change.  I stopped doing the subsidized thing with phones 2 years ago after reading a similar post.      I SAVED MONEY.   That means i've been able to upgrade more often whilst my income actually went down.      Good to know.  Thanks!   Why would that be the answer?     The answer should be to find out if she is cheating using less intrusive means.  It's not hard to figure out someone is cheating.  It's as simple as "i have to work today" when you really dont.     The ends do not justify the means even if the ends justify an action be taken.   Two wrongs don't make a right.  Neither person here had any respect for the other.  So fucking break up and hopefully they'll both learn not to be dickheads in the future.     You can tell it's a frat samurai on account of the salmon colored armor.      Elsewhere in this subreddit is a whole discussion w/sources where they say they can.     The police can just hook a device up to phones older than 8 or 12 months and unlock them because most have exploits by that age.    The only ones they have to send to apple are new ones of which they get partial data from.  after about 8 or 9 months, exploits are developed and the police update their little tool.    They don't need shit to get you data.  So it doesn't matter if you do fingerprint or iris or pin code... or what your legal protections are for them physically forcing you to unlock the phone.... it.... doesn't....matter.   They have your data if they want it.     People STOP BUYING SUBSIDIZED PHONES!     All you get is a 2 year pain in the ass agreement that you can never be free from if you want to afford the upgrade.    just buy the unlocked version on a credit card and pay it down in 4 months.   If you STILL can't afford it, then you should be doing something with your money other than buying a premium phone.    There's a lot of places selling unlocked devices that offer financing too.      its because of the code it changes within the system processes or configuration files to allow itself.  Even if you remove the app, the separate code is there there able to be accessed.    Now if the carriers didn't lock people's bootloaders down, everyone would have had a custom recovery installed and flashed a clean rom by now.  But once again all this hold handing the carriers do to "protect users" has actually put them at greater risk.     And because the carriers have a real dick up their ass about letting manufacturers keep their devices up to date, a patch to fix it is just kicking it on the shelf at samsung.  Meanwhile the carrier just lets all their users phones shit the bed.     We need the FTC to step in and say enough is enough.  Get the carrier out of the way.  All it needs to do is connect my call.  There is NOTHING about the software on the phone that will fuck that up.  The ONLY approval they should have over updates is when the update is to the radio.  But what's funny is, they don't even need to do that because unlocked users flash those all the time with no problems.    There has not been a single case of modified phone software harming the network.  On the other hand, there seems be a shitload of locked down phones harming users going on.      You're on the exynos though... the article only lists the American carrier models as the ones at risk.  The international carrier free phones did not come with swiftkey.  Only samsung and google. (my 910c only came w/samsung)  swiftkey is different.  Swiftkey made a special bloatware version specifically for carrier model samsung phones.   This bloatware ended up being a bloated sack of ever expanding shitdemon.   People, If you're on a carrier phone, and you were required to get it contracted to afford it... STOP DOING THAT!  Buy the unlocked versions only. Better to put it on a credit card and pay it down over 3 or 4 months than to get locked into a 2 year aggreement and no control over your own shit.    Don't let the carriers do this shit anymore.  People don't want bloatware for a good fucking reason and this is the biggest fucking one.      Accident warranty only covers it if you haven't voided your warranty, you are correct.    People should just save that money and spend it on insurance instead.  ESPECIALLY if you root or play with bootloaders; you should have the 3rd party insurance.  its only 99 bucks to replace it if you brick it.     To be fair, it wasn't TRYING to kill humans.   It was just trying to fuck one of them.  Then it succeeded by using a bald lady to fuck Fred Jones.   http://i.imgur.com/ahUOSDI.jpg    A good representation would be to take bowl of water and a straw.  Blow straight down softly until an indentation appears and grows slightly.     If you observe the edges of this indentation expanded and shrink rapidly.    The edge of the termination shock is sort of doing the same thing... which is where voyager is. It's not leaving just returning readings of the turbulent convergence point of the two medium of interstellar space and solar wind.       It is caught in the turbulence of the edge.     Edit: clarifications.   away from it.    No, you dote, Voyager is in the Gamma Quadrant.  Broccoli hasn't rescued them yet!        No.    Because the people who can figure out how to do it will go to XDA or Rootzwiki and follow information that already exists.    If you do it here, every derp in the world will try it, then fail... only furthering the cause the carriers have to continue locking this stuff down.       Clinton's thighs look like a couple of pigs fighting over a McDonald's milkshake.     Thus enters the Patriot Act and all that secret court shit.   Apple cannot unencrypt the system portion of the device.  That requires your password as the key.     The rest is not encrypted in the same manner and for whatever reasons likely to remain secret, Apple is able to respond to these warrants with retrieval of partial data.    All these companies were required to keep backdoors in shit because of the Patriot Act.      Ahhh the height I saw the world as a child....   Thank you.      I don't think I can let it go for that.     Well okay just give us a call when you get really desperate and we'll shave another five bucks off just because your back is against the wall.  I'm sorry we couldn't do business together, good luck feeding your kids.     Great my thumb burst through and now i need stitches.     WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHERE YOU BUY UNDERWEAR?! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?! UNDERWEAR IS UNDERWEAR! IT IS UNDERWEAR WHEREVER YOU BUY IT! IN CINCINNATI OR WHEREVER!!   If it is encrypted, they can get it unencrypted by apple with a warrant.   They don't get 100 percent of data but they get anything that is important.  TXT messages, phone records, contacts, and media files.     They cannot get into the system of the phone though.   So they "don't get 100 percent"    The ends do not justify the means.     I was cutting other peoples yards for 20 bucks a pop at 9 years old in 1988....  Edit: I just realized that some summers between 9 years old and 16 I made more money than I did at 18 working retail 40 hrs week.      This is why you **ALWAYS smell the wine before tasting it.**  It'll stop you from drinking wine that has already turned to vinegar too....   Staying together and making it work does not equal total trust again.    No matter how long it's been.... it'll always be there.  In the back of your mind.    You can't unlearn it.     You could spend 40 years afterwards in a completely blissful marriage.  And if the cheater were to go alone into a room with another female... or drive with one in his car... Or on his walk you see him wave hello to the lady down the street and she returns his greeting with a big sloppy tongue kiss....   you'd wonder.  and if you say you wouldn't you're a damn liar or a fool.      Edit: All kidding aside. you'd still wonder even if all the actions were innocent.  You'd still wonder if you need to wonder.  Past experience guides future behavior.  You really don't just undo betrayal.        Even if they aren't cheating; once you stoop to secretly checking the other persons private things, the trust can never come back.   Snooping email, text messages, looking through their files, and combing through their internet history is wrong.  Don't do it.        They could be completely innocent, and you're snooping through their things.   The relationship is over at that point because the communication is not there.  Neither is the respect.       Its clear she is a liar.  Not really sure how you could think anything else...     ok then.  thanks!   Girlfriends don't have to be ~~alive~~ real.   Edit:  Wait that looks bad.  I mean... get a doll or a fleshlight then.   They won't cook you eggs or cuddle but they are always awake and ready.

Its just.......   BOOM.       its too complicated.     Just say, "These aren't yours?"     When she says no...throw them in disgust, freak out and start washing your face.    She already knows you were sniffing the panties.  Girls are too smart to believe all that complicated nonsense. The best lie is the simplest lie.

Keep the patient distracted at least.... it'll make everything else so much easier.  Rather than deal with a pissed up, uncooperative, angry patient.....   Dammit it was almost out and this post made it crawl back up....   you know stuff....thats cool   Ah ok.  That makes sense then.  Thanks!   Reddit is neat.      Uh yes he was.  He created a whole type of warfare called ["hard war"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/rethinking-shermans-march/?_r=0) that involved starving civilians to death and shelling innocent towns.    He stripped the civilian population of food on his march... even though he had more food than his soldiers could consume.  They'd take it anyway.     The only people he did not kill were the one's that got out of his way and allowed him to brutalize others.  If you resisted at all, say to protect your last remaining cow, you and your whole family were dead.    So it's often said "Sherman's March did not include mass killings"   That's true.  Instead, they were precision targeted killings.  Personal vendetta killings.  A die in a fire killings.   Killings of the most desperate who's backs were against the wall.  Ultimately, [his idea of war](http://www.historynet.com/general-william-tecumseh-sherman) was to make innocent civilians suffer as much as possible before they died.    Also, Sherman seeded the term, "The only good indian is a dead indian" as a shortened version of his original words ""The only good Indians I ever saw were dead."     So yeah... he loved killing.  And he loved it to be close and personal.   [And he loved inflicting as much hardship and pain as possible before doing so. Because his desire was to "make them howl."](http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/shermans-march)    I'm in Southern Leyte philippines.... we aren't exactly riding the bandwidth super highway here on a shitty Edge network that is commonly slower than 1x.

 All of them are our heroes and Simo is also one of the greatest. But there is still so many forgetten hero who was even greater.   Well I know Simo Hyh... I am finnish after all. But if you compare the balls you need to take alone 10tanks with birch logs versus shooting people from the distance I think it is over hype. Simo wasnt even awarded with war award (mannerheimin ristinritari) even it was proposed. The award is given to those who show enormous courage in battle. There was multiple fins with no single media attentation who fough with ten times bigger balls than hyh. Specially those in command/guerilla troops (kaukopartio) who fought behind enemy lines. They splitted russians troops on road with machine gun and when russians were in small groups they took them one by one. Kaukopartio troops were also the reason fins had more guns/ammunations/tanks in the end of war than in the begin.   I think white dead is kinda over hype. There is actually multiple awarded veteran (mannehriemin ristinritari) who stopped tanks with birch logs. Some of them actually stopped almost 10 tanks in one battle. Some of them even went top of tank and knocked the hatch and said "death is knocking".   It was so cold that if you got wound your blood circulation stopped almost instantly and you died standing. There is also legend that some fin patrol cut the russian patrol throats open with knifes and the whole rus patrol was standing on road throats open.   Well just look the russian comments..   Well you are not obviously on map with politics or just naive.   Maybe you havent understood this joke then? It it joke about russians being "puppet" aka dolls. Jokes can be disrespectful too, how many n**** you know? And btw I am not even Russian myself. It is not about "dolls", it is political joke.   I think this post is hateful and disrespectful, but it also shows you dont know russians. You think socialism grew out of hate towards others? No, It grew out of idea people being equal. Yeah, It didint work out in real life, but at least they tried.  I think capitalism isnt good either, but it is the best we got now. It makes people work and world going on. We just need to hold in it as long as we get something better. Maybe it is socialism where robots are working for us, but let capitalism be our vehicle in that bright future.

Can you share the script? and also that python screenshot one? :)   I like it, but somehow that sperm behind girl is kinda distracting.   I can definetly agree with this. One good way to reply is to be really polite. Like example if somebody tells you to be "retroactively aborted", you just thanks and you tell you will talk about it with doctor.   You can actually find similar behaviour from multiple lower class workplace. It is pretty common that in building site somebody is called with names. It is not like it is mean to be anyway personal. Those who take it personal should grow some balls, get over it and do better work next time.   This is also culture thing. In Finland we dont have concept of small talk. Also we dont really like to talk much and when we talk we usually like to talk straight and only "facts". That is just way we roll. Linus also talked about "you need to earn respect" which is also quite true in here.   I wonder where the fuck you work when it is allowed to watch butt pics.   I try to make favour and get this pic NSFW tagged, because if i see this pervert way, I am sure there is boss who sees it same way. And instead "thank you", I am called fucking pedophile, please go and hang yourself.   Well sorry, I am not native english speaker :3   Well you can look muricans and see where their foods are taking them. It is not only fat and salt but also all those chemicals and gene manipulated shit they put in their bodies. All those chemicals are not even properly tested. GL, I am still going to eat naturally. ;3   They are not naturally produced. Why you should put anything non natural in food?   It is not like we dont know what it is. We also know it is not dangerous to people. But idea of using blood entsyms in food to make it look more appealing is just alone discusting. Well I think this might also be culture thing and what I have understood there is quite lot wierd things going in food production in murica.   Well that partitial thing is the worst, it is like little teasing.   It is pretty, I like it.   Well not THAT WAY SEXUAL retards.... There is definetly one damn fancy naked butt in that pic.. and usually fancy naked butt pics are NSFW.    I am pretty sure OP is some kind of engineer. "Hey lets build perfect meal! All we need is some glue".   nvm, that sounds creepy if you think it wrong way..   "Dad, why babysitter is hairy man with leather suit?"   Can you actually turn somebody gay? :O   Well you basically made factory produced food for your family.   So you are basically feeding your family with this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydzIlKJmwV4   I think this is kinda sexual.. NSFW?   That hat? You are going to make some kind left-wing hippie out of her?   I would probably taste it, but seriously meat glue? I am not sure how common meat glue is in murica but in here it is same as eating shit.   The guy in mid is obvious hipster. He had glasses before they were cool and stopped using them when they became mainstream.  	60

I live in an area with a high population of new immigrants from Poland. BMWs, iphones, and flashy clothing is very ubiquitous among this group. (much different from my Polish relatives who came here ~100 years ago, who primarily came in a wave of lesser-skilled labor)  A number of the 21st Century immigrants are probably coming here for work because of their technical or specialized knowledge.

I've been used to working 55 hrs a week for a while now. Draining work for sure, but I've got to imagine it's only about 4 months.   Thanks! This sounds a lot like what the job climate/ lifestyle is like for my uncle. I am definitely going to seek out his point of view as well.   Not incredibly random. I have a family member who is successful in the field, and have seen some of my college classmates transition into the professional field fairly soon after graduation.  It really takes a special kind of person to become an MD, and it really only pays more in the long run, considering that 4yrs of medical school + being an intern + the cost of school-related debt and malpractice insurance etc., etc., ...I cannot imagine that most MDs are making good money until they are past 30.    As is the case with many of us who are fresh graduates. Does an internship necessarily mean that you work for months in the field w/o getting paid? Already did an "internship" while student teaching, where I pretty much took over a classroom for 4 months, having to work nights and weekends w/o my university or cooperating school district knowing. Hoping not to get stuck in that situation at this point in my life.    Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.  After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.  From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program?   It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.  Thanks! TLDR: (see title of post)    If lost forever in an endless field of celery, with no other edible items available I would begin to cannibalize myself before taking my first bite of celery.

Plus, the Rams are probably going to part ways w/ SJax at the end of the year, so they will probably give him a good deal of work in the near future to see what he can do.    Yes.

An American mid-engine two-seater from a defunct manufacturer that is made almost entirely of plastic and has a weird cargo section near the engine, no bonnet (hood), and still has a cult following.   Get Clarkson in one of these, would love to see his reactions to it.    [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate.   I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.  I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out?     Soccer is and has always been my favorite sport, but I honestly hate matches that end in a draw. [The NASL concept] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) to end matches had to have been such a suspenseful and awesome experience for fans though. I just wish that this concept would have caught on on a bigger scale, because no true soccer fan likes watching matches decided on penalty kicks.   The tie is a dead concept in the NHL with the dawn of the shootout.   This kid was quite the sniper for the Rampage a few years back. Such an abrupt and unfortunate ending.   In... the wulllld.   Merry Christmas from Chernobyl.   VW Fox?   Wayne. He's red hot and getting a plethora of targets. NYJ are not playing good defense at all.   Pettigrew is droppable. I hesitated to pull the plug on him, but his 5pts per week simply aren't paying off. You've got a better option there in K. Rudolph.      Risque pics. Your Volvo was showing in the last two.

[second creepiest] (http://www.imglols.com/disturbing-jesus-chair/)   Your pictures are a testament to how much Hyundai evolved from decades past. From the time [this was their idea of a sports coupe] ( http://www.autoevolution.com/cars/hyundai-scoupe-1992.html) until now it's reasonable to say that no other car manufacture has underwent such a image transformation.   In the spirit of this post, it's redundant redundancy.   Those were some sad times, my friend. That was our scoring line in Chicago.   5 ints! Romo is did a better impression of a Bears quarterback than the actual Bears quarterback.   Almost a decade later and the mention of [that] (http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=105344) still makes me cringe. Scott Stevens couldn't exist in today's NHL.   Hockey's Champions' League? What fan of hockey wouldn't love that.   Hell yes. A truly International Hockey League? The old IHL (RIP 1945-2001) only had one team, Soviet Wings, outside of N.A. for just one season.     This would open up so many opportunities to see different styles of play   really good players who never fit into the North American style of play.    Not that surprising at all. A number of people in Jefferson Park, including my aunt, are keeping chickens. The serenade of chicken clucks and shrieks  isn't foreign to the Northside.

I cannot look at this too long though, it's making me sad. Why it had to end for Pontiac while soulless Buick keeps on living is a reality I do not want to accept.   Consider the Mazda 3. Consumer Report is saying that it is a great buy. The new "Skyactiv" engine gets the best fuel economy in its class and is actually more fuel-efficient than Mazda's subcompact Mazda 2. Additionally, the long-term costs are projected to be low considering the trends of the Mazda 3's build quality and reliability over the past few years. The price is not that much different than the Cruze or Focus either.  I wish i was in the market for one today.  	61
 The narrator seems to be too biased and at times even came out as an asshole.  The type of girl who "went to college," but majored in communications and sleeping with professors.  I told you, the 'asshole' type of thinking, it is especially because of the above sentence. It felt like the most judgemental sentence I've read in the recent days. Even grammer didn't seem fit for that repelling sentence: *majored* (past tense) and then *sleeping* (continous tense). I'm not sure if that's right (I'm not native in English) but I'm having a feeling that its not, because the sentence sure sounds very wrong grammatically as well.   Rest In Peace, sir!   Today when I was practicing Sudharshana Kriya, I observed, or rather experienced, one profoundly simple realization. When I dived deep into the breathing pattern at the end of the Kriya process, there came one frozen frame in time, Im calling it the *Moment*, where I realized what present moment means.   At that one frame of time (I refer to it as a frame of time because I dont want to give it a unit of measurement, like the *second,* and make it sound quantifiable) everything in my life, both the past and the future seemed to be unified, aligned in one straight line telling me what I have been doing all my life has led me to this moment and what I do now will lead me further.  *We live not thinking about the past or dreaming about the future. Although theyre necessary at times, we sure create them both with the building blocks of present.*  I know, this is not a new concept, but the way I experienced it, deep down in meditation, had impacted me more, like never before. I guess what made this more influential is an activity I undertook the day before. I decided to take up Zen, which is all about experiencing the moment as you live through it.   Dots do connect.  And I understood the singularity of life.    I thought I knew life.   World is a small place.. and at the same time big too :)   I am actually waiting for this pic to turn up.. I collected it long back but am unable to find it... Now I got it again through this post.. thank you so very much :) :)   I watched the movie 4 times and I gave only one reason for doing so: *I deserved every bit of that film* :)   Hey pal.. thank you so much for the creative critique... The things you pointed out are very helpful for me to improve.. Thank you so much :) :)   And also, I think that quote in the title doesn't say the same thing as compared to the one I thought to be the correct version. The title quote emphasizes that the things that you worry about do happen in real.. and thus you worrying about them is justified.  But in the one that I commented, it says we worry about things that are not going to happen.. thus not justifying our worries.  Lot of difference!    The quote in the title says pretty much the same thing, but is more witty and sounds like something Twain might have said or written.  Ironically I too felt the same way about the corrected version in the comment I gave. Funny!   Makes great sense. Thanks :)   Good one :)   I guess the quote actually reads: "I've lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which **never** happened."  He was talking about how worrying about the things that might go wrong is actually worse than those things themselves. I can't point out to the source, but I sure remember Twain telling it this way.   It makes sense.    Hey thank you for the critique.. I incorporated the changes pointed out by you.. Thanks a lot once again :) :)   Hey thanks for pointing out the things that made this piece unimpresseive to you.. Yes in this piece rather than a full story or a conflict. I just tried to write about some mystic encounters of a person with a light that he saw in his dreams which mysteriously tranformed him and made him get better at things that were bothering him. It's like a magical medicine that he doesn't know where it was coming from.  I will keep your review in mind and shall practice on with the aspects you mentioned.  Thank you so much, Kalteras :) :)   Thank you so very much, pal, for such a helpful review.. All those things that you pointed out, especially comma things, will definetly help me get better. Commas always confuse me so much.. Any suggestions there??   I'm honestly surprised how well this is written for being non-native! Can I ask how long you've been writing in English?   Thank you so much for the compliment. I've been writing in English for four years now. Mostly I wrote blogs and articles (but with lot of errors, I now realize), never serious ficiton though except for a couple of short stories. Tried my hand at writing real fiction in the past but didn't work so kept it on hold. Now I felt that it is time I took it up seriously. So here I am writing flash fiction for practice.     I think fix up this stuff   Yes, I just did.. I wholeheartedly thank you so very much for the help :)   I will just critique like a reader himself who can also write. I'm not a native English speaker, I'm from India:  * In the opening line, the word 'exactly' being used multiple times slightly made the sentence a bit pretentious. Try changing that, if you can.   He had huge hands, so long that if it stretched it, it would go through the walls and..   I think it should be "He had huge hands, so long that if he (you just mentioned the monster as a He) stretched them (plural, *hands* - right) they would go (plural again.)   So thats why it sat on its toes,  Hmm, fine. But maybe sitting on its (or his, I'm not sure. its is fine though) knees would do better, I guess.   It was just sitting there staring at me, **with its eyes**,  I don't think that emphasizing that it is staring at you with its eyes is necessary. Everything in the universe looks with its eyes only, no!   They looked like ordinary human eyes except they were extremely yellow, and instead of a pupils it had a lightings, opening a persons mind into another world, most people called it a nightmare, but to me it was a dreamland.  Good and important sentence, but first of all it's too long, without easy readability and also grammatical errors. Singular - Plural mostly ('a pupils', 'a lighting's' - just pupils - no a, 'a' makes it singular; same for lightings - no a and also no apostrophe, I guess). But I would say instead of 'lightings' find a better word. May be *sparks.*   Most children at that age liked to go to the  Most children at *my* age  - would've done better, because a moment later you're bringing that point onto you, saying that you like staring at it rather. So, this seemed better.    So I told my mother, she embraced me, and told me that monsters dont exist.  Embraced is not establishing your point here. You can expand this point. Because it's an important one. It is showing that he was not believed by people. So, this can be better I guess: "So, I told my mother. She looked back at me with a calm and unsurprised but an understanding look in her eyes. She took me close and hugged me, and said that monsters dont exist."  I don't know if you like my description but it I'm trying to tell you that this is an important moment in the story and so finishing it so justly wouldn't do good.   refusing to neither eat nor drink anything until I saw the monster again.  It's *either - or*. Because you already said *refusing* which is a negative, and *neither - nor* is again a negative. No double negatives.   As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me.  It's bear - not bare. And refused.   Ended the story well. Overall, I liked the story. It's very good. I like such fantastic and mystic incidents put into words. And coming to your writing. I sense that English is not your native language. It's not mine too, like I mentioned at the beginning. So, you have some grammatical errors. Needed correcting. But after the sentence "As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me." Everything went too fast. Situations aren't established well. Maybe you can take a second look on that.  overall it's a 7/10 for the storyline. English is to be improved grammatically.  But I'm having a feeling that you're going to do a lot better in the coming days. In some ways, I see myself in you. I see my own writing in yours. We can all improve and we should -  we will.  All the very best... And once again, Good story.. keep it up :)    [And hey, now a quick tip about posting in this Sub. Do select a **flair** for your story, like a genre. Yours can be *Fantasy*, I guess. And also critique others' stories. Else they put you into Leeching (they already did, which is why I'm telling this. Normally leeched posts are ignored by members here.) which means you're a freeloader over here, taking critiques but never giving them back to others. I faced it last week. You please don't. You wrote a good story.]    This is my second flash fiction. (I'm from India and English is not my native language. But I love this language which is why I made writing in it as my life's purpose.) Here, I tried to voice out the character's mystic experiences in his life. I didn't emphasize in this piece on the name of the character or his environment or such minute daily life details, but on his internal voice. And it's also written in first person.  Please critique it in whatever way you think will be helpful for improving my fiction-writing skill. I'm open to all your comments.Thank you, all :)                                                         THE VAGUE LIGHT  It is said that you shouldnt chase butterflies; rather you should sit down and wait for them to come to you. Well, I didnt chase butterflies, but all my life I had chased a light, a particular light that I saw in my dreams.   The light appeared for the first time in my dream when I was a child. I remember that day because I was laughed at by the entire class for failing in the 5th grade Math exam. After that night, after I saw that light in my dream, Math ceased to scare me anymore. The light didnt make me a genius in Math, but it did stop me from being scared of it. In a way, it protected me.  Eventually, I turned 16, and got my first rejection from a girl I liked in my neighborhood. I asked her out on my birthday. She took it for a joke but when I told her I meant it she felt annoyed and stopped talking to me. I liked her very much, the rejection bothered me. And then one night, that light appeared again in my dreams. From the day after, looking at that girl never troubled me.   There came a time when I needed a job desperately. I was 24. I couldnt get any job due to the financial meltdown that hit the world hard. I felt like a loser looking at all the comfortable parts of peoples lives, and wondered why I always reside on the other side of the things that I wished in my life. I didnt find an answer because at the moment finding a job felt more reasonable than finding answers to the unanswerable questions of life. So, I restarted my job search, and yet after months time nothing seemed to be changing. I became weaker at heart with each email response I never got from the companies I applied for. I started believing in all the bad things in the world that happen to good people. I had always thought that I was one of those good people and now my current situation in life only confirmed it.  Not finding a job made me unhappy and dissatisfied. Happiness and satisfaction in life can be measured in the amount of peaceful sleep one gets every night. If you can go to bed and sleep without anything bothering you, youre a happy man. I used to sleep happily every night, holding in mind the dreams for my future, but now I held only despair. Night by night my sound sleep moved farther and farther away, but it left the sound part behind for me, the sound of unruly thoughts, the noise of desperation to make a career, and the necessity to have a constant income  they stayed with me. I truly reached an impasse on life, and it was all darkness. I needed light.   It happened in the middle of the night. I opened my eyes to a white nothingness. I couldnt see a thing. It was blindingly bright, but it was familiar. Whichever side I turned my sight to it was only infinite luminance. The light. It came back for me. I couldnt move. I just stood there in front of it, inside it, becoming one with it. After some time, I was disappearing into the light; or maybe it felt like all that light was disappearing into me, but I didnt know for sure. I slowly felt the falling, quietly, drifting down, towards something. And I opened my eyes to the bright rays of morning sun spreading on the walls of my room.   That day, I decided to start my own business and never look for a job again.   from *Walking* by Thoreau   That's very encouraging. Thank you :)    It's not wasted work, it's practice.  This is one great piece of advice. Nailed it.   Experience a story every day. You'll magically feel motivated to write again.  I recently started writing Flash-Fiction to get better at writing fiction. This is how I'm trying to feel everyday, experiencing a new story!  Thanks.. All the very best for the great future ahead :)   INTERSTELLAR sure energized me to become better at my art: **Writing!**   Great that your book is out... Good Luck, pal :)   Hey thanks a lot... Am downloading the documentary already.. Will surely watch.. I like docus very much :)   I like the flash fiction pieces that emphasize more on *single-scene* settings rather than long *short-stories*. It gives more chance to take the reader into a part of the story, like waking up to a moment into the dream.. You never remember all of the dream, only few vague portions of it. [Flash Fiction, according to me should be like that, or at least *that's my style*.]  Your work is good. The descriptions were easy enough to paint a good visual picture to the reader. Keep it at that level, it's good. Now, on the other side of the things, the writing from the point where a gun was pointed at the back of his head to the moment the stranger entered the last digit into the safe.. things didn't seem much clear. It felt like what you wanted to say wasn't properly delivered. In short, that part was unclear.   Over all.. Good work 7/10.   All the best for the next one :)   Awesome and outstanding :D   Awesome design....    Wow.. thank you so much for mentioning this... You just gave me new books to read in my life... :) :)   Nice post... Deep down, little emotional... Geographically, at least!   Yes. Please.   Yeah there is something there.. What's that??   Kindle Paperwhite, of course!   *Under The Dome* being more than 800 pages did put me away from picking it up till now, but someday I will read it, which is why I never watched the TV Series past S01E01. But then Stephen King is like that only. Master Artists don't mind the length when they're really keen on their work. But then hey this is a misconception. In Harry Potter series multiple books are way more than 400 pages, but they're a part of my life and may be I would've been disappointed if they were written any shorter.   One of the best film posters of all time. A really awe inspiring one.   I guess the look on Amelia's face at the closing shot self-explains that she didn't have a clue of all the Good that happened to the Mankind because of their mission. She should've known. But may be that's why our hero started his journey to her, probably to tell her how important she was in her contribution to the saving of Mankind.    I like to believe it to be true. May be there is a Parallel Universe where you're right and you exist in another Universe, and are sending back dreams to your other self in other universe, who is wondering about it all. I love this shit!   Did Buddha put his tongue out in this pic....?? I remember a picture of Einstein doing the same. By the way, awesome drawing, pal. Keep it up :)    the premise of the story is good, but the dialogue just didn't seem natural.  Yes.. when I re-read it on and on I'm feeling this too. That's where I think I need to concentrate from now on. Any suggestions are most welcome :)   you were translating from Indian to English  I really wasn't trying to do that, I was writing in direct English. But knowing that this is how it sounds to reader made me feel real awkward about my writing. But thanks for coming up with this point, because I believe this is a very vital aspect for a non-native English fiction writer, which I completely am.   The last part, while a really good idea, isn't executed quite right. I found it really hard to believe that somebody would throw keys that close to another person (even if they don't like her) and that she would have time to stand up, hear someone say "MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! (by the way, caps made it seem like the person was screaming at the top of his lungs which would take even more time), and then throw her hands up to cover her face. I don't think her reaction to that warning would be to cover herself.   Special thanks for pointing out the occurrence errors.. will keep that in mind next time.   I think it might be better if Praveen said: "Mythya, look out!" as that would signal that there is some sort of danger coming at her.  Now, that is very straight and simple (why didn't I do that before!)   Thank you for the entire response which is going to influence me in the direction of good writing :) :)   And I would like to ask you if you know of any resources that would help me in bettering my *dialogue.*       Hey PrpleWlf, thank you so very much for the extra effort. Your suggestions are very supportive. The way you pointed out the difference between usage of languages depending on region is very new and helpful. And coming to my nativity thing, although I'm from India, my life's aim is to become a very good English language novelist. I've great stories to tell, but the kind of fiction-writing skill that I possess puts me far away from it. I will take up the journey and travel far to reach it.   And special thanks for re-writing the first paragraph in your way, this would help me think better the next time when I rework on it. Although getting a translator is a good idea, I want to put up the necessary skill into myself to become good at writing fiction. Courses would be a good idea.. thank you for mentioning that :) :)   Truly hoping this is of some great help, and not to demoralizing;  Your response is in no way demoralizing. It is truly some great help. Thank you so much :)    Thank you so very much for the critique :)  I have to say that it was very difficult as an English reader to get through simply due to the grammatical issues  Can you please point out where I went wrong?? Honestly, I believed that my English is good, but looking at what you just said, I now feel the fire to learn where in my grammar that I should improve.. Thank you so much for that.    While the ideas behind the story are good, the grammar takes away from it.  Yes. This is a real trouble.. Please shoot at me whatever suggestions you have in this aspect.    Do not take this to mean you should give up in writing,  I can never do that. Never!   I would not expect myself to be able to write in your own native tongue without first learning the language  You just opened my eyes to the fact that I do not know English as good enough as a writer should know. (I mean, I speak good English everyday with people all around me. Even now, I'm talking to you fine, I believe, with no grammatical errors.)  Thank you once again for the very uplifting review.. If you can, just help me with the above mentioned issues as well. Thanks :) :)   I realized Flash Fiction to be very helpful for polishing your writing abilities. This one here is my first flash fiction. It might even probably suck. But I don't mind. I'm here to listen to you guys and improve my fiction-writing skill, or rather build it up. I don't know. Please just critique this piece as much as you can. I want only to get better, that's my sole purpose. (I'm from India, so English is not my native language, but suggest me there as well.) Thank you all very much :)        It was 10.15 AM on a Monday morning, and peoples minds were just migrating from a weekend induced relaxation to the work environment again, getting their psyche ready for the next five days of hustle bustle in their daily lives.    Mythya was seated at her desk with her hands loudly and busily typing a mail to her manager about the tasks for the week ahead. She does that every Monday. She looked at the clock, and pictured how the next 5 days were going to be. *Occupied as always with nothing unusual ever to happen in my life,* she thought.     Karthik sits opposite to Mythya, four desks ahead. Distracted by the typing noise, turned his head to see who it was that sounds involved in work so seriously already, and found that most of his team mates were not even seated at their desks. Hey who is disturbing the blissful morning silence with the noise of work? asked Karthik.    Praveen and Vinod were standing few rows away from Mythya. Praveen was stretching his body, getting ready to go and get a bite of something in the cafeteria. Beside him Vinod was holding the key ring of his shelf and playing with it in his hands.    Its her, said Praveen lazily, pointing to Mythya, she must be sending her work schedule for the week.     Yes, guys, responded Mythya, just typing the usual weekly mail. We all got to do this.    Yeah, right, but not already, said Karthik. Its Moday morning, for Gods sake, kill some time.     She looked at him and chuckled.    Praveen stared at Mythya for a moment and something came up in his mind. Karthik, talking of work, I guess I left some important papers at your desk last Friday.     Yeah, you did. I locked them up in Vinods shelf, said Karthik pointing to the desk next to him.     Vinod felt attentive at the mention of his name. Oh yes, sorry, I forgot to mention that, he said to Praveen, still playing with the key ring.     Karthik, please do me a favour, started Praveen. Im going for breakfast, meanwhile please take out those papers and keep them at your desk. Ill come back and collect.     Sure. Just get me the keys of the shelf.     Yeah, right. Please hand him your keys, he said turning to Vinod.    Here, catch, called out Vinod, and raised his fist to throw the key.     At the exact same instant Mythya started to rise from her desk. Praveen observed this. MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! he said, loudly.    By then the key ring had left Vinods hand and was shooting towards Mythyas head which abruptly appeared in its trajectory.    Listening to her name in a loud caution, Mythya reflexively raised her both hands in defense, covering her face and head.    As she did this, the key that was about to hit her had stopped in front of her hands, but it did not fall down  *it started to float in the mid-air.*      Yes... Miss this guy :(   Please suggest me how to practice Informatica PowerCenter Tool. There are a lot of practice exercises on the internet but I don't have any repositories. Is there a way where I can build my own repository or download some free ones?  Please point out any other ways to build expertise in PowerCenter tool. Also include, if you can, info about certifications and their corresponding study resources.   Thanks a ton.   Thank you so much!   "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." - Albus Dumbledore, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*  This sentence has stayed with me, and will stay so till my last breath.   It's an awesome book.... In some way, it is better than the movie... You will know what I mean when you read the last page of the book. You will see the difference yourself.   Once again, I love this kind of posts!   No, I'm not!   That's sad to hear :(   Good one :)     Wait a minute, Reddit has some originality?  I meant the ideas that people come up with. They can be original, of course. Imagine J.K. Rowling coming here years ago and asking how it would be if she builds a world where they teach magic to kids as a field of academics.. I guess, Harry Potter wouldn't have been as big a phenomenon as it is today if somebody had stolen her idea and made a movie on it even before she wrote the first book!   There are some subs here such as [r/Writing](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing) or [r/WorldBuilding](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding) where people put forward new ideas they have for some of their future ventures, like writing a book, for example.  So, looking at those posts I often wonder what if somebody copies your idea and comes up with similar venture without giving you your credit?   *How can we rely on the safety of the original ideas that we share on Reddit??*   The one thing that felt interesting to me in the entire film was that she disappears after reaching the infinite potential (the 100%) just like the car did in the example she demonstrates to the professors.   So, at the end I saw it as Lucy *becoming one with the Time,* and thus turning herself infinite and forever, which I think explains her last words: *"I AM EVERYWHERE"*  - just like Time. Time is everywhere.   This is my first flash fiction reading I guess.. and I would now say what practicing the *show don't tell* type of writing means! Thanks.. I'm gonna Save this post and come back to it for reference to help my own writing practice. Great work, pal :)   She was very hot as CatWoman!! :D   Please remove this post if you like the scene so much... With this camera quality video you're dirtying the people's food called Interstellar.   Ok.. as promised, I just listended to both tracks, and they didn't sound similar in any manner... to my ears!    :D :D :D :D :D    listening to both of them rightaway.. will get back to you on this.   Yeah... True.  *I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.* -Maya Angelou   Awesome man.. thank you so much.. I literally Googled for this kind of pic of Endurance.. And here it is today... Credit goes to you ofcourse.. thanks a lott :) :)   Thanks for the answer.   Thanks for the question.   That's a nice idea...!!    Thank you for pointing that out for me :) :)   Thank you so very much for the resources.. :)   Thanks for poiting it out.. I too am going to read his answers for other questions.. May be I can learn a lot..   Thank you very much for the answers.. and by the comment that *showurnust* posted I got to know that you answered various other questions in this sub.. so I just befriended you here so that I can read all the possible explanation given by you for other questions.. Thank you so much for the good work..   Yeah you're right... I was thinking like a 3D being ;)   thank you very much for the answers.. :)   Thank you so much for the answers.. I appreciate it very much :) :) Thanks a lott, especailly for quoting Kip Thorne.   Yeah you're right. Because just now, I came back from watching the film for the third time. I posted that on Twitter and some person tweeted me saying "what a waste of 9 hours!"   I mean, what the hell, how can someone say such a thing about INTERSTELLAR.    Typical third dimension beings.  Yeah *Muggles*     It's beautiful, utterly beautiful.  Yes. Nothing less!   1. When the crew left Earth, they reach *Endurance* in just a matter of minutes. Is *Endurance* placed so near to Earth?  2. How did Brand know that they are dealing with the beings  (they) of five dimensions?  3. Why did Romily die? What caused the explosion? And why was Dr.Mann trying to kill Cooper?  4. How come NASA manufactured a Space craft that can travel into the higher dimensions without even knowing what those dimensions hold?  5. In the 5th dimension scene (where Cooper is hanging around the bookshelf) he gives the S.T.A.Y message to Murph first. Later on, he gives her the coordinates for NASA in Binary. But those things happened the other way, no? First they stumbled upon NASA secret location and later when he was about to leave his Earth, Murph gets the S.T.A.Y message.  6. And why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message at all? If Murph wouldve convinced him showing that message, they would have never saved the Mankind, so why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message in the first place?  7. The data was coded into the seconds hand in the watch when Murph (young) placed the watch on the bookshelf after picking it from the floor. But only years after that day Murph (grown up) comes back to pick it, and then sees the seconds hand moving. So, has Cooper been waiting there behind the bookshelf in 5th dimension all that time for her to grow up and come for the watch?   8. How did Murph (grown up) suddenly realize that it was Cooper that has been her ghost all along?  9. Tesseract gets closed and Cooper was pushed outside of the worm whole and was later on found by other Rangers. So, by the time he came out of the wormhole back into our galaxy, has his data been utilized and the whole plan A thing worked already? Because he looks to be of the same age when he wakes up in hospital on Cooper Station, and two weeks later Murph turns up as a very old woman (of some 80 plus years, but when she shouts Eureka she was may be just 35 plus.. so what has Cooper been doing all those 45 years and where did he end up all that time).  10.  Well thats it from my side, but there are a couple of more minor doubts from my roommate: How did Cooper exist in two places at once? And how did they manage to move the entire population of Earth to another world?  Thank you, guys :)   Awesome analogy there.. the comic book thing.. Do you have Youtube videos of webpages for us where we can watch/read the actual explanation by Grant Morrison??   I'm jealous of your nephew. I guess now he would even build up an ambition of becoming an Astronaut! Good for him :)    Having the urge to watch the movie again  I just came back from watching the movie for the third time :D   That's encouraging!! Thanks      ya whatever, man!   Happy Children's Day :D   In the wake of INTERSTELLAR film, I would like to ask you guys about the books (not Sci-Fi ones) that deal with higher dimensions, alternate/parellel universes, time warp concepts and etc.  Please suggest.    thank you for this... although I guess it should say "more than just a MAN"..  but I guess this version is more unisex... nice.. anyways, this is a motivating piece.. thanks for sharing it here..   Darkly funny!   Hey hey hey.. Isn't this form House of Cards :D   I've always loved this quote!   Fuck.. I just saw my face in this.. This sentence is a fuckin' mirror.    Oh didn't knew this... thanks..   Yeah exactly, that's what I meant, they didn't come up with all that themselves.. They took help of a scientist (physicist, to be precise), so I too wanna learn stuff in the same way by taking help of books.. Because I can't afford hiring scientists to teach me stuff.. Hence, this post!   I up vote you for just your try... Good luck for the reading habit..    Can you please tell me what according to you is hard sci fi?   you SHOULD go watch INTERSTELLAR..    you SHOULD go watch INTERSTELLAR..    Ya.. I recently read this book and was spellbound by the way it was architectured!    good work!!   After watching INTERSTELLAR, my heart cried in ecstasy!  And, also I've never before seen audiences clap out of respect once the end credits started to roll.. [This is from India.]   Thank you so much, man!   Why?? Does science not involve the way we live... And isn't family a part of, a very important part of, the way we live on this planet??   Thank you so much for the post!   I don't know why people thought it to be a lame quote.. It has a great depth in it, I shall try to give view point of how I saw that quote:   The evil that arose from *strength* and *power*, when such an evil is prevailing in the world, but if none is to stand up and act against it, if everyone is thinking *weak* and *cowardly* of themselves, such a resistance to act would create more evil because it is fueling it.  In a nutshell, just imagine what would be the plight of Gotham city if Bruce Wayne would've been afraid to become *Batman* and fight it.   Hahaha... Correct!!   Outstanding!   "You call it hope, that fire of fire, It is but agony of desire." - Edgar Allan Poe  Not that I'm negating the actual post, but looking at your comment I just thought I might as well mention this candid line by Poe.   Nice full-form of HOPE.. :)   Well thought, pal!   Awesome quote.. I'm surprised it only 2 comments till now..   That's pretty much nails it all.. Thank you so much :) :)   Hey thank you all so much, guys.. Very helpful suggestions there... I will surely put them to good use :) :)   I was thinking such a thing recently.. Thanks for the push :)     it's pretty obvious that inhaling exhaust gases is bad for you.  Yeah.. That's what I meant.   seriously true and good...   haha.. you might laugh so hard that this post can be NSFW..     In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.  I have always loved this quote. It speaks so much in this one candid sentence!   I commute by Autorickshaws..   when a diesel truck or bus passes me, that weird diesel exhaust smell really bugs me.  Yes, this is the trouble... and also one more thing that really irritates the fuck out of me during such rides is the noise of the horns from all those vehicles who want me to get the fuck out of their way. (*I mean, come on, I'm trying to do good to the planet by opting for a cycle, give me some damn place to ride it.*) I had to move sideways and sideways until there is no place left for me to move anywhere. I hated all this experience, this totally removed the joy out of riding a bicycle, for me.   I recently bought a Firefox Roadrunner Pro-V.. I decided to commute to office daily on that bike, the distance is 9KM. But only after a week's ride to the office, I felt discouraged, especailly because of the overwhelming amount of traffic I had to face. I'm from India, *the second most highly populated country on the planet.* So, that's kinda seems obvious.   I work in corporate, and by morning 8AM onwards the traffic sky-rockets in corporate cities (I'm from Pune). InitiallyI tried riding in that traffic, but I observed that every motor vehicle's smoke is comes out onto the commuters who take longer to travel, which is me, in this case, as I had to ride very close to them all. We don't have sepearate roads for bikers in my country.   So, I felt bad about the kind of traffic I had to ride through. I decided that this is actually bad for my health, inhaling all the pollution from the vehicles all along those 9 kilometers.   But everyday when I come back to my flat and look at my bicycle in the parking place collecting dust, I feel really bad. This is something I'm unable to turn around in my life.  I would really like to hear about your cycling habits, so that may be I can adopt some of them and make my bike and feet feel worthy.   Hey thank you so much... also for the link... Next time when I pick up *Paradise Lost* I shall use this resource!! Thank you so much :)   Hey thank you so much for the feedback.. It is very helpful and surely didn't hurt a bit, because my main focus, as far as my "Writing" life is concerned, is not on poetry, it's basically on *fiction.* This poetry pieces are just a trail to drench my thirst, just to see if I can writing nice sounding and rhyming stuff. That's all. Apparently, I couldn't.  Anyways, talking of poetry, let me confess, I tried reading epic poetry like *Paradise Lost*, but truth be told, I never *understand* anything in those epic poetic lines, but then sometimes among them I used to find some really awesome powerful *quotes* kind-of lines, which made me keep going if only for searching more of such lines..   Why I'm telling you all this is because you really seem to have great knowledge on poetry related works (you even mentioned that your academics are related to this field). So I want to ask you for help.   Please help me with an explanation on how to read epic poetry?? I mean, I literally Googled for a verse/prose translation of Paradise Lost. *How freaking weird is that* - to search for the English prose translation for a work already originally written in English itself! I mean, come on, what kind of idiot does such a thing.. I did it. Because I was unable to figure out even a single sentence clearly..   Now, tell me what am I supposed to do about all this?? I really want to read great epic poetry, like Paradise Lost, Divine Comedy, The Aeneid, Beowulf and etc..!! HELP.  **Note**: English is not my first language, I'm from India.    Title: *Just The Floating*  Genre: *Short Poetry*  Word Count: *130*   Type of feedback: *Anything will help*   https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/just-the-floating-7403dcee3571  I mean, come on, it's really short.. please, guys, give me feedback on that.. Thanks :) :)     Sounds like Internet!!       sleeping is for pussies.  High-Five for that!  	122
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	184
 I was gonna vote for Hillary. Then I died.   He isn't using it right. I follow 700 news org in one list and it tells me a lot :)   We report, you decide ;)   Could you autograph that pic using the sharpie in your ass? Cause that would be freakin awesome.   I'll be waiting on my check. I can't vote for her though - she was born in kenya (FACT!) and she promised to take away every gun in America and change us over to Sharia law.   Yeah. I made all that up. But put it on a website and post it around the net and people on the right will just believe it without thinking.   I'm gonna write my own bible, the Chance-a-Sutra. It will have a lot of pictures, including some with guns in them. Can't wait to pass it out at schools there.   More than 2,100 paratroopers took place in the operation.  The 82nd Airborne Division conducts thousands of airborne operations each year. Exiting an aircraft in flight with a full combat equipment load comes with inherent risks, but we take prudent precautions to minimize potential injuries, Wilkinson said.  http://www.wncn.com/story/28801173/50-paratroopers-injured-during-ft-bragg-airborne-operation   *Koonin's main point was that humans, together with nature, are now determining the evolution of the Earth's climate, Rosner said. "That is amazing, and given the difficulties we have in managing our affairs, also very scary," he said.*  *"It is time to move on from the fake debate over whether climate change is real or poses a risk, and onto the worthy debate about what actions we must take to avoid a climate catastrophe," he said in an email.*  Well stated - something I am betting many on the right will miss in the whole article.   Hannity is pimping this fake story as well - but considering the rw'ers who listen to him I can see why he would. They question nothing and just blindly believe anything (hmmm and many on the right are religious isis like fundies as well....)  Anyway - Obama is planning on letting them fly here in stolen Libyan jets after the isis folks have been exposed to ebola and finished training mexican kids to bring with them for terror attacks.   Mexican authorities at Taco Bell told me all about Obama's plan.   I just thought "5 black guys" was the name of a new burger joint...   Yeah....blah blah blah. Obama will take all your guns, crash stock market, destroy America, he is a kenyan born muslim, he will put christians in fema camps, etc.  The right seems to be wrong. A lot. But not one has the guts to ever admit it, do they? I might take their criticism of hillary more seriously if they didn't make up things and fail to own them when they are proven wrong.  Waaah...What is hillary gonna do? Same things the right swore Obama would? ROFL. OK....we believe you.   Number 1 answer: "I am conservative who thinks gays are causing god to punish us, that we need more religion in our laws, more wars, less taxes and more money for defense and israel"   LOL OMG. You dredge up some old old old newspaper article?  Hillary owns the mind of the right. It is a beautiful thing to behold how she has them all running around.    Ohhhh. Rubio...Yeah. This guy:  He criticized judges who are redefining marriage from the bench, claiming that pro-marriage-equality decisions take away the rights of Americans like myself who oppose same-sex marriage: Those who support same-sex marriage have a right to lobby their state legislature to change its laws. But Americans like myself who support keeping the traditional definition of marriage also have the right to work to keep the traditional definition of marriage in our laws without seeing them overturned by a judge.  Calling tolerance a two-way street, he lamented that today there is a growing intolerance on this issue, intolerance towards those who continue to support traditional marriage.  The Florida Family Policy Council announced today that it will host *Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) at its 2013 Annual Dinner. The FFPC is led by John Stemberger, the anti-gay activist who most recently helped launch a Boy Scouts splinter group that will ban openly gay youth, and the fundraiser will honor Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver.*   Who is he? Didn't his dad invent the Rubio's cube, or Marco Polo game, or something?   Not everyone has time to read all the questions everyday so there will invariably be duplicates.   Hey, don't give away our secrets or they will ban that too!   Or take it to work and put it in the water cooler.   It's funny how the right sees all of this.  God is mad over two men kissing - but he doesn't care at all about wars, murders, robberies, rapes, cops shooting and beating people, poor people starving or not getting health care, putting as many people in prison as you can, etc and so on.  No...all he is mad about is gays and economic policies where you try to help out those in need.  Conservative fundies...they make no sense.   I used to vote republican. Up until 2004. Now they are so far gone I don't think I will ever, in my lifetime, even consider voting for them.   But, either way, they are losing the culture war. Their regressive, religious, policies keep getting beaten.   Consider this. The right complains about ISIS/Fundie muslims all the time. The reason? Because those groups aren't as progressives as they say Christians now are. Think about that. They are actually saying progressive changes are good and regressive fundies (the muslim ones) are evil/bad.  Maybe, just maybe, they will run with that and move to being even more progressive....now that they use the term 'progressive' in a positive light. I won't hold my breath, but what they rail against is, to some extent, what they are here in the US. Regressive.   Indeed. In fact, it from one of their playbooks: 1. Cut unemployment benefits because people getting them are milking the system and not getting jobs.  2. Shoot down proposals to spur job creation.  3. Complain that, because of Obama there are no jobs. Blame Obama and the unemployed.  4. Claim to have a solution - cut even more benefits (food stamps) and decrease taxes on the rich so they can create more jobs (oddly enough, again, admitting there aren't enough jobs but cutting benefits anyway and calling those in need lazy welfare bums).  Not much they do makes sense. But then, folks like rush and such wanted America to fail so they can blame Obama and tell people 'told you so' for electing Obama (the old fundie idea of punishing 'sinners')  Conservatives....they want to break America for some reason (and yet, they have failed to do so the last 8 years, which makes them sad).   I prefer local talk radio (and have worked in some radio over the years and did my own show). One of my fav stations here for many years have been over taken by beck/rush/hannity/levin. Yeah, there are other stations locally but none I have found that are mostly local talk.  Local issues don't get enough play. One of the guys that had a show here moved onto 700wlw so I pick him up there but still not really 'local' anymore (same state).   Add into the mix how difficult it is to get a license and choices plummet (our show was on pirate radio). Big companies buy up the spectrum and keep out competing stations.   *Really to believe that 5 million Jews know better than 6 billion people of the world?*   It isn't just Jews in Israel. It's republicans here in the US who put god/bible/Israel ahead of country.   They worship Israel, hate gays, etc all because they fear what god might do to 'murica (they ignore crime, wars, adultery, eating bacon, screwing over the poor and those in prison, etc).  We have our own little isis like group in the US that vote for and push for laws based on religion and will toss this country aside for another country that runs itself based on religion.   I don't expect a lot from various subreddits :) but one would think fellow humans participating wouldn't be so...well, dumb or transparent.   I lived there for a spell. It is the armpit of CA. Sooo glad to be away from there. Ridgecrest and Tehachapi were much better places IMHO.   Apparently. I can think of whole news orgs that annoy me ;)   Maybe it is because she is running the youtube server from her home? Benghazi!!!   Because this was an action by a government official and not some random kid.   It's not like it could hurt him any....   He was also born in kenya, had a fake BC, took away all the guns in the US, allowed ebola to spread and kill millions of Americans, crashed the stock market, sold out the US to muslims for a caliphate....etc.  And this is what pisses people off? LOL.   This is an update to some earlier stories, now with video and more information.   Well, is it legal like moving your HQ to another country to avoid taxes? If so, how can anyone complain about it. I am sure there won't be any republicans or conservatives who will complain that the Obama's operated within the law for their own benefit.   PS - no, I am not upset with Obama here since he exercised a right other parents have as well.   I bet, because he said that, conservatives won't vote for Hillary. Damn, that man sure is powerful and intelligent! "Don't trust someone I don't like!" because, you know, before all republicans did.  Gonna be a long, dumb, campaign season.   Hmmm "thepunditpress". Let's see how conservatives will view something like this.  Guessing: It will make them say things like "See!! It's all fake, no one has ever mistreated a black/muslim/woman/gay person. This is why I am SMART and don't trust people!"  But then, someone posts a story where a cop shoots an unarmed American citizen, and it's on video. Suddenly..."So, one bad apple! You can't judge all cops by this. If a cop says he shot someone I got his back and won't just assume he/she is lying!"  Cons.....   If Bush and Clinton ran together they would be unstoppable. The, after 8 years Chelsea and another Bush could run together.   It would be like Kang and Kodos. The two families could rule the earth together forever.   It cooks faster than in a conventional oven.   Is this your 'I am going to pretend to be a smart person but really gonna act like a conservative' account? What is your brilliant analysis of the left's agenda? That they treat fellow humans in a more decent way than rw fundies? Dang, that's a plain awful thing right there. Damned libruls!   It's gonna be a fun 8 years with her as president. I don't like her myself, but man o man cons hate her. I can see why, after 8 glorious years of bill and her in the white house they ended up with bush who screwed up everything. From 9/11 to wars to recessions.   Then a dem black man takes over and fixes the messes bush made. Republicans are just pining for those wonderful bush years again. Go Jeb....   Here's the video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uY7gLZDmn4 feature=youtu.be   Looks like you signed up with that name just to bash ole hillary. Or troll. Either way, your argument doesn't make any sense. Hillary may be to the right of your President, Obama, but she is left of the loons running as republicans. Are you one of them 'purists' or just conservative who is pretending to be 'concerned'?   Well, if they are a woman, holding open a door will ruin their day from what I have been told. Benevolent sexism. Every once in a while I hold open a door or do something nice for a woman just to ruin their day. Oddly, many smile and thank me - but that just tells me they are mental slaves of the patriarchy. Or something like that.   Republicans are the whiniest group of people I have ever met. "WAAAH he is meeting with some human being I don't like instead of killing him all the men/women/children in a country I don't like because they don't think like me! I wanna control them. Me me me!"  That about sums up the foreign policy of conservatives.    This man is just too stupid to be president.   I was one. There were some decent folks on the force but overall there was an atmosphere of corruption and people who let power get to their head. I don't regret leaving there (back in the 80's).  Cops will stab other cops in the back first chance they get to save themselves. I was a friend with the sheriff before I worked there and became friends with the lt. of Internal Affairs (all cops hate IA....). This upset other deputies. You don't want to get on the bad side of those directly above you - they come together and can make your life hell.  We used to tie up some inmates, face down, arms pulled up behind their backs, and leave them like that 45 minutes or so till they were in so much pain they were crying. My senior officer on floor with me one night (mostly worked in the main jail) sat and watched a guy hang himself - we cut him down in time, but he told me not to interfere and let him do it if he wanted.   There is a corrupt culture and a good old boy's network - but, yeah, there are some good cops. Problem is they fight an uphill battle against the system.    Depends on your personality and age. When I was a young man I read "Follow My Leader" 14 times (about a kid who goes blind - oddly enough he was named Jimmy Carter). Then there was The Dark Is Rising series by Susan Cooper.  Sci-Fi? Start with and oldie like Rendezvous With Rama - not too intense but interesting and easy read, and fun.  Just a few personal suggestions :)   Criminal? What has she been convicted of? I missed it.   Call Palin, because she could shoot at the Russians from her back porch.   Perhaps that is indeed the case. But at some point we have to deal with today and what is going on instead of letting either party get away with "They did it before so it's our turn to screw things up."  As a citizen I say "Yep, you both have been dicks and held up progress at times. Now get to work and earn your damned pay check and fill the positions we need. Slackers."   4chan: Already when back in time and told some woman she would have a baby and to name him Jesus. Then they snuck him out of his tomb later and wandered around dressed up as him.  Reddit: Figured it out and created /r/Atheism to combat their evil plans.  Tumblr: Went back in time and helped created boy bands who can't play a tune but make them feel special - which ended the real rock and roll era and broke up what was once a new, amazing band, comprised of members of The Who, Rolling Stones, and The Beatles.    From her FB page:  Good LA Times story about the immigration reform bills I've introduced. Two things not mentioned in the story: Legal permanent resident are being deported, as well. And not only do several states use the pretrial diversion system my bills would adopt, California did, as well, until the legislature changed it as part of the costly, failed, War on Drugs whose consequences we are still working through.   Because she doesn't want to see the American isis like party back in control pushing their religious agenda?  Or, maybe, she is like Romney and feels she deserves the job and wants the power that goes with it. She liked being in the whitehouse and all the attention/power it had which is why she carpetbagged a senate gig.  I don't like her myself but I would vote for her over anyone running on the right (unless huntsman were to try again). Big business will end up with the two candidates they want the most and the rest of us will pick one for them.   Try looking at it from the view of an investor. You put $x into a company and you push to get as much back out as you can.   You start a company (investing your time/money) and want to get the most you can from your investment.  People cheer that on. Until the people doing the actual labor (investing their time, and even money on a car, gas, clothes) want more. Then suddenly people talk about 'greed' and how awful it is.   Prices go up all the time because the first two groups want more. They lay off people, shift jobs to Vietnam, etc, just to grab a few more dollars. But when workers want a bit more of the wealth they are helping to create folks get bent out of shape and pine for the glory days of the early 1800's.   All of these years of having a min wage and the right still says we are the greatest country on earth, most innovative, wealthiest country, etc. Maybe it isn't the big boogeyman people have made it out to be after all.   Also, worth noting, this is based off of 233 businesses. They sent questionnaires to 1000 and 233 replied. What's the over/under on businesses downsizing at anyone one time in Oakland? You can read the study at the link. Not what I would call 'well done'. Heck, it could be worse than that. Could be better.   I wouldn't be opposed to a more Scandinavian model, tiered min wage based on age.    Here, let me help some folks out:  Back when we started NAFTA (and now, maybe TPP) what people tell you is "Yes, in the short term there will be job losses but long term there will be gains" (of course, the people who lost jobs back then were called lazy, etc, by the right and then when they did finally got jobs had lost seniority, etc, and so on).  Anywho...this will all pan out in the long run. More people with more money spread a tiny bit more evenly. People have whined about the min wage since I was 18 and making 3.35/hr and the country is still going strong.   All of the others aren't the topic of conversation right now. I actually don't watch much news (I use a twitter list w/every tv news station in the US, etc).  One might also find your posting rather spammish as you posted it, what, like 4 places at once? And you obviously agree with the content so I wouldn't guess you would be a good peer reviewer of fox news ;)   People don't jump on fox without cause.  It was, for fox, a decently written article. But note the use of the word 'activists' (5 times) and how and when in the past they have used that term. In the article they state: *Though Lomax is tied to the oil-and-gas industry* note they aren't calling him any sort of 'activist'.   Fox didn't question the author worth a damn. They basically just reposted what he said without 'peer reviewing' him. Now, as far as the peer reviewing- they don't even explain what it is or how it works, which may sound silly. Until you think about this:  **The journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field (i.e., the "peers" of peer review). Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published.**  So peers review the data. And in this case, where one could make an issue with the data, is in who collected it (which is outlined in the actual paper). But that doesn't detract from the actual paper or the findings about the air samples. Other people who have done similar research reviewed the paper and found it acceptable.   If, in fact, you read what the peers wrote you will see that they had questions themselves about some things. One reviewer states that air testing near such operations is very difficult and this is not a final answer but is valuable because it assesses areas identified by the public. All of them offered revisions and had some questions.   None of this was expanded upon by fox, discussed, etc. Thei 'journalism' was basically reposting and asking a few pointed questions to the reviewers. Basically - typical fox clickbait that doesn't require a person to think.   Was the password 'Pencil'?   "obama WILL ban ALL your guns!"  Yeah. Never happened.   Ok...yeah. So? Is there a point you are trying to make? If so. What is it?   Betting cons will believe Iran over our president. The same cons who before were telling us Iran lies all the time.   You mean like in the bible, where it says you can handle them without fear? Oh wait - I forgot, god only protects from snakes, for everything else we use bullets and bombs because we don't trust god (though the right is pretty certain god will personally attack america for letting gay people marry -using hurricanes, floods, etc).   Yeah, I think the right is going to call for 15 investigations and millions of our taxpayer dollars to investigate this. It's the only way to be sure!   Cons seem to get a lot wrong. Climate. Iraq. Obama was born in Kenya. No shock that the tea party takeover has just added to their problems.   Being #1 doesn't always mean you're better, it could just mean a lot of people blindly listen to your crap.   Kind of like cons probably listen to some crappy boy band and yell about how they are better than the Who ever was and proudly proclaim "My group is #1 right now, it means something!"   Obama told the truth about where he was born and cons are still whining like babies about it saying he lied.  Telling the truth gets you nowhere with the party of whiners.   *Also, what is a Koran defector?*  An ex-muslim from korea?   Do people there have dvd players?   And what I posted: http://mediamatters.org/research/2009/04/09/media-conservatives-fearmongering-obama-will-ta/149054  None of what proposed would ban/take away all guns - which is what people were claiming. Even in 2013 he didn't try to take away guns, he supported the AWB back in 2004 (so nothing new there).  He did not try to, nor ever said he would, take away all the guns.    This one? Which ones was it gonna ban?  Proposed Congressional Actions      Requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, including those by private sellers that currently are exempt.     Reinstating and strengthening the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004.     Limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds.     Banning the possession of armor-piercing bullets by anyone other than members of the military and law enforcement.     Increasing criminal penalties for "straw purchasers," people who pass the required background check to buy a gun on behalf of someone else.     Acting on a $4 billion administration proposal to help keep 15,000 police officers on the street.     Confirming President Obama's nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.     Eliminating a restriction that requires the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to allow the importation of weapons that are more than 50 years old.     Financing programs to train more police officers, first responders and school officials on how to respond to active armed attacks.     Provide additional $20 million to help expand the a system that tracks violent deaths across the nation from 18 states to 50 states.     Providing $30 million in grants to states to help schools develop emergency response plans.     Providing financing to expand mental health programs for young people.    No more that I can see, can't recall every hearing of this before - since they are covering it later on the news they may update the article later.   This can't be right. Conservatives assured us in 2008 Obama would take away all guns. Not that he wanted to, not that he said he would, but that he would in fact do it. Not sure how, but apparently the right understands government better than the rest of us.  Then in 2012 they said the same thing, that he was just waiting until his second term to ban them all. Again, no mention of how he could but were told he would.  Apparently they were wrong. Again. And still no one will own up to the lies and hype. Benghazi!!   I am still waiting for you to explain your post. Did folks here like my op or not? (checks the karma on it...957) so...anyway, you were whining about what again?  I think you are just trolling, as I said before, and it appears I was right and I win. Concede any time you want -unless, as I said, you are trolling.  Either way. You lost. I love the smell of trolls roasting in the morning.    Ohhh, I like that :)  You threw in the whole porn thing, which is supposed to mean...I dunno, what? Maybe you are projecting here.  What the heck is a wank licker? it is obviously something you know about. Please, be an adult and enlighten us.  All this fuss over one pic - apparently you are greatly upset over it all. Please, enlighten us all as to why. All I did was post a pic from some news source and you are completely upset about it - how did this all happen? It must mean a great deal to you. I am just not sure why.   So sorry...but apparently a lot of other people didn't agree with you on whether or not it was an interesting post.  What - are you some sort of religious purist and you think you are the sole arbiter of what is or isn't interesting here?  Yeah...No. Maybe, just maybe, not everyone is you. There are a lot of interesting things out there that make people go "wtf?" - And your attempt to make it all about you and what you like isn't going so well.   Apparently folks actually appreciated my post. Why does that bother you so much? I don't get it.  I care about link karma because I actually care about posting things that people might enjoy reading. I don't care about comment karma.   Seriously - maybe I am totally off on things. Is there something I am missing here? Why are you and a few others so upset with an interesting post? I am trying to understand it- I am just not seeing it.  I have no reason to 'defend' myself to anyone for anything. Seriously? Is your life so sad/bad that this is something you are willing to get all upset about?  Fun thread, interesting topic, and your are focusing on me in it all? I think you have issues beyond what I can help with.   Oh...I'm sorry...downvotes?  Is that something you personally track? How many votes does this thread have?  Yeah. And how much link Karma do you have compared to me?  Yeah. I thought so :)  You were saying?   It's a damned shame how people act at times :) I upvoted your reply because I think it is genuine and honest.   It is really sad that I regret posting something I thought people might enjoy. I was gonna post it in news (where I usually post) but didn't see it as a news story, so I posted it where I thought appropriate.  Out of all the things I have posted in 2 years on reddit I don't think I have ever posted something where I have gotten so much hate.   All over a pic...sheesh. I get why some people rant about reddit now. But - hell, I will keep doing what I do and screw the haters - it isn't like I will get a check in the mail or gold/etc anyway :)   Yeah...no. You're failing in that. But it's ok.   "When I see" is a rather broad definition. I saw it in a news story, posted it. And all you are able to contribute to this thread is whining about me?  Heh. I'll give you a 8/10 on the trolling front - because I am enjoying it.  Keep trying, I think we can bump you up to a 9/10 if you play it right.    Where did I imply that I did?  Can you point that out to me?  I bet you can't.   Yeah, well...tell that to the folks over there kicking my ass for some reason over it all.  On the other hand, don't bother. I think they are either just trolling or butthurt about something.  I really don't get some areas of reddit at times. I try to find interesting things for folks, don't ask for upvotes, gold, etc, just try to post links people might find interesting and get nothing for it - and for some odd reason some want to kick my ass for it.  Meh. Screw em. Tomorrow they will forget my name and so will I lol.   That's so cute!  Yes, when I see a big cat dragging a shark out of the water is WTF worthy. I guess you see that each day and it doesn't elicit a response from you.  Who knew. Hey...how about you post all the pics of that happening you probably have? Go ahead...I'll wait.    LOL - well, apparently, some people in my thread think I 'stole' the thread from someone. I don't get it....I honestly didn't see yours or the other thread when I posted mine. I monitor about 700 news sources on twitter/etc and saw this and thought it was interesting, but a few people in my thread are on some sort of down voting spree over it all.  http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/31selr/bobcat_dragging_shark_out_of_sea/  God...I hope my life never becomes that lame. I mean, it's lame right now, but I don't go around whining about people posting something I posted (and kudos to you for not being a jerk about it).     Does this one post of mine to reddit, out of all the ones I have made, upset a few folks this much?  Maybe I am not the one acting like a 14 yr old here.   "All (  only) things that make you say WTF." - and that pic/story made me say "WTF?" when I saw it.  So...do I understand it or do you have some other interpretation you would like to share?   I posted the other thread, didn't see yours at the time :) For some odd reason that pissed off a few people....Sometimes, I just don't understand the internet.   That's cool. You must be a conservative. How ya doing? See any good movies lately?   You know, I have always wanted to be one of the "you people" crowd. Funny how easy it is to get such a designation.   Indeed, that is when facebook is forcing all the apps to change their API to new platform.   No, I got it from a news outlet. I never claimed it was my photo.   My friends at a christian bakery snuck me out through their closet :)   Guess not all of us lead a life where we are refreshing a wbepage every few minutes. Go you.   Could be. We need a full investigation - where is Issa when we need him to look into things like this??   That was a horrible movie. I like end of the world style movies so I sucked it up and watched it.  Now I did enjoy The Remaining:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2714380/  It sucked, but in a Plan 9 From Outer Space way. It was a hoot. IMHO, best ever movie about the end times with a christian twist to it. Left behind was just a HORRID movie. Not even one I can watch for fun. The story line was god awful, that whole thing with his daughter, etc...good lord it just sucked so bad it made me wish the end was here.   I think it was caused by god as punishment against gay bakeries...or something like that.   Breaking News Feed @PzFeed 53s54 seconds ago  D.C. POWER OUTAGE - Dept. of Energy - White House - State Dept - Some 2,400 customers affected - No terrorism suspected   Breaking News Feed @PzFeed 3m3 minutes ago  UPDATE: The Dept of Energy has lost power. CNN   Well, at least he 'prayed' on it. It's like isis in America anymore.   I don't even get what the diagnosis is. Too energetic??    Well, it is better on tap than from amazon :)   LOL. Yep. Just like Obama was going to take away all the guns (never said he would, never happened), he was gonna crash the stock market, would ignore ebola and we would all die from it....etc.  The right will believe anything :)   It's great in coffee. Or, uh, so I hear.   Yep, I was gonna reply "Gamer". :)   If I may:  I understand all too well the conditioning. And then there is the history, and community, and perhaps biggest of all, acceptance by others (family, friends, etc).  What you wanted, in being a wise old jewish man on a mountain, was a sense of purpose and knowledge that you thought perhaps would help not only you but also others (I don't know, speculating).  You existed in a framework. And you wanted to do well within that framework.   Now I would like to look at it from a different view for a moment - in part because just the other night on fedflix (old govt movies) I watched a show about Jews in Chicago, made by the police department.  I ventured to guess, while watching it, that there were probably some in the Jewish community who weren't really believers (at least to some extent). But that they knew and understood the importance of culture and history and the things which tie people together. Sure - maybe moses never existed, but the traditions passed down had a net positive influence so such things were worth keeping and celebrating because of the larger lessons they conveyed.  Religion is a mufti-facteted thing and sometimes leaders see that even when they don't believe in the facts of story. There is worth in a common past, those experiences can be celebrated, understood, and carried on. Not always my cup of tea of course :)  Anyway, sorry if I am off the mark, I am personally dealing with a lot myself in this arena (though not from a jewish perspective).   What is it you are debating actually? That there can't be anything higher than humans? That something you can't see can't possibly exist? That the only things which can be are the things we can see and understand with our current technology?  Logically, such debates aren't even really debates. The more we learn the more we realize there is that we don't know. It would be like complaining that theoretical physicists and things they talk about are bunk because they haven't been proven. Proof requires the ability to prove things which may be currently beyond our physical capabilities. You don't discard such things out of hand but try to understand how the theories came to be, are they plausible, etc and so on.  Agnostics are the theoretical branch, imho, of atheism.   The point is there doesn't have to be a point. As humans we discuss a great many things and disagree on them. Sports, for example. I can easily get into a debate about the Buckeyes being better than other teams (which I have done a lot of....) when it comes to football. It won't matter in the end but people have views on things and shit happens.  Now, as to 'those who can't be reasoned with' I would tend to disagree on that in a broad sense. Sure, right now they can't, but part of that is because few challenge them directly. Popping the bubble people live in isn't usually a one time affair. But the more they see that others aren't like them (on beliefs/etc) the more their bubble is altered.   A door opened a crack today by you could be opened a bit more tomorrow by someone else. I wouldn't say it is a goal to change the mind of people but to open the minds of others to help them better determine for themselves certain things.  Ignorance, on many things, hurts us all, and picking up even little bits of 'education' on something here and there can lead to better things down the road.    I agree.   They were elected to stop the policies of Barack Obama and the Democrat Party, Limbaugh asserted. Unfortunately, however, Republicans are making it clear that they intend on working together with Democrats and the president to get things done, particularly Obamas free trade agenda.  Ive got a lot of members who believe that international trade agreements are a winner for America and the president and I discussed that right before I came over here, said Senator McConnell, who among other Republicans, shares Obamas vision about the trade partnerships. I think hes interested in moving forward. I said, Send us trade agreements; were anxious to look at them.  Even Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has voiced his support for the trade agreements, encouraging the president to prioritize passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Speaking at the Center for the National Interest dinner in New York City on October 23, Senator Paul said:  Our national power is a function of the national economy. During the Reagan renaissance, our strength in the world reflected our successful economy.  Low growth, high unemployment, and big deficits have undercut our influence in the world. Americans have suffered real consequences from a weak economy.  President George W. Bush understood that part of the projection of American power is the exporting of American goods and culture. His administration successfully brokered fourteen new free trade agreements and negotiated three others that are the only new free trade agreements approved since President Obama took office. Instead of just talking about a so-called pivot to Asia, the Obama administration should prioritize negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership by years end.   http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/congress/item/19489-republicans-to-obama-we-will-give-you-trade-promotion-authority   Let's just start a rumor that it stops discrimination against gays and prevents Iran from getting a nuke, and that Obama is 100% for it all. The right won't even look into it and organize against it, including setting up a gofundme for the pizzaparlorSuperPac.   So what? They are investors. They don't work, they invest their money and it works for them - the are able to finally do this under Obama.   Of course the children, those in college, jail, etc probably aren't working, and given how racist the justice system is one can better understand the numbers (Note: conservatives don't think the system is racist at all and, in fact, support more discrimination in America against blacks, muslims, gays, etc).   And don't worry folks - some republican will campaign on forcing those black folks into the labor force...just like, what to cons, were the 'good ole days'.   They like to hire people to look for acorns, shop muslim bakeries, and things like this.   I don't think anyone ever accused her of being very bright. Out of the dems in power there are 10-12% who are loons. On the right it is about 65%. And people keep electing both.   "Jesus will transform you - suddenly you will hate the poor, push for wars, seek out ways to force his words on others through laws, instead of the healing the sick you shall shame them. Instead of selling all you have and helping others you will set up venture capitalist companies and sell all others have to enrich thyself. The lord will show you that to support our troops you send them die, to support the sick you will turn the other cheek, those in prison you shall laugh at and hope for their misery."    Drove alone across country with only a 2 hour nap. Twice.   The football from the college championship "What's it like knowing the Wolverines will never touch you?"   Find a liquor store and some guns. Hole up there and wait for other cool people who want to drink to do the same. Party on until things calm down.   In other words, pretty much my current life.   Help, help, I'm being repressed :)   Not sure how the two are related, except maybe in the mind of a conservative: "I support discrimination and so does Iran, why can't you treat America like Iran? Inconsistent! They are the exact same countries doing the exact same things! If only libtards were as smart us to see that!"   Real gross domestic product -- the value of the production of goods and services in the United States, adjusted for price changes -- increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to the "third" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  In the third quarter, real GDP increased 5.0 percent.  https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm   Basically - the economy is growing under Obama, unlike under Bush - conservatives told us the economy would crash, stock market would plummet, and Obama would take all of our guns. Seems like they got everything wrong.   Does that include Liberty University?   http://imgur.com/lhEKYGW   Title was from the twitter feed.   I can hear the conservatives now: "See, we got a republican congress and we turned things around......"   Hope I win. I had a pet rock once, those are like ponies right?   The headline is the story, what else do you want to know - what he was wearing when he signed it? :)   "We're bigots and promote discrimination and people don't agree with us on that being a good christian idea! WAAAAAAH"   The question is - would I have to bake her a cake??   That was the title when I posted it.    Progress always wins. Look at how cons talk about Islam and how regressive it is - even they admit becoming more liberal/progressive is the right way to go.  Sadly, many fundies want to halt and roll back progression to please their god.    Odd, it sure seemed to be about current US politics to me. Weird.   Here is my problem with free trade and conservatives:  Theory - free trade will help poorer countries grow which will open new markets for the US and spur job growth.  Reality - ok, makes sense....but you forgot something.  What happens is businesses close here and people lose jobs as the first step. Then they lose their house, car, etc. And maybe, just maybe in 5-10 years more jobs will open up. All the while conservatives are yelling at people needing food stamps, unemployment, etc and calling them lazy. And, of course, they are busy union busting so when some jobs do come back you won't be making as much as you were before.   They think their job is to go to bat for republicans - they really don't care about the US.   LOL ok...now I am a muslim apologist for calling out click bait biased 'journalism'? I am pretty much an atheist and don't have any love for anyones religion.   This is a blatant attempt from a rw source to feed the feeble minded hatred of an entire group of people that is vastly larger than the few militant idiots here.    So, once again, the term 'militants' is there but the headline leaves it out.   So I guess it would be accurate for me to say "Christians sexually abuse children" when writing an article about some catholics and them covering up abuse?  Or "Christian Nation" (as the rw likes to call the US) starts a war with Iraq. Hundreds of thousands killed by US Christians in search for oil and wmd's.....   From the article: "Militants from extremist group Boko Haram" and the headline becomes "Muslims".  Yeah....ok :)    Interesting how they use the term 'muslims' here to identify someone. In the US I never see them say "A Christian did x/y/z/". I am guessing the only reason they mention it and care in the first place has something to do with their personal biases. What's next, "Gun owner shoots/robs someone?" No? I wonder why.   If I get my membership renewed later this week I will help you out, lvl 100 Necromancer. You just plan on farming the last section with Malistaire or the whole area?   Sounds like something a conservative would say. Not true and try to push fear - because, well, facts are pesky things that get in the way of agendas.   Troll much?   http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2015/supernatural-recap-21015-season-10-episode-13-halt-catch-fire/   Teacher who died in a crash. He crashed into a phone poll which allowed his spirit to tap into the internet/wi-fi - and he used the GPS to kill the guy in the car (but let his wife out first).   I found it interesting because a recent episode of Supernatural had pretty much the same thing happen. Someone needs to get Sam and Dean on the case.   Never stoop to the student level. Just break out the rifle and duct tape and then tell em you are going to go all nazi on their asses....man, I miss my teaching days, my methods were ahead of their time. Or behind the times.   I love the image of Iran the right pushes. Nothing about the caviar sales from there, the tourism, etc - it's like how they played people on iraq and babies/incubators, shredders, and nukes/etc.   And why are they 'concerned' about Israel? Oh. Yeah. Jesus and the Bible. It's like our own mini isis in the US.   Blazing Saddles.   What did they do, bring him back from the dead so he could die again? Sounds like something fox would try to do with reagan.   But see, rmoney was being a smart business man and we need smart business to run our country just like a business - make profit, cut workers, outsource military, and if people don't like crumbling roads they can drive on someone else's roads.   I call it DeadBart because it seems everything is ghost written by someone who hates obama....   You don't need to rally them, they will vote for any republican that hates progress, science, muslims, anyone not white and Christian.  What they need is someone to rally moderates and swing voters.   Image here:  http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/otras-ciudades/derrumbe-formo-el-rostro-de-jesus/15445256   Here, cry into my glass so I can add your tears to my vintage bottles from 2008 and 2012. I do so like a glass of those in awhile.   Hey, I can't stand the lady myself, but this is a witch hunt. Are you saying the state department is lying that they didn't get everything?   Yeah - after the emails were turned over to the state dept and the ones asked for by gowdy were given to them.     So, looks like Boehner is for the TPP as well. For once there is something both the right and the left can bash obama over and the right is quiet as can be. Huh.   The butler with the candlestick.    Rand Paul, Ron Paul, Ru Paul....what's the difference. We need people with new names.   Soldiers have alleged (although the Pentagon has said it cant confirm) at least six U.S. troops died in clashes with the Taliban while hunting for Bergdahl after he went missing and was seized by the Taliban in Paktika province on June 30, 2009.  http://time.com/author/mark-thompson/   She probably wouldn't like my Meat Loaf Mondays or our White Castles Wednesdays :)   Wait....what? We funded them for years, because, well, the soviets. We wanted the Taliban. Back then they weren't a 'threat'. They were tools we used.   And I don't think back then they were going to rush into the USSR anymore than I think they are going to rush into the US.   I am being honest here - I don't see the big threat to us. Do I think some people can hook up and do terrorist things? Yep. But hell, lone wolf folks here could do a lot more for any number of reasons.   What, exactly, if you can elucidate on it, scares you about them?   Awww....look at you being all scared.  Go ahead, tell us all what these 5 folks are going to do that scares you so much.   What IS the cost side? What is it you fear and 'believe' they can or will do? Should American's be quaking in their boots over these folks?  Apparently you think these 5 humans, out of 6+ billion, are some huge threat to our country.  Can you detail out how they are such a threat?   What is it people think they are going to be able to do? Have a tupperware party and plot to overthrow the US?  5 People, out of the entire population of earth. Now I am sure some might think they can come back and inspire others - but the track record here is the US kills folks like them all the time.   Maybe the fear people have is that they will use their time and notoriety to influence fundamentalists to jihad - to which I say, I am more worried about the fundies here than there.  Where did the taliban come from? What can these guys actually offer the taliban now? Or is it Al qadea I am supposed to be afraid of now. Or Isis?  Seems there is always someone in the ME that I should be afraid of. I live in Ohio. I am more worried about the Wolverines come football season or the Spartans than some no name guy in the ME who wants to kill someone else in the ME.  Hell, for all I know there some russian guy who pines for the old days and wants to work with some of his comrades to launch a nuke. Really, I am not afraid of 5 guys from the ME who have more of a bone with countries there over Islam than here.  Perspective. We should get it.   As far as the last part: *How is that relevant to Bergdahl?*  It goes to the worries and concerns the right seems to have. Really. I am not scared of the people we traded for one of our own. What are they going to do to the US? Nothing. They don't scare me. If I had to put my 'worries' in some order or other, those 5 would fall below my X. Countries and people that have the actual ability to do us real harm (China/Russia) would be high up on the list.  This is about one thing - people who hate Obama and want to use this whole thing for political reasons.   I see a US soldier, who for whatever reason, was captured and in danger. He is home now. That's one bottom line for me in all of this. I was no fan of Bush, though I voted for him in 2000, but I wouldn't have ripped him a new one for bringing home one of our own. Our soldiers face a lot, sometimes they have issues, but you don't leave em behind. Period.   Maybe 'patriot' means something different to others. One of our own was captive. We had those guys we traded for awhile and got whatever it is we wanted from them. They were no use to us. It isn't like they are gonna rise up and come over here and whip us. Seriously, there are bigger and worse things to be scared of than them.  But it's all about politics and bashing Obama - I can find a lot better things to bash him over than this.     And you can understand the hype over '5 high ranking' and 'trade', right?  We had a fellow American, a soldier, being held. We kill 'high ranking' al qaeda people every day before breakfast with drones. What, you think those 5 had some sort of magical abilities or something? Ohhh scary people we held. I mean overall, were you one of those people who though Iraq was some huge threat to the US in the first place?   We traded some losers not from this country for someone who was a US citizen. That is a good trade all day long because I am not really sitting here scared of those folks all day long.   I'm still more worried about the soviets their nukes because they could actually do something other than yelling allah ackbar while killing each other.   (*puts on conservative hat*) Why aren't we using our soldiers to do more of this? Shouldn't our kids, spouses, etc be the ones on the front lines? We need a real president again like Bush who gladly sent our people to do the fighting instead of asking others to do their part. We need to pull up our bootstraps and hand money to other countries and our fellow Americans to die and protect our freedoms from....well, crap, I don't know which of our freedoms is at risk over there right now.  Anyone know?   Honestly, I can't answer that. But it does bring up something:  I though Obama threw open the borders and anyone could just walk in here? I mean, republicans have basically said that - so why does this person even need a visa? Is it possible they are just fear mongering (again)?  And I am guessing that the US still has some of the best healthcare in the world on some things. Even Ted Cruz signed up for the ACA :)   I think we know why. Gays. God is punishing the US for the most evil of all evils. Gay people. That is why he has sent hurricanes and storms like this.   Never before in our history have we had to deal with such storms. It was only after the commie liberals starting pushing for gays to be married and allowed to serve their country that god started this. This is why we need to vote for the super smart awesome christian republicans. They can guide us out of the wilderness and strike down the gays for Jesus.  Yeah...might be some sarcasm in that directed at the most backwards people around - Fundamentalists (who all seem to gravitate to 'conservatives' whether here or in the middle east.)   So what he is saying is: "Well, there have been many problems for years we blew off, but now that there is the ACA and it's helping people we want to remove it and then we will finally, maybe, do something about the problems we have been ignoring"  Whatever happens, the ACA gave attention to a problem long ignored. Progress. The right can't stop it. From allowing their fellow countrymen/women who are gay serve their country to healthcare to gay marriage - progress marches on.   So you wanted Obama to treat him as a criminal before he had a chance to share his side of things? A soldier came home. Now they are saying he is guilty of something. Two separate events that should be treated as such.   So as commander in chief you would let someone rot without definitive proof? He could have had mental issues, ptsd, who knows what and your thought is "Screw you, we're leaving you behind on the word of others and without you being able to defend yourself."  Nice.   So, basically, you would leave a man behind because of what some people believe? Funny how some people abandon their principles first chance they get. Regardless of how you feel the president has a duty to treat him as a US soldier in good standing until proven otherwise.   And he still was convicted of nothing until now. So yeah, I tend to stick to my principles even when they end up maybe not having the best result. Something it seems other are willing to ditch because they never honestly held them in the first place.   So you judge people before you look for them?  Hindsight is one thing, and being upset in hindsight is too. But not looking for someone based on hearsay/suspicion is something else.   So advisors determine guilt and innocence now without even talking to a person. Ok. Whatever floats your boat :)   And the right would rather leave a soldier to rot than bring him home.  It is obvious that they have totally abandoned their principles on this - but hey, remember Darren Wilson and Ferguson? They got upset when people judged him before his day in court. Suddenly they don't care anymore.     They can be upset about that all day long. But they would be upset no matter what he did. If he had left him there to rot because someone said he deserted, without proof and chance to defend himself, and it came out he could have rescued him? The right would be screaming about it.  It goes to principles. Should he have treated the man as innocent first? Would you? Or has that principle went out the window because people hate Obama ?   I'll say what I have elsewhere. Obama acted properly and treated him as innocent until proven guilty.  Something I think conservatives used to believe in but are now ditching because of Obama. Funny how that works. Guess they will from here on out never, ever, mention the idea of innocent until proven guilty.  Had it come out that Obama had the chance and did nothing because he believed he deserted than the right would be howling about that too.   So you are saying Obama shouldn't have done anything and just accepted the word of others that he was a deserter, without a tribunal, hearing, etc? Without even talking to him (or having others do so)?  And here I thought conservatives had some principles on people being seen as innocent until proven guilty or at least being able to testify on their own behalf.  I am guessing conservatives are abandoning their principles right now to smear Obama. Which means they never really held those principles in the first place.   Reminder to the conservatives on this: The man was seen as innocent until proven guilty, and Obama acted in a manor consistent with that.  I am sure that is what is making the cons unhappy now :)   SO.....Let me see if I understand this. Obama didn't declare him guilty beforehand, helped get him rescued, and people are upset about this? Same people who were saying D. Wilson shouldn't be seen as guilty till all the facts come out wanted Obama to do the same for this soldier?  Ok....   Stupid to apologize. The right has been 'accusing' Obama of being a muslim as though that is a bad thing. They whine about muslims in politics here all the time.  So how is it a 'slur' in this case?   Ah republicans -  they see others as less American and less human because of their race, religion, orientation.    Yeah, but we still don't know where the Ark really is. Except that it is in some desert warehouse run by the government. I bet Obama uses it for a footstool!    They got the ideas for fines from Cruz and Liberty university :)   Conservative view on this (which you can see around the web):  "Good. Obama is evil and took all our guns. Bibi should be our president and I support any country spying on us. I hate America because the person I wanted to win didn't so I fully endorse foreign nations spying on us. We must support Israel and stop gays here or we will get more deadly hurricanes.   We should be more like them and how they treat gays and how they handle health care - not like Obama, we need leader like Bibi to hold us cause we are scared of mooslims too! Not to mention baby Jeebus loves Israel and will curse us if we fail to kneel and serve her, Obama is a muslim and doesn't know what the bible says about us serving them!"  ---Yep, that pretty sums up the rw and anything Israel/Obama   You have to use AT-AT's for that since they can get under the shield ;)   My dad's dad died when he was young. He missed his dad. That didn't mean his mom was gonna rush out and marry some guy.   What is it conservatives are always saying? "Suck it up, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and don't blame others!"  So if you end up with two moms, one, none, whatever - deal with it and do the best you can because they probably are.    Baby steps :) Maybe he is now against gays getting 'stoned' because he thinks god hates pot now and he is just confused.   ah yes, fear mongering. Obama will take all your guns, stop parents from allowing kids to do chores, will crash the stock market, destroy america!  Blah blah blah. Still waiting on all the crap people claimed WOULD happen to actually happen. And so far? Not ONE has had the guts to admit they were wrong and apologize for fear mongering.  Israel - beware fundie christians who want to use you for their apocalypse they dream of.   So...basically like your run of the mill fundies elsewhere in the world.   "Oh, look at us, hugging those like us, helping those who profess the same beliefs. And bombing those who don't back to the stone age or being over run by our manifest destiny"  Fundies are their own countries within countries.   Woohoo! That guy produces more green house gasses out of his mouth than every farting animal on the planet (I'm looking at you, cows).  I hope he gets the nomination too - that would be classic.   According to conservatives only lazy people aren't working - that is why they want to always cut aid. So - according to them, Obama is awesome because everyone can get a job.   In the future we will have mated dogs to chickens, then that creation to pigs, and then that one to cows. We will have an awesome food source that gives meat, milk, and eggs all while being potty trained and able to sniff out drugs/bombs.   Don't we all ;)   Yep. Better stock up now. You could make a killing selling that stuff later. Of course, if you get caught, you could be in a cell next to bubba. "What ya in for?" --  "I sold lip balm!"   You seem to run around saying that a lot, and complaining about reddit in general. Maybe the problem isn't reddit....   I did both. Book from the library and the librarian. Man oh man, that reference desk has everything :)   Also worth noting: It was national foreign language week. There are a million things to be concerned about these days. Kids learning something new about the world isn't one of them I would put on the short list.   Here are my thoughts. When I was in elementary school we had one jewish kid (and 2 black kids) and I don't know if any were atheist or not. But we did have fun Christmas celebrations and plays. And we also learned about Jewish holidays and did activities with that spinny thing made of clay stuff and some candle thingees....  Anyway. Being exposed to actual, real life, cultures and languages that a good chunk of our fellow earthlings are involved in I don't see as a bad thing. It's one thing to read about something in a book and another to hear it/see/etc.  I mean, which would you rather do - learn about sex from a book or from actually doing it? :)  Reality. It's outside the bubble some want to wrap themselves in.   No, I am just a prophet. Sometimes when I see a headline I get glimpses of the future (started to happen after sex with a leprechaun). Give it time, rw fundies will be talking about gay lasers.  More Aircraft Laser Incidents Pinned on Gay Club-Goers http://swiftreport.blogs.com/news/2005/02/more_aircraft_l.html  ;)   Fox headline will be "Lasers can turn your eye's blue, can they also make you gay?" Then those bright rw congress folks will get scared and try to ban it thinking gay people with laser pointers could be pointing them at your kids and making them gay.  America. Land of the free... and crazy rw'ers who believe gays cause hurricanes and punishments from an invisible sky fairy. You read it here first, gay lasers will be a thing.   So they want to ban women from getting ammo?  	200
             Another interesting part: Some scientists are upset that the risky expedition caused important resources (supply ships, crew, equipment) to be diverted from other research sites in Antarctica. http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/rescue-effort-for-trapped-antarctic-voyage-disrupts-serious-science/?_r=0               Renewables now make up 15.9% of U.S. generation capacity, more than oil and nukes combined.                          	18
 That knife is worth more than $20...   Should of had a better best man.    Watch TV, golf, and eat out all the time. Oh, we both have new cars.    THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY!    I'm now survivor ready.    Robin.  Sorry.    I was waiting for her to throw or drop it, to show how easily damaged our brain is.  I was disappointed.    Batman and Robin.  Batman Forever was bad enough to demand a reboot, but the pushed it one more time.  Batman and Robyn will be forever known to me as the worst movie ever.    Blow jobs   I find it hard to feel sorry for people who made millions then blew it all.    Women drivers    This is what i tell my wife all the time.  That and the speech from Team America World Police.  There are three types of people in the world; dicks, pussys, and assholes.  I'm a dick and i feel responsible to fuck assholes who think it's on to shit on you pussys.  She doesn't agree, but it's been 5 years, so i think she's at least accepted.    What is wrong with you?  Do you only like happy cartoons?    Leaving Las Vegas    Did i miss the funny?    The kid was a dumb thug.  The cops testimony isn't that hard to believe.  The evidence backs it up.  Blood in the cop car, kid shot at close range.    So, what about people that aren't homeless or in prison?  Is there a genetic predisposition to being gay, but there needs to be the triggers in your life?  Similar to people that suffer from addiction?  I've always figured everything in life is a mix of nurture AND nature.    I've always thought this was more the case with gay men.  Of course some women become lesbians, even gay men think women are attractive. It's sex with them that scares them.    So by that logic, a person who is constantly scorned by the opposite sex, and accepted by their sex, could develop long term "gay" feelings and behaviors?     I got an idea.  Everyone there hates the police, so the police should just leave.  Let the towns people protect themselves.    One study last week said it proved it was genetics, now this study is suggesting it's a learned behavior.  Nurture vs. Nature rages on.    Never worked in a shop?  Oil and air.    A beautiful American history lesson from JizzBomb.      Literally, unbelievable.    Fuck that lady.  I'll drive slow in the left lane, be reckless and film the guy I'm blocking, then laugh when he crashes because I've forced him to speed past my self righteous ass.    Fuck more women   This should be at the top of the list!   This man is my new hero.    Did he take the charger?   ITT: no shit    Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail.   Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.    Yes, fuck you.  Safe distance is half a car length, at any speed.    Why would we want to buy a tank from the French anyways?  Maybe we were being polite...  Look France, it's not your tank, it's us. We just don't understand, but thanks anyways.    These are all mostly designed as a one time use part.     Your suspension components.   But sure, drive that thing in, techs need to eat too.    Women drivers   False.  Porsche 356 pre A.   I was once told, you may be able to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to maintain one.    Funny, i feel the same.  What's even more funny is i always considered Daft Punk to be an EDM type "band".   My wife votes Democrat, and i vote Republican, so now we both save time and neither of us vote.    How exactly does one, suck a fuck?    Bad luck Brian.  Turns found gun over to the police.  Gets arrested when gun comes back tied to a double homicide.   Remember,  possession is 9/10 of the law and police don't care who did it, as long as they can arrest someone.  Hopefully it won't be you.    This is why 4, 5, and 6 are far better than 1, 2, and 3.   If you take that much time on the models and special effects, you're going to put as much effort into the story and charters.  1, 2, and 3 were beautiful c.g.i. effects, but had no depth beyond that.    What does something that happened a hundred years ago have to do with a guy getting jumped by three black guys?    Roland   Holy shit, i live within 15 miles of there!  I'll be visiting soon.    That's the problem.  Engines and oil are getting better, so they tell people that you can go longer in between oil changes, but we still use paper filters.  I don't like going past 5k.    No, it's still bitching and he still sounds like a dick.   This. I've interviewed close to 50 people and it bugs the shit out of me when they are half an hour early.  I feel that is worse than 5 minutes late.  I'm a busy guy and I gave you the appointment time for a reason.  Last guy showed up while I was still eating my lunch.  =/   Worst. Porn. Ever.   Well, that's disappointing.    Problem is, too many people drive like thoughtless idiots, so they walk the same.   	53
 Are you going to do any more articles for cracked, or are you just a video guy from now on?  Also you have a pretty notable fashion sense, where do you buy your stuff?  	1
 As an average man who has been crushed by his single cat being hit by a car, I can attest to this.   While your *science* is right, you left out the main ingredient to pegasi, dragons, and large beards: magic.   Yeah, I generally use it for CQB, but I like how it can handle targets at range effectively if you know what you're doing. The P90 and MP7 and worthless past anything other than buildings, otherwise I'd be using the MP7 everywhere.   SEAL Team 7 has a clan server up. When we are in, we keep it in good condition   Oh ok, forgot that variable. Thanks for making it known   First of all, llama and infectios, your posts are not helpful and annoyingly pointless to the post, please read the reddiquette.  In regards to the post, I think the beacon would be overpowered if everyone could spawn on it. Imagine if all 12 soldiers or even 32 spawned on it at once. It would be extreme mayhem. The idea would be cool, helpful, and useful, but way too powerful. They would have to put a security measure on it, like a half second or full second spawn delay between each spawn if they made this possible.   It released the 4th with premium in the US. Where are you located?    Edit: they were unplayable from a bug for like a day or two however   I suggest you buy it for xbox. Comparing pc to console is like comparing apples to oranges, simply uncomparable. That being said, buy a good gaming pc later. premium is more worth it now than it will be as more dlc releases, but pc gaming can be more fun. Its really up to you.    Tl;dr - Buy premium now on xbox, then pc later down the road for other gaming frontiers   He mentioned jets, but his post mostly concerned helicopters. You only have rockets in a helo if you're an AA pilot, so we need pods to do something. Read the post better next time before you make a fool of yourself   I was about to post a thread there, then thought, there are more interactive andy's on BL then intelligent people, so I came here haha   My main gun is the PDW-R, and I use it on medic or support mainly because I'm pretty bad with rifles and completely trash with LMGs. I'm great with carbines and snipers, otherwise id use it their too.    Yeah I saw that text shrink as well. He literally bumps his troll posts if they're stagnant for an hour to get the responses coming. Its so sad.   Yeah, I saw the troll post. Of course his kdr and skill are high, he hides in the back while getting mav kills only. No deaths means no drop in skill.    The last 30 seconds were most gripping, as I expected the soldier we were following to get knifed by the recon near the end, so they could share their remorse.    Yeah, this. I tried to record some footage back in the alpha so I could give feedback, but my super powerful pc was incapable of playing and recording simultaneously.    I was exaggerating, but 3 or 4 is less than 6 to 11. It must have just been the very few times I was playing that it happened   It only takes like a single bullet to kill people on hardcore lol I think the thing that turned me off to it was the stupid blueberries not realizing that there is friendly fire, so I die from my own soldiers constantly. Super off putting   I never really play hardcore. Idk why. It's not like it's too difficult, it's just less fun for me. You enjoy it more?   I never really play hardcore. Idk why. It's not like it's too difficult, it's just less fun for me. You enjoy it more?   Never used the extinguisher, but that's because I thought it could only be used once. Is it pretty useful now?   Surviving within an inch of life after an epic slaughter... These are battlefield moments that I play for   These are the moments when you feel good, like you're a true, skilled soldier. Good feel   Are you in my clan? We feel this way everyday haha   After playing close quarters with conquest domination, capping a regular conquest flag feels like the microwave minute from hell. I know the feeling   I would like to hear any of your more unusual moments where your first reaction drenched you in the fear that you would soon meet your demise, but your valorous Battlefieldian mindset brought you through to victory. Here's mine:  Today I was capturing point Bravo on Caspian Border, when a large tree on the C side of the capture point was knocked down somehow. The tree pinned my soldier so I could run around between the branches, but I was trapped within them until it disappeared. In all of my long hours since the game released in October, this has never happened to me. Meanwhile, through the brush, I witnessed a jeep with two men drive up, and a third soft target following close behind. I quickly threw on my big boy pants, locked and loaded, and screamed my war cry as I fired on the jeep's driver first, killing him, then his gunner, with a few (probably lucky) shots. The third man discovered my hideout but I used my prison to my advantage, using the branches as a shield, successfully luring him one way so that I could shoot him in the back and rain victorious, just prior to the tree vanishing. I successfully held Bravo while hiding in what I had assumed would be my grave, and now I want to hear your stories. Anything is fine, but preferably the strange.   Thank you, this sufficiently answers my query, and it makes perfect sense. I doubt uTorrent cares enough, or is even capable of showing a more defined graph, one which would support to what you are referring. Good enough for me.    I can watch the graph update every second. Does it calculate it in reference to the prior speed? Or through some other equation? If what you're saying is true then the graph it supplies me while it's downloading the torrent is a farse, and it's not showing me real speed data.  The way I'm making sense of what you're saying, is that when the transmissions are interrupted, the speeds decelerate, which is why they fall, until they can connect to another peer, where they begin to lift again? Let me know if this is a completely false assumption.   The last sentence sort of answers my question. I suppose that make sense. Dropping and picking up peers would appear to cause that, except the slopes are pretty defined over proper intervals, so there should be more to it than that.  	28

 I'm probably going to get the shit ripped through me for this, but I'm new here so cut me some slack.   why is asking what to get a bad thing?  I only ask because I was just about to make a post asking for some advice on some good gear and places to get it from for someone who isn't familiar with all this.    that's what happens when you make out with a vacuum cleaner   I don't want to live on this planet anymore.    uptokes all round to share the love!!    you're an idiot, that's not dave.    well about 6 years ago my dad got his first mobile phone, and for about 6 months he kept forgetting where the space key was so every message I would get would be one big head fuck that I would have to go through, it didn't help that my sister told him "2 typ lik dis 2 mak it shorta".    as the title explains I'm struggling to find a suitable FIFO job in the mining sector.   I am a qualified fitter and machinest with a wide variety of experience, but I'm having trouble finding work in the mines.   mainly due to the fact I'm unsure of where to start looking, Iv tried all the main job search sites but can't seem to find anything suitable or within my qualifications, most jobs Iv found have been for high up supervisor jobs and such, and seeing as Iv only been qualified for 7 months I doubt I will have any luck with a job like that.   all I have been hearing about is this "mining boom" where so many people are getting these amazingly high paid jobs, but I can't find them!   so if any of you have any advice on how I can get my foot in the door I would really appreciate it! :)      when I was 14, i ran into a door at full speed and knocked myself out cold while chasing a friend around his house. the last thing I remember was his mum yelling " stop running around before someone gets hurt!!!" then bam I was out. scored I nifty little scar under my eye from it.    fitter and machinist here! finished my apprenticeship 6 months ago and trying to make my way to the WA to toll away in the mines   fuck you.    can someone tell me how long that thing went for? I gave up after seeing the fetus and realised it wasn't goin to stop    proposed to my girlfriend...   the look on the office ladys face at work when I ran out of the toilet in a rush with my pant down to answer the phone because I thought I was the only person there.   	13
 So I'll pose the same question I always pose when I see articles like this: why don't more people just err on the side of the environment? Clearly the people really pushing the agenda against science are concerned about money. Money money money. No long-term sight. It makes me sick.   Protein. Diet variation. Humans are omnivorous.  If you're asking from a vegetarian/vegan perspective, I sympathize. The way animals are farmed is horrendous.   Nevermind. That's an anti-spam technique, apparently.

Then put Medics Killed and Medics with full uber killed strange parts.   Glad that you asked, I actually found that I have become a better Engineer from the experience, with the knowledge that the Chargin' Targe is the weapon that takes the most skill, I know to only fear the Shield using Demomen, I don't even sweat when I see anything that isn't a shield.      I also have become a better Medic, the reason for this is that I know that only a skilled player could kill me with the Targe, it's really just about the confidence that I obtained when I got that kill.   [Sure] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3383129766)   I personally tried out a B.A.S.E.

The rocket launcher mostly is based on splash damage, removed by the Direct Hit's stats, you need to literally get direct hits to do anything with that. The Grenade Launcher, however, is based on mostly direct hits from the pills. The shattering pills from the Loch aren't as bad as the Direct Hit's rockets that basically shatter on surfaces anyway.      TL;DR, this isn't really that long so not reading it just kinda makes you lazy if I'm being honest, but pretty much the play style for Soldier changes to being direct rockets and Demo's doesn't because direct pills are his thing I guess.   My friend was playing some TF2, can't remember the map, I think it was ctf_well, and I joined on an alt account to start pissing him off by doing dumb things like whacking his sentry when I'm not an Engineer or building right next to him because he HATES that. So I'm doing that and then I guess I walked onto a metal spawn or something because he starts talking to me in the Skype about how a Soldier took his metal. So he picks up his dispenser and says "No. This Soldier is not using my dispenser." So I walk into him as a medic and start calling for a dispenser, he gets pissed and starts to call a vote kick on me, I plead in the chat and say it's my third game and that I'm sorry and I will try harder, I stay in, but he still wont let me use the dispenser, he picks it up every time and while that's happening I need to pretend to be on Reddit laughing at something. Eventually I stop and leave him be. Until a Pyro comes and sets everyone on fire including me. At that point I stood next to his dispenser spamming thanks while other people enjoy the heals. He picks it up and burns to death. I think it was worth it on his end.   I got a 23 on my math test, I assure you! I-uh, totally got a 23 on something unrelated to the button!

 I loved that hike. I did it twice in a day   I've had similar things happen to me. It's strange that you mention swimming lessons. I used to dread going to my swimming lessons when I was young (for some unknown reason). I remember a specific instance when I got into an argument with my parents because they forced me to go when I didn't want to. The phone then rang a couple minutes later saying the lesson was cancelled. As you said, these feelings passed as I grew up and became more confident.    Be my Ygritte?

 watching a old video clip and bringing someone back as a hologram after death is completely different   they didn't give the ok to be used as a hologram after death it's different from old recordings and clips etc..   the family giving the ok is not the same.. let people rest in peace there is no need for holograms   they are the ones that would have to ok it in the first place they could sue otherwise   enough with these holograms!!! first 2-pac then Micheal Jackson and now Senna  i can't support this because they are dead they get no say in it (sure the family or whatever gives the ok but not the actual person who obviously can't)  let them rest in peace   it's like they think Ferrari is sitting around not upgrading their car at best they'll be able to compete with williams   if i'm not mistaken they have like 10 tokens left.. how much do you think they will improve this years car?  will they be able to match Mercedes on pace rather than adopting an alternate strategy  Raikkonen said in an article after yesterdays race that he thinks this will happen.. hopefully it's true   cheers.. these streams are pretty shit today keeps cutting out   Renault provided a gigantic turd of an engine   what did he say my stream keeps screwing up   i don't expect it to be any better next year   got a feeling rosberg will take hamilton out   yep it will be another hamilton rosberg vettel podium unless the mercs chew the tyres like Malaysia    hard to pass cars when the car is powered by a gigantic turd   massa has electrical problems?   he's using any excuse he can think of   going to guess it will be a Hamilton Rosberg Vettel podium   get used to this podium it will be like this all year   it was boring and a sign of how the rest of the year will be  some teams are struggling to even finish a race.. Rosberg doesn't have what it takes to challenge Hamilton, the Ferrari's have improved but not enough to pose a threat to the Mercedes and we have yet to see a good vettel kimi battle because something always fucks it  williams not good enough to keep up with the ferrari so we can expect the same results each race 1.hamilton 2 rosberg 3 vettel 4 kimi 5-6 bottas/massa    so for the rest of the year it's going to be 1. hamilton 2. rosberg 3. vettel 4. kimi then the williams 5-6 and so on   another boring race.. Malaysia probably going to be the only interesting race of the year if it stays like this   it's on of my favourite maps what i'm saying is it's annoying to have it voted for several times in a row or only have 1 or 2 different maps inbetween playing it again   its like some people just can't get enough of it that they have to constantly vote for it a gazillion times  just played a few rounds of casual for fun and dust2 was voted for 3 times (twice in a row) happens every day  maps been out for like (15 years?) you would think people wouldn't want to play it every 5 seconds     he'll be kicking himself for it the ferrari is vastly improved from last year and McLaren is pile of shit   alonso will be kicking himself now for leaving ferrari.. McLaren look like they will have there worst season ever and the ferrari seems a lot better then last year   this had better not be how the rest of the season is utterly boring race   the issue is the crap engine in his redbull he'll be lucky to get a win this season with that Renault turd powering his car   time for redbull to get a different power unit the Renault is basically a gigantic turd   the redbull seems to be a powered by a pile of shit   it's going to be a Mercedes dominated year again so i think it's going to be pretty boring all year round   even so he really shouldn't discuss/show things like that in the first place as it's a review  they are not supposed to reveal plot twists and endings   they need to make the movie appeal to both rooster teeth fans and neutral people (who may not even know what rooster teeth is)  if it's just a movie full of RT references and in jokes it won't be successful    this is more then 5000 people i think it's grouping all  players together  saw a post on the gameloft forum where someone tested a low score and got 29,434th place  this happened on a event before and they never fixed it   was going to post something similar unless you run a ben riley you are almost certain to lose your combo in the high rise area  hate it with a passion   well that sucks   just noticed the new event so had a quick go  got 1.6 million on my first try (died because of a stupid mistake)  i thought that would be good enough for a decent position that i could work on later.. nope 360th place don't even want to kow what the top 50 scores would be  1.6 million in previous events would of got into the top 100 no problems seems now you got to get over 4-6 million to place well   that's why they should come up with something to keep people occupied that isn't 30 day long events one after the other  they can't keep this pace up forever   they are far too greedy for that they would much rather release several 200 clam items every event so people have to buy several $100 clam options to have everything  personally i wouldn't spend $100 on a mobile app even if it gave unlimited clams i play this game for 1-2 minutes maybe 2-3 times a day.. not the same as spending $100 on a PC/console game that will give me 100's of hours of immersive gameplay    i uninstalled simpsons because of it family guy might go soon as well as it's just getting tiresome if you want anything decent for the game without paying the ridiculous prices they charge   it will be another copy paste event you can't make something unique when you are put events out one after the other   got another score of 2.4 million luckily this one registered so i'm in the running for the 50 iso 8 prize   i'm a little burned out on this game atm  king butt, comic con which went for 40 days then Halloween and now american dad to me that's far too many events in a short period of time  once this one finishes they'll likely have a Christmas one as well  game needs some downtime between events maybe release a new district or have smaller weekend things like they used to do not month long events one after each other   this only seems to happen to me on my best runs and ones i use ISO-8 to continue on  i just scored 2.6 million on the daily run and game decides not to register it i even used 6 ISO during the game  game is more than happy to take the ISO and not register the score  seriously getting over the glitches this fucking game has (not to mention the lag)  restart of phone etc isn't making the game register the new score  don't have screenshots because i shouldn't have to take them after every run in case this BS happens.   a lot of people make far more vials then they can ever spend  i average 800 on a bad run and over 1000 on a good run playing 5-10 times a day you end up with a lot more vials then you can ever spend  they should add a mystery box for like 100k vials that you can win ISO or portals or something   this happens to me a lot and it's annoying   progress rewards are 2500 vials and 1 iso 3500 vials 2 iso 10 iso and last prize premium portal and 10 ISO  the entire event (and leaderboard) is based on how many enemies you can kill..   doens't matter if you score 20 million it's based on the amount of enemies killed  not sure who gives the bonus if there even is one... i've got 80 enemies so far and i'm in 486th place don't play often enough to score higher in events like these   i try to use my highest level spiders with a bulletproof as the main one due to the abilities of near miss and extra points from enemy kills..   my multiplier is 33 and if i have a good run i can get around 2.5-3 million average runs if at least 1 million  other then that it's just down to luck.. only use ISO to continue a run if you are sure you can get a higher score for a good prize otherwise it's just a waste   the new event didn't register my score of 4.7 million to the leader board  it knows i got 4.7 million because each time i die it says best score of 4,7 million but it never went on the leader board fucking pissed me off  all scores i get know go up but just not my best one   the event isn't registering my scores got 4.7 million but it didn't register  http://i57.tinypic.com/166zync.png  fuck this game has been really glitched recently  edit-- getting a message leaderboard data unavailable that might be why it's not showing   it designed to make you want to spend money to get it quicker. otherwise you just have to wait and get them from premium portals which all depends on luck  just score enough to get them on the daily leader board or try to get 50 iso-8 and buy the discount ones or get them in events  no way in hell i'm spending 800 ISO to rank up my 5 star bulletproof one   i was thinking about this because right now in issue 4 it's already requiring higher then level 70 to continue  the later issues will probably go higher then level 90 as they already have a 7 star in the game  hopefully they release all of them as 7 star otherwise it will be a pain in the ass to rank one from 1 to 7 star   yep changed back on andriod as well although i somehow managed to get the bronze prize yesterday and got 50 iso-8  i don't even remember making a 2.5 million run in unlimited mode but apparently i did and it was enough for 50 iso-8   android daily rewards have changed again no more premium portal  the 4th price (1000-9999) is 5 ISO-8..  sucks when it's 12 for a discount portal.. i relied on that portal as i've been a bit low on ISO lately (even though it gave me spiders i didn't need)  if i'm lucky i'll be able to get 8 or 9 ISO a day      it's hard to say what it is as the number needed would increase everyday as more people get better spidermen  the premium portal prize 1000-9999 used to only need a score of 300k now it's increasing to 450-500+  	54
 I got dumped a couple of weeks ago for the first time after 8 months with my first ever boyfriend. I had never been in a relationship with anyone before, nor had I done things with a guy so he was my first everything. I even ended up giving him my virginity because I thought I was ready. I don't regret it. But I just still have a lot of emotion towards the breakup and keep trying to tell myself I'm past it but it really hurt my self esteem. I'm a bigger guy and so it was hard finding my first relationship and took a lot of time and hard work. I'm 19 and I just can't figure out how to get past it and rebuild myself. All my confidence is gone and I don't know many other gay guys to ask. Please be nice. Thanks.      Exactly.   Those feels. They hurt.   I upvoted because you're cute   The red brick road leads to death, disease, anguish and sadness. There's also cookies and milk.   Do I see egg clusters from flies or just puss?   I don't get it. Is it wtf because its the same?   Yummy! That hair! ;)   How did it happen? This makes me so sad..   WHAT?!?   He can keep playing with those joysticks he has. I'll take the one in his shorts.   This is fucking hot   Stalin had an iconic mustache yet people still wear the style and he was worse than Hitler and killed millions more than the Nazi's did. Sadly, I admire his mustache.   I'm gay and I just got pregnant. I'm scared but I'm keeping it. Take that nature!   This is how I feel on all three dating sites I'm a member of, and in real life when I ever get any courage to try and ask anyone out.   He gets me all sorts of hot and bothered   Decomposition. You'd look like this too if we left you out somewhere to rot.   A woman who fucked up cooking?! This is an abomination!   Nothing funny about this but damn they're hot!   Did you think it meant January 1913?   I'm assuming you think that flesh colored thing right under the kangaroo is a ballsack. You're blind. It's a foot. Otherwise, what the fuck are we looking for?   I ain't saying he a gold digger...   Buddha hand. They smell fantastic.      So jealous!   Hot damn!   Totally a bag from a box of wine. I've done it at parties.   Can I marry him?   Dark Helmet from Spaceballs. Very nice. Love that movie.   Source?? Please!      LOOKS LIKE THIS FAGET IS FINALLY GETTING MY FUCKING BATH READY FOR ME   HOW ABOUT GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU CUNT NIGGER SHIT FUCKING PROLAPSING PUSS SUCKING FAGET AND DON'T FORGET YOUR CAPS LOCK BUTTON FAGET   THANKS I NEED SOMETHING TO FUCK BEFORE GOING TO CLASS   FUCKING FAGET CUNT SQUIRT NO ONE READS SHIT LIKE THIS BECAUSE ITS SO FUCKING LONG YOU WHORE SLUT CUM DUMPSTER BABY FUCKING FAGET   YES   This is really cool   THAT'S WHERE I CAME FROM FAGETS.    Well excuse me. I didn't mean to upset you. Gracious.   Does anyone else think it looks like the dog is smiling?   They're all along the bottom and in the background.    Do you really not see the maggots? They're on the reverse side.   Repost   NO CAPS LOCK GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE FAGET NO ONE LIKES TO READ THAT MUCH   THIS IS MY REGULAR FUCKING WEEKDAY NIGHT FAGET   WHERE ARE YOUR CAPS LOCKS FAGETS  I WILL STICK MY SUSHI ROLL IN THAT FAGET   There is nothing significant in this photo   I think he's trying to get into porn or he might have already done so. Anyways, he's fucking attractive now.   Ahhhh, Hispanics   I think he likes you. With his penis.   I honestly thought this was a man who had put on fake boobs.   It actually is a legitimate photo taken during a paranormal investigation of the Amityville murder house. It was taken in the 1970s.   Yeah, with no explanation your picture makes absolutely no sense. But since I now know, I can say she's stupid.   Agreed   Nice makeup. It looks good...but obviously not good enough.   Try posting a picture of your mother. Wait. That's what this is. Never mind.   Could help with sex   I'd bang   How about attention whore who probably has daddy issues   Looks like Amanda forgot to clean out her locker.   Just broke up last night. I can't wait until I no longer care.   He looks like Wall-E.   It's all a matter of food distribution.       I did too. And I'm a man.      No. Too late. It's been posted quite a bit already.   It's a repost. Trust me. I made the same mistake...   There are people with thyroid conditions which causes them to gain weight uncontrollably even though they have a healthy diet.   Apparently someone already put this up. I didn't see it on here so I thought I was the first person to post it and then learn that someone beat my by an hour. Dammit. So I have to call my own post a repost. I'm so sad..         I agree. It looks pretty good.   She didn't choose the wookie life. The wookie life chose her.   Where do people get all these photos of my family?!   Last year when I spent Halloween in College Station, I got into two car accidents with the same car and had it break down. Then proceeded to push it half a mile into a parking garage. The car was also covered in puke. The worst part about my night? I was sober.   Dammit grandma! I said later!     	79
 Here, take a look at [this good rooting q a](http://www.androidcentral.com/rooting-it-me-some-qa).   I have the defender for my X2, and it's a freaking beast. It's big and bulky, but I can't imagine anything else that could protect my phone as well. If you have genuine concerns for your phone in a work environment, this will allay them.    Yeah, there might be better rss readers out there, but the few I've tried so far all have some major limitation, and currents works fine for me. This is one of the very few categories of apps where I really haven't bothered to explore alternatives. Guess I have time to browse the market now, though...    ...you see reddit as lawful good? It's a screwed up system where quality and genuinely interesting is buried by, well, stuff like this.    Well, according to my favorites list, I use Tapatalk, Google TV Remote, and Currents the most.  But it feels like I should say ROM Toolbox, Root Explorer, and MyBackup Pro.   That's almost the only reason I always root my phones, so I can flash new and different ROMs. It's true, you can do a whole lot of customizing without root, but I've found it to be just plain fun, not to mention it *does* increase your options for apps and the such.   That being said, when I got my last phone, I waited until I was certain that if I rooted I would be able to get back to stock. If something were to happen to it, I would want to get it back to original condition for the sake of insurance.   Oh. Or that.   Well, I would assume that it's smart enough to realize that home is the location where the phone spends the night. And even if it wasn't, I would also assume that you can adjust things manually.   Yeah, it's good at what it does, but it's not going to save you much from where you're already at.  However, I've always loved the location part of JD. It used to turn on my WiFi when I pulled up to the house, and turn it off when I left. The same with other common hotspots I frequented.   Well, usually flashing a ROM will, or some adb stuff even (though you need to find out exact commands and whatnot, probably from xda). If you're trying to delete various types of data, there are usually apps in the play store that will delete different stuff on your phone.  But a factory reset simply wipes out user apps, settings, etc. It doesn't wipe the phone back to factory new. All kinds of stuff get left on it.   Well, since starting a sg costs nothing but a bit of time, someone start one up somewhere. Hell, I'll start it up if y'all want, but I know next to nothing about base building.   Well, if you're running stock and haven't flashed or rooted or anything, and you're getting random reboots, then take it to your carrier. Should be their issue to deal with (assuming you keep your insurance up).   Well, yeah, it mostly does. However you installed the app after the reset, so the reset can't have an effect on the app, see?  If you just uninstalled and reinstalled to fix it, then it was just a bad download/install the first time around.   Sooooo.... are you promoting this app that apparently the guy doesn't want you promoting?   There are literally a ton of home launchers. If you're wanting to keep the ICS feel, go with Apex, Nova, or Holo.   What sucks is that it still tops out at 20 pages, so I can't see past D.   Go to www.cerberusapp.com, log in, click "Help" at the bottom, then click the "I have a rooted device. Can I get additional features?" part.  edit: I'm glad you brought it up, I didn't realize I didn't have it enabled either. Do now. I had to go the .apk route, maybe because of dual sdcards.   Install VLC, didn't help with media sharing issues. On my Revue I can still only see what WMP sees.   Dude, nothing else worked. You got it right, thanks a million!   I'll install and try VLC, but so far I can only see files over the network that WMP can see.

(0x80040207)   This is what MatroskaDiag tells me.   Tried it. How do I find out what the actual video codec is?    After codec/pack after codec/pack (mostly from download.com) failing to play .mkv files, I finally found one [from cccp project](http://www.cccp-project.net/) that will at least let me see the files with WMP 11 (32 bit Vista), but they still won't play. They all show as having a length of 0 seconds. I know the files are fine, they play great in the KMPlayer, but I need WMP to be able to play them in order for my Revue to see them over the network. I've been Googling, installing, unistalling, etc. for 3 hours. I'm officially disgusted.   Not that I can notice.   Always hit the menu key when you're looking for something, even if it doesn't seem like it would do anything where you are.  For instance, when you're in the WiFi settings, you can hit menu again for more options. This is where I always go after a flash to keep WiFi on even when asleep.   [Doesn't look like it.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=791227)   The only issue I have with Beautiful Widgets is there's not full screen widget, otherwise I'd be all over it.  I'd use Chrome, but the X2 CM9 won't support it. :(  Podkicker looks ok.  The official Wiki keeps chopping off the right side of charts on my phones.   lol   Fast for Facebook over the Facebook app.  Chromemarks + stock browser over all other browsers.  HD Widgets over Beautiful Widgets.  MyBackup Pro over titanium Backup.  Pocket Casts over other podcast apps.  Wikidroid over the others.  TweetCaster over Twitter.  News360 is my preferred news aggregator.    Well, make sure your family members have your work phone for emergencies, and turn your phone off. Check it on breaks. People survived before cell phones, you know.   Not mine.   I am a beautiful person. (Just installed it the other day, so it's basically the default.)  And I turn that option off, I'd rather hit the words at the top than have it auto-correcting what it wants me to say.   That is a good idea, for Android and PC both.   That's what I'll do from time to time. but I never stick with the same look more than a week or two.   xda can be another good friend.   I hope you're not considering CM7. Back stepping there (well, diagonally maybe). [Look through xda](http://forum.xda-developers.com/search.php?searchid=35505095) and see what they have to say about it. Bet there are a ton of comments already.   Honestly, that would be annoying enough to me to simply abandon the widget for another from the play store. I am absolutely positive that you can find another you would find more appealing.    Actually, I would probably just split my time going through the basics of operations, through the options on the phone, and through some of the play store apps.   Doesn't mean it doesn't work. :)   Noted and fixed. You're right of course.   lol Thus the list. *With links.* :)   Well, besides word of mouth around the forums, I've had a couple Verizon techs tell me this. While it doesn't necessarily mean it's true, it makes it kinda hard to discount.   ...why would this reply get downvoted? If you don't believe me, go talk to Verizon or another anal provider.   shrug Like where? I wouldn't be against it, but I wouldn't know where to do it.   ...Jonny's used to hard ships?   I know this is an old thread, but I just wanted to be sure someone turned you onto [Paragon wiki](http://wiki.cohtitan.com/wiki/Category:Contacts). Before you accept new contacts when you have a choice, you can look them up and check out their story arcs, rewards, etc.   ...there's a sentence I never thought I'd stumble upon...   SD Speed Increase is always good thing on a fast card.   Well, it depends on the device. My little Ascend is unbrickable, but my Strat can be bricked if you're not careful. I thought I had bricked my Droid X2, but after a couple hours of trying to boot into various modes and dozens of battery pulls I got it back. The fact is you *do* need to be careful and certain of what you're doing on various devices.   Yeah, I threw it on when iammolotov mentioned it wasn't there. Big oversight on my part there.  edit: OH! Durr, I was bouncing around then so much I lost track of where I was.   I actually thought about doing something like that, but my tastes definitely go against the grain.  I can tell you GO Launcher is pretty much the king of GB, but quite a few folks love ADWLauncher EX, Launcher Pro, and Zeam, and Nova and Apex launchers rule ICS. The bulk of the rest of them are pretty much the same, with different options within each that tailor to different peoples needs. In launchers, I put a little list at the top of launchers that are really different from the rest.  With browsers, there are a lot of good ones. Opera is probably the favorite, with lots of Dolphin users. Chrome is really popular on ICS.  As far as app stores go, Play Market is the only one, outside of providers' own apps, that won't break your TOS. Amazon has a lot of followers, mostly due to the free app of the day. GetJar was getting really popular until they dropped their free Gold apps. SlideME and soc.io mall have a few followers, too.   Just remember, read, read, read first. Make sure of what you're doing. If you brick your phone (I don't know how easy yours does) you're 100% out of luck (unless you get creative with your insurance...)   Insurance? Eh, I don't know.  But to learn to root, [check out what xda has for your phone.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1603905)   Yeah, same with me. I've been using Beautiful Widgets and Recast for my clock and weather, but just switched back over yesterday to HDWidgets.   You mean WiFi, don't you? If you're not wanting to use something like Skype, you can use a VoIP app like GrooVe IP.   By the way, did you go to the Play Store and simply put in "theft"?   Well, for one it will void your Terms of Service, so you can't turn it in if there are any issues unless you flash it back to stock. But the amount of things you can do and apps you can use is greatly increased.   Myself, I use Cerberus also.   Pretty much any VoIP app will. My favorite is Groove IP because you don't need some 3rd party VoIP server.   Ok, I put in the link for SlideScreen 2.0 beta that they released openly, since they're not supporting it anymore.   Some of my must-have, un-rooted, Play Store apps are...  Beautiful Widgets  ChromeMarks  Currents  Fast for Facebook  GasBuddy  Gmail  News360  Pocket Casts  QR Droid  SoundHound  Tapatalk  Tweetcaster  Wikidroid  Wikitude  Zedge  I have a lot more that I always install, but those are some of the good-for-everyone apps I keep.    Right with you there. I really liked Claystone, and was unimpressed with TSF. Updates for both would be welcome.   wtf... lol Glancing over it I'm seeing Crome as Chrome. Nice catch, thanks. Fixed.  And I thought about putting in the rating, but once the list got large I put in the Android version required, and that took a long freaking time. So I put off the notion of adding ratings due to time and/or laziness.  	62
 and that's how tyranny happens.   But....Bush!!!   The "most transparent administration in US history".  Riiiiiiiiiight.   Obama saying something else is Bush's fault?  When will he start leading? He is one who **provided ISIS with TOW missiles**.  Also, is there any **single one thing** that Obama likes about America?  This man is not fit to lead a kindergarten teeball team.  He should be put in handcuffs and removed from office.   And Democrats want the federal govt in charge of the health system.         This is what happens when governments run schools.   "The most transparent administration in history."  Yet another lie.        United States has been heavily arming an apartheid state that has WMD.  Ahhh, to be young and naive again.    That's easy to say when terrorists aren't firing artillery into your neighborhood.   Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.  Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.     Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.     Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar?   Democrats have expanded the federal government every chance they've had.  Obama voters: You've made your bed. Now lie in it.   They are not going to release the account number of the US Treasury.   You know what I call people who rob stores?   Thugs.      Paging Al "The ice caps could be gone by 2014" Gore.      Just because you post things on the Internet doesn't make them true. Obama is on the verge of enabling a nuclear Iran.  Yes even Democrats are jumping ship on this one.  http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0MB0KF20150315?irpc=932     Please tell me how a nuclear-capable Iran is patriotic and good for America.      Health care costs started rising when the federal government got involved with Medicare.  Put the govt out of the equation and market forces will work things out.  Edit: Market equilibrium would never allow a $50 aspirin. Govt intervention  through Medicare is how this initially happened.  Why is the British national pastime queuing? The inefficiencies and bureaucracies of Socialism.   Obama is a naive idealogue..  It is fucking insane that we are negotiating to allow a nuclear capable Iran.   I read the letter and think it was a great idea.   So any criticism of her action is bigotry? It's racism?  That card is old, worn and a weak argument.      But the earth was supposed to be out of crude oil by now.  The polar bears were supposed to be gone unless we curbed energy expansion.  The ice caps were supposed to be gone by now unless we stopped using fossil fuels.   Acid rain was supposed to destroy the world unless we stopped building factories.  The hole is the ozone layer was supposed to heat the earth unless we stopped using aerosol.  Deforestation was going to destroy the rain forest unless we curtailed Western Civilization's footprint on the earth.  The sky was supposed to fall unlesss we repealed capitalism and submitted all economic control to the state.   The intolerance of the left strikes again.      Yes. How else do you think ISIS got their hands on TOW missiles they are seen using in their propaganda videos?    Standing with the muslims? Yes we can!   http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5i4tuuy1jsw    This person is celebrating attempted murder of police officers.  If you think this is cool or even acceptable you should probably move out of your mom's basement.      They won't stop until they control all facets of our lives.  Tyranny isn't coming in the front door wearing a white hood.  It is coming in the back under the guise of green living.         "The lunches are heavily subsidized by the Government"  So these lunches really aren't 60 cents. Someone is paying for them and probably at a high markup/overhead considering they are government funded.   Wake up Reddit!  Don't buy this!  Why would Obama support a nuclear Iran?  They have stated the *intention* to "wipe Israel off the map".  Israel is a free and Democratic nation unlike Iran where homosexuals are hanged.  It's unbelievable that any American supports Iran or negotiations with them.  The fact that Obama and Kerry are so passive and even supportive of Russia and Iran is indicative of ethical collapse.      But the shooters were such good boys. They DinDuNuffin.   Where do you get this reality from?  Most likely you are not a climate scientist, so you get your 'reality' about our climate from a little rectangular screen that tells you what to think,     Who makes up these codes? Who decides what speech in a private setting is not allowed?         "I'll have more flexibility after the election." Barack Hussein Obama to Russian president  Charge him with treason.   If you think government is more accountable than the private sector you're going to have a bad time.   "Hiding profits in tax havens is one of the most common ways large corporations avoid paying their fair share to the IRS."  You know what's not fair?  Working hard to get somewhere and having to provide free housing, Obama phones, food stamps, disability, education and health care to people who sit around and smoke weed all day.  Most low to medium income people don't understand this because they pay little, none or even negative tax.  Rewarding the unsuccessful and punishing the successful is an unsustainable economic proposition.   Don't you mean Russia's actions in Crimea make it very possible?   Why is the Secretary of State running a charity while in office? The potential for corruption is high with this one.      More excuses for the lies and corruption of the Democrat party.  You will make a good serf.      More nonchalance from the Democrat semen chuggers of Reddit. Your nonstop excuses for Democrat lies and corruption will be a double edged sword.   More gargling of Democrat semen by Reddit.   If a Democrat commits a crime, not a big deal.  The rule of law is not important here, just whims of the mob.   You now carry a burden so others don't have to.                     The root of the global warming movement lies in a big government, anti-capitalist ideology.  When global warming was discredited by data, they swiftly changed to climate change.  Climate change is not about the environment but, like most left of center ideas, it's about societal control and the repeal of capitalism.   I'd rather have wrong ideas than outlawed ideas.   The author is an atmospheric physicist from MIT.  It looks like you are the denier of science.  Or do you just baaaa that when it fits your agenda?

Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaida. You said Russia ... the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years," -Barack Hussein Obama  This is what happens when you put an amateur in the White House.   We can't have black people wandering off the Democrat plantation and thinking for themselves. /s         It's good to see the State Dept has time to tweet in between their arms shipments to ISIS.      The only thing wrong about this article is the number.  There are 20+ million illegals in the US. Since Obama's executive amnesty and his orders to cease deportations and even apprehensions, they are pouring in.    Third world status?  Yes we can!   They most certainly will not be deported for voting.      How about deporting people that have broken our laws and not paid a dime of income tax?   Don't you know who occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Ave?   It's the Chicago way.            The rule of law is no more.   Don't worry liberal hipsters.

 it appears you received some great info already.  i moved to KC from WI in 2004.  in 2008 i moved to FL for a new job.  i just moved back to KC in july of 2013 because i couldn't stand FL!   i'm so happy to be back in the midwest!  here are a few things i noticed having lived in both states (i lived in boca raton/fort lauderdale area):  1)  the people here are ridiculously nice.  if you make eye contact in public chances are the person will smile or say hi.   in florida i felt that if i made eye contact with a stranger that they would want to fight or run the other way.  the fake people in So.FL are the worst.  everyone is trying to one up each other.    2)  traffic.  anyone that has only lived in the greater KC area and complains about KC traffic, you haven't been to FL.  i don't miss the snowbirds or the tourists lost while looking for disney.  3)  cost of living.  when living in FL you're paying tourist prices.  i don't miss waiting for a table anytime i wanted to go out to eat.    4)  parks.  KC has some amazing parks.  what i experienced in florida was that it was so crowded that parks didn't really exist.  builders in florida would rather put a few high rises and make more money.  5)  the weather.  while people in FL are probably asking how you could leave FL for KS, the weather is very fair here.  people will tell you, if you don't like the weather in KC, just wait a day, it will change.  while living in FL i really started to miss the midwest seasons.       i ask out of curiosity, why don't you want to pay your own electricity?  i'm sure they take an average of all apartments and sneak that into the rent cost.     make sure to stain the carpet on move out day to ensure replacement.      i moved from kansas city where i loved living to south florida for a job.  inside i knew the move would be temporary.  after 5 years of living in south florida (ft lauderdale area), i couldn't take it any longer.  home of sunny beaches and shady people.  i approached my boss and CEO and asked to move back to KC and work from home.  they agreed.  i purchased my first home (29 yrs old now) in july and am happier than ever.  i have a great job doing what i want to do and get to work from home.  i would have never gotten this opportunity had i not taken the risk in the first place.   i've scratched my forehead many a times trying this maneuver.     apparently it's cold in AK.   bedazzle wiener   needs more bubble blowing and Canadian accent, eh.    the San Francisco treat!   Clay/Jax = family.  Nero/Jax = 'family'.  regardless, i can't wait for next week.   sorry, hypothetically speaking....   how would jax react if he found out nero was responsible for the killing of one of the sons old ladies?   he drives it in the snow as well, i believe.   lots of random ass grabs and nut taps.   if you want a clean kitchen eat at home!  	16
 Half-Life. I want them to just say that 3 won't be made so I can be done with it forever. The fandom is annoying, Gordon Freeman isn't really a character, so why should he be revered the way he is, and I'm tired of hearing about it literally everywhere.   That band, man...   MOTHERFUCKIN' SHIBE   So worth it.   I Hate Hartley   Saw these guys on their first American tour. They were amazing then and have only gotten better!   A fire breathing beaver!   I never got to see it, what was so bad about it?   Shaking hands....   And /r/thecheapestofamazon   Contrasumption?   We've known Teppei personally for a few years, now. He's a really cool and layer back guy!  Edit: We took him to dinner before the shows every time he came to CO since we met him.      I still do. It's the handle, man. The handle makes drinking anything better.   Most probable worst case scenario, you YLOD and need new thermal paste. You'll probably be ok!   My school had an assembly about it. I had no choice.   Wait... Then what the fuck is a berry?   It's a collection of all the TF2 comics, L4D comics, and the like for other games.   That sounds fucking awesome. Literal all-star cast.   Ah, I see you've unlocked the [Butthurt] trait. New player?   Thanks for making me realize I don't know how borrowing works... Asshole.   Aaaaaaaaand you're a bad person.   One of my favorite bands!      FUCK YOU, FERD, YOU UNFABULOUS SHIT  Edit: Why the *fuck* do I keep seeing you?!   You two will always be at odds.    Well, realistically, Tolkien never would've been able to finish it because it's just so extensive.   Dammit, I can't handle unfinished Middle-Earth, if GoT is never finished I'll go insane.   Yeah, I pretty much said "fuck that" after seeing words like vivacious, bemused, and haughtiness. I learned two of those words last year.   Everything on NoSleep is true even if it isn't.   Dude... Fuck you.   I'm afraid of the beach, oceans, and lakes for this very reason.   Tricycles. I am terrified of riding tricycles.  Edit: also, laying on my stomach with my legs hanging over an edge. I'm terrified someone is just going to walk up and break my knees by hitting/pushing my lower legs really hard.  Edit 2: OH! And moths flying into my ears.    It's gonna be Cooking Mama X Mass Effect!   I thought that was a subreddit and tried exceptionally hard to figure out how it would be relevant before clicking on it. Needless to say, I was disappointed.   /r/DIY ? It sounds like it belongs there... But I've never seen a casket on it, so I don't know.   Well there's different words for different age groups. I can't remember off the type of my head, but pedophile really only applies to a range of like 7-9 year olds or something like that.   What's one of the most fun things you've ever done and why?   I agree. Not to mention, I feel like exclamation points make me seem excited, so caps convey anger better.   I'd like some recommendations, any genre at all.  If you like it, I'll check it out.  Edit: Thanks a bunch! I'll do my best to check all of them out!   I'd like something new to read and I'm not going to say what I've already read in order to get a little more variety. So, bring it on!  Edit: Why the down votes? I'd just like a few new comics to read....  Edit 2: Thanks a lot, guys! I'll try and check all of them out!    (`) LOOK AT IT Just... FUCKING LOOK AT IT  (`)    (`)   I still hate you.... Like, a lot.    TIL that the Fire Nation is North Korea.   Be honest.... Did you search "period blood?"   Why the *fuck* did you spell the numbers?!   My current favorite has to be Our Darkest Days by Ignite.  http://youtu.be/pToEaI9TkJI - Bleeding   Please provide a link to the album or a song from it!   I saw a Prius that said "smuggg" on the plates in reference to the Southpark episode. I thought it was pretty funny.   There's nothing fabulous about you, Ferd....   THANK YOU O_O   That's my phone's shadow.      Ooh! ME!   Over yonder!   I'm a T Swift fan, myself.   With Taylor Swift? She won an award and he jumped up on stage and took the mic from her and started screaming about how Beyonce should've won. It's where the "I'mma let you finish, but..." Joke came from.   There was a duffel bag left in the school parking lot and the police were called. All this bomb threat jazz and it was later found out to be a Kermit the Frog doll that was stolen from one of the teachers earlier that year. It is now a school "holiday" where everybody wears green.   1497   I thought he literally pulled out a quarter and then it somehow broke. I was always confused what the quarter had to do with the situation at hand.   Redditors for 334 days... You check out.   Will.i.am is just awkward all around.   No one beats Liam fucking Neeson in FO3!   Well, since I'm all the way down here....   I know a lot of military and they're good people that are going through exactly what we're going through. Don't blame them.   It was the same with me. A game with no dialogue or really in depth backstory made me tear up at the end. Only game that ever made me do that.   I'd recommend you get Journey and the Unfinished Swan. They're both PS Store purchases and they're amazing.   Oh, yeah. My bad.   There's an arcade game called T.E.C. 3001. It's awesome.  Edit: Indie*   Because it's a heavily anticipated game from a prestigious studio.   Well, by your logic, you got your ignorance from your father and you're completely ignorant of the fact.   YOU'RE AN AWFUL THREAD   As much as I dislike GameStop's way of business, I'd hate to see them go. They have some good stuff and the employees their are some of the best conversations I've had about the video game industry and really nice guys.   Completely absurd, my good man.   May I partake?   YOU SHIT-EATING, CRUSTY, JAGGED PIECE OF WALRUS ANUS   Not exactly what I was looking for, but I still like it! Thanks!   Like one that shows off really cool or creative cars, motorcycles, ect.   I also think the PS3's Netflix layout is a lot better. The Xbox' is just annoying to use.   I saw the thumbnail and didn't read the title... I thought it was an Anchorman 2 picture. I'll just say I was disappointed.   In quite a butthurt fashion, might I say.   The butthurt is strong in this one.   Ah, I believe you meant to say empanada, my good man.   I keep getting Serious Sam and Duke Nukem 3D coupons.   What's with Guy Fawkes masks and these pictures?   I... I take 45 minute bathroom breaks. No one believes that I just don't care enough to get up sometimes.   BUT SHE'S ALREADY SAT HERSELF DOWN SO GINGERLY!   You need 4 leg holes for 2 penises?   Um... Thanks?   Um... Thanks?   "*Yes.*"  	91

 http://www.afa-online.org/WarpedTourVolunteerApplication/   Bring a lot of [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) and Clif bars.   :D   Does it happen more frequently with vegans than non-vegans? In the unfortunate cases where it does happen is it actually attributable to the diet being vegan or is it due to some other factor?  Those are questions that the organizations I cited look into before publishing their statements. I'm willing to bet that whatever sensationalist news story you read did not look into those questions.

I expect Action For Animals to have the tour schedule worked out within the next 2-3 weeks, so they will let you know by then.   We had someone bail while I was on tour in 2013 and it messed things up for us quite a bit.   Can you let me know what shows you might be able to do? I'll check once a schedule has been put together and see if we are still shorthanded for any of those shows.   Send a follow up e-mail to your original e-mail letting Action For Animals know that you are interested now. They are trying to work out a schedule for all the shows and that would be good for them to know as they are planning.   No. Action For Animals has wristbands that will get volunteers into the shows. When you get to the show you will give one of the volunteers who is travelling with the Tour a call and we will come out and find you to let you in.

Congrats, that's an awesome position!   [Unfortunately, the district attorney has already decided not to press any charges](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/no-charges-for-colorado-farmworkers-videotaped-hitting-pigs/).  If what was revealed in this video wasn't criminal then the laws need to be fixed.   [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to include less meat in their diets.  Reddit also has awesome communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/vegrecipes, and /r/veganrecipes!   If companies can get away with treating animals terribly and allowing their workers to outright abuse animals while still selling their product and making a profit then they will continue to do so. Corporations care about what consumers are buying.   But instead of doing that, factory farmers are pushing for [ag-gag laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag-gag) all across the country so they can continue to treat animals terribly while not having to worry about their terrible treatment of animals being exposed to the public.   Reddit was also outraged when some tourists lit a quokka on fire in New Zealand, but then we got even more outraged when commenters asked why we were outraged about the quokka while remaining apathetic about all the other animals that are commonly treated poorly.   lol, I would have taken it as a joke, but unfortunately far too many people say those things seriously.   I certainly appreciated meat. I ate a lot of meat growing up and enjoyed the taste as much as anyone.  Unfortunately, just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is ethical. For example, humans have waged war for millennia. We even see tribal clashes between different groups of great apes. Could anything be more natural? Yet I think we can both recognize that despite being natural we both would condemn unnecessary warfare.  To determine if something is ethical we must look at both the benefits (such as my enjoyment of meat), and the negatives (the harm caused to other animals). As much as I enjoyed the taste of meat, there was little doubt that the harm caused to other animals outweighed these benefits in almost all cases. (One exception might be a food like oysters. While they are technically animals they possess a very minimal nervous system.)   Also, /u/YawnY86's long comment said nothing about what is best for the cows. It was simply how their farm maximizes profit at auction. It is incredibly telling how many people in the industry lose the ability to differentiate between what cows might appreciate and what maximizes a farmer's profits.   If meat could be produced without any harm to animals I would have no ethical objections to consuming it and would likely eat it on occasion.   [Like this](http://store.afa-online.org/product.php?productid=17410 cat=0 page=1)?  Action For Animals has a couple other colors as well if you look through their store. All the money you spend there goes to supporting Action For Animals' activism!   Vegans are actually largely supporting and even funding the push for synthetic meat. [Here is an essay from Ingrid Newkirk](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0) (president of PETA. ^I ^know ^they ^suck ) about how she is excited to eat meat for the first time in 40 years once it can be synthesized.  As much as reddit likes to circlejerk about vegans needing to feel special that really isn't why people choose to be vegan.  [Here is a quote from the animal rights group Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/advocacy/path.html):  We want a vegan world, not a vegan club.   You should share your tofu recipe in the /r/vegan thread for simple vegan recipes.   Hey, it's that woman who abuses her chickens by letting them eat their own eggs!    Recipe for /u/test_subject7471's steamed vegetables:  1. Purchase cook-in-bag frozen vegetables. 2. Insert in microwave for amount of time indicated on bag.    I read the comment /u/PumpkinMomma is referring to. I would have found that pretty insulting.    Did you look at the other comments about what a great prank this is? People clearly understand that this is a prank and not the most effective way to advocate for animal rights.  We can enjoy humor on this subreddit too.   We had a thread from an omni a couple weeks ago saying what a friendly and welcoming community they thought /r/vegan is. I have to say that I have found this community to live up to that reputation as well, and the only hatemongering I see is in posts that try to condemn us all with a single brush.  I do find your second paragraph to be quite telling however. Eating animal products is not merely a personal choice as it does not simply impact oneself. It causes harm to the animals being slaughtered and consumed as well. Vegans view this treatment of animals as being unethical. If you view every comment on the vegan subreddit that says "using animals in this way is wrong" as being hatemongering then it is hardly a surprise that you reach the conclusion that this subreddit is hateful.    It is produced by bacteria. It is vegan.   I want my own brussel-sprout-hatred ever after story.   I ate a vegetable once and I almost puked. How can vegans compare this to REAL foods like chicken nuggets?

Finally, I guarantee that you know some of [these famous vegans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegans) who look quite healthy.   There isn't going to be any product on the market that tastes exactly identical to meat, but there certainly are products that are indistinguishable in certain settings. I have seen taste tests with vegan sausages and vegan ground meat where people were fed these alternatives and conventional meats and they were unable to identify which was which.  People's perception of these products also plays a strong role in how they will claim the products taste. I have seen research on protein bars where they fed people the bar with a wrapper that either said, "contains 9 grams of protein" or "contains 9 grams of soy protein". Despite the bars being identical, the people who received the "soy protein" wrapper rated the product as tasting much worse, but they perceived it as being healthier.   There isn't anything on the market today that will replicate a 12 oz  chunk of steak, but there are indistinguishable alternatives for many of the settings in which people eat meat today, as long as you go into it without prejudiced expectations based upon knowing the product is vegan. In addition to this for the meats that are not yet being replicated, many of the vegan alternatives on the market are still delicious in their own right and can be a new food that many people would enjoy having added into their diet.  Finally, tastes vary from person to person, so the only way to really discover which foods you like best are to try them out for yourself.   [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to add more plant-based foods to their diet.   [My favorite picture from that site](https://nakedvegancooking.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cranachan.jpg)   You're not at the top of the food chain. An animal that exclusively eats other carnivorous animals, would be at the top of the food chain. That said, the food chain isn't something that tells us how we ought to behave either, it is merely a description of the current state of nature (you cannot derive an ought from an is).   Clearly you don't need to worry about becoming prey for another animal just because you have chosen to eat more plant-based foods. Your position in that sense is safe.   [The actor in that scene went vegan after filming the movie](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2015/01-02/unprejudiced-heart-interview-with-babe-actor-james-cromwell.html):  It also inspired me to become vegan. After having worked all morning with these extraordinary animals, I'd see their relatives on the lunch table. They had ham and duck, every animal except horse. That's when I said, "I've got to try to be a vegan." And for the most part, I have been vegan since 1994.   Choosing to become vegetarian or vegan isn't going to solve all of the world's problems or even all of the problems with how animals are treated today, but it is something simple that each and every one of us can do that will make a world of difference for those animals who will be spared a life of unimaginable misery thanks to our choices. Reddit has excellent communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/VegRecipes, and /r/veganrecipes for anyone who is interested in adding more plant-based foods into their diet. I'm thrilled to see redditors caring more and more about how our choices in what we eat impact other animals.   If demand declines cows won't be starved. As demand declines fewer cows will be bred to meet the lower demand.   While I am not pictured in the photograph, I am comfortable with you thinking that I am any of the four individuals in this image.   Well there is a difference in that sea world keeps tens of animals in captivity, while tens of billions of animals are kept on factory farms (and then slaughtered). I would say that is a difference of roughly a factor of a billion.

I agree. Bullfighting is still incredibly cruel, but too many people glaze over the fact that the way animals are treated on today's farms is even worse.   I'm sure there will be a post soon about how vegans need to stop hatefully shoving our views about cutting on the bias down the throats of lacto-ovo vegetarians (since obviously /r/vegetarian is only for lacto-ovos). Then we will have to keep all posts that mention cutting on the bias on /r/vegan too.   [You wanna fight? I'll take you down so hard!](http://i.imgur.com/kHRKOcu.gifv)   What about their sensitive vegetarian feelings when they see how much better we look than they do?   I was really reluctant to become vegan even after I found out more about how terribly animals are treated for dairy and egg production (and slaughtered all the same). I tried signing up on the Vegan Freak forums though since I really liked their podcast, but I told them that going vegan was too hard for me. They were a bunch of meanies and told me that my excuses sucked and that their forums were a safe place for vegans only.  I decided to give veganism a shot since I wanted to be a part of the forums, and 7 years later I couldn't be more happy that I did!   Are you saying we need to start posting more nudes to /r/vegetarian? I suppose I could help out.   I usually recommend [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) to omnis who might be interested in adopting a diet with fewer animal products. It is run by Mercy For Animals and everything they promote is entirely vegan.   Don't worry, on /r/vegan we have lots of talk about our awesome vegan poops.   I'm not sure if your comment is sarcastic or not. Clearly there are still issues with things like factory farming that nobody should support whether they are omni, lacto-ovo, or vegan.   Woah, if you are trying to disagree with something that a lacto-ovo vegetarian says you can only do that over at /r/vegan!   I'm not sure how I feel about getting multiplied by carnistscum.   Seriously, if she wants to not eat dairy and eggs that is her personal choice, but it is my right to consume these products that don't harm anyone. It's not like anyone is going to cry if I choose to drink milk, and it's not like anyone gets ground up alive so that I can eat eggs.   If you vegans want to disagree with me on that point then you can only say that over at /r/vegan where nobody here will have to listen to you.   Oh come on, I have contributed enough to this subreddit to earn my place on the list of people you don't like.   Why don't you do your thing over at /r/meatfreediet? If people want to only hear about what you like then they'll join you over there.  /r/vegetarian is a place for discussing all types of vegetarian diets and that includes vegan ones.   You keep acting like vegans aren't also vegetarians. The purpose of /r/vegetarian is to promote vegetarian lifestyles and that includes vegan ones.   People need to be careful about what they say or they could make someone cry like a baby calf that has been separated from his mother.    The purpose of /r/vegetarian is whatever vegetarians are interested in. That is a wide variety of topics, some of which also includes harm caused to animals by production of some vegetarian foods. If something is upvoted that tends to be a pretty good sign that vegetarians find it relevant to the subreddit. We don't need additional censorship from the mods.   But I have to be careful to only consider the feelings of the people on /r/literallyhitler, and not the ~~jews~~ chickens that are being gassed, right?   You aren't the one suffering. The animals are the ones being oppressed. Vegans aren't oppressing vegetarians by discussing issues pertaining to the treatment of other animals on this subreddit.   People who care about how animals are treated, which I would argue is the majority of this subreddit, want to see discussions on the topic, even if it goes beyond simply how eating the flesh of animals is bad for animals.   It was my thread that they are accusing of vegetarian-shaming!   60% of my redditing is done from my throne of moral superiority.   I happen to be reading Nick Cooney's new book on the subject right now.   [How To Be Great At Doing Good by Nick Cooney on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Great-Doing-Good-ebook/dp/B00SZ6378S/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr= qid=)   One cruel step in an incredibly cruel system.

If you buy steak or any other product from 5,000 miles away they aren't putting that one steak in a car and having someone drive it 5,000 miles. They are loading 10,000 lbs of product onto a truck/airplane and shipping all of that. If you bought 1lb of steak your portion of that is equivalent to roughly half a mile of transport. If you drove an extra 5 miles to find a place that sells locally sourced meat that is going to be roughly 10 times as harmful as buying the meat from across the country if you as an individual drive a shorter distance to pick it up.  Then again, none of this actually looks at how the animals are treated.  The places where lots of people live aren't able to produce lots of products that rely upon vast open land area to be produced. To meet a city's increasing demand for local products it is only possible if it becomes increasingly intensive and increasingly confined.   [Here are pictures of cage-free, free-range, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). They are also all local to somewhere.   Yeah dawg   If I've learned one thing about nutrition from vegans it is eat a lot of just one thing. Too much variety is never healthy in your diet.   They're all sleeping right now. Probably dreaming about eating vegan fish and chips.   Why would things only matter if they exist indefinitely? If it doesn't matter that you have had a positive impact for 100 years or 100 million years into the future, why would longer or indefinite periods of time make your impact matter?   I'm not impossible. I'm right here.   Did Dave talk to you a bunch about getting snipped while you were on tour with him?   The same thing that happened to all the people who were working in VCR factories, retailers, and repair shops when people stopped buying VCRs. They will find new jobs. Most likely ones that utilize similar skill sets.   Check out [VeganBodyBuilding.com](http://veganbodybuilding.com/)   Won the lottery and one step closer to getting your shiny vegan badge!   Plant foods are great sources of B-vitamins with the exception of vitamin B12.  Vitamin B12 isn't costly to get anywhere. It is produced by bacteria, and can only be reliably obtained from animal based foods, fortified foods, or a supplement.   A multivitamin costs less than $0.10 per day. Tons of foods like cereals and soy milks are fortified as well.   You haven't made a case for why either one of those things is okay. Killing animals for either of those reasons probably is not acceptable.   I have heard that vegan foods are so low in nutrients that vegans need to eat a mountain of food every day just to be able to survive.   The real key is the fiber. Studies have found that 99% of omnis suffer from pernicious fiber deficiency, and this can lead to digestive duress, bad stories for their poop blogs, and even death. This looks like a healthy (and delicious) high fiber meal.   /u/BlizeH. I also got an additional 1 quid (also from BlizeH) since I made the above comment.

That /u/infinity guy is really popular. I wish I got as many username mentions as he does.  (My username starts with a lowercase L)   Oh no! I don't want to kill anything!  :P   There are a couple people who keep accusing my gifs of being a secret vegan plot to control reddit (or something like that).   I'm not trying to be secretive about what I'm doing. I'm vegan and I'm thrilled when more people choose to cut back on animal products, especially when it is because of one of my posts. All I'm doing though is sharing content that I appreciate and that I think other redditors will appreciate too. There's nothing secretive or sinister about that.   Yeah, I do a good amount of leafleting and tabling. I donate to Animal Charity Evaluators' recommended charities. I started an animal rights club back in college. I have toured as a volunteer with Action For Animals at the Warped Tour for the past couple years and I'm planning to do it for a little over a week again this summer.  That sounds like a lot, but I really still am a normal guy most of the time. I could/should be doing much more.   I wonder how /u/infinity feels about getting all these username mentions.   Really?  In the "What is philosophy?" guidelines to posting it mentions, "Value Theory, which includes ethics/moral philosophy, political philosophy, aesthetics, and similar areas."  I can't see how this would not fall under that umbrella.   Record it on video and upload it to YouTube so that we can show even more omnis!

Maccas  Found the Australian!   I know that they raised a lot of money that they put toward improving their ability to distribute Soylent efficiently. I'm not sure if they have fixed all of the issues with the long wait times to distribute product yet, but I expect it to either be resolved by now or it will be soon.   It is difficult to really show if someone else feels pain. Fish respond to painkillers in ways that seem to suggest that pain is being relieved. [Here is a site which refers to some good studies about that](http://www.fishpain.com/fish-and-pain-analgesic.htm).  Also, this doesn't specifically deal with pain, but [Wikipedia has a good article on Fish Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_intelligence).   You should be upset. What they are doing is absolutely not okay. I'm sure their condesention and dismissive attitude is beyond frustrating as well. Don't try to get rid of that passion that you feel.  Keep in mind though that you aren't the one suffering. When reacting to your parents or anyone else think of what will be best for helping the animals, not what will feel most satisfying for you. Sometimes that might mean showing your frustration or telling someone off, but more often that means remaining cool and rational, acting like you understand where people are coming from, and presenting the animals' case in the most levelheaded way you can.   This is a case that will go down in history. When the future looks back at the abysmal treatment of most animals today they will point to this case as setting important precedent for securing non-human animals better protection under the law.   Thank you.   First of all I want to thank my mom and dad for always being there for me. Gotta thank the big man upstairs. And of course all those fans out there who upvoted me. I couldn't have done it without you guys.   Pig farmer Bob Comis who holds himself to the highest standards of animal welfare writes, "I cannot think of one sound ethical argument in favor of slaughtering animals for their meat." After years getting to know the personalities of the animals he raises, he questions whether it is right for him to go on in the industry.   If I had to compare the taste to something I would say it tastes something like pancake batter, but I think it is more enjoyable than drinking straight pancake batter would be. It definitely works for keeping me full and keeping my energy levels up.   I have given up on dating omnis. We don't share enough in common and it is much too emotionally draining to see someone you care about regularly acting in ways that you find to be unethical. I am content with being single until I can find a worthwhile vegan girlfriend.   There are tons of cosmetics available that aren't tested on animals and do not contain animal products. That said, what someone's mom does should have no impact on that person's ability to speak up about what is right and wrong.   I remember hearing something from them about raising a lot of capital to improve their ability to distribute their product more efficiently (it took almost 4 months for me to receive my order). I wouldn't be surprised to see them making international shipping available soon.   I can't wait to hear why people shouldn't be able to protest animal abuse if their moms wear makeup...   I have been using it for the past month or so. The taste is unobjectionable and it is incredibly convenient. I don't use it at normal meals, but if I don't feel like making anything or if I'm putting off a trip to the supermarket it is great to have around. I'm sure it would be great to take along while backpacking or travelling too.   They don't do any of those things.   They do not.   Have you considered just getting some [soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) to bring with you to places where you may not have many food options?   This gives me an idea of something to try. Sharing videos with people that have vegan videos in the related videos or as the "Up Next" video in the sidebar.

You seem to have used definition 2 as if it was the only definition.

Have you tried doing the math on this? Vegan Outreach has distributed roughly 20,000,000 booklets. If we assume that 1% of people who receive a booklet go vegetarian that would be 200,000 vegetarians. Far fewer than the total number of vegetarians in the United States.   [I found this on Amazon](http://smile.amazon.com/Forum-Deluxe-Plush-Mascot-Costume/dp/B001YJRAYA/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8 qid=1429329719 sr=8-10 keywords=cow+costume)   You are awesome.   Relative to the RDA, oats are higher in protein than carbs or fat.   I would still try to make choices that cause as little pain as possible.   Right now you are benefiting from eating countless fortified foods. Iodine deficiency has plummeted since the advent of iodized salt. You eat enriched flour and breakfast cereals fortified with dozens of vitamins and minerals. You can't recreate these things without relying on the store.  Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.  [Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.  Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.    Those are factual statements. I'm not following how you get from there to how we ought to behave.  I can say. "Humans have waged war for millennia. Violence is natural." However, I still condemn unnecessary violence. Wouldn't you?   I happen to think I am more capable of making informed ethical decisions, but if you think other animals are smarter than you are then I can see why you would look to them to guide your ethics.   So is it because something has happened for a long time that you think makes it okay, or are you trying to suggest that humans have evolved eating meat therefore it cannot be healthy to not eat meat? Could you flesh out this position a bit more?   Vegan Outreach shared it on Facebook.   I see that there is another party called "Shooters and Fishers" that won two seats. [This appears to be a political party centered around protecting people's "right" to hunt and fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooters_and_Fishers_Party).    *sigh*   I want my beliefs to be able to stand up to all accurate information. If there is information that would challenge my beliefs then it is my beliefs that should change, not the information that should be silenced.   If you lived in a violent and bloody society you wouldn't just be the one committing the violence. You would also live in fear of or perhaps be the victim of violence against yourself.  This isn't just hypothetical either. Humans have waged war and participated in tribal violence for millennia. We even see other great apes occasionally engaging in territorial skirmishes with neighboring groups. What could possibly be more natural?   Yet when you look at a terrible and bloody war taking place right now you would never simply say, "oh, it is just natural so that makes it okay." None of us really believe that nature should be the arbiter of our ethics.  	192
 HA! I completly forgot about Warkick. But I meant, if the Yogs themselves were Robot Master-esque bosses   Hey Yognauts! If the Yogscast were to be in a Mega-Man styled game, what would each of their stages, enemies and boss abilities be?   Ugh, that's fluxed up!   Don't make jokes about your child's hobbies, or say that being an artist is hard. Chances are, your child knows this and is already looking for ways to make his or her chosen profession work. As a young writer, I am so blessed to have parents who care and support my line of work. Parents of reddit, do the same.   You have no power here   Sorry, not finished yet!    The pain was dull when a massive shard of diamond erupted from my sternum in a shower of gore. I collapsed to the hard metal floor of the lab, my beekeeper style helmet cracking. I saw the woman who killed me, Blood Diamond, saunter through the hail of laser fire from my co-workers; her glittering skin reflecting the blasts. She made a fist and stuck it out, firing a voly of cystaline shards into the crowd. I gritted my teeth as I watched my friends become bloody hamburger in a matter of seconds. Then the sky darkened. Clouds began to swirld   Dang. Now I wish we could make a Yogscast mythology themed RPG   You Sir, are bloody brilliant!   Dang dude, nice! I love how Hatfilms are just three harpies. I have an image of them sitting on a rock and throwing shit at sailors. I wish someone would draw a picture of the 'Demi-Yogs' on a ship like the Argonauts.    No, just for fun! :)   Hey Yognauts, fun question for everyone! If the Yogscast were demigods, who would their godly parents be? And don't just choose from Greek or Roman!   In one series I'm working on, humans can transform into one animal by using medallions given to them at birth. It's an instant process, and is considered a normal thing to do. Children will often change into their animal forms while playing. Adults who work in places like shipyards or train stations will use they're animal forms to get around easier.   That's not the case. The dragons aren't quite like the ones in Eragon. They're intelligent, but not on a human level. More like a dog or a elephant.    I don't quite like the whole idea of BitbybitBooks.com. However, I'll look into getting the story published by an actual company a year or two, depending on when I finish my first project, unrelated to this one.    Yeah, I tend to do that. Ezekiel will be a pretty deep character, and not just because of his personal tragedy. Also, I haven't mentioned the other characters, but expect diversity amongst the cast. LGBT characters will be represented fairly as well.     Thanks man! I don't quite have a title for it so far, it's still in conceptualization stages. If you have any ideas, be sure to message them to me!   Oh belive me, I'm doing research into the theoretical biology of dragons. The fire breath will be explained to a degree (get it?), and I'll try and work in the whole flight issue.   Alrighty then! I'll be sure to inform you of any updates!   Hey, thanks for the information! However, I am taking liberties with history for narrative proposes and 'rule of fun'. And also, never say to a writer "The only real way your story would work,". That's a bit insulting.   I just wondered what people would think about the idea of an alternative western where dragons existed. Wasn't sure if it was done before, and just wanted to gage people's reactions before I work on it.    Oh,thanks. I guess.    Hey reddit users, I was walking home from school today and I just got an idea for a novel, I want to throw it out there and see what everyone's reaction is.  So, it's set in Old West America, around the 18 hundreds. Dragons are real and are commonly used for various reasons. The larger ones,(the size of elephants) are used as pack animals for settlers. The medium sized ones (about the size of a cow or horse) are used for transport and mail carrying. And then there are small dragons, around the size of a lap dog or cat, are used for companionship.   Magic is used in place of electricity and is only just being used for utility proposes around the time of the story. Artifacts holding mystical properties are rare and are valued to the point of small turf wars breaking out for one, no matter what it can do. People can also be born with magic abilities, but they're essentially like Mutants, hated and feared.   Slavery was abolished a century before normal and as a result interracial marriage is becoming popular, despite the previous generation being against the practice. However, the civil war has broken out over a two piece powerful artifact found on the North and South border. Since both sides want the whole artifact for themselves, war broke out.   In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a young man named Ezekiel. He was the son of a Native American woman and a African American man, but was orphaned due to an outbreak of a mystery illness that almost killed him. Now, at 19, Ezekiel and a few other orphans from his hometown join the Pony Express. Aside from delivering letters, Ezekiel wants to find out more about the mystery illness that killed his family. He gets his opportunity when his dragon becomes sick and he's forced to stay in a small western town called Griffin Gulch.      "Psi-tron." I growled, clenching my fists. The caucasian bald man looked up from his coffee and I-Pad and smiled.   "So my boy, you're here to kill me?" he asked, gesturing to the chair across the table. "Have a seat, I'd rather be inconspicuous in this cafe. Call me Cecil." I sat down and glared at him.   He smiled and pressed his left index finger to his temple. A sugar packet levitated out of the condiment holder and hovered over his mug before being dropped in. He smiled at me again.   "You know, my life has been a good one. I've worked with the Authority Patrol for years, facing countless threats to humanity. But then, your generation came along. The results of that damn shot given out at birth." I blinked.  "What shot?" I asked. Cecil chuckled and shook his head.   "Oh, the government kept that secret from you, did they? They didn't tell you about Project Metahuman? The plot to make an entire generation of superhumans using vaccines and mutagentics over the course of thirty years?" He shook his head again. "Son, you've got to learn to investigate things better." He reached into his pocket and drew out a flash drive marked with a strip of red masking tape. He slid it across the table towards me and looked into my eyes.   "Agent 8, use this knowledge and share it with those you trust. The Authority is not to be trusted." He closed his eyes. "Now do what you came here to do."   I reached for my pistol and was about to fire it under the table when I saw Cecil reach into his pocket and pull out a tiny white tablet with a red line on it. An explosive pill. I screamed "Get down!" at the cafe's patrons, before tackling Cecil to the ground. But it was too late. As I lay on top of the psychic, an orange and red blossom of flame rushed out of his chest and hit me so hard, I blacked out.   __________________________  I awoke in the rubble of the cafe. I looked down at my hands and legs. They were pink and raw, but that was good. A sign that my healing factor was working normally. Then I winced as I saw a foot long piece of rebar embedded in my sternum. I made a silent thank you to God that my meta-human power also deadened pain while I healed. I heard voices calling my name.  "Quinten?!" A woman called. I managed to cry out weakly, "hear!" A  fit asian woman in her mid fifties lifted the debris off of me and smiled. Lana was like my second mom. She'd been my superior officer while I trained for The Authority and seeing her so soon after my regeneration was great.   "Hey rookie." she said, using her customary nickname for me. "How you holding up?" I felt the flash drive in my pocket and grinned.   "Never been better."                       It's from Torchwood. The episode as a whole was sub par, but this scene was the best.      Or any 'lame superpower' could be dangerous.    I could hear the mongrels outside my apartment door. One scratched at the door and hissed like a cat before scampering off. I smirked to myself and began pouring myself some cereal. I knew plaid was their weakness. That's how I'd managed to keep my apartment untouchable for these past few weeks. I was glad I'd done all my shopping for the month four days ago, because that's when it started. It was madness in streets of Flower Mound Texas. I locked my door and huddled in the corner as my male friends and neighbors were bombarded and pelted with rainbow stickers, glitter and false eye lashes.  The women weren't exempt. It was all jean jackets and hard beer for them. Alice, the girl I fancied from down the hall, was turned.  We were talking over the phone when she was attacked by her cat. I still hear her screams of 'No, Mr. Whiskers, put mommy's makeup and fashionable tight's down! I know they match, and are super cute but-'. She dropped the phone, but I can still hear her screams as Mr.Whiskers, a gay Russian Blue cat, turned her.  I hear her when she comes down the hall for a 'Pride Rally.' Radio and Television stations are all run by them now, airing nothing but 'What not to Wear' and musical numbers. I don't know what else is going on in the world, but I pray that someone can help save us from this rainbow menace.  My door suddenly splitters open as a man sized rainbow colored salt shaker shaped machine rolls through the doorway. I gasp in recognition. It's a old Dalek prop belonging to one of my neighbors, Terry, was a huge Doctor Who fanboy. Now it was decked out in sequines and a pink feather boa. On it's gun arm hung the swatch of plaid that I'd hung on my door. It lowered the gun and advanced forward.  "Rainbows Reign!" it shouted with the typical cadence of a Dalek. "You will be made fabulous!"    Like Parasite?   Yeah man, I love the show. Mike actually controls condiments, not just dairy products. Although he could control ANY condiment, so creamer could count.    "Dr. Awesome." I growled, clenching my fist. The good Doctor stood before me, his cape billowing in the Skiyline City breeze.  "You're reign of terror ends now!" he shouted, his eyes glowing yellow, preparing a blast of heat vision. He never got the chance.   I sensed he'd eaten a burger an hour ago. A burger with extra mustard, mayo and ketchup, perfectly churning in that all American stomach of his. I focused on the condiments, imagining them coating and expanding the lining of the stomach. Dr. Awesome gasped and stumbled backwards away from me.  "What are you doing?" he gasped, as I began to make the mustard snake it's way into his lungs.  "Remember that supervillian couple you killed nineteen years ago?" I asked, forcing the mayo to enter his throat. He hacked and coughed, spit out a wad of mustard.   "N-no." he gasped. I scowled. Of course he didn't. Superheroes don't care about anyone who get in the way of their 'war on crime'.   "I'm their kid, Mike Richards. Forced into the foster care system, hated because I was born with powers I never asked for. And you know what I'm going to do?" I turned and forced the rest of the mustard and ketchup into Dr. Awesome's airway, clogging it.   The normally invulnerable superhero was now on his knees, gasping and shuddering as his lungs were deprived of oxygen. I knelt down to his eye level and grinned.  "I'm going to make you a vegetable." I imagined all the mayonnaise piercing his cerbrebellum and frontal lobe and watched as the Doctor's body suddenly went limp and fell face first into the pavement, a mix of mustard and ketchup dribbling out of his mouth. Revenge has never been spicier.    The summoning circle was complete. I held the obsidian knife to my hand and swallowed hard before slashing it open. My blood welled up in my hand and began to drip into the curves and symbols of the circle. I hoped I got it right, the website's Jpeg file wasn't very good, but I'd managed to get a basic circle right, so I trusted it. After a few minutes of blood letting, I brought out the lighter and lit the red candles surrounding the circle before closing my eyes and began to chant the magic words.  "Etrian, wotanos, eteronso!" I chanted, the words spilling out of me. The air in the center of the circle exploded outwards, extinguishing the flames and forcing me to close my eyes. I smelled brimstone and popped on eye open. A tall crimson skinned man in a dark suit with crimson tie stood in the center of the circle, busily tapping away on his I-Pad.  He looked up and scowled when he saw me.  "Dang it, what do YOU want?!" he groaned in a baritone voice that would put a voice actor to shame. "Let me guess, world domination?" For the first couple seconds I couldn't speak. My spell worked! I was a genuine warlock, or wizard, or whatever the terminology was!  My hands shaking, I reached into my backpack and drew out a paper and handed it towards the Devil.  "I- I summoned you from The Pit for this." I said, trying to sound humble. The Devil took the paper from me and looked it over, a look of scorn and pity passing over his face. He looked down at me and shook his head.  "No. I'm not doing your English paper for you." he said, matter-of-factly. I frowned.  "Come on, the class is in ten minutes!" I pleaded. The Devil shook his head.  "Look, kid, your a powerful warlock. But in the time you spent looking up down to summon me, you could've been working on that paper." His expression softened and he reached into his pocket, drawing out a small plastic keychain of a red cow. I took it and looked at him.  "Um, thanks?" I said, confused. The Devil's stoic expression softened and he smiled.  "It's for the future." he said. "And it'll kill that teacher of yours, if you want. Consider it payment for this little trip. But keep practicing kiddo. And know that one day, when you least expect it, I will get your soul." And with that The Devil exploded in a cloud of red sulfurus dust, leaving me with a bunch of snuffed out candles and a empty circle.   What if the Yogscast are actually out of sync with time and space? Like, Zoey, Fiona, Duncan, Lewis and Simon are actually split between various dimensions and points in time, like Clara in Doctor Who. Yoglabs is a fixed point, it's where everything first happened, and thus, things will happen, regardless of current events. Deep Space Mine isn't in space at all, it's in a 'rip' in reailty caused by the explosion. That 'rip', is actually where Lewis gets his powers of 'Creative mode' from. Notice, he was able to save Simon and Duncan from certain doom, while HE survived and lived on the station somehow. Lewis is somehow either aware that he and others are scattered across space and time, or it's not the Lewis we know. For all we know, Deep Space Mine Lewis might be on his way to becoming Israpel.   	33
    I actually just checked the map and there doesn't seem to be anyone in my area on that map either! The closest to NS is Quebec! :o   ohhhhh awesome!    No, I'm located in Halifax, NS, Canada!! I definitely can't afford to travel that far!    I'm having no luck finding a person or salon in my area that would install syn dreads and I just ordered a set. Eeeeek. Not sure if it's okay to post this type of thing but I need help and no one I know has dreads...   thanks!   Thanks! I'm drawing every spare moment I have!! haha.(Although that isn't much as I have had a summer job and I'm in an intensive IT program) I'm focusing on dot work designs lately. I find they turn out the best. I've been trying to focus on tattoo-able designs.  I actually did have an artist in mind and got a side tattoo from him but he's never taken on an apprentice...I'm thinking once I'm back to the city I'll go in and talk to someone from the same shop.  Thanks again for the advice!   I'm working on a portfolio to take in and I have a shop in mind but I know nothing about how I should go about it besides that...I'm also very nervous about taking in my portfolio. I feel as though it could never be good enough as I have no actual experience tattooing and I haven't had any training besides advanced high school courses. I really need to also mention that my art isn't "photo realistic" I have a graphical/2D kind of style to my work. Any advice would be very appreciated!    thanks! :)   I'm looking at starting to use baking soda and ACV instead of shampoo and conditioner...Any really good recipes out there? That are more than the basic mix? Like something with tea tree oil etc. I'd really appreciate any advice I can get on this.    sweet, thanks!   I'm in Canada so that sucks! haha. and nice!    Hmmm, is that in US dollars or CND?    That's true, thank you. I was thinking fruits and vegetables, as well as oatmeal without sweet flavoring added would be good places to start. I'm hoping to keep my diet as low carb as possible. And I'm pretty small/female. So my MAX calorie intake is about 1400.    But I honestly can't stick to it right now. I just can't sit down, figure out my macros and then plan my grocery shopping and meals off of that. I'm not good at meal prep. That's the main problem I'm having so I'm trying to find foods that are easily prepared. I'm also looking into nutrition bars. But, quest bars are out of my price range at  $40 per 12. so...I'm hoping there's a better alternative. I really appreciate any tips or advice I'm given. I'm still very new to trying to lead a healthy active lifestyle.    okay, thanks!    Hmmm, its starting to sound like it's worth just waiting til my hair grows out! Do you know if the dreads were successful at 6-8 inches? Like did they end up keeping them and having them look good?   my hair doesn't even curl on its own. Even when I don't comb it, no joke. It's crazy straight and fine.     thank you for the input! I'm still thinking I'll grow my hair out and try to get natural ones in the future. My hair is way too short for that right now though unfortunately. Parts of my hair are only 3 inches. For some reason shaving it seemed like a good idea.    I love the look of dreadlocks, I've been trying to grow my hair out to get them forever now. I haven't managed to do it but I'm thinking synthetic dreads would be a good alternative for me because I'm a Caucasian girl with thin/straight hair too. I'm wondering a few things about getting them...Such as how long should my existing hair be in order to put them in? And where should I typically go to get them put in? I've called a few places that offer extensions but no one there knows anything about putting in synthetic dreads...I know a few people that can dread actual hair would they have an easy time putting in syn ones?   	20
 The ride never ends.   Item Sponge Succubullshit  Mr. Bones Wild Ride My Ex-Wife   That's disgusting that whole subreddit promotes Slam culture, and quite possibly Jam culture.   [Link for anyone who would like to see it.](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/42323-ghost-dad)      So our government has lied to us again. This time (and its not the first) it has come from the very top, the man everyone put their hope and beliefs in turns out too be a fucking asshole who doesnt give a fuck about any of you, your rights, your freedom, your very existence as a human being. This administration does not give a fuck about any of you, or anyone else in the world apparently.   The last one didnt either when they sent your sons and daughters to death on bullshit information that they knew was a lie, when they enacted so called laws and rules that deny you the things granted by the supreme law of the land. And what did we do. Not a fucking thing.   Also lets not forget the entire system is corrupt, "oh what about so and so from that one state, he/she is trying to make a difference they are trying to right these wrongs." Bullshit and fuck you. If you think for one second these so called "Politicians" give a fuck about you, you are completely misguided and ignorant of how the system works.   "Oh well what should we do? Random guy on the internet what CAN we do?" Well lets see we could protest and have the media paint us as rapist/drug users/idiots who dont know what they want. We could vote (in a system that is broken) for people who will make changes and fix the problem (remember how hard reddit was dick riding for Obama when he came here.) We could show our civil disobedience and take to the streets as a mob. (Yeah and when the police come with the guns,gas,armored tanks,grenades,clubs,chemical weapons and the feeling that they know they will get away with anything they do. Be prepared to either give up or get killed because they were "in fear of there lives.") Well we could gather on our computers and come up with something (NSFuckingA).  The point too all this is we have very few options left for us. The system has been working toward a goal for years and years and a bunch of post on the internet isn't going to change anything.   The founders of this country shed blood for the beliefs and ideas that once made this the greatest country on earth. Sons, brothers, husbands, went too die for us we can sit around and be the best keyboard activist we could be. And you know what  I have no answers, I have no idea, I have no plan to fix what is broken. Im just as lost as you. Just another twenty-seven year old father who sees the entire country heading toward something that's either completely safe and sound that leads to us giving away everything that we as a nation are founded on. Or something bloody, violent, unsafe and scary that leads us back to when the people where in charge. Not some rich asshole in a suit or some idiot in a suit controlled by money.   /rant  Pre Edit - Ive been drinking, and this is going to get buried anyway.

Can't dodge the Rodge.      Obama should also stop killing civilians with drones. Also he should reel in the NSA. Also he should also stop the drug war. Also he should let the people in gitmo go. Also he should get rid of the patriot act and ndaa. But guess what he woulnt do any of those and he sure as fuck woulnt fire the FCC chairman.

Character and story line wise. 2 is self contained with its only ties to the others being the town itself.    NANANANANANANANANANANANANANANA GARGOYLES!    As a huge SH fan I beg you op please play the original versions. The voice acting is way better. The fog is actually there. There's a buncha reasons. Also if I may recommend play them in this order if you can 1, 3, 2, then whatever else.    I dont see arts and crafts on that poll. FUCK I LOVE ARTS AND CRAFTS.   I think a big ass drawing of Liam laying down on the front, surrounded by lots of anime girls all passed out around him.

Thanks to /u/2centzworth for the story.   Thank you for the story.    I dunno it was just posted a few hours ago and from the title its somewhere in Missouri.       Just a reminder to always record the police. Its your right to do so. Also head over to /r/amifreetogo and /r/bad_cop_no_donut to see just how much this happens everyday and why there's a growing number of people who have nothing but hate for cops.    Glad I could help. Hope you find something you like.    Anime can be a bit hard to get into, with that said I'm gonna list some of my favorites with a small summary and you can check out which one if any sounds enticing.   Cowboy BeBop - considered to be the best anime ever made it focuses on a group of bounty hunters in space and there various adventures. Each episode is pretty much self contained but there is a plot line of each character that by the end is wrapped up fully and very well done. Check out the episode Pierrot Le Fou.  Afro samurai - the story focuses on afro as he kills and kills some more too reach the man who killed his father infront of him as a child. Full of action, violence, revenge, some feels and a sound track by RZA def check it out.  Samurai Champloo - the story of a girl who hires two samurai to help her find the samurai who smells of sunflowers, its full of style, action, comedy and imo on par with bebop as one of the greats.   Panty and Stocking - made by the people who made KLK story is about two angels. Panty (a foul mouth nyphomaniac) and Stocking (a goth girl who loves sweets) who must kill ghost to collect coins to get back into heaven. This one is a non stop ride of comedy, pop culture refrences, stylised violence, and absurd fun. It doesn't take its self seriously and its better for it.  Paranoia Agent - Do you like trippy mind fucks because that's what it is. A town is terrorized by Lil Slugger a kid on roller blades who attacks people with a baseball bat. Good style, good story a d kinda weird but totes worth it.  Trigun - A wild west type anime, focuses on Vash the Stampede in his travels fighting off bounty hunters, over the top villians and two insurance girls, too find Peace And Love. But in all seriousness its a great series loved by most for good reason.   When they cry - don't let the cute girls fool you this shit gets dark, like real dark. The story is split up into a few diffrent storys each containing a few episodes. Full of curses, tourtue, violence, some feels. Its not a trip for the faint of heart.  FLCL - zany, over the top, weird, stylish and a lot more. I could say more but its only six episodes go watch it.  Lain - a story of girl and her computer. There's way more to it than that but this is one of those ones where you watch it and you go wtf then you watch it again and go. Ooooh. Mind fuckey and very good imo. BUT YOU DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.  Those are just a few I personally enjoy and feel like give my half assed summery for.

One of the only things I've ever made on reddit gets reposted.   The hunt for red october.   That girl is a keeper. Thats from a dog fashion disco song.   Whats the difference between Zimmerman and Martin?   Zimmerman dodged a bullet.   I named my daughter Aya. From the Parasite Eve games on ps1. Cant wait til shes old enough so I can have her play those games. Most of the family doesnt know where I got the name from.    Liquor and whores.   It would be super awesome ninja, guy.   That ladder boss fight, that was some serious shit.   I'm a 26 year old single father of a 2 year old daughter whom ive had on my own since day one. I have no ties to her mother (she payes no child support, only sees Aya once every few months, no fighting, no anything), I live in a single bedroom apartment with my daughter, shes has the room I have the living room. I work everyday  im fairly attractive, im sharp as a tack, and im pretty layed back drama free guy, and I havnt been in a relationship  since her mother (and that was a mess).  Honestly at this point I know that i'm alone. Ive accepted this. At a certain point you just kinda let go, and stop trying to reach out for "her" and instead focus on giving your child the love that you wish you could feel.   TLDR: In my experience as a single dad you are less desirable.   The peanut butter and only the peanut butter, then with a strong enough shake you can get the jelly out of the container with no cross contamination. Then you are free to spread said jelly with your knife.    Andy Merrill aka Brak is from my town. Oh and the story of the guy with the motorized bar stool. Newark Ohio ftw.         I see what you did there.    He is also going for the world record, with no saves and no deaths.       He is also going for no saves and no deaths. He is also wearing a tie :D      Such a fun raid that was.   I found a girl once.    Hi, Billy Mays here for test_subject7503. Have you ever wanted your own Ninja? Someone to stop those pesky neighborhood dogs from shitting in your yard? Someone to hide around your house and scare the shit out of those pesky in laws who just dont know when to leave? Someone who can always find the remote or your keys?  Well with test_subject7503 all those things will be done for you and more. Those pesky neighborhood animals will suddenly vanish. Those in laws pants will have mass amounts of shit in them in no time. Hell cant find your keys or you misplaced the remote. NO PROBLEM he is already handing them too you.   Oh you want a female test_subject7503? Fuck you im Billy Mays. Shut up and buy this shit now. Or I can have my own test_subject7503 slap your shit into next week. Call now.   Single dad here, heres a quick story.  Daughter is born, her mother isnt stable enough too be a mother, and she doesnt even want too. (shes told me I chose too not give her up for adoption so she is MY problem) So I moved back home to my moms and take care of my daughter on my own. Around my daughter being 6 months I get a call from the Child Support Agency in Columbus. (i live in ohio and in the county next to columbus) They told me too come in so we can set up ME paying child support. I go in with Aya (my daughter) and with notes from witnesses (doctors, friends, family, boss, co workers) saying Ive done everything without any help from her mom.  Oh well in that case we will close the case against you and we will have your county pick up the case against her.   Aya is almost two years old now. Ive still never herd anything about awarding custody or having her mom pay anything. The system is very flawed and biased.   I think its just so fucked that within 6 months I was told to come in to set up payments, but its been almost two years and she is basically not doing anything and is getting away with it.   All Great Danes are like that. They have no idea how big they really are. One of the best breeds ever.    Why does that baby have tits?   TIL That the KH storyline made my brain fill with mass amounts of fuck.  I need to go lay down now.   No, you fuck off.   ^This guy.   The name FailedTeacher seems to make since now.   For?   Why did you hit your dad?  	112
 So you don't trust the government to monitor your internet activity, but you trust them to be the only ones with big guns? Brilliant.   why would buying a gun mean a school shooting? More people use the internet to harm children than use guns to harm children.   I'm questioning the validity of regulating either. Loughner had a legally purchased handgun when he went after Giffords but she is advocating banning AR15's? To me it's the equivalent of one saying "I'm the victim of a hate crime, it's time we ban CO2 emissions".   'The people that around me' care deeply about your personal sympathies.   Every knife is designed to kill as well. But most don't. It depends whos hands you place it in. The same for guns, the Internet, vehicles, fertilizer etc. Anything can be misused in the wrong hands. But we should just monitor everything all the time to be safe and to protect the children.  	5
 Am I the only one who actually enjoys sleep paralysis, and purposefully induces it; occasionally trying to push it as far as I can, hoping some fucking insane hallucination happens.... Or is it just me?   It says further in the wiki that you can be infected with the virus by simply handling a wild snail of this species.   Read that at like a [6]. Now I'm rethinking life (-)   It's because when your telling the truth, you get tired of repeating yourself over and over. When your lying, you are more concerned with keeping your lie together that you don't get as irritated. This is what I've seen at least.   But she ain't messin with no broke niqqas...  	5
             Can confirm, only way is to root.  If were saved to SD card = much easier to recover files! For this reason get your friend to change his damn save location to his SD card should he be so stupid again.   A nice gimmicky one would be a speed detector - point camera at a moving object and bam.      This made me feel sick to my stomach.   As a new Dad this guy needs to be put out of his misery. If not death then medicated to his eye balls.   As /u/Pelkhurst said - if he ever gains lucidity and realises what he's done I don't even know what a man would do to himself once he realises how much pain and suffering he put his very own flesh and blood through.  The question "How could he live with himself?" is simple - he couldn't.   If the fucktards are willing to do this with their PC's, how long do you think it will take before people start finding malware on their Motorola branded cellphones?    Best comment I've seen on Reddit for a very long time.   Nice.    Actually 4K is rather useful for video editors and even downsampled to 1080p is actually significantly higher quality than native 1080p.  Also with 4K TV's becoming eye poppingly cheap it's quite affordable for people replacing their current sets.   And furthermore given the competitor has been offering this feature for a while you can't tell me there's not a market for it.   Yes, but as I mentioned earlier the 4mp module on the HTC M8 simply doesn't have the same dynamic range of the higher pixel sensors resulting in washed out highlights and lack of detail in the shadows.  I agree Apple have things right - they've gone with 8mp coupled with phenomenal software support resulting in one of the best cameras for an all round solution.   I have an S5 and cannot understand how awesome the phase detection is for focusing, especially in low light. But why they didn't incorporate all the technologies into a single unit is beyond me.  I'm hoping HTC pull finger and release an awesome unit (phase detection/range finder/OIS), coupled with fantastic camera software (Zoe?) and just blow everyone out of the water.   I don't know if you read the review, they had to deliberately cool the phone down between benchmarks. LG were contacted who advised they are still tweaking the final product, so perhaps it was a pre-release hiccup.  I reckon Qualcomm have got a lot riding on this after Samsung's snubbing, so I daresay they'll be working closely with LG to ensure there are no issues.   No.  Extra megapixels also allow you to crop photos after you've taken them. Extra megapixels allow higher quality (read:4k) camera capabilities. (Note this last point may be why HTC rumours indicate 2 camera modules on the M9? - 1 high pix for UHD video, other Low "ultrapix" module.)    You have to hand it to HTC, however you needn't look any further than the decision by Sony to [release the Z3 as a 1080 screen](http://au.ibtimes.com/xperia-z3-sony-unwilling-sacrifice-battery-life-2k-smartphones-1368833) which they were slated for and forced to explain why. (Battery life of course..)  However it proves the world (as of September 2014) wants 1440+ higher screen sizes in their flagships, so it's going to be a risky move. Then again HTC are if anything happy to take risks!   It was extremely hampered by early reviews and the narrow dynamic range. GSMarena slated it as even when down grading the competitors camera from X-4MP they still did significantly better.  (I will say except for low light, where the camera excelled but realistically most people want a good all rounder than an awesome 1-thinger.)    Bother. Thank you very much for answering my question :)   I missed having a flashlight widget too much.. Or have they fixed that?    Thanks, that's a good idea.   No offence, but isn't that cutting off my nose to spite my face? I still want to listen to music on my phone, I just don't like the spotify wakelock keeping my phone awake when I've already closed Spotify!   I do.   It's just frustrating that it's not a 'feature' I can turn off, as I usually (as most people do.) turn my phone off and keep listening on their desktop, not realizing their phones are quietly still running.    I was listening to music on my mobile, but closed it via the X on the notification widget. However when I started listening soon after on my desktop I still had Spotify controls on my lock screen only.   I guess the *feature* here is you can pause/next your music without going back to the Application on your desktop. The severe downside is it keeps a wakelock open, draining your phones battery.  Because it doesn't display the ability to shutdown (No widget in the Notification centre) so I've found the only way to stop the wakelock is to Force Stop the Spotify Process in Android Application Management.  Ignore if this doesn't bother you, but I use Spotify on my desktop to save my battery life, which makes it kinda pointless to keep my phone awake.   Good to see our government ignoring its [own official advice:](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1 objectid=11362695) "Treasury has advised against taxpayer backing for Team New Zealand in the next America's Cup, labelling it "poor value for money"." Source: NZHerald Nov 2014   Damn nature you scary! http://i.imgur.com/jZO8w.jpg   Very very cool. Reminds me of "Limitless" movie fractal* zoom episodes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLxzNjVBCFY  *Is fractal the right term for this type of effect?   ..And the sound of Zero Fucks being given resounds around the world.  *Until the banks enforce: "Security fees: $100 a month"*      We need an ELI5 for saturation points on phones.  I mean yes there are still untapped markets, but most of those won't be buying 2k screens at current flagship prices, so how can they gaze into their crystal ball and say 2k are going to be the mainstay when most people don't want over 5.5 inch devices, and with the market flooded with such devices why your average Joe would choose a 2k screen over last years flagship with a normal HD panel?   It's a pretty good example to see how see how tsunami's are formed during an earthquake.   The simple and unfortunate truth could be they can't afford to uphold the tickets..  Http://www.airlineweekly.com/true-false-united-rising-uniteds-encouraging-q3-result-suggests-better-times-ahead/      The simple fact is people will do stupid shit and try and run regardless of whether the police will chase them, in nz we've had quite a few people die from smashing their car after the police have even called off chases minutes before.  You can't apply rationality to irrational people.   I see your point, but I would argue it was made our business the moment they went public.   That's an interesting, and probably quite accurate account, as it explains the medical check too.   Weird.   I get the feeling we really got kept in the dark/were deliberately misinformed and mislead over this whole story.   Like they wanted to paint a picture of what an awesome person she was so we'd keep an eye out for her.  While negating to inform us the circumstances under which she was found, and then offering us the teaser "She was checked by medical personnel" makes me believe she was far from the perfect mother etc portrayed by the media.    That was sooooo satisfying to watch.  People running from the police are so fucking selfish, it's good to see some good old fashioned street justice.   Oh, so they love to know where you are without a warrant, but god help you if you want to find out where they are?   Hypocritical wankers.   Actually captured him quite well. Good job.   However he's also managed to oversee a government which has approved some of of the most utterly appalling environmentally crippling policies like allowing dumping on the Great Barrier reef.   He's also attracted world wide ridicule by attempting to deny climate change.   I hope so.   the ISOCELL is a very interesting development in Pixel technology, I strongly believe that when paired with a good OIS it will bring superior low light performance over standard BSI OIS sensors.   I was kinda hoping for an ISOCELL OIS camera module, but 20MP doesn't sound like it. The Sony IMX240 equipped Note4 with OIS wasn't the best in low-light.  Still very exciting!      I'm sorry but are they fucked in head?   Fuck this makes me angry.  Fucking greedy corporations who can't be fucked to clean up their act.  Egged on by fucking greedy politicians who want their campaign money.  And stupid fucking residents for allowing this to happen.  The environment is just fucked. Doesn't even stand a chance.   There are more than one ways to skin a cat - like with Sony's curved sensor array promising higher light sensitivity!  The simple (and tragic fact) is more/bigger pixels are not feasible while the market craves smaller devices.  http://techtheday.com/can-an-eye-like-curved-camera-sensor-lead-to-better-photographs/   Android RAM management has become significantly better than older Android versions. These days with richer Applications and more RAM than ever before actually clearing your RAM can result in an impact to battery life as the OS needs to reload the Apps back into the RAM you just cleared. (For instance most Opera Mobile using desktop mode has over 200-300MB of RAM constantly.)  Likewize with Application cache (the other reason people use them) I can appreciate people who have very limited device storage using them, but they're a crutch as if you have to use it more than once a week due to space issues, chances are you need to upgrade your phone anyway.   lol. Then you'll get people complain about the noise, you can't win! :D   I appreciate that sentiment, I don't know what phone you have, but the S5's "phase detection autofocus" is light and day difference over the not-awful S4's focus.  but yes, I hear you on the low light issue.  This is something that needs to be fixed on the sensor as IOS is not the silver bullet we need.  (From the screenshot comparisons between the S5 and Note4 (although different sensor Sony IMX240 vs Samsung's Isocell) the differences for the lowlight shots are not as awesome as I expected the OIS to be able to perform with the Note4.)   Had a wee chuckle at your comment- brings back memories!    Well said.   It is but it's certainly a step in the right direction. I think most consumers have come to accept a slight protrusion, however 12mm (plus screen etc so more like 15mm) might be a tad thick. However you are getting 3x optical zoom!   Well, you'll be happy to note: "The European Parliament approved legislation that requires the mandatory use of "Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems" for all new electric and hybrid electric vehicles within 5 years."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle_warning_sounds   I know! They make fantastic (if horrendously expendy) filters too, so I have little doubt this module will be to a high quality standard.  Can't wait for camera samples.   The way I read it makes it sound like she blamed the bus for not being loud enough, so she didn't bother looking.   My S4 took significantly better photos (edit: In good light!) than our $600 Fujifilm EXR from 2011 though.   People who want better quality will always buy a better dedicated camera, I'm talking about the entry level ($100 cameras etc.)   Nah, it's only a suggestion. :)   Indeed, the only digital zoom I'll ever appreciate is the Nokia Lumia Pureview digital zoom implementation.   Yeah, I hope that Stuff have just edited out that little sound bite out of context, because blaming the bus for being silent and then admitting you didn't bother looking doesn't make her come across as the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Of course if she's a Redditor and would like to defend herself I welcome her side of the story. (If there's more to it.)   Thanks, I didn't realise it was also stabilised!   Yes, however due to the fact it was developed by a 3rd party - Hoya I'm hoping it's not patented to Asus, and could potentially make an appearance on other devices.      I really wish I could post this to the r/nottheonion/ but Stuff are such a shit tabloid news site they don't accept submissions any more from there! Anyway, this is pure Darwinism in action.   I also laughed at the fact they had comments which had to be disabled, I'm guessing due to the fact they ripped this girl a new one for actually blaming the bus for being "silent".       NZ, no such luck in our High Schools unfortunately, although that was 10 years ago so things may have changed, but I doubt it.  Not even as an optional study, I would have taken that class in a heartbeat.   That is very cool that you get taught about the myths though.   You have myths class?!    Awesome, gosh that was quick! I'm surprised this ran on your phone, it doesn't support Kit-Kat.  Tap 'main' does it expand to further info? Also please display "CPU_wakelocks" (press circle icon)    The silly thing is the fact most Applications on your cellphone can do this, and much much more:  See your photos, record your voice, view your location hostory, view your website history.  Yet everyone just clicks the "Install" button without a second thought.  Yet God forbid a company are actually OPEN about the fact that in order to provide you a service using your voice they WARN you that your voice is being recorded.  Come on people. Props to Samsung for being open about this at least.   LG are just as bloody bad! "LG smart TVs send data about users' files and viewing habits to the company"  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2066400/lg-smart-tvs-share-data-about-users-files-and-viewing-habits-with-the-company.html   Anyone else reminded of the movie "Alive"?    Brutal.    Well you see on your graph how the 'awake' is damn near a constantly solid line!  While your Screen on graph is only sporadic and doesn't match with your 'awake' line.  This basically indicates there's errant background processes which is sapping your battery life.  These errant processes are usually: Google scanning for your location (as requested by Adware on your cellphone) Google Now waking up your phone to either see your location or present you new cards. Weather Apps/widgets updating. Email/Facebook apps updating themselves. Background data use (think Spotify/music playing etc.)  The best way to determine what's sapping your battery life is to get Wakelock Detector. (However due to the fact Google are bastards they don't want you to be able to access the indepth analysis battery stats.) So you need to use a work around (nothing scary!).  Step 1- acquire a windows PC. Step 2- Go here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3VlhZIZVSufZlAeICJet6QBtyAF7z06_ysl1kUKME4/edit#slide=id.g298bc178a_00 Step 3- follow instructions.  I've done it a few times now, this will allow you to actually see your Wakelock stats (so in effect that's sapping your battery life by waking up your phone!)  Once you have your Wakelock stats post a screenshot on this subreddit can we can help you to determine what's the matter.   Sweet jesus man. Your battery life must be awful.  Are you worried about your battery life? What do you get - my year old S4 got 4hours SOT /8 hours standby.       But is upping the pixels the best way to do this?    To answer the op, technically no. But it's very relative to your previous experience with screens.   What I mean is if you haven't had an amoled before and look at the note 4 you may think the color and other amoled properties are a QHD attribute.    There's the old (and very relevant) issue of the human eye simply being unable discern the individual pixels, above a certain dpi.   This shouldn't be ignored, however at 5.7 inches I'm willing to believe those with extremely good eye sight can see a difference under optimum conditions.   Is it worth it (I know not what op asked, but these two questions are closely related) for most people an awesome FHD amoled will provide the same wow factor and provide awesome battery life.   I feel mislead by the title, I thought op meant Don Hertzfeldt's rejected: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkrJB7Q0X3Q      There's something deeply insidious about this.   Does it play clash of titans?    How many people clicked the link just to see the lesbians kiss? Come on.. you know you did.   What aren't dashcams good for?!   Seriously, there are now entire Youtube channels dedicated to dashcam footage from Europe.  And now just entertainment, we've benefitted scientifcally with detailed footage of meteor showers for instance.  And now one's capture a freaking commercial plane crash! That's awesome.   Considering what that man has done for science - take it out of the classroom and into millions of peoples living rooms I'm stoked someone has found an appropriate way to ensure his legacy will live on. (Aside from DVD and Bluray sales of his shows of course.)  It's a great honour and bestowed upon a worthy person.   Plot twist: all 4 dead were found in the morgue!  Thank^you^I'll^let^myself^out   Thousands of men all around the around laugh nervously and cross their legs.   What's the icon?!    You're right, and "State commisioned murder" has such a lovely ring to it.. /s!      It just adds to the abhorrent nature of the crime commited by the police.  I think the wording was carefully chosen in the article to articulate the difference between the police forces.  The ranks of the elite riot police wear **riot gear** for protection.   The ranks of these scum wear **masks** for anonymity.   There's something deeply wrong on so many levels as that sentence: "masked police".   Any police that are wearing masks are instantly not worthy if the title "police". They are criminals posing as police.      Samsung have a reasonable video editor in their "Samsung store".  I can edit videos taken, and then compile my own videos from the clips on my Samsung s4.  Maybe see if there's an alternative for your device? Or see if you can acquire and sideload the apk?    So chump change for them then?  This is the rich making the poor on a merry dance while their friends rob them blind.    This is a genius post! Catch upvotes by laying a trap for all the lonely posts without upvotes.  Outstanding logic.    Your parents were probably having some fun to the #1 song on Sunday, July 27th 1986 which was:  Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel  Too much information.   sadly no....... I'm sure it's out there!   I know. Well done on doing your homework, it's stuff like this that I'm sure Stuff aren't allowed to post for fear of their masters coming down on them.   It's sickening really. Unfortunately it's never going to change, ultimately it is only going to get worse.   As governments the world over have shown big business owns legislation to ensure they continue to make squillions of profit unimpeded.   That's.. Awful.   I know right!? Something is a bit smelly with the whole affair.   you needed a /s there! :P But yes, that's basically their thought process.   lol, no..   It's the impact to the image of the company they represent that the company are worrying about.  For instance an older person might hear a rumour that 2 married employees have an affair and will choose to take their business elseware. A younger person however would go "whatever." so given this is an insurance company, they will be looking at the age etc of their clientele to determine whether this is enough to make people not use them.   Of course the other side of the coin is that the company may realise (perhaps after an analysis from a PR agency which I daresay is already happening) that they in fact gained from their employees indiscretion and may allow them to keep their jobs.    Personally, I still do, but the wife went to Whittakers long ago.  They still have a humungous following regardless of their piss poor business choices.   Then again in NZ there's only a duopoly - Whittakers and Cadbury.   They got lax. They released bad business decision - changes to their product - after bad decision with no mea-culpa it's all "To protect our increasing profits."   Haha, I tried last night. However surely someone can find it!?   Judging by some of the commentators it was at least 30 minutes, so there's that.   Indeed.   What's the easiest way to lessen the blow of any change in their core product - give away free shit.  Where's the free shit Cadbury!?   Right, which makes the profit, coupled with this announcement all the more brutal.   Ha-de-ha. You think this isn't part of what's going to happen in your part of the world too?   I have to wonder if the marketing genius's at Cadburys saw how well the announcement went down for Whittakers and presumed they could pull the same stunt?   Also (I don't know how much Australian choco makes it to NZ shores) but the Aus arm of Cadbury posted a humungous profit last year -  **CHOCOLATE maker Cadbury recorded a $127 million profit in the year Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised the company a $16 million grant to revive factory tours.** [Source](http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/profit-blots-blots-cadbury-aid/story-fnj4f7k1-1226978294004)    And Aussie too...... They forgot the NZ public have memory like elephants, companies are not easily forgiven for messing with an iconic product!         If I find it I'll post it!  Edit: found this, just from the news http://youtu.be/21btvNAFn98   True. Although if true you have to spare a thought for their families... what a time.   Just their building, not their employees as I understand. But yes, free publicity regardless!     Oh. dear....... God this gets worse and worse for them..   It was harmless until the name of the company was released, by the company. As mentioned earlier, they may have made it worse for themselves a bit.   You're probably not even half wrong......   Perhaps, we can but wonder really. Probably bystander effect too, everyone else thought everyone else would do something. (if you get what I mean?)   lol, they hopefully won't, the whole flying the corporate team into CHCH for damage control seems a bit overkill though.   Actually, really good point. In this day and age sometimes a good denial and complete media silence is the best policy.   A comment on the article would lead you to believe the guy did. Worst possible way to be caught if that is the case..    If it was the second floor as mentioned earlier, can't exactly knock on the window..   It's not that they were having sex, it's having sex with the lights on beside a busy pub.   Bear in mind cellphone camera's aren't the best low-light cameras, so for the some of the clips to be such good quality one can only presume they were lit up like a xmas tree.    Haha, fair call..   Ah, thank you for the clarification.   Still clearly (judging by the photos) visible to outside though..    I'm sure they'll be somewhere in imgur.. I would search but on a work machine. :D   You feel sorry for them, but in the same breath, having the lights on at street level.. You have to wonder if it was deliberate (hence the 'caught'.)  I also really hope it was all above board, and wasn't an affair, that's perhaps the worst way for an affair to come to light..         Very true.  	131
 I threw up on myself a couple years ago, the third time i ever tossed and washed. It was the last dose I owned and I was pissed. Ever since then I'm just more careful about it, and hasn't happened since.    That's incredibly inaccurate. I prefer HS over Mmm, Speciosa all day. The quality IMO is better and it's way cheaper.   Cost isn't a huge factor? OH SHIT THIS NIGGA BALLIN   iOSPoundcake?   Wayward apostrophe's   Anal parachute   Well, you can OD on anything, technically. But you would have to eat a pretty god damn ridiculous amount of kratom to die from it. So accidental  overdoses aren't especially harmful with kratom, you can just throw up or lie down until it goes away.   You're a dirty nigger   What kratomkorner coupons? I don't know of any.   He's confusing shills with people who love their products, prices and service. I recommend them all the time. They just have a large following. I'm quite interested to see some concrete shillage though, if there is any.   I'll bet you a package of Monistat 7 that it's extremely relevant.   The other day I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to try a 3-way strain mixture. I went 2 grams of Red Vein Sumatran, 2 grams of Green Bali, and 2 grams of Red Vein Thai. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling pretty great, when I suddenly felt the need to shit. I went and got on the toilet and squeezed a good one out. However, I was still feeling quite adventurous, so I decided to wipe from back to front. I've always wiped from front to back, and I was just curious what it would be like to not have to lean off the seat to wipe... I could just reach down between my legs. Unfortunately, because of this, I ended up with a yeast infection on my nutsack. Do not recommend.   Phenibut and benzos don't have a cross-tolerance? Could that be why? IDK anything about phenibut. I used to be prescribed k-pins as well, i'd get 90 1 mg pills and i would blast through them in 5 days, which i never remembered. It's a horrible drug to be addicted to, and a dangerous one to get off of.   Does your tolerance not build when you take DXM? Can I get away with taking a really small dose of DXM? I really don't like the idea of using it every day though.   Looks like I better try this tomorrow. I can't seem to talk myself into a washout, unfortunately.   Try a different strain. Maeng Da makes me feel like shit.   I used to shoot heroin. The first time I ever took kratom, I took 7 grams. I don't know which strain, I didn't know enough about kratom at the time to care. I went from being dope sick to feeling ok in about 20 minutes, it was really quite noticeable.   I didn't catch a buzz off it at all, I just felt normal again. That was the problem. I didn't want to just be ok, I wanted to be high. I took kratom a few more times at pretty high doses, and then just went back to the opiates.  It wasn't until I went back to prison this last time and got out, that I decided to give kratom a go again. This time it worked great, because I was at baseline as far as my tolerance was concerned. It filled the void I had in me. Even though I'd been sober for about 8 months (I'd used Suboxone in prison in the beginning of my bid) , I still just felt empty. So I gave it a shot and I haven't looked back since. It's been about 8 months.   The problem is, when he's hooked like that, the mental aspect is half the battle. And having a plant that just keeps him feeling OK is just going to cover the physical side of things, it won't do much for the mental cravings. I would say his best bet would be to (somehow) get off the opiates for about a month and then start a kratom regimen... that way it does something for him both mentally and physically. Other than that, he could start a kratom regimen now and seek outpatient treatment and/or NA/AA for the mental side of things. I don't know. I hope this helps.   Call the ambulance right before you take it so they're there when you start to lose your shit.   That sounds detrimental to your health. Not the sort of thing you want to deal with long term, who knows what the effects could be. What about veins? Does it happen with red, green and white veins?   I can't make heads or tails of this comment.   Tomorrow, around noon.   Just slip a few grams into her soup and then she'll see the light.   Did you pay several hundo for it? Maybe it's heroin. Maybe those are heroin rocks.   You do this every day? I need to find a solid method myself.   I giggled at your comment.   The only green I touch is Bali, mixed with reds, and I haven't been getting any palpitations... so yeah, might be worth experimenting. I also have a history of heart palpitations and anxiety anyway, so I suppose the whites might exacerbate it.   What strain are you using? White veins and Maeng Da both give me heart palpitations, along with a plethora of other side effects. I've sworn them off.   4) Green stains are hell. Grass stains were always the bane of Mama's existence.   Be careful.   Tobacco: You may crave tobacco more when using kratom. I chew tobacco and I feel nothing extra after I chew, other than I'm always ready for another chaw as soon as I spit my last one out. Food: Always take kratom on an empty stomach, being full can minimize the effects greatly. Some claim eating a small meal 45 minutes after kratom ingestion can actually potentiate it. I've never witnessed it. Soda: Some also say caffeine increases kratom efficacy. Once again, I've never noticed it.   MAKE ME, DICK FACE   That brother can keep his ass over here.   100 mg oral morphine? Forget about it. Kratom is for people who want to maintain, not for people looking to get high. You'll never achieve that sort of feeling from kratom. Come back and give it a try when you're all strung out and out of options. Until then it's going to be pretty useless to you. Even if you take a heroic dose, the side effects will have you fucked up long before any sort of opioid feeling will.   It's really not even comparable to cannabis. If you're opioid naive, you can certainly get a high from it in the beginning. I've never smoked it but I've read reports that it's hardly even worth doing. I'd imagine you'd have to smoke a couple grams of it at once to achieve desired effect, although I'm not familiar with it at all.   It's apples and oranges. Kratom is the type of thing that might tempt you to indulge in it more often than you originally planned. I wouldn't recommend it if you're just trying to make your weed go longer.   I'll review as well.   Junk-Gnomes are sneaking in your room and shooting you with H right after you fall asleep.   That's who I think about while I fuck the sandwich.   I just saw your name and your comment and I immediately imagined what it'd be like to stick my dick in a vacuum cleaner hose that has a club sandwich jammed in the tip.   I have an Amazon gift card, was thinking of coppin some kratom myself but would be pissed if I wasn't happy with it. Best to not chance it I guess.   I'll notice he's gone. I'll notice how fuckin peaceful it is without his negativity. lol   Your mom choked to death on my wiener   I hate the taste of tea.   Sources:  Herbal Salvation: Great value, my personal vendor**** MMM, Speciosa: Known to have highest quality, but you pay for it.****** Strains: Red Veins (Sumatran, Borneo, Thai, etc.) are best for sedation but I throw a little Green Bali in there to spice it up a notch. It seems to really potentiate the Red Veins, and it's not too speedy. Such combos are great for pain.    Good question. He's a dirty shill.   Ha. In reality, he's actually a boner consumer.   Awwww. Poor thing.   Only 77 dollars for 2 ounces. What a steal.   You guys could have at least posted a couple other times before dropping your shill post. This is just blatantly obvious and disrespectful to this sub and its subscribers.   Cop a sample pack and try them all, see which ones (or combinations) you like best and go from there. Use ginger if you get nausea. Use as little as possible. Get plain leaf, no extracts. Go several days cold turkey from your pain meds before you try kratom and the results will be much better than if you try to transition from one directly to another.    This is downright snazzy. Bravo.   A couple... When I pooped, my poop already had toilet paper in it. Also, I now own 5 less grams of kratom.   It really itched. Do not recommend.     DAMN. THAT BROTHER ASTUTE.   Can you deliver to New York? I'll give you a handy-j.   Withdrawal from any sort of opioid gives me nightmares, if I can even manage to sleep.   WHERE'D IT GO?   YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   Robbed?  You nod from UEI?   Reminds me of people that think ecstasy is cut with heroin or coke. It just doesn't make any sense. Kratom vendors are going to synthesize methadone so they can lace their kratom with it? Sounds crazy.  Surely they wouldn't be using pharmaceutical methadone. That would be even crazier. They wouldn't be able to afford it. I would know for sure if there was methadone in my kratom, lol. I'd be ripped all day, rather than feeling good for a couple hours and then just feeling a glow the rest of the day. Tell ya what though... if somebody finds kratom with methadone in it, I want some.   Just jam a ball into your vein. Then you don't have to worry about coming down... ever.   Go for it. I chase every dose with ginger ale. If I don't, I get nausea. Ginger ale works really well though. I wouldn't be using kratom without it. I suggest you get some.   One time I wiped my ass from back to front and I got a yeast infection on my nutsack.   Even when it isn't the holidays, USPS screws up once in a while and loses a package in circulation anywhere from 1 to 10 days. It just happens. It's much more likely during the holidays. I'm sure it'll make it, but give it a week or two. If it never arrives, I imagine MS would replace it.    The only thing I understand in this post is MS.   I go 2:1 RVS to Green Bali. The RVS does hardly anything by itself, no matter how much I take. But that 1/3rd of Bali REALLY potentiates the RVS. It's the only way I roll.  	66

 its ok that you really liked her and now you miss her even if she wasnt in your life that long. i get it; it happens. thats just something you are going to have to give yourself time to get over and move on.   On the other hand it sounds like the girl has some issues of her own that she is dealing with; trust, commitment, not knowing who she is or what she wants (all hypothetical of course but she was obviously flipflopping at the very least based on this tiny impression you gave on her) so this might just be for the best.   keep in mind; you didnt end anything on bad terms, take your time and go easy on yourself and try to find some fun distractions in the meantime is my advice. you said you have gone on other dates, so you will clearly have new options, keep an open mind and you never know what will happen.  you should maybe post this over at r/advice or r/relationships because i feel they would be more inclined to give in-depth advice at those types of subs.   so but who gets that donut?   the home depot logo makes it particularly classy ;)   its gross but ive probably gone like 1-2 weeks when im in a bout of depression; they get all stained up (mostly by coffee and cigarettes) and they feel grimy in my mouth. Also plaque builds up, which is the only thing that isnt fixed once i start brushing again (thank god for whitening toothpaste).   when i start back with the brushing and flossing i also notice all the space and holes between my teeth which i couldnt feel at all during the non-brushing weeks, and notice the food stuck in between them immediate. so the less you floss your teeth, the less it feels like you even have to floss, cuz your teeth are all clogged up with grime.  i feel like i talked for way too long about this gross personal subject. im going to hit save before i change my mind completely.  edit: spellings   my highschool had "math for everyday life" which was supposed to be the remedial math class, but was probably the most useful class for highschool students since it taught you how to understand and calculate mortgages, bank ( /other) loans and interest rates, how do understand and do your income ( /other) taxes; stuff that people actually need to know to be an adult. I thought that was pretty good, too bad it was only supposed to be for the "dumb" kids cuz im pretty sure everyone would benefit from that type of class...   highschool sweetheart: we were both too immature to particpate in a real relationship. we are friends now and have talked about how different it would have been if we were both mature adults. our relationship was technically "off and on" because we broke up over every (stupid) fight but became "official" again shortly thereafter, rinse and repeat for 2-3 years. lots of jealousy and dumb arguments, that type of shit.  edit: accidental words   leave it; its his closet now.   WHOA WHOA WHOA that was some cold shit outta nowhere..!  ..Wait maybe the ex learned to read and write?   0_o  	9
 they never add anything to weekly sales   If you like military games   I didn't think it was his best work either, but still overall a great read. The thing about Slaughterhouse Five (and most of what I've read of Vonnegut) is some of the passages in the book just stand out, and are unforgettable. Someone posted here the other day the excerpt about the poor in America, so I'll throw this one out there instead -  The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.  But the Gospels actually taught this:  Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isnt well connected. So it goes.  The flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didnt look like much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe. Readers understood that, so, when they came to the crucifixion, they naturally thought, and Rosewater read out loud again:  Oh, boythey sure picked the wrong guy to lynch _that_ time!  And that thought had a brother: There are right people to lynch. Who? People not well connected. So it goes."   Sorry for the tired often repeated post, just looking for opinions. I have about every rare and most epics. I've been maining curi's board control warlock, but am trying to build towards druid or maybe shaman.  I have: Sylvanas, Rag, Tinkmaster, Velen, King Krush.  Should I craft Cenarius? Black Knight? Cairne? Something Else?   I'm not really into CS, but in League when someone on your team sucks, they end up feeding the other team which inherently makes that member of the other team a lot more powerful. If they're bad enough, they will make someone on the other team so powerful that they have essentially singlehandedly lost the game for your team, all the while you have to suffer and play against someone who is a lot more powerful than you are until the game is over. You likely end up dying a lot due to something out of your control.  Not an excuse to be an asshole, but a possible explanation of why League/DOTA can be really frustrating.   Overcosted is the wrong word, should have used too expensive. It's too expensive to be played right now, as it's a dead card in aggro matchups. Maybe that changes after the next patch, when it seems like aggro will drop off a little and druid and shaman control will rise up (or maybe hunter becomes playable)   The effect is still pretty insane, but it's now really overcosted since the nerf   Hunter otk is gone, warrior charge otk is gone, pyroblast and mages were nerfed. It's pretty clear Blizzard isn't fostering one turn kill mechanics and that they don't want them in the game.    but in heartstone you can win with some classes in one turn even if the other guy have 20 health and board control and there is nothing you can do about it  Not true anymore     You are getting downvotes because you are whining and stating things that aren't actually correct. I did not downvote you, but I'll try to address your points fairly.  * **It's mostly luck-based.** Yes, this game is not chess, it is a card game. All card games are based on a mixture of skill and luck. Just becuase there are RNG minions, does not mean the game is total luck though. Have you ever played poker? It's a game based on calculating odds based on known and unknown factors. I'll take your mad bomber example - Let's say I have a 3/1 divine Shield, and you have 3 minions, one of which is a blood imp. Is it worth mad bombering here? How important is getting rid of your blood imp to me? Can I afford to have the bomber hit my own life total or get rid of my shield? Should I save the bomber for a more opportune moment or do I need the 3/2 body to keep tempo? Should I attack first, increasing the odds of hitting your blood imp but potentially allowing my 3/1 to be killed? Am I playing into board sweep or setting up a potentially bad trade based on what I'm anticipating you to have? Do you have Hellfire in hand?    Sometimes your mad bomber just kills your 3/3, and yeah, that is super unlikely and really sucks, but to claim there is no strategy because of it? That is not true.    Cards like Blood Knight are perfectly fine. It is a sick answer to a metagame dominated by argent squires to catch people unaware. A mediocre card that is really good against certain deck types - literally every competitive CCG has cards like this.  * **It's Pay-To-Win.** Hearthstone has just about the least offensive model of any CCG. Solforge? Far worse. Magic? Hahaha. The top constructed decks have around 1-5 legendary cards in them, with Druid Control generally being the most expensive. I practically have this entire deck after one or two months without spending a dime - I'm missing two of the five legendaries. Also, the legendaries AREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD OR GAMESHAPING! Most are niche cards, with exceptions being Sylvanas and maybe Rag. You do not need legendaries to be competitive. Crafting them is also very easy and not nearly as hard as you make it to be. I've crafted two legendaries in a month or two without even disenchanting anything besides duplicates. Not to mention you can craft any card you want - unlike other games where you need to just keep cracking packs.  * **One of the two game modes sits behind a paywall.** No, this is pretty much a huge exaggeration. Yes, arena costs 150 gold or $1.99. Daily quests give you anywhere from 40 to 100 gold, and you get 10 gold per 3 constructed wins. Not only that, but winning in arena GIVES YOU MORE GOLD. Going 7-3 gives you over 150 gold! Arena is far from random and very skill based. Many, many players are able to average 7-12 wins per run. Also, stating that Blizzard has reduced the rewards is just a straight up lie - they actually INCREASED them nearly across the board when they made the move to 12 being the maximum win number. I have never paid for arena and do one or more nearly every day.  So yeah, that is probably why you are getting the downvotes   Seriously? Solforge is pretty fun but it is super pay to win. The free to play rewards I get are most often a small amount of silver and a common I have numerous copies of. The Drafts are great, but as a f2p player expect to be able to play one every week if you're lucky.  Constructed is really dependent on legendaries (hope you got lucky and have 3 Thundersaurs!) and incredibly unbalanced - at least when N/T Shapers was completely dominant you only needed a few legendaries - Zimus, Phoenix, etc. Now that A/U Weirwood Thundersaur is the best deck by a country mile, hope you have thundersaurs, blightsteel gargoyles, 2/4 free robot guy, etc   It's almost like games became more complex or something   Sure you can, you can stop writing off people complaining about being threatened as being "pretty damn irritating"   Yeah, being empathetic towards other people's problem totally sucks   That's not true at all. It's simple, but it has a lot of decisions. Obviously it relies on random factor, but so does every card game. Arena in itself has 30 decisions just when making the deck. Then there are decisions to be made with the mulligan process, with which creature to attack, when to attack your opponent's creatures rather than go to the face, trying to predict what your opponent's possible responses to your plays are, etc. What you are saying is simply wrong   ok   Well, you've spent 60 bucks, by all means extrapolate on how you'd like to rape this guy's mother   The point is they actually get paid well enough to deal with that sort of bullshit    The fact is 90% of games are shipped broken, buggy, or half-finished. It doesn't help you go to shit like CES with amazing pre-rendered scenes, but the game never looks anything like it.  Said by someone who clearly has no idea how programming works     How is it not clear that this only applies to the chuckleheads actually doing this sort of thing    Have you seen the hatred lobbed at Michael Bay and Justin Bieber? How about George Lucas from 1999 on? Its nothing new and certainly isn't unique to gaming.  * George Lucas net worth - 7.3 billion dollars.  * Michael Bay net worth - 400 million dollars.  * Justin Bieber net worth - 130 million dollars.   Totally fair to compare them to the Call of Duty balance patch guy who makes a 6 figure salary if he's lucky     Fuck all of this "tl:dr - it's the internet, learn to deal with trolls, blah blah blah" nonsense. Not sure why it's so hard to just say that yeah this guy is right, we shouldn't be dicks    And I'm sick of indie developers and publishers thinking they're entitled to my money simply because they "made a game".  And you got "indie and entitled" from a guy saying he just finished working on a AAA game how? Oh right, because you didn't read the article     There is a tutorial, it does a good job teaching you the basics of the game.   Easy. It is less complicated and more streamlined than most other card games, but still has a good amount of complexity to the game.   I'm sure bloggers will strictly follow those rules! Betting this game sucks   Nice metagame, lol   "Franchises we would like to see on the WiiU"   Looks like a guy drumming up page views with some fake F-Zero fan art to me   Sylvanas   Yeah. I might keep truesilver because it's just so good, but most of the time, I think just being able to play out a 2-3-4 or 2-2-3-4 with the coin start usually just trumps keeping a good card. Getting behind in this game is pretty brutal and I believe coming out strong is pretty important for arena.  Plus, this game 9 times out of 10 just gives you back the cards you mull anyways, so you might just get that sick 4 drop back ;)   Stormwind champ vs faerie dragon is close and you could probably make an argument that the champ is the better pick, especially in this deck.   One of those cases where it depends. Is it a 3 card or 4 card hand? What does the curve of your deck look like? How many 2 drops are you running? How awful would it be to drop your hero power turn 2? (Pally being not ideal, warrior completely awful?) Hearthstone is more complex than most make it out to be.  Yeti is obviously a top 4 drop, and if you manage to draw into something to play on turn 2/3, slamming a yeti turn 4 is obviously awesome. All I can really say is know your deck. Sometimes I'll have a deck with nuts lategame (3 flamestrikes or something like that) and not enough lower drops. In that case, I'd throw the yeti back, as I know I'd be drawing lategame power. Other times your curve just looks like a diagonal line from 2 drops down, so there I'd probably keep the yeti in hopes of out-tempoing my opponent and winning quickly.  In most general cases, I'd likely throw it back on a 3 card hand, and keep it (assuming it's the sole keeper) in a 4 card hand. I know "it depends" isn't the ideal answer, but it's the case here.   Pick 5: I'd take the 5/4 Taunt over mirror image, but it's probably close  Pick 6: Definitely frostbolt. Frostbolt Is one of the top cards you can get in a mage draft, murloc tidehunter is not very good.  Pick 8: Really don't like ice lance, I'd just take the 2/3.  Pick 10: Twilight Drake over counterspell. Twilight Drake often gets silenced but when he doesn't he's like a chillwind yeti or better. counterspell is ok but not as good  Pick 17: worgen infiltrator, or mana wyrm over mirror image. Not really a big mirror image fan, you probably overvalue it a bit.  Pick 18: your 2 slot is filling up but i'd probably still take faerie dragon over stormwind champ  pick 28: shieldmasta. Curve is important, but you're placing a bit too much importance on it.  Still take really good cards like shieldmasta over mediocre ones like argent squire.  pick 29: you can never have enough frostbolts   ----------------------  Not horrible but a couple of mispicks. You don't need to deliberate over frostbolt, it's a slam every time unless there's something else like flamestrike, fireball, water elemental, etc     I'll keep waiting for 10 or under, but thanks for the update!   Don't fret - many of us have been playing card games for almost 20 years. As long as you keep learning from making mistakes, you will keep improving.  **Step 1: Drafting your arena deck**  Look over tier lists - the following lists are very helpful references. Do not be afraid to do a few drafts directly following the tier lists. The more drafts you do, the more you will get a feel for which cards are very good and which are not, and you can deviate a bit based on personal preference.  http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1ujhzo/antigrav1tys_arena_draft_tier_list/  http://www.ihearthu.com/trumps-arena-card-rankings/  http://www.ihearthu.com/vivafringes-guide-to-arena/  **Step 2: Draft mana curve**  Ideally, you want to balance tier lists with mana curve. Don't pass up something like Argent Commander for a mediocre 2 drop, but you want to be able to have enough 2 drops to be able to curve out (2 drop on turn 2, 3 drop on turn 3, 4 drop on turn 4). Having around 6 2 drops you can actually play on turn 2 is a good metric to start with.  Practice makes perfect. Although it's work, write down all 30 of your picks (including all 3 cards and what you chose) and post it here. You'll get a critique from a large amount of people who will quickly show you your faults - and if you don't, PM me and I'll look it over. It will be super helpful in seeing if it's the cards you're picking that's the problem.  **Step 3: Draft Classes**  Don't be afraid to pick "overpowered" classes. I pick mage every time it comes up and if mage isn't there, I'll pick paladin. The point of the game is to win. Your mileage may vary, but mage and paladin are generally considered two of the more powerful classes.  **Step 4: Mulligans**  On the play, you want to have a 2, 3, and 4 drop. On the draw, coin gives you options but try for a 2-2-3-4, 2-4-4, or a 3-3-4 start. You generally always want a 2 drop in hand. If you draw 3 4 drops, mull them all, unless one is something really insane. Anything over 4 do not keep is a good arena rule of thumb.  **Step 5: Gameplay**  Always be thinking of what gets you the most value. At worst you want to trade one of your cards for theirs. In general you want to look to get added value. Getting 2 cards with one of yours is how you win games. If you play a shattered sun cleric and trade with the 3/3 taunt bear, you get small value because you traded a 3 drop for a 3 drop but still have the battlecry on another creature. Small value adds up and wins games.  Finally, don't give up - once it clicks, you'll be rattling off 8+ wins every time. Good luck   I totally disagree. if this guy can't string together more than 3 wins in arena, the first thing he should do is strictly emulate the guides to see what approaches are known to work.   Once he gets the basics down and experiences some success, your advice has merit, but until then, if he just plays the way he feels like he won't magically get better.   EUIV on sale any time soon?   Black Knight is a literal game winner. Eating a shieldmasta or sunwalker is such a huge tempo shift. Worst case he's an expensive Chillwind Yeti, which is obviously worse than Illidan, but it isn't very hard to get insane value from him.  Illidan usually needs to survive a turn to provide good value, otherwise he is kind of mediocre. The Beast is usually just pretty bad. Usually just eats removal and gives your opponent a free guy.   [Gallipoli](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082432/)?   Why would it be so awful to give every arena deck equal opportunity to be great instead of having to get lucky enough to get the class cards for a good run.  That exists, it's called playing constructed   Yeah, 3 is probably ideal, but depending on what the other two cards are, I wouldn't feel too awful taking more than that.  Let's be real, if I was handed a mage deck with 5 flamestrikes, I probably wouldn't complain too hard.   Great list, minor disagreements here and there. As mage I do not agree with maxing out flamestrikes at 2.   I used towerofthehand.com as my reference. It allows you to put what the last book you finished as a scope, so it will avoid spoilers.   Solution: If you don't like playing buggy unfinished games, stop buying games in early access   Totally a mystery why people would pick the best arena class if given the option   Setting challenges for reading is great, 50 is about double what I'll read this year most likely. Not sure I'd be a huge fan of only being able to read US born authors for an entire year, however.   I feel it's fine where it is. It's fairly weak unless you have lots of pump and not a card I'm super happy to pick.   The Third Bear by Jeff Vandermeer   Blizzard, hotfix the game immediately, we need to take Ice Block out because it's the only card guy who has been playing for four days has a problem losing to   **Hearthstone!**   Blizzard's TCG wildly surpassed my expectations, arena is tons of fun, and I'm really looking forward to seeing where Blizzard takes it next year and into the future.   It is also incredible - most underrated game of the year, and in my personal top ten list. If you like old school platformers, particularly Ghouls n Ghosts, snap pick this up   Yeah, I see the appeal (though not for me) and liking it is one thing, but I can't imagine people enjoying it so much that it made their top ten lists. Have people here put hours into Divekick? Is there an active online community to it?  In a year with so many good games, I just question seeing it listed above some others.   Yes, it is much better than the original 2/2  Yes, hunters are awful  Yes, it wouldn't make hunters OP  No, Blizzard will not buff up a card to be better than the original version of a card they just nerfed about a month ago (hunters were pretty awful back then too)   You really think Blood Imp would be a lot better as a 2/2 without stealth? If so I doubt you understand why it's good in the first place. Just because people are currently packing bad cards like Fan of Knives to deal with Warlock Rush doesn't mean that a 1/1 stealth with a super powerful ability would be worse than a plain 2/2 that literally dies to nearly anything other than a hero ability   That's besides the point, why would they make a card they just nerfed better than it was originally?   Why is Divekick in so many top 10 lists?   Making it 1/1 stealth makes it much more powerful than it was originally at 2/2. More powerful than Blood Imp most likely   To be fair sacrificial pact at its best is killing your opponents demon for free, which is pretty sick. Card is still awful don't get me wrong   Card advantage is important, but the MOST important thing in this game is tempo and curve. In arena, if you miss a turn 1 and 2 drop on the play and don't have a plan, like a turn 4 hellfire or consecration, most cases you won't be able to keep up with a t1 coin into a 2 drop t2 2 drop t3 3 drop t4 4 drop.  From there, it's all about getting card advantage and making value trades. Rarely is there any "drop it and I win" cards like mtg (Gideon Jura in Rise draft, baneslayer angel, etc)   Nothing better than sorry spamming a sorry spammer when they preemptively, aggressively, GG you.   I am really bothered by the coin sitting in your hand on turn 6+   Puppy Games are an awesome dev, great fresh takes on old school arcade games. Ultratron is a great Robotron 2084 knockoff. I recommend the bundle even though I'm not a fan of having to BTA for steam keys.   DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY WITH FIIIIRRE   hex   This card is currently not playable in constructed, but can be a very good card in arena. It is deck dependent, but in a shaman, paladin, or a low curve deck with lots of guys, it can be insane.  Regarding it being win-more, I don't think that is true. Just because you have minions on board does not mean you are winning. When you drop him, it allows you to instantly make favorable trades and get a ton of value. It lets you trade a 2-drop 2/3 and a 1/1 paladin token for something like a chillwind yeti. In this case you might even be behind on board, and the champion lets you surge back with all sorts of favorable trades.  If you are slightly winning, he lets you get even more value, wipe any threats they have while trading up, and secures his own safety from on board minions. If your opponent does not instantly deal with him, you will likely win.  Certainly an underrated arena card IMO.   I don't know about that   Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes might be worth checking out then   You don't think it would be incredibly rude if InXile offered up beta access to all for much cheaper than what actual backers paid the moment it came out? People would have their pitchforks ready.   If you think that $60 is too much to ask to opt into a beta, then just wait until release. For them to release the game at any less of a price would be spitting in the face of the people who are the largest fans and backed them on Kickstarter.  The game is speculated to be in the $20-30 range on release, so I don't see what the big deal is.     yeah, it was a totally innocent question too, totally not implying anything   The comment thread here literally makes me want to vomit. Could you guys try and dismiss this any harder? Some assholes jack off into this dev's phone and all you can talk about is how she probably faked the whole thing?   "Cyber Self Harm" (It weirdly exists http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25120783) as it's pretty easy to garner sympathy that way. If it is option b I don't get why she elected to do it on such a small image board, maybe it's because like I said a thread about this on /v/ was just full of people who had no idea who she was.    Could possibly be option B. How did the image board get that photo of her?    this seems to be a quest for attention    blowing it out of proportion    We can discuss it and condemn them all we went but that won't change a thing.    As a developer is listing your gender a requirement to get something Green-lighted?    To me it sounds all fishy...    she didn't have to state that she was female    I have a feeling that SJW's are going to use minimal or fake "backlash" or harassment to garner more attention to their creative endeavors    The victim complex is a million dollar industry for feminism, and you're just seeing it take root in their newest infection via gaming    With that said, I'm skeptical of this.   Fucking Shameful.  Edit: and the mods actually put misleading title on this....fuck this sub    stop condoning/dismissing the behavior    EDIT: And then I fire the catapult during their turn. Does the opponent see you mess with the board items?  no     sylvanas, thalnos, rag, ysera, leeroy   try making a whiny post on reddit about your ordeals to reignite your spark   obviously not OP   I'm pretty sure "essentially play nothing until turn 5" is a strategy that won't get you very far   God, Snow Crash is so bad. Flat characters, lots of deus ex machina, pseudo-intellectual tripe on neurolinguistics, unfunny jokes, ephebophilia - what *doesn't* this book have going for it?   thanks for alerting us to the situation, if it wasn't for your thread we all woudn't have known   Two parts pseudo intellectual masturbation, one part creepy lolita fantasy, stir well   Did they really not fix Nat Pagle?   Should you get a game-of-the-year caliber title for around the price of a cup of coffee? Yes, yes you should   play as a mage   Yikes, this scares me into thinking that the devs have no idea what they are doing  Good thing the very problematic hunter class was nerfed to oblivion   Swan Song by Robert McCammon   I might be able to sort of compete with you - same first two picks even. 11-2, got the week 14 bye going into my playoffs.  1.

It was an interesting concept and isn't a bad game per say, but when it came out all I heard was rave reviews and comparisons of this being the next Portal. I bought in, played it for a couple of hours, smirked a few times, and never went back to it.   Any comments on how the PC port is?   If you do daily quests and are competent at the game you can bust out 1-2 arenas a day. Within a month you will have a good collection, all for free.   and so is the individual card limit.   It's still 1112 cards vs. 381. 5 times the number of sets may have been misleading although true.  A lot of what you say is pretty misleading as well though. You can't simply discount manafixing, non-basics, etc as "not cards". You can't write off trash, unplayable, limited fodder in MTG without also doing it for Hearthstone.   But it's still 5 times the number of sets that hearthstone has available.   Lol, look at some MTG standard top 8s lately and you'll realize that's not quite true   Because it's popular and people like to be hip and contrarian   Because it's an aesthetic choice? Better looking is relative to you. Give me pixels over polygons any day.   Maybe it's because some people like these types of games   Be prepared to be burnt at the SJW stake!   http://fuckyeahdoom.tumblr.com/post/26695763994/burninsun-sleeps-marijuanaut-tour-2012-june   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Davies  He was on lost   Yeah I appreciate the backup, just pointing out this guy is clueless   he's taking 7 turn 2, and if you arcane intellect turn 3 he's taking 9. That leaves him at 14 and even if he SW:D's your 5/3 wurm, you still have a 4/3 ready to bash him next turn.  I agree it is deck dependent, but if it's burn mage he isn't going to be playing many guys at all and a turn 4 fireball gets the priest to 3 life, card advantage is moot at this point   I'm aware     his suggestion was actually  what? wyrm is only 1 mana if you are going to coin on turn 1 why not  Wyrm, coin, mirror image  on turn 2 wyrm mirror image  turn 3  Arcane int.      the guy i was originally replying to said:  TURN 1  Wyrm Coin  Turn 2  wyrm mirror image.  I definitely didn't say that     So from turn 3 on you just don't play anymore spells until they die?    But if he has a SWP he's killing your t1 wurm anyways. 2 SWPs ruins your day, but why would a priest even keep that hand against a mage?   Coining into 2 wurms turn 1 gives you 3 additional turn 2 damage at the cost of -1 attack to the second wurm. You would need to get in hits with the second wurm on turns 3, 4, 5, and 6 for coining on turn 2 to be more damage efficient.  TBH I think the difference between the 2 plays is REALLY small anyways so not that it makes much of a difference.   so on turn 2 you'd rather have a 4/3 and a summoning sick 2/3 than a 4/3 and a 3/3 that are both able to attack?   Interesting line, not sure if it's better to coin on turn 1 or 2. Turn 1 gives you 3 extra damage on turn 2 at the cost of a -1 attack on one of your wurms.  Keeping the wurms at 4 seems good, but assuming it's constructed and not arena, SW:D isn't that highly played anymore (or is it? seems like I've been seeing less and they aren't very good), and you are going to get SW:P'd on his turn 2 if he has it regardless.   * T1 wurm - coin - wurm  * T2 mirror entirty -  mirror entity  * T3 arcane intellect, or one of your drawn spells if it gives you a better option   Leaving you with a 5/3 and 4/3 with 4 0/2 taunts the priest is going to struggle to get through. I don't think you wait to play the second mirror entity. Maybe if he has a SW:P turn 2 to kill one of your wurms, but even then I think I'd still just jam both of them out.     It is way better than both of those cards. Assuming it's early in the draft and we're just picking best card, I'll take it over average cards like razorfen hunter, bloodsail raider, reckless rocketeer, etc   You don't use the whole card in the example though. Slime is irrelevant to the issue   If you need it explained, you get 2+ uses out of eaglehorn bow   more like 1.5 cards   It isn't a card I'd pick over anything else in arena, but it's definitely a great arena card I'd never be unhappy playing.   Magic has its own large set of problems, ranging from social retardation to smug prickish undeserved elitism   I never use "well played" unless I lost and you didn't say it yet, or in response to a "well played" from the loser.  Otherwise it feels like aggressive GGing   It is definitely a cumulative experience - the more you read, the more you want to read, and the easier it becomes. Find an author or genre you like to read and start there, but don't be afraid to branch out into new genres or experiences. Reading is the best, welcome.   ty    is a former professional poker player.  Well why didn't you say so in the first place? This makes all the difference in the world   pretty sure the prices have not updated yet   Anyone know if nat pagle is fixed   Sacrifice 75%  Beatbuddy 75%   As much as I really despise the direction Final Fantasy has taken, it's pretty unfair to compare sales of a series spinoff to one of the numbered entries.   Indie developers? Try every popular game genre ever.   Then just concede against priests and requeue - problem solved. Just because you don't find playing as or against control fun doesn't mean it should be stricken from the game.   It's one of the best cards in the game, I would just craft them. If you're totally free-to-play, you might crack 2 in packs nearly right away, or it could take you months to crack a set.   You can always find a way to scum the system. However, the playtime will certainly help more than it will hurt the case of people lying about how much they have played the game.   I think they should work on adding a filter to which scores get counted and displayed for you- things like "at least X hours of playtime in game", "at least X games owned", "at least X reviews submitted", "X% of achievements completed", etc.  You can set the default on these and have most users be fine with it, but adding the filters can only help.   yeah, that's definitely not true  	132

Usually she slept through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, "Tell me, April, who created the universe?" When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear.  "GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep. A while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Saviour," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.  "JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep. Then the teacher asked April a third question.  "What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"  And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.  This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!" The Teacher fainted.

    Every time I try to vote on something, it says "Your vote cannot be cast at this time".  Why?                                                                        The guy buying all of the stock thinks that slavery is morally wrong, but only sees one way out of it for them.  He "buys" them, then sets them free.  Tells them to head north, and gives them a compass, and a watch.                     I came to a stop, put my rig in neutral, set the brake, and ran out and saw if the dude was OK. He was fine, but the engines shit out on him, so I called 911. I was a few counties over in Shoshone county. I damned near shit a brick because a DAMNED PLANE ALMOST LANDED ON ME!  That dude scared the fucking shit out of me.  I heard a "WUNK" on my roof, so I backed off, (what the fuck was that?) then I hear the plane again, and it touches down.    HOLY SHIT!  DOWNSHIFT!  DROP THE CLUTCH, NEURAL! 911!  OH FUCK  I'M GONNA KILL THIS GUY!  OH SHIT!  I stopped 30 yards back.  Then I'm on the phone after I see if the guy is still alive.  Scary shit!  STAY NEXT TO THE PLANE!  STAY STILL!  Turns out he ran out of gas, and had to land, so he just went for the nearest highway, and he accidently tried landing on me.  After he hit my roof, he took another pass, (faster), and landed ahead.  WTF?    **EDIT:** paragraphs      Right now, shit's going real bad.  I'm about ready to be homeless, and the only thing I'll have left is what I can haul on my back, and my cat.  Unless change happens really soon, I'm going to end up homeless, and I'll be resorted to armed robbery to pay the bills.  My SIL is even leaving.  I don't know what to do, but I'm going to soon lose everything unless shit changes really fast.  The thought of doing a hostile takeover because of an emergent situation has never occurred to me, but I'm about ready to go knock over a service station.  Right now, I basically have nothing to lose, so why keep alive?                                          Except for potentially killing myself if I build it wrong, what If I do it, and set it off?  Also, how to do so safely in town?  OK, I might build 2, and torch them off, but what would happen if I got caught?  Is it worth the risk?  I wouldn't be using them as weapons, just to make a hell of a boom, (and run like my ass is on fire because nitro).               Drop trou, and fuck it in the ass.         Since tasers are LTL options, (like I as a civillian have the option of pommelling you with my knife, or turning it around and spearing you with it, and after that drawing a gun and stopping you), but if I pommeled a person to stop a threat, (Ideally I don't want to get that close if I have to use it), I would be arrested if I hit somebody in the temple and accidently killed them even if it was self-defense.  Then released because if I'm drawing a weapon and was using proper escalation of force, then no charges filed in WA state).  But what happens if a cop pulls a taser, uses it, and the guy drops dead?  Would an investigation occur?  I personally won't pull anything on anybody unless I intend on using it, and am pretty sure I might have to.         Such as lines instead of saying "Then I told him that he's clueless", they wrote something like "All y'all don't know jack shit, eh?  Fuck ya!"      Oh, and what's your thoughts to "Not yet.  I just got off of work, I'm going home to do exactly that."  I got stopped 4 days ago because my headlight was out of alignment and I was apparently blinding him when I passed.  He smiled when I said that, then it was back to business.  Now I have to figure out how to re-align my head light.      The only time I was terminated from a job, (and borderline suicidal), I used my sunglasses to hide my emotions  They couldn't tell anything was wrong since I had my eyes covered.                  Then a police officer grabs me, (one hand on my shoulder, and one hand on my right hand to restrain me).  Why did he do that?  I spun around and was about ready to deck the guy because I though somebody was going to rob me, but I stopped once I recognized that it's a cop, and not somebody going to rob/assault me.  So why did he feel the need to mildly restrain me, to risk getting punched in the face?    Once I saw it was a city officer, I stood down, but I thought it was some random dude trying to stop me from getting away from the several mortars about ready to shoot off.  He should have shouted over his bull horn, eh?  He asked me if I owned this road, and told him "no, but nobody else is using it eh?  so I'm setting off fireworks."  He stood there and watched the fireworks with me, then ran my background info, then told me not to set off fireworks in a public roadway.    Then he told me to pack up my shit and go to the parking lot if I'm intent on setting off fireworks, so I did.  He shook his head, and took off.   Ever since updating to 10051, the start menu doesn't work, and nor does Project Spartan.  I ran sfc /scannow, to try and fix it, but that didn't do anything for those two issues.            How do I fix it?  I can still launch shit with the search function, but start is completely non-functional.   Stopping people for minor traffic violations, (didn't signal, broken headlight on passenger side, and turned into the far lane) just to get a verbal warning, and when they stick their head in the rig, it's obvious that they're trying to smell drugs/alcohol, so I suspect that was the "real reason" for the stop?  Is that a thing, or am I paranoid?  No, I wasn't drinking, Just nobody was there, so I pulled into the left lane.  I got let off and basically told "don't do that", then sent on my merry way.  This just happened, if it helps.   Such as a brown bear, you make yourself bigger and charge it if you can.  The bear will likely be scared off, as it now thinks you're a threat to it  Dogs, slowly back off while not turning your back, always locking eyes with it, (if you turn and run, it will kill you).  Large cats, you stop moving, and slowly back off, never losing eye contact.  Get to safety, but slowly.  If you run, you're now the prey, and it will kill you.  Gators, RUN. If you run your ass off, they'll give up after a few meters.  Try and stare down a gator, you're not gonna have a good day.   While driving down the road, how do police decide to not stop somebody going VERY FAST (2-3 times the speed limit, running lights (reasonably safely, but emergently) , and blaring his horn and having on the 4 ways while flashing his high beams), Is it because he's on the phone to 911 and talking to dispatch as it happens "live", or some other reason?  When my wife cut her hand on a stupid-ass soup can, I was honestly faster than the ambulance, so "get in my truck and buckle up.  We're hauling ass".  After she got in my rig, I went 65 through town through 20 zones, and police actually got out of my way.    I was heading the most direct rout for the hospital that I possibly could, and had my 4 ways on and was jumping lights.  I think it was pretty damned obvious that it was an emergency, ( I normally don't drive like that,  eh?)  But they knew to get out of my way and close down intersections somehow.  Is it because I was on the phone to dispatch ( 911 ), while I was rushing to the hospital as fast as I felt safe going?    No, I didn't jump lights if it was unsafe, but if there was a gap, I did the left, right forward?  CLEAR  thing?  While I ran several lights, and wouldn't have stopped until the hospital, (then surrendered, because somebody bleeding to death on me), everybody (including several emgergency vehicles were just getting out of my way.  About half way there, I got a lead rig and a pilot rig.  How did they know that I needed a police escort when all I gave on the phone was present location, description of the vehicle, license plate number, and direction of heading?  How the fuck did the cops know not to stop me, clear the roads, and take me to the hospital?                  How does one adopt non-local vernacular?  I've adopted several sayings, and I honestly have no clue where I got them from.  I'm a native to Eastern WA, (Whitman County).  I've managed to pick up the following words and I don't know how or why:  Buggy = "shopping cart"  Y'all = "You all / you guys / you"  Eh? = "Huh? / what? / right? / yeah?"  Sup = "What's up?"  Pillock = "Dick"  Arse = "ass"  Thank god I didn't adopt "cunt", or "hoser", eh?   Sorry if this a "shit post", (whatever the hell that is), but I don't know where else to ask this.  And why don't people know what a buggy is?  I don't get it.  "shopping cart" now sounds dumb to me.      Because God doesn't trust the English in the dark, eh?               I have 2GB of RAM installed, if it matters.               To me, it's a 4 wheeled thing you shove around a store to load your shit in.  I met an Alaskan today, and he thinks it's a strange moterized vehicle that looks like a rock crawler, but designed for mud.  Around here, we call those  "rock crawlers".  He was talking about how much shit he can fit in his buggy, and I was getting confused, so I said "buggy?  you mean that thing that you do this with in stores?", (did the buggy shoving gesture).  He then tried to describe what he meant, but I still had to guess.  I had no clue what he was talking about for about 3 min, until I asked, "like a rock crawler?"   Like "g CZ52" and it goes through Google, but if I type "b CZ52", it does the same search but through bing?   If I do it, it's armed robbery and I face 10-life. If the government does it, it's tax collection, and publicly applauded.   A black hole. Because once you go black, you never come back.                  Why not?  I have it connected through FB.   Life in prison.  9a.44.050               No, it's more like this:  **"Old Atheism"**  Guy 1:  I don't believe in god.  Guy 2:  Shut up, and go along to get along.    Guy 1:  OK  ****"New Atheism"****  Guy 1:  I don't believe in god.  Guy 2:  Shut up. Go along to get along.  Guy 1:  No.  Why don't you shut up about your god?  Guy 2:  PERSECUTION!  YOU HATE GOD!  Guy 1:  No more than you hate Thor.  Guy 2:  THAT IS OF THE DEVIL!  OF COURSE I HATE THOR!!  Guy 1:  OK, no more than you hate Bigfoot.  Guy 2:  Bigfoot isn't real.  Guy 1:  Exactly.  Guy 2:  .....               In WA, I don't think I can conceal my ka-bar, (because of the "dangerous weapons" law, but in ID, I can, so long as I have an ID LCCW, or WA CPL.  I called the police, and while I can open carry basically anything I want, I can't "Furtively" carry any dangerous weapon, (except pistol since I'm licensed to do so).  So why the law difference?  Also, is it a good idea to inform, even though I don't have to?  I got in a collision back in 2012, and an officer responded.  After asking for DL/reg/ins,   I gave him all the paperwork, and also gave him my CPL, and told him that "Since I'm armed today, here is my CPL."  He just looked at it, asked me where it as, and said "cool, if you don't touch yours, I won't touch mine."  I didn't care, but I felt like I should inform the officer even if I legally don't have to.            I was formally employed as a cashier/assembler/toy sales associate/cart associate/freight unloader at Walmart, and recently left that job.  I got a new job as a landscape maintenance technician, and MY GOD, the labor is hard work!  Before I worked at Walmart, I was a car wash guy, and before that, I was a groundskeeper.  I don't remember how long it took me to adjust to manual labor, so I'm asking here.  It's Saturday, and my muscles still hurt from the work week.                                                                     Free food and free housing for the rest of his life, so why not do it?   They figure.  "Fine, want to fine us for being "anti-competitive"?  Fine by me.  I'll just "delete" the last 20 years of technological progress from the average consumer perspective."   Some people are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, as it was just there yesterday, but now it turned into a Big 5 overnight.      Just for shits and grins, I burnt a DVD, and decided to re-install.  A USB drive takes all of 20 min, (max), but from a DVD, it takes over an hour to install the OS.  MS should by default provide USB drives to install the OS, and have them fill out a form if they want a DVD, (like was done until Windows XP, with shipping CD's and including a card that if you want FDD's to write MS)  MS should transition to USB installation.  Installing W10 with a DVD is the first time I've even used that drive since 2010.               Some of them are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, because it used to be there yesterday, but it's now a Big5 over night.                Violators of the curfew order will be arrested on site. Rioters, looters, and arsonists will be shot on site.        They wouldn't march next year.      I think there was an aqua-car int he movie, but it's been about 20 years since Ive seen it, so I don't remember.  I think Kevin Costner was in it.  It came out WAY before "The Postman".                                    I tried to replace the front glass, (not very sucessfull).  I got the front glass off, but the LCD was still stuck to the screen, even after heating it up with a hair dryer.  at first, none of the buttons except for power and volUp and VolDn were working, so I took apart the phone completly, (MB, and screen/bezel assembly as one unit) and noticed that a connecter came loose on the touch screen link to the lower buttons.    I got the home, menu, and back buttons to work again, but I still can't use the touch screen at all.  It simply doesn't recognize input.  Is there a way to fix the touch screen?  It displays everything fine, but input via touch is now impossible.  Is there a connecter that I may have missed?  I would like to not spend $71 if I don't have to buy a new front screen/bezel assembly.  **EDIT:**  Well, now that I tore it apart again, and put it back together, the phone won't turn on at all.  :(  Fuck.  Now it looks like I'm going to have to buy one. :(  I'm now back to my backup phone, which is a i997 flashed with CM11 (unofficial) 4.4.4.  Do you think I EMPed it by accident? Even plugging it in, it won't signify charging at all.              The phone identifies as an i9300 in the sticker in the back of the phone, and in the ROM. However, when I boot into download mode, it shows up as an i747, and trying to flash a i9300 ROM fails. Is there a way to resolve this?   MS!  GET RID OF THE "LESS OPTIONS" IN TASK MANAGER!  It's Fucking USELESS!  I can't use it for shit!  "More Options" should be the default, (and only option for task manager).  The way it's set up now, it's little more useful than the task bar!  If I go Ctrl+Shift+Escape, I WANT THE FUCKING TASK MANAGER!  WHY DO YOU TORTURE US LIKE THIS?    The way its used now is fucking retarded and useless!  Get rid of it!  Bring the old style back!  OK, done rant now.  But seriously, whoever thought of that needs to be bitch slapped!      "Fuck the police!"  I'm not talking about spouting off at the mouth, but making his land a deadly trap to anything that moves.  Anything that intrudes is shot on site.  Now what?  They will not be negotiated with.  They have RPG-7's, and aren't afraid to use them.  Prisoners ar taken, and severely tortured on live TV before execution.            Example:  We got in WWII because of the Jewish holocaust.  No, we didn't.  We didn't even recognize them until 1943, when the war machine was starting to lose support, so it was revealed to the American public about execution camps, so we must fight the evil. The USA actually turned back Jewish refugees in 1938, because we didn't want them either.  (Source:  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267 )   We REALLY got involve in WWII because we embargoed the japs for oil, so we got struck in the territory of HI, so we declared war on them.  Then, since JP was allied with GE, they declared war on us.  Boom!  WWII.  The rest is history as we know it.  Anyhow, how do these modern propaganda stories get passed down as fact, when they are incredibly wrong, and why do people believe it, when even a modicum of research would prove it wrong?   If you aren't liberal, you're "not a true atheist". The only thing missing is worship of a deity. Oh wait, most "practicing" atheists these days do worship something. Government has taken the place of a god. So it's a secular religion for most "practitioners" of atheism. If you don't comply to the "doctrine", you will be rooted out, and banned on FB. Small minds think alike, eh? Yeah, they're "tolerant", so long as you agree with them.     Would Obama start cussing to nobody in particular while live on the air?  How far would he get before the networks cut away from him or he realized he was uttering a stream of profanities before he stopped talking and left the stage?                              My cat is an indoor cat, but a few times she has gotten outside, she doesn't even leave the property, and when I had her at my old place, (an apartment), she never left the stoop of my place.    But she swill wants outside even though she never leaves my property, (a tenth of an acre).  She even restricts herself to the front lawn when she does get out. She's not a wanderer, so why does she even want out?  When the weather's nice, I leave open a couple of windows so she can look out, but she still wants out.      It is done so nobody calls the air force to report a UFO and strange lights all over America that cause the sky to glow all night long for over 4 weeks.  (basically "Oooh, look at the pretty lights!" is what it is passed off as).  But here's the catch:  The test is really to see what a HEMP would do the CONUS, and the test is not only hailed as a "progress of mankind" or some such bullshit, but it's really a covert mission to EMP the entire USA before the fucking Russians can do it, just to take the "wind out of their sails".  Now what?   Russian hands, and Roman fingers.     	200
    Woody's channel would then be the equivalent to the sahara desert.   Is it on Netflix?   I just wanted to know, cause the show needs a little more salt in its game.   I thought you were correcting my spelling, but it was correct and I just didn't know what you were trying to convey. Good day sir.   "They just cracked inter-dimensional travel"   ???   This is a suggestion for the PKA crew to watch. Woody, in PKA 238, said he wanted to stream movies and I immediately thought of Black Mirror. WATCH EPISODE TWO, this is a tv show like 'The Twilight Zone' only it is a more modern, rated-r version. I would love you guys to give theories on what you think the second episode (the best episode) symbolizes because there is a lot a room for interpretation.  Edit: I think Kyle may have mentioned this show before on PKA. He may have already seen it so idk.   After the fiasco on PKA 238, where 98% of viewers were screaming map names at their computer screens. I have engineered a link of sorts that will resolve any future map name struggles. Your welcome.   http://www.themodernwarfare2.com/mw2/multiplayer/maps/   You know, it wouldn't be hard at all for woody to literally search 'MW2 Maps' on google.   Why? there are a bunch of tutorials on how to moon walk   Be black.   I don't know what made me laugh harder, your comment or your username.   1.~~Climb a mountain~~ 2.~~Eat a raw potato~~ 3.~~Parachute jump~~ 4.~~scuba diving~~ 5.Confirm Half-Life 3   10/10 would laugh again   I wouldn't risk it bro.    Dude, worse could have happened, trust me. Just wait about a month and no one will ever remember that you said that. It really wasn't even a scumbag thing to say in the joking atmosphere. Don't worry about it.   Good ol' anvil jokes   I cosign with this suggestion. It really was great Netflix original, very dark.   You might be my long lost twin...Hello brother.   Gotta keep in mind that they are just friends that are having a conversation, not your AP U.S History teachers.   That's really selfish dude. There are about 200,000 or so of us and I, for one, do not enjoy this topic and I DEFINITELY know that I am not alone.    WTF are you trying to articulate???   50's   What kind of dog is that?   Only problem is that these subs only have like 2,000 subscribers and max 25 people on at a given time :(   Thanks for posting this!   None of them allow you to post your own music. If they do please let me know where you post. I make Hip-Hop beats   It really is annoying :(   It seems like you get on sub-reddits like WeAreTheMusicMakers and I can't even show what I have created. Kind of frustrating to see every subreddit I encounter discourage self posting. Anyway, where can I post my music? Which sub-reddits?  Edit: I'm a Hip-Hop/Rap Music Producer      If you have 1 video and split it in to like 8 videos, but get a fourth of the views of the original on each of the 8 videos he'd still be making twice as much money.       I actually charge $25 for a basic lease. PM me if you're still interested!   Woody probably still going to do short clips, Gotta get that money.   Annnnnnd Fuck your Poll it is! Love those style of videos!  	36
 Cherylee by Gowns on spotify, second half of the song is powerful   John Frusciante's solo in Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers or the face melting solo in Alive by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam   What's your favorite short song? I'm gonna set the limit as anything 3:00 or shorter, I think that's reasonable enough to be considered short. So what're your favorites? I think the top on many people's list might be Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, but I think my favorite is Songbird by Oasis, great summer tune.   As soon as saw this as a topic I knew it'd be about these lines of the song. If I were green I would die just fits the melody. It's the same thing as misheard lyrics to me. In Pearl Jam's song Yellow Ledbetter, Eddie says, "but they don't wave" but it legitimately sounds like "potato wave". We all know it's not potato wave but it sure as hell sounds like it.   I'm in love with their ability to tell a story that can draw emotional responses from the listener   That Western Skyline or A Little Bit of Everything by Dawes   John Frusciante's cover of How Deep Is Your love, originally by the Bee Gees  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=awKM1YLAl18  This is so awesome, John is so talented, love this guy.   Wow, yes it is still on netflix, I checked, looks super intriguing, thanks.   RHCP is in my current top 5 bands, I love those dudes, I dont care if reddit thinks they've fallen off either   Helllll yes, I love early hip hop, this is gonna be awesome   If this isn't a documentary about Kevin Federline as a backup dancer than I don't wanna watch it. Nah, I'm kidding, thanks for the netflix link.   hmm I'm not familiar with any of these, that can only be good news   Hmm first 3-4 albums you say? I'll give it a whirl   Definitely looking forward to seeing the Talking Heads, I don't know much about them really, pretty obscure fellows I imagine   Hopefully this will help me understand the punk scene more! Thanks for the suggestion   AWESOME, I'm a fan of all these dudes, can't wait, thanks   They recently came to Hershey, PA. Near where I'm from, and I think some people said they put on a pretty good show. I'm not a fan of theirs myself, but I can appreciate good showmanship   I love watching documentaries, and I love music and I've watched a few rock docs. Can anyone suggest any good rock docs that discuss music from any time frame between the 50's and now? I like when they are specifically talking about genres or artists, but I wouldn't mind a documentary discussing multiple genres at once and how their fan bases felt towards each other, and how it effected the genre in all.   Ayyyyy a Marina fan, I see you kid    Spotify has allowed me to broaden my horizons so immensely, I'm very thankful for it   Gnarly amigo, that's what I like to hear   This song is so gnarly, too bad only one album was ever made.   Ahhh!!!!!!! I totally had a similar situation with Black! It was always one of my favorites, but after a certain situation it actually made tears swell in my ears and I had trouble listening to those exact lyrics.  Sage Francis from his new album. "May the bridges that we burn light the way"  And lastly Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt in combination with his music video is heavy shit. "You can have it all, this empire of dirt" as his hand is trembling and pour out a drink onto the ground.   I was in England at the time she died, and there was a bunch of hooplah, but I frankly didn't care a whole lot. I don't know why I'm not a fan, it could be because she dated a bum and she shoplifted tabloid magazines, but I guess that shouldn't affect my opinion of her as a musician, but oh well, it does.   Hmm, its easy to see the benefits. I would envision that this would grant the new player base experience in going forward with their gameplay.    Ahh it was a low budget (relatively speaking) indie film that received all great reviews as far as I know. I think the movie is awesome. Anyways... I always, for some reason thought the song "Satellite" always seemed like a narrative for the movie District 9. I dont know... something about this combination always made me think they clicked together.    Thats actually the song I had in mind when you mentioned Rise Against, debatably my top 3 song of theirs. Ok Sephiroth, I have a question, have you ever seen District 9?   I've always admired Rise Against's lyricism, good lyric choice   I really liked Copper Gone by Sage Francis and Southsiders by Atmosphere   That was awesome   Ahh gotcha, thanks man, I was trying to get a general gist of what people thought, and this makes sense to me.   Hey guys, I was just wondering  what all of your guys' favorite Frusciante songs. I dig Central, Murderers, The Mirror, Before the Beginning, Time Goes Back, and The Past Recedes. Those are my top 5 probably in no particular order.    Mariah Carey   www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DxUxSOBifo  Cherylee by Gowns    Ahh, so I guess that's why it's never brought up :P Thanks for the heads up man. I also totally dig the album, and Greenwood rips the tits off his guitar. I guess now I'll just sit and wait for my ass kicking.   Hey all, I've been browsing the music subreddit for only about a week or so and I've seen a bunch of Radiohead fans (not really a surpirse), however, most of the discussion I've seen has been about OK Computer or Kid A, deservedly so. I was just curious as to what the community thought about Pablo Honey, being there first album and all. Creep doesn't need to be mentioned, but you all probably already knew that.   One of my favorite tracks is definitely "You". Yorke's voice just incredibly shreds through the song and gives me awesome chills and I'm left amazed. I just thought I'd make this quick point.  Anyways, I was just wondering what the general feeling of this album was, cheers.   Michael Jackson, why do you call Sprite "Jesus juice?"   Keith Moon - Wanna grab a beer since we have the same birthday? And maybe we can talk about your Holiday Inn story   The first time I heard contact I was actually blown away by the build up, I thought it was Sooo good, but you're right it almost feels like the the rest of the song is anticlimactic.   Hmm and I only like the first half of Touch... Maybe RAM wasn't the best choice on second thought   Hey not a bad remix to it, you definitely did enough adjusting to "make it your own" so to speak.   I've only listened through it once so far, and it seemed like if you like Rise Against, you'll probably like this album. It didn't seem to stray too far from the norm, which is fine. I was just wondering what the community on here thought about it. Thanks.   Motherboard on Random Access Memories didn't do much for me   I agree, I think I get the message that Radiohead was trying to convey, but I wouldn't say it ruined the album. I definitely could have done without it though.   Open Happiness by a collective of artists   you're awesome   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aYiiGd3PZc t=2m2s         It can sometimes be hard to pull off a tribute song that is really as cohesive as this one. Slug did an awesome job. R.eye.P      The intro of "Stranglehold" by Ted Nugent. As soon as you hear that you know I'm in the zone and about to show you a girthy yet humble 6.4 inch dong slice   I stopped filling it out once I saw Mac miller with more votes than slug   O.A.R. Are one of my summer bands   As if I needed another reason to love Eddie.   Yep I'm not sure if it's still on there, but yeah we started watching it as a joke, then we decided to stop ha   Lost me at Avril lavigne, and made me want to kill myself at Bieber.   EDIT: just saw Bruno Mars (I'm dead)   Skalett Johansson   FIZZZ LESS'GO   The only thing I could think to hide is when my roommate and I watched the first 10 minutes "Nude Nuns with Big Guns". I could not wait to get that off my previously watched list.   Fancy - Iggy Azalea   Ahh sorry to hear that man, truly I am. It's also good that you have BB to turn to that can bring back good memories.   Bringing back the memories of listening to Breaking Ben. First heard of them playing Halo 2 and their song "Blow Me Away" was in the campaign.    Thanks fellas, I'm going to check these out ASAP   Piano Man by Billy Joel, American Pie by Don McLean, Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, and Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers   I re-watched School of Rock the other day, and it has always been one of my favorite movies from when I was growing up (come at me). I think I first watched it when I was in middle school. I can still remember that scene where "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black is basically teaching his students everything about the History of Rock, and what a huge impact this scene had on me the first time I watched it. This was the first moment I can remember really getting into music, and it was because of this scene. With Freddy watching live performances of the The Who's Keith Moon, and Jack Black filling the blackboard with hundreds of bands and connecting their genres and influences. It was just incredible to me. So after re-watching it, I wanted to know some of the best live/historic performances ever to watch. I want to see how the legends played and the iconic moments they had. THANKS :)   Teams should always be bigger than the players in any sport. There are usually BIG problems that arise when players think they are bigger than the team.   Well so much for being coy. I reciprocate the feelings, what can I say.   Put your ear down to the earth and listen for it. Put your heart into it, and ye shall find what your heart desires!   you're right, as much as it pains me, gotta take it down.   Stop thinking of it as a losing streak. Each game is independent of one another. So try to just put past losses behind you and focus on the next game, to avoid going on tilt     No one pays them. It's a video game.   Anyone else think that it would be nicer if they played the replays a bit slower so the pros have enough time to speak about the fight. A lot of time the fights are too fast paced and some of the strategy and analysis is left out. Especially in crucial fights when there are so any moving parts, it'd be nice to absorb as much info as possible.   Somebody is on Fantasy tilt   Looking at the champs compared to the actor. Christian Bale seems the most believable.   Ahh okay, I would think of a champ with no cc. Multiple abilities that can cc usually help define a support champ as well as their ability to shield or heal you. Master yi offers no cc and will steal your cs without protecting you. An adc also come to mind that doesn't really support but helps kill, is Lucian. Zed also doesn't seem to offer too much into the role. And I'm not sure about Vlad or not.   You mean the most viable, nonpopular pick? Or do you literally want the worst champion that could ever try and support?   I think it's the fact that no team is really head and shoulder above the other teams. So confidence in ending games is an issue. It took TSM so long to close out that game.   Xpecial and Cop on the analysts desk, stick knives in my ears plsssss   Cosplay still sucks.   Who's this guy at the announcer's desk???? WTF   Why did he make out with Meachum? Can anyone explain that scene?   Actually really helpful and concise. I've been wanting to learn Elise as well, but was kind of discouraged by her two forms. I don't like champs with 2 forms because I have a tough time judging each forms power. Thanks.   So basically this post is about how EU LCS makes me really hard, but ends up being anti-climactic. Reflects my last 3 days fairly accurately.   Not sure if a parody or not. 0(o.o)0   If reddit didn't have a "remember me" system when logging into the site, you'd be screwed.   really? :( first time I've seen it. It's original to me. Uh-oh philosophical debate incoming.    CLASSIC MIX-UP   I'm confused. Explain pls.   Hmmmm Interesting.   Pros: Rewards team for defending wards ( as you stated)    Cons:Would make the pink slightly stronger (not sure if a noticeable difference) [Not sure if this is even a con]  Hmm. It's actually a pretty fresh and original idea. Good Work. Wouldn't mind seeing it implemented. Not sure if it will, but I like it nonetheless.   Dodging is the last good defense against trolls, I say lower the LP penalty, even though i'll never reach that division. I approve of the ideology behind it.   Can you make a tutorial video pls? I think the community would be grateful. 12/10 on improvements, would buy it from a 3am infomercial on comedy central  	91
 Cute overload.   I love that you call him "The Chew".  My friends dog looks nothing like Chewbacca, but can make the Chewbacca noise on command.  It. Is. AWESOME.   He is beautiful!  And his face looks so wise. :)   I do wish that I had seen this about 3 month ago.  I really wanted to live in that direction.  Alas, too late!   Cool!  And I also hope that there are some LA firms there.  I'll try to check it out if I can get over there after word, and will spread the word among the grad students!   Hey lady_elayne!  Nice to know I'm not alone!  You should PM me and tell me ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL about your Saddlebreds!  I'm a Morgan girl myself, but I've ridden and shown my share of Saddlebreds and Hackneys as well.   Thank you!  And no, you didn't sound too "judge-y". :)    Sorry to confuse, captainstag!  And you're right, just like anything (even riding in general) it can be done well and to the advantage of the horse, or poorly to the ultimate disadvantage of the horse.   Ah I see.  Since I'm a Morgan person, I'm more on the "fewer aids" side of the camp too.  And yes, the clump of dirt!  Always a big hit with my horse too.  But ohhhhh the dreaded baby powder bottle...all you have to do is pick it up!  He clearly thinks it's going to eat him. XD   Oh man, my horse LOVES the fire extinguisher -- he thinks it's hilarious. :)  And to answer your question, I show Morgans.  What do you mean when you say that Arabs are one of the more natural breeds?  Do you mean for saddleseat?  Because my view was always that the Arabs were the most unnatural saddleseat horses, simply because their motion (historically) was to move with lower action and a sweeping stride to cross desert sands efficiently, not to step high and raise the knees.  I know that they are now breeding for the bend at the knee, but I don't know how true it is to the breed's origins.  Your opinions?   I'd love to know what you do to your soil to get those nice onions!  We have onions, but they are always small and never get to be the nice, large onions we would like.  Doesn't matter which variety we try, they are always puny.   Well, the equitation is completely different - so comparing a saddleseat rider to a hunter/jumper rider is like comparing apples and oranges.  To effectively ride our horses we need to sit back, legs away from our horse's sides, hands elevated.  Saddleseat equitation should look like this: http://www.discoverhorses.com/saddle-seat-equitation.html  Of course, there are people out there that ride like this (ick):http://www.uphaonline.com/images/charming.jpg  If course, the same goes for any discipline. I founded and formed an equestrian team at my college and was the only non-jumper person.  I was SHOCKED at the lack of ability in most of the riders.  So many of them were pushed to jump before they really had developed a seat.  I think this is why jumping is seen as "dangerous", simply because people haven't really learned how to "sit" yet.  And yes, I've done LOTs of cross-training.  My mare transitioned to huntseat years ago, so for the past several years I've been riding both Saddleseat and Huntseat, and I've had to develop two different forms of equitation depending on which horse I'm riding.  I've also done hunter/jumper stuff in college, some dressage, and LOTS of driving.  I think everyone should take a "vacation" from their discipline and try something else for a few months!  It's so helpful.    You can judge my equitation for yourself if you like, I'm by no means an "equitation rider" and was never trained as one, but this is how I sit when I ride huntseat.  http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg   I can't follow you captainstag.  What about horses that wear Easyboots?  Do you think that horses shouldn't wear shoes at all?  Show horses' longer feet and weighted shoes cause no ill effects.  Many show horses compete into their 20's and are completely sound.  I wish I had a picture of my horse's feet -- they're really not that much longer than your average horse.  I do think that the TWHs stress out their horse's joints in the "big lick" division.  Those shoes are huge, heavy, and throw the entire stance of the horse off.  AND they ride two year olds that way!  Those horses are too often crippled before they hit 10.  So sad.   No, he only wears it in the summer, and that's only on days leading up to a show.  Also, it's it really hot we just leave it off.     Hey FlameGirl!  I'll go through these one by one:  1) You can do some things to encourage head and neck position, but most of all the horse has to be built for it.  My horse is not, that is is why he because a hunter and not a saddleseat-type horse.  However, assuming the horse is upheaded to begin with, the upheadedness and head carriage come from a) building muscle and b) collection.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Dumb jockeys are used, taking the place of a rider when a horse isn't being ridden.  They help teach a horse the proper "frame" to be in.  When we ride, our hands are elevated to meet the elevation of our horse's head and neck.  While riding, you can bump and tickle your snaffle bit to ask the horse to keep his head up.  Of course, none of this is possible without good impulsion from the hind end.  When a horse pushes off its hind end, it elevates its front end.  There are plenty of horse that go around the ring with their head down because they are not collected and pushing off the hind!    2) I don't know much about rollkur.  I've never seen it used outside of dressage. :/  3) The rider sitting farther back on the horse does not have any ill effects on the horse's back.  Morgans, Saddlebreds, etc. have a center of gravity that is in the middle of their back (they are built in an upright fashion) as opposed to a thoroughbred or quarter horse whose center of gravity is over the shoulders.  The saddles are designed to sit in the middle of the horse's back and the flaps are cut back to free up the horse's shoulders and not impede their movement.  4) Whips are used pretty much like they are in any other discipline I suppose.  Lots of riders show without whips.  I rarely use them, even at home when training.  Sometimes they are carried as a "prop", especially in equitation classes, and I carry one in the ring sometimes because my horse tends to focus and listen better if I'm holding it.  Otherwise, it's just an aid, as it is with anything else.  5)  Many Saddlebreds and Hackneys have had their tail "set".  In other words, a muscle in the underside of the tail has been cut to allow the tail to stretch up and bend over at the top.  Some people think that the tail bone is broken, which is not the case (and would be awful!).  My horse is a Morgan, so this type of procedure is illegal for our breed.  He does, however, wear a bustle in his stall to encourage an "arched" tail carriage.  Desired Morgan tail carriage looks like this: http://www.playmorfarm.com/Play_mor_farms_stallions/stallion_images/centerpiece-thumb-2010-2.jpg  Desired Saddlebred tail carriage looks like this: http://www.goinggaited.com/Born_Contender_al_12-4-06.jpg  Feel free to ask follow up questions!   The topics that always come up with "abuse" in the saddleseat world generally has to do with several things: shoeing, soring, and training aids.  1) Saddleseat horses wear weighted shoes, and their hooves are grown out longer than, say, a thoroughbred's hooves.  Many people see this as strange because their horses don't have feet like this, and thing that a) the shoes are heavy and hurt the horse and that b) the hooves lose the proper angle when they are grown out and it is detrimental to the horse's legs.  The shoes are, in actuality, quite light.  We have to realize that we're dealing with a 1000 lb animal, and the shoes weigh a matter of ounces.  Also, when the hooves are grown out longer, proper angles HAVE to be maintained for the horse to be sound and happy, so it's actually very important to keep the angles correct.  Of course there are crappy farriers out there, but that can happen to any horse of any breed/discipline.  It is also important to point out that hoof length and shoe length are strictly regulated -- every time I leave the ring after a class there is a steward there measuring my horse's hooves, making sure we are within the regulations.   2) People often think that Saddlebreds, Morgans, National Show Horses, etc. are "sored" in the fashion that some Tennessee Walking Horses are.  In the TWH world, some trainers (not all) apply chemicals to the legs of the horses that burn or cause pain, causing the horse to lift its legs high to try and get away from the sensation.  It's abusive, but it does work, and the reason it works for TWHs is that they are gaited (meaning they perform a running walk) and do not perform a trot.  A sored horse will look lame at the trot (because they are).  Therefore, soring for trotting breeds is irrational.  Even a Saddlebred that can perform the two extra "gaited horse" gaits (the slow-gait and rack) still have to trot in the show ring, and a sored horse would stick out like, well, a sore thumb.  I do not condone what is done to the Walking Horses, and will never be about to understand how the owners and riders of these horses can put their horses through this and still say they love them.    3) Training aids used in the saddleseat world are things like stretchies and chains.  Stretchies are simply a length of rubber surgical tubing that is connected between the horses front legs to provide resistance.  They look like this: http://i.imgur.com/vpc0W.jpg.  Have you done this at the gym? http://www.health.com/health/static/hw/media/medical/hw/h9991377_001_02.jpg  It works the same way, building up the chest and shoulder muscles of the horse -- this can create a higher step through improving muscle tone.  Some horses, like my horse, don't use them -- they take short steps to avoid them, basically looking at me and saying "yeah...whatever". :)  As for chains, they are places like bracelets around the horse's ankles, and again, encourage a higher step.  The combination of a bit of weight (think ankle weights) plus the looseness of the chain (the chain flings forward when the horse trots, and carries the foot a bit with it, creating a higher, more open step).  Here is a picture of a horse trotting wearing chains.  You can see how the chain is flinging forward on her hind leg http://morganshowcase.com/Listing.php?HorseName=Wonderful%20Tonight Page=Photo Order=4.  Some folks think that these chains are exceptionally heavy, but really, they're just chains.  Perhaps like one you'd lock up your bike with.  Kids put them on their feet at horse shows and pretend to be "show horses" all the time.  There is also the misconception that the chains bang onto the horses feet causing as "soring" effect.  Again, soring a trotting horse doesn't work, and moreover this is not an effect of using chains.  Some chains come coated, padded, or are wrapped to prevent any sort of injury from occurring, and many horses get worked with their legs wrapped and boots on.  An added bonus of riding a horse wearing chains is that they jingle, and it's a good exercise for riders to listen to the rhythm of the chains to determine their horse's stride, cadence, and speed.  Wowzers, that got long!  Thanks for your questions CaptainCorpsie!   Hello fellow Reddit equestrians!  I have been constantly seeing forum after forum of people blogging, posting, and ranting about "show horse abuse" in all disciplines, and one that always arises are the Saddleseat horses.  I read the comments, I look at the examples, and generally people who make negative comments are doing so because they're not sure what the discipline is all about, and don't understand the training, riding, and showing of these horses.    Also, many people don't know what Saddleseat is at all, which is understandable since it's sort of a small world compared to the western and hunter circuits.  So here I am, a saddleseat rider putting myself out there.  AMA!!!   You're welcome!   Well, marathons ARE very impressive! :D  So yes, maybe you do have HMS, but isn't it great that someone could basically throw you off a building?  I have video of me getting thrown very hard off of a horse and when I hit the ground, I bounce.   aaaaaaaaaand that looks like me.   I was, and still am, that girl.   Some people with HMS can certainly still run, it's just not one of the things I'm able to do.  I wouldn't rush into the doctor, but next time you go in for a check up you might want to mention it.  They may look at you right there, or if you like, you could have them refer you to a rhumatologist (that's who diagnosed me).    The back pain may be unrelated, as many people have back pain, but the sprains and dislocations could be a sign of HMS.  Have you ever broken a bone?  I tend to sprain/dislocate in situations where other people may break (falling off horses, having a horse fall on top of me, etc.).  I wonder if you are the same.  Also, it's AWESOME that you compete in marathons -- something I would love to be able to do!   Fortunately, I do not have the life-shortening form of Ehlers.  The rarer forms are quite debilitating and deadly.  And yes, I have very soft and stretchy skin.  I have a huge wenis! http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wenis   I can and I do!  I can't do some things -- like if I do pushups I basically dislocate my shoulders, but I do squats, flys, presses, etc.  It actually helps to do some strength training because it builds up muscle around the joints which helps them stabilize.   I'm worried about having kids for this very reason, and also because I'm afraid I'll pass on the HMS to my children.  I score a 7, so we're pretty close in the regard.  What exactly happened when you were pregnant?   I can't tell you what the difference is, and there is a recent study that shows they aren't different at all.  There are several types of Ehlers Danlos, and hypermobility is one of the types.  I do have the elastic skin, and I break blood vessels and veins all the time.  I bruise like a ripe peach too, so I never know what exactly to call what I have.  I just stick with calling it "hypermobility".     Oh yes, it is ALL about the impact.  The elliptical machine at the gym and I are BFFs.   The best way to be!  Now go freak out all of your friends!!!   I have been diagnosed by a doctor.  I was diagnosed when I was about 13 or 14.   Those are definitely the two camps that people split into!  Typically, people who are into medicine are in the "ooooOOOOOoooo" camp and most other people are in the "OH GOD MAKE IT STOP" camp.  My boyfriend is used to it, but I think it still freaks him out on occasion -- especially the hands.  I don't demonstrate very often, and I do think there is something to be said for the theory that demonstrating makes things go bad faster.  You keep stretching and stretching every time you do it, so at the very least, you're not making things any better.  But yeah, I do it in my sleep, and there are also things I do that I figured were normal, and apparently aren't.  I scared the crap out of a yoga instructor once. :)  As for the running vs. biking, for me it's definitely not an issue of fitness.  I work out and my recovery time is amazing, but once I start to run, all kinds of shit starts to go down.  Basically, when I run and my body is subjected to the impact of the running motion, my legs can't hold themselves together.  So then my muscles try to compensate for the loose joints and overtax *themselves* and then my heart begins to work overtime trying to get blood and oxygen to the muscles.  My doctor told me to not take up regular running, as it may overtax my heart.    One other idea is to go the the Red Stag Supperclub on Tuesdays, which is their "Cheap Date Night".  Two entrees, a bottle of wine, and two desserts for $32, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  A nicer place where you could dress up a bit and make an occasion out of it.  Call ahead for reservations though, the deal is very popular!   I went into the doctor thinking I had juvenile arthritis.  When she found no sign of that, she started putting me through flexibility tests and basically tied me into a knot on her exam table.  She got it right on the nose that it was HMS, but other doctors thought it was just "growing pains" even though I hadn't grown in years, or didn't have an explanation.  Not many docs I've meant know about it, and so I educate every medical student I run into about HMS!  I sat next to one on the plane and we started talking about it -- he had just studied it in class and was fascinated that he was sitting next to a living embodiment of his textbook!     I found out about the name ON REDDIT!  Hooray for Reddit!  And yes, you are not alone. :D   Thanks for pointing out that this is serious, dizzysparrow.  While it is entertaining, there is quite a bit of pain associated with it.  I partially dislocate things all the time -- they often pop back in on their own shortly after, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.   I've also sprained my left ankle 18 times, usually just by walking down the sidewalk, and my right 13 times.  This to me is "normal".    As for how it effects my daily life, it depends.  I cannot hold a pen for very long, so I take all notes on my laptop when I'm in classes.  Winter is the hardest -- my hands and legs stiffen up and I have problems holding onto things and moving my fingers.  I was in a drawing class this winter where I had to hold a pen for hours.  I would have to come home at night and use hot packs on my hands to ease the pain.  Of course there is the obvious -- I can't run, so fun co-ed sports are out (mostly) and I have to invest in a gym membership to stay fit since I can't just go running (though I do bike in the summer).  I believe that the worst thing about HMS is that people can't tell you have it, and therefore can't understand why you hurt or think you are "whiny".  If you looked at me walking down the street, I look no different than most people aside from a slight limp I sometimes have.  You cannot always see pain.   ZOMG BENDY ZOMBIES!!!   Interesting to know.  I read that myopia can be related, so I figure that it could be a lack of strength in the eye tissues causing it, but since they're not sure what causes visual snow, who knows?   I am really good at goofing-off wrestling!  Someone thinks they have me pinned and then BAM!, I'm bent in half backwards giving them an epic wedgie.   It may, or you may just be flexible.  Do you have the associated chronic pain?  Or are you just delightfully bendy?   My pain did not subside when I finished growing that I can remember, but my pain also got worse when I was 13 or 14.  I stopped growing when I was 11, so I hadn't even hit puberty yet.  I'm really not sure how your son will be effected, but my doctor believes that as my body naturally tightens up with age (the way normal people become "stiff" with old age), I will simply become more normal and the pain will subside.    It's interesting to hear about your son's hamstrings.  Mine are also incredibly tight -- I can't even touch my toes despite being so flexible, but I've never had any physical therapy done to loosen them up, or heard of any positive reason to do so, but I sure hope it is helping your son.  As for things like sports, let your son play!  I'm not sure where you stand on this, but don' let his EDS hold him back.  I was a three sport athlete in high school (before I was told to stop running) and had no ill effects.  I am currently an internationally competing equestrian, and I can tell you that horseback riding is great exercise for EDS kids.  Balance, muscle tone, and cardio all without the impact of running.  It is something I can do with few problems.  Tell your son to hang in there and use ice/hot packs when the going gets tough.  If you have any other coping questions let me know!   Here are some photos for you all.  I can't take my two favorite poses because that would require another person (me bending in half backwards touching my toes to my forehead and me popping my shoulder blades out like a spiny dinosaur), but maybe I can get them later today.  Me bending my fingers backward (no this does not hurt) http://i.imgur.com/51PjQ.jpg  My fingers bending by themselves (without me pushing them back).  I can hold a tennis ball this way!  http://i.imgur.com/y5sc6.jpg  How I type.  Palms stay flat on the laptop, and only my fingers move: http://i.imgur.com/RLVPL.jpg  Verification: http://i.imgur.com/HkD8e.jpg     From your description it sounds like she may, though I have no business diagnosing people.  Does she have chronic pain?  Aches in her joints and muscles?  It is possible to have hypermobility without the pain -- my mom has it as well (it is genetic) but can run and do things I can't do.  My 63-year old mom can outrun me!    Of course, if she does gymnastics, yoga, pilates, or other "stretching" forms of exercise, it could simply be from that.  You can "become" a bit hypermobile through certain exercises.   Well, if you're referring to sexual positions (which I'm guessing you are), it IS rather beneficial.  You can basically put any part of my body anywhere you like.    On a more serious note though, there can be complications with pregnancy, and this condition is genetic, so he and I both have some concerns about having kids, if we ever choose to.  I can't say I would want my future children to go what I've been through.      Huzzah!  Don't let the haters get you down, man.   Haha!  Now that I'm sitting here at my desk trying it out, I would say that yes, it is rather easy.   I like you too kaizerfloyd!     I have always been a bendy individual, but chronic pain in high school sent me to the rheumatologist to figure out what was going on with my body. Turns out I have hypermobility syndrome, sometimes called benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) and, more recently, believed to be the same as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_joint_hypermobility_syndrome#Hypermobility_syndrome.  I also have visual snow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow) but I'm not sure if there is any correlation between the two, since little research on visual snow has been done.  I sprain all the time, I type like a freak (according to my boyfriend), I sleep in positions that look like I've been in a horrible accident, and I can't run (my legs can't handle it), but I do live an active and joyful life despite my rebellious body! AMA!  Edit: pictures have been taken and are linked below!   Well, he has a son...so too late!  Also, from what I have seen/heard, he is a FANTASTIC father.

AMA!  (pictures to come)   *hugs fellow Artie-loving Redditor*   Whoever made this, bless you for including Artie - The Strongest Man in the World.   Mine looks almost identical too, but probably larger from what I can see in the photo.  He is springer spaniel/golden retriever.  http://imgur.com/F8o6g  Maybe the postman's dog was a golden?     When I was a little kid I thought that the Colonel Sanders logo was a chicken nugget with a face and tie.    I second what amaltheas2 has said.  As another horse owner/rider/competitor of many years, stick to riding lessons, and lease a horse before you buy.  If you are going to eventually buy a horse for your children, make sure you have a professional trainer you know and trust try out the horse for you, and also have your kids try out the horse to make sure it is suitable for them and their riding abilities.  Also, even if your kids are small DO NOT buy them a pony.  Ponies are smart, quick, and sometimes rather mean.  Even though they seem more intimidating because they are larger, get an older horse for your children instead.  It may be a longer way to fall off, but they will most likely fall off much less often.  Be safe and good luck!      I've always thought royal blue looked great on lighter, redder bays, but I'm not sure what colors they have.  I'm sure she'll look great in any color!   1: Awesome coloring job.  2: You are some serious eye candy (assuming you're the guy in the photo).  	56
 yes? your point being?   merely asking for proof of god, nothing more. should be simple enough, no?   no, i have seen no proof of god, until such proof exists, there is no god. pretty simple. science is all based on proof. show me proof and i will believe. until then. there is no god.   and there's the actual bible that treats women like property.   http://imgur.com/DStRYfh   yes, and comics are proof that  mutants exist.    oh we dont, we're still waiting for people to prove that god exists. so far, nothing.   please see - ALL the Crusades  also see - World War II re: Germans and Jews  aaaaaaaaaaaaaand we're done    an entire body of medical professionals would disagree with you about both sexuality and gender. and given a choice between the two, i'll go with medicine. religion isnt logical in the slightest. the belief in people coming back from the dead, or walking on water would require too much of a suspension of common sense. the bible isnt meant to be literal, there are too many contradictions. and unless you're reading it in its original aramaic and greek, you're not really getting the true context   do you really want me to start listing out all the so called christians who have been caught doing something unchristian? i mean there's an entire 2000 year  history of JUST the catholic church.   you know what, if more people had your attitude, i'd be a really happy trans girl   misguided, maybe, but not inherently bad   it'll open in an incognito window   amen   you should see my inbox. yeeesh. it's always the fundies. YOU WILL BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY, but i will pray for your eternal soul.  uhhhh.... ok, thanks?   i have, that's how i became an atheist   only pointing out the hypocrites who preach family values who are then caught doing something they shouldnt be doing, like all the priests diddling little alter boys beneath their robes.   were there atheist pedophiles? i'm sure there were, but they didnt have organized religion to hide behind so that they could continue doing it.   the bible is a fairy tale, and the sooner more people see that, the better off we will all be. people created god in their own image, and people can kill him too.  you will not accept homosexuality because of the bible? a book that says the sun is fixed in the sky? and that the moon is a light source?   i used to think the way you did, i grew up christian, and then i studied the bible and i saw the error of my ways and became an atheist.  When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. - 1 Corinthians 13:11   religion = choice  my sexuality and/or gender = not choice  when you use religion to criticize my sexuality and/or gender, then you are choosing to do so. because you could just as easily choose not to. therefore, you are in the wrong. pretty dang simple.   you didnt just compare homosexuality to pedophilia and torturing people at the stake, did you? christianity is a lifestyle choice, my sexuality and gender arent. my life isnt a "theory", i live it every day. and i take offense to anyone who criticizes it because of something somebody passed down thru oral tradition from the Bronze Age. society has evolved way past the need for religion. the faster it dies, the better off all of us will be.    i'd love to see a few examples of atheist "family values" hypocrisy if you could post a few articles. i'd do the same with the hypocritical christians, but even if i limited myself to the scandals that came out this year, i'd run out of space pretty quick.   well, first off, i have to point out that if anyone is against homosexuality/ non male/female marriages, then they are a bigot, even if they couch their arguments with the cloak of religion. religion is a choice, my sexuality isnt. so people can choose NOT to be a bigot, because there are plenty of christians who accept homosexuality for what it is, part of every day life.   http://imgur.com/DStRYfh   look at how many supposedly "good christian" people who preach their "good christian" values end up getting caught for doing something inappropriate which go against said "good christian" values.  and again, the only thing atheists argue for is that there arent any gods. that's pretty much it. everything else about how to live your life is completely up to you, good OR bad.   but atheists dont go around preaching family values explicitly laid down for them in a holy book.   it's pulled directly from the summary.   the title is pulled directly from the summary   jeez, it's like you become a pariah. i told a cousin that when i came out, i picked as an example of the kind of girl i wanted to be look wise (we have the same body type) and the first thing she says to me is "Look, i'm a REAL girl, ok? 100% female"  urgh.  i have to add that she's since become one of my biggest allies, because the REST of the fam fam hasnt come around yet.   actually, it was pulled from the summary   yes, and which is why we say that you can discuss YOUR OWN DOSE as well as to state that we ARENT doctors.  every single one of us knows somebody who self-meds. some do because they didnt want to spend one more day as a gender they werent. some of us just had no access to a doctor who would prescribe them hormones.   we are NOT against self-medding. we just ask that people not give out advice as if there were only one dose for everybody. there isnt. i'm not on spiro, or progesterone, only estrogen shots. one of my girlfriends is on shots too, but she takes them every week as opposed to every two weeks like me. my other partner is on spiro, estrogen, and progesterone, and she might add avodart to her regimen.  the mods of /r/asktransgender care about the community, which is why we became mods in the first place.     yeah, they WERE rewritten as of Jan this year. i totes WAS going off the old rules. still stands tho. we're not doctors. we cant be going around giving out medical advice. we CAN discuss what OUR dosages are, and point out that there isnt a "standard" dose for everybody.     no one standard dose, i should have said. i stand corrected. i was just trying to make the point that you cant just go around telling people that they should just take a certain dose of certain types of pills    i'm 42, came out when i was 39, and yes, i feel like i'm still in my teens/20's. totes should have come out earlier. but i cant go back and change the past, i dunno if i would, i like the way my life turned out, i've had a blast and i continue to have fun.  i guess it's all in how you perceive it.    i'm not a doctor, there is no such thing as a "standard dose" which part about those two things dont make sense? not everyone reacts to hormones in the same way, which is why we should ALWAYS see a doctor first.  yes, not all of us have access to a doctor. which is why we allow discussions about dosing AS LONG AS WE DONT SUGGEST THAT IT IS WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO.  i have two other trans girls living with me, and we are ALL on different prescriptions. it is the height of arrogance to assume that you know what the other person's correct dosage should be.       and we choose to abide by those rules. we arent doctors. and even if we were, the people asking for advice to DIY arent our patients. and even if they were, we STILL couldnt prescribe them meds because we'd have to do a full check up first.  yes, there are those of us who DIY, but it should be the absolute last resort.  i'm sorry you seem to disagree, but we have a responsibility as mods to the trans community and to the reddit community as a whole to abide by the rules the admins have set down.   we've tried to keep everybody informed with the changes we've made AND we've asked for suggestions. so to say we've got "secret rules" is simply not true.   as per the rules of Reddit  7) The Website is not a forum for the exchange of medical information, advice or the promotion of self-destructive behavior (e.g., eating disorders, suicide).

Martin Luther  King was a serial adulterer, the FBIs monitoring of King  make up much of what we now know about the mans personal life. King had engaged in so many extramarital affairs that his wife, Coretta Scott King, had reportedly become disillusioned with their marriage.  Kings right-hand man, Ralph Abernathy, wrote in his 1989 autobiography that the staff all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.  Billy Graham? Homophobic bigot. He considered homosexual behavior to be a "sinister form of perversion," a lifestyle choice that will lead gays to personal ruin. When a young woman wrote him about her sexual love for another woman in 1974, the evangelist replied with a threat: homosexual perverts will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. "Your affection for another of your own sex is misdirected and will be judged by God's holy standards," he answered.  Mahatma Gandhi? He had unusual personal practices (which included, alongside his famed chastity, sleeping naked next to nubile, naked women to test his restraint.) The pre-independence prime minister of the Indian state of Travancore called him, "a most dangerous, semi-repressed sex maniac"     more like BANG! "i was forced to shoot him because he was wielding something in his hand in a threatening manner and i feared for my life."   with raw story, none, however, the study that it is linked to is.   so what the hella you saying?  *evil grin   how hard is it to define?  WAS IT A SATISFYING SEXUAL EXPERIENCE?  [ ] yes  [ ] no  [ ] HOLY CRAP GIMME MORE   dont forget greenland   that's a really good question. i only knew i had switched over when i got gendered female over the phone while talking to a bank rep. first i cracked the biggest smile ever, but then i stopped and asked myself when the heck i switched over, because the only thing i consciously did was to stop resonating. the pitch i must have unconsciously raised over time.    i dont think anybody here is under any illusions that bernie will win the nomination. what he's doing is shifting the conversation and the attitudes of the democrats to the left, where they should be. if the tea party shows us where the hard right is, then bernie shows us where the hard left is.   "...and a child shall lead them"  \- Isaiah 11:6  (totally taken out of context, but if the christians can do it, so can i)   good god, /u/mepper, that website is hella annoying   keep it civil   keep it civil   i've known people who decide not to transition after psychotherapy. i've known one trans person who detransitioned after ten years. i've known somebody who detransitioned, only to re-transition after two years. transition is pretty personal, and everybody's journey is unique.   i've known people who decide not to transition after psychotherapy. i've known one trans person who detransitioned after ten years. i've known somebody who detransitioned, only to re-transition after two years. transition is pretty personal, and everybody's journey is unique.   why, what's wrong with it?   but.....    nbsp;  ^^tablets nbsp;ARE nbsp;computers.....   yes, but i understand the urge when you feel that someone is wrong on the internet  https://xkcd.com/386/   hey there, we try to keep things civil, so this comment was a little on the aggressive side. we get enough grief that we dont need to add to it in this sub. if you disagree with the point of view, that's fine, but try and word it in a more constructive manner?   thanks  The Mod Poodle   Warren 2016   before i came out, i crossdressed pretty much only to fap too. i was turned on by wearing all the sexy lingerie. then i decided to go out en femme one halloween, i found the frilliest outfit to wear, and i was TERRIFIED of going out like that because i was scared i was going to have a raging boner the whole time thru. once i walked thru that door(took me about half an hour to work up the courage), i was just HAPPY to be dressed as a girl. i loved the feeling of the air swishing past my thighs.   and once i started hrt, even the morning wood went away. i still love dressing up in sexy lingerie, but only because it makes me feel super sexy. i blame testosterone poisoning, "here, let me take a simple situation AND SEXUALIZE IT TO THE MAX"  seriously, if you're a girl, fuck testoerone. (for the guys, carry on)   i know you can use quotes in video submissions, i gotta ask the mods if i can do that in articles without the headline if it's misleading. that's a really good point, thank you   yes, earlier   it has a link to the actual study   good point, thank you for your reply.   not in the comments   exactly   look, 90% marginal rate will never happen, knowing bernie tho, he really means it. also knowing bernie, should he become president, he would also compromise so that he'd settle for a marginal tax around 40%  better to ask for the moon than to start somewhere around 50%.   something something party of good christian family values   yeah, but rules say i cant change the title   cant change the title, remember?   no fucking choice, it's the fucking rules   this is /r/politics, i gotta go with the actual title of the article   But in the rush  to publish everything, how do you guard against fraud? i ask because of the recent controversy over the raw data in the study that showed that gay canvassers swayed voters opinions in a lasting way.  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/science/maligned-study-on-gay-marriage-is-shaking-trust.html?partner=socialflow smid=tw-nytimes _r=1  *edit: another article about false and retracted studies  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/opinion/whats-behind-big-science-frauds.html   a guardian article that referenced the study AND quoted the researchers that collated almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years.  so yeah, it's a valid news article.   josh needs to go for treatment, his parents need to be taken to task, the girls he molested need help too.    josh duggar is not a pedophile, he's a sexual abuser. big difference. and his parents are the most at fault here because they covered it up, didnt get him the help he needed, and blamed the girls because of their fucked up version of christianity that they subscribe to.   see Bobby Jindal   yes   missed it by THAT  much   they've tried to change the mind to fit the body, and they've shown that it just doesnt work. so that's why the recommended course of treatment for people diagnosed with gender dysphoria is to transition.  http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11814300  so just like how homosexuality was deemed to be not a harmful disorder, so too with being transgender. it is far easier to change the body than to change the mind.     uhh, if the Duggars are liberal, i sure as heck dont want to see what they consider a true conservative   they can keep on keeping on, their numbers will keep on shrinking right along with that attitude.   the Schadenfreude is overwhelming   some are, what this brings up is the whole "Nature" vs "Nurture" argument   http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/19/are-we-products-of-nature-or-nuture-science-answers-age-old-question  science says that it's 50/50   cuz it's yours, silly.   as a fellow gay transwoman, i have only been able to achieve penetration with help from viagra. the dysphoria down there is just too dang high. has been since the beginning.  on a side note:- arent girl orgasms WAY better than boy orgasms? like holyshitballs batman.   right?   hey, i've removed your comment because of the "fucking exclusive dude club" bit. we try to be inclusive here, and that also means NOT picking on the people who DO identify with the binary.  if you'd like to repost the comment with something less judgemental like "no, i didnt want into the dude club," it'd be better.   *sigh*  i'm sorry, i'm a li'l jumpy, i spent too long replying to the anti-abortionists in this thread. a woman should have a choice, dammit, i just wish people could see that. i'm pro-life, i think we ALL are, i just believe that abortion should be the last resort, but i DO believe that the choice should ultimately belong to the woman whose child it is.   please see  "if you cannot force a person to have a blood transfusion even if it will save their life, if you cannot harvest viable organs from dead people unless they consented prior, then you cannot force women to NOT have an abortion. case closed."   tell me about it   for a kiss? yeeeesh   i'm still male on my singapore IC, female on my ID in the US   i came out as trans when i was 39, i know people who have come out as gay, genderqueer, lesbian, and all things inbetween on the spectra  of gender and sexuality at all ages.  it is NEVER too late   the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's body until the third trimester, until then she has every right to abort the fetus is she so chooses.  again, it's pretty simple.    ok, let's take this from the top, shall we?  the jews werent growing inside the germans' bodies. babies are. if you cannot force a person to have a blood transfusion even if it will save their life, if you cannot harvest viable organs from dead people unless they consented prior, then you cannot force women to NOT have an abortion. case closed.  come back with a different analogy, one that doesnt involve nazis.   *sigh* again with the concentration camp analogies. just stop already. whatever women want to do with their bodies is really up to them.    yeeeeeeeeeeeup   first and second trimester, the fetus is dependant on the mother's body to survive, therefore any and all medical decisions, including whether or not to abort lies solely with the mother. end of story. you may not agree with it, but if we cannot force someone to get a blood transfusion to save their life, and we cannot harvest viable organs from their body after they die, then we cannot force a person not to have an abortion. it's really that simple.   we're all pro-life, some of us just believe that sometimes abortion becomes ncessary   we're talking about the first and second trimester   no, it supports pro choice. because at the end of the day, if the fetus is still in its first or second trimester, than the choice lies with the mother.   http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/07/pro-choice-blogger-promotes-10-reasons-to-have-an-abortion/   you're welcome   the fetus is dependent on the mother to survive until the third trimester, until then, the decision on what to do with the pregnancy lies solely with the mother.  suicide should be legal if the person is of sound mental health.  a woman chooses to have sex, not to have a baby. should a pregnancy arise because the woman had sex, then the choice of what to do with said pregnancy lies only with her up to the third trimester.  pretty simple actually.   in the third tri-mester, yes. which is why there are restrictions on late term abortions   the baby is dependant on the mother for life, therefore, any medical decisions rests soley with her.    we shouldnt be blaming immigrants for contributing to the drought   and they still use a majority of the water. whatever they put back will still be less than what was taken out, so the water level in the reservoirs drop to the point where we're in the current crisis. it's unsustainable.    but that person doesnt have to be the mother, it cant be someone else. so if the mother decides she doesnt want to take care of the baby, she can give it up for adoption.   you cannot make medical decisions for another person, pretty simple actually, even if you vehemently disagree with those decisions.     an unborn child is dependent on the mother's body to survive, so all medical decisions rest with her. once the fetus becomes viable outside the mother's body is when abortion is restricted, which is why almost every country in the world has restrictions on third trimester abortions.   actually, no, because the medical descion of what can and cannot be done rests with the individual, in this case, the mother. you cannot force anyone to have or not have a medical procedure they do or do not want to have. so you cannot force a jehovah's witness to receive a blood transfusion even if it to save their life. you cannot remove viable organs from a recently deceased person, even if it is to save another person's life, because even dead bodies have certain rights. the right to have an abortion lies solely with the mother. end of story.   except that statewide, average water use is roughly 50% environmental, 40% agricultural, and only 10% urban. population has minimal impact on water use, it's the agriculture that's sucking cali dry   yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup   *sigh*   um. wat.   uhhhh.....  how did he get elected again?   any medical decisions pertaining to the mother's body rest with her, unless she is incapacitated. if you cannot force a jehovah's witness to have something as simple as a blood transfusion to save their own life, then you cannot force a woman to NOT have an abortion. pretty simple.      abortion is a medical decision, which rests with the mother, who has final say.   he's that predictable?   but it still comes down to the fact that we cannot make ANY medical decisions for the woman, we cant make a jehovah's witness have a blood transfusion, even if it is to save her life.    ahhhh, the old "abortion clinics are like nazi concentration camps." well, let's see where that analogy breaks down, shall we? the jews werent growing inside another human being, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand we're done.    because that unborn human is growing inside of another human being with rights over her body, whom we cannot force to do anything she doesnt want to do.   because you cant even force a jehovah's witness  to have a simple blood transfusion, even if it's to save their life. therefore, you cannot force a woman NOT to have an abortion. it's not your body.   making college free would enable more people to get an education who would normally never be able to get one   because the bottom line is that other people do not get to decide what a person does with his or her body. we cant even take viable organs from dead bodies, because even dead bodies have rights.    ;-)   it's not your body, you cannot decide for another person what to do with her body, it is as simple as that.   no, it should be up to the woman to decide   because heaven forbid that we hear from the ones who didnt die   1) Staff Sergeant Eric Fidelis Alva EARNED a Purple Heart.   2) it's Memorial Day  he gets to say whatever the hell is on his mind.    that knocking sound almost drove me to madness. every time i heard it, i wanted to pick up the monitor and hurl it at the wall.   the vapors?   cool! should happen any moment then.....    nbsp;   ^^how nbsp;bout nbsp;now?   spellcheck, coming thru since clippy from microsoft word 95   fuck no   http://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/entertainment/10-of-the-hottest-female-celebs-with-big-feet/  as for the height? have you scrolled thru /r/tall? you're one of the shorter girls there. i'm 5'11" and i rock 5 inch heels all the time. (size 9.5 shoe)  who knew that tall girls have big feet? /s  took me a year before i finally saw a girl staring back at me in the mirror.  and listen, your mom can call you a jabberwocky for all that it matters, it doesnt make it true. you know you're a girl, nothing on this plane of existence or beyond can change that fact.  that's the pesky thing about facts, they're true whether people choose to believe in them or not.  you're a girl. simple as that.   something something, separation of church and state   y'all do guilt at expert level. like i'm asian, and i get the whole "we're very disappointed in you" speech from my mom and dad, but my ex got the third degree, like her dad would keep telling her how they spent all the money to make sure she was raised right, went to church, bought all the clothes for her,cooked, cleaned up after her.   like i said, at the end of it i was gonna volunteer as tribute. jeez.   i dont envy you the guilt trip your parents are gonna lay down on you. i would feel SO bad when my ex got into it with her parents. like it would get so bad that sometimes i felt that  I  should detransition for them. Korean guilt, on par with jewish mom level.    pffffffffffffft, no worries there, i'd run out of fingers and toes on five people before i ran out of friends in the bay area. shoot me a PM when you're here and i'll get the info on a few therapists and endos for you.   which city are you going to for your studies? if it's a big one, i prolly have friends there and i can get the info of the therapists in that area that they see.   because an education is never wasted. because all the people who graduated from college should give back so that others can have the same opportunity they did   ha, if you're  coming to the states, get all the documentation you need from therapists here. the hormones will be covered under your school's health insurance.   and as far as me ex, we broke up before she heard back from the military, so i cant help you there. i'll text her and ask for you.   http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/watch-bernie-sanders-blows-wolf-blitzers-mind-with-plan-to-make-college-free-by-taxing-wall-street/   well, have you been diagnosed with gender dysphoria? and are you out to your parents? my Korean ex-girlfriend was in the same boat as you are, but she came to the US on a student visa and transitioned here, so she has an official diagnosis and a letter she sent back asking for an exemption.   have you read this?  http://www.koreaobserver.com/trans-woman-files-complaint-against-military-over-surgical-castration-24136/  (dont read the comments)  *edit: also, this   "On March 2013 Seoul Western District Court ruled that five female-to-male transgender individuals can be registed as male without sex reassignment surgery."   well, having served in the army, i can tell you that in some ways, it's actually easier, because every minute of every day is planned for you, and when you DO have down time, you're so exhausted, you usually sleep.  also, if your service is mandatory like israel, singapore, taiwan, south korea etc, there's usually an exemption for trans people.  do you want to talk about it? i could prolly find the regulation on service exemption if you tell me what country you're from     the article directly quotes Hasselback, American Family Association, and Penny Nance, all saying terrible things about trans people, as well as anti trans bathroom bills in states like Florida and Nevada brought up by republican legislators.   the science is settled, the repuvblicans are the ones making it a political issue.   so you're saying that those republicans didnt say the things they are on record saying about trans people?   i was 7, so i dont remember thinking about gender at all. but then i saw a documentary about a bunch of trans girl prostitutes working to save up for reassignment surgery. after that, i pretty much thought about it pretty much non-stop til i came out..... 33 years later. :-p   there's a reason i havent gone back in twenty years   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand now i'm crying all over again.   And the founder of a chain of Christian treatment center Josh was sent to, resigned in 2014 under a cloud of accusations that he had sexually groomed and harassed young women and teens in his ministry.  the only thing missing from this circus is a clown car..... oh wait   something something hypocrisy of "family values"   hmmm, you raise a good point there. i didnt even think about it in that way.   as a queer trans girl lesbian, it makes me happy to read the comments of lgbt support in this thread   From the WPATH Standards of Care  A mental health screening and/or assessment is needed for referral to hormonal and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. In contrast, psychotherapyalthough highly recommendedis not a requirement.   The SOC do not recommend a minimum number of psychotherapy sessions prior to hormone therapy or surgery. The reasons for this are multifaceted (Lev, 2009). First, a minimum number of sessions tends to be construed as a hurdle, which discourages the genuine opportunity for personal growth. Second, mental health professionals can offer important support to clients throughout all phases of exploration of gender identity, gender expression, and possible transitionnot just prior to any possible medical interventions. Third, clients and their psychotherapists differ in their abilities to attain similar goals in a specified time period.  And RLE is only require for GCS,  not HRT  From the WPATH SoC:  The current Board of Directors of the WPATH herewith expresses its conviction that sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.    people engage in different ways, but there has to be a spark somewhere. take this sub, for instance, i'm sure there are many more lay people with only a cursory understanding of science that get so much more knowledge simply from reading the studies posted here and asking questions because they dont understand an aspect of the study and have someone more knowledgeable answer the question in a way that give the questioner a deeper understanding of the  topic of discussion.   well, they said in the article that the most likely application was for electric car batteries and home storage batteries.   but if you present it in a fun way that actually encourages understanding and prompts follow up questions and a desire to further one's knowledge, then we all win.  i've seen studies done on beer, and pot, and laughter, and poker. science CAN be fun too.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFqHlliWmVY   Ezekiel 16:49 "Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy."   to be fair, they DID say that these were EARLY results, and even mentioned the potential weakness of the battery with the lithium anode in terms of long-term stability and safety   i have never seen so many messages in my inbox. lots of them were from my friends with nothing but support. had a few from bible thumping friends i had when i was going to an all boys christian school and ten years of summer bible camp. those werent too fun, mostly cuz they were along the lines of "god doesnt make mistakes" and "i'll pray for you to see the light" or some other ineffectual bullshit.   family was the hardest, my parents didnt take it too well, nor my religious aunt and cousin. i have a really big fam fam, and only two of my cousins talk to me right now.   my friends are my family now. i honestly thought i'd have to go thru transition by myself, and my friends made me cry because not only did they support me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. and that made me smile inside, even tho i was bawling my eyes out like a baby.  it's been a blast, and i dont regret it one bit.  	189
 There is plenty of people who would give people one on one support like AceCool.   A lot of people in Australia would be on Free TV, that is where you can find this Television channel I am talking about. If you go to One (Name of the channel) if you go up one (to SBS radio) then up again. You get to see a channel that has a moderate amount of static, there is no shows being broadcasted just a Windows Vista looking desktop, with russian words in all 4 corners. There is a program open, may be Task Manager due to it saying "Processes" in the program, but the reason it is strange to me, is that there is an error.    DayZ is a "survival" game, I don't think it would help it to stay as survival if there was airdrops    Yes, the helicopter will land, but only my Character will eject from the helicopter.   Make a link post. I wouldn't consider it lucky because some of the gear may be impossible to get.   Ok I sent you a Skype Contact Request.   I am new to creating missions for ARMA II using the editor and I am creating a small scale mission. I am trying to make an insertion in a blackhawk, except when it lands, it only ejects me and not the rest of my squad.

Making people pay to learn Garry's Mod LUA? Why would anyone pay for this when people like cosmicseagull makes tutorials that are free on youtube.   Don't even try to hack. Use money printers in the server, put them underground and somewhere no one will hear it or see it.   What "stuff" are you stuck on?   Driving threw Cherno in a V3S isn't counted as "running" through the town.   First actual good use of that quote.

                   Something terrible lies at the heart of New Orleans  a rampant, widespread and apparently uncontrollable brutality on the part of its police force and its prison service. The horrors of its criminal justice system from decades before Hurricane Katrina and up to now lie somewhere between, with little exaggeration, Candide and Stalins Gulags.      I don't see why approaching mental states as legitimate subjects of inquiry should entail that they are irreducible.   I would distinguish between mental and inner states. A "mental state" could just be a stage of a process, like a machine state. An "inner state" to me presupposes some sort of qualitative barrier between process and perception.  My whole point in this discussion is basically I don't know how qualia could ever be considered "states" in the "machine state" or "process state" mould, therefore we can't talk about qualia without presupposing a different kind of "state" that is not a stage of a process.  In other words, I am arguing that reductionism rules out qualia and consciousness as legitimate concepts. That doesn't mean I consider reductionism *wrong* (I am up in the air about that), merely that I think those are the inevitable consequences of accepting it.  we already know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about how the brain handles vision, conscious awareness, religious experiences...  I'd agree with the first and last of those, but not the middle one. Explaining the neural correlates of consciousness is not explaining consciousness, unless doing so can "explain away" consciousness as a meaningful idea, a la Dennet's attempt.  I think that consciousness, as well as qualia, must either be null or radically other. I don't see the middle ground like you seem to.  The idea that maybe they [animals] are just automata that happen to behave in a certain way while experiencing nothing is a remote skeptical possibility akin to "what if we're really brains in a vat?" or "what if other humans are really unconscious zombies?"  It's not remote since many believe that we humans are such automata as well. We can at least say that humans have the *concept* of qualia, even if it turns out not to refer to anything. We can't communicate this concept to animals so we have no way of telling what qualitative experience they may or may not have.  On the ethical side, though, I agree with you: In the absence of strong evidence otherwise it is ethical to assume that humans and animals both experience qualia.  Since our qualia seem to be in continual flux, that suggests to me that it must be a process (or more likely, a set of processes).  I think you're confusing change in stimuli with mental processes. They're two different things. I'm saying - how does qualia fluctuate *if the stimuli remains the same*? A point stimuli or a constant stimuli can kick off a whole cascade of processes but it only seems to generate one immediate, constant quale. Red only becomes "less red" when the rods in my eyes saturate (a physical process). The fact that the quale goes away when I look at something else is not the issue.  then some subset of those feedback connections would be projecting into the visual cortex and incorporating that information into the stream of consciousness.   The problem is, it doesn't appear as a "stream" or a "process," but as a pointlike experience. Obviously a process assembles that experience before it is "presented" to the awareness, but what is it that can apprehend the entire process instantaneously?  Again, it's not enough to say "well, it really doesn't happen instantaneously, we've proven in the lab that there's a lag of 40 milliseconds" or whatever. Why does it *appear* instantaneous? Where does this sense come from?   Why a major problem [with Blindsight]? To me it just suggests that it's possible to have a visual experience (however degraded) that one is not consciously aware of.   Because it argues against the *role* consciousness has been assigned in current reductionist theories, which is as *the name we give to the processing of stimuli via mental states.* Here is a complex mental state in response to a stimuli, with *no conscious component*. That's a huge problem in my book.  Reductionists could fall back on the older view of consciousness as a pure epiphenomenon, an "impotent narrator," but that view has been out of fashion for some time and for good reason.  maybe there is crosstalk in the circuits which, while relatively data-poor, allows patients to perform slightly above chance (which is all they find in performance tests).  [This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7794783.stm) seems to suggest something a good deal more shocking than "performing slightly above chance." Key quote:  "A video recording shows him completing the obstacle course set up by the scientists "flawlessly", without the aid of his cane or another person."  Also he can respond to facial expressions which is one of the most complex tasks of the brain and I doubt it can be explained by weak cross-talk.  You might be interested in the work of Colin McGinn on this subject.  I can only wonder if these pessimists have ever actually opened a neuroscience textbook, because the way they talk, you'd expect neuroscience books to be 2 pages long!  A lot of them are Philosophers of the Mind, so I *hope* they have read neuroscience, though you never know. Anyway the pessimists aren't so much saying "we can never figure out the brain" in the heuristic sense of figuring out what region processes what, as they are saying that the "deep truths" we want to find by studying the brain, such as "is reductionism true?" simply aren't accessible, and perhaps aren't even intelligible concepts.  Note this is different from saying "consciousness isn't an intelligible concept," it is a level of abstraction removed. The pessimists are saying "asking whether or not consciousness is an intelligible concept is not an answerable question."  Going back to McGinn again he is also sympathetic to this idea though I think at heart he's a non-reductionist though he doesn't declare openly for that.  I'm not one of these pessimists myself but the way that very smart people (a lot more educated than I am) continually seem to talk past and misunderstand each other on this subject makes me queasy that they may be right.   there is also no history of civil war between Sunnis and Shiites until the American invasion of Iraq  Someone please get this man a history book.                        Thanks. Oh, and I forgot to add:  4.) The hope that close attention to the details will allow for a better foundation upon which attacks on the "big problems" can resume in the future. This view holds that the previous attacks failed because of shaky foundations. Bad definitions, muddled logic, etc.   I have no idea what you're talking about but there's a number of works on the intersection between mathematics and philosophy.  One category is the philosophical basis of mathematics (Godel's theorem, Cantor, etc.)  But I think what you're interested in is the converse: A possible mathematical basis for philosophy. On that topic Badiou has been recently popular.   1.) over-specialization, a desire to "professionalize" philosophy so that it resembles other university disciplines.  2.) lack of progress on the "hard" questions leading to frustration, giving up, lack of funding.  3.) the view that there are no "hard" questions, just illusions of language.   The tendency to over-define vague terms and then follow those definitions to their logical conclusions gets philosophers into muddles.  True, and that might be the problem with qualia.   I fear we're constructing a pantheon of very slippery inner states, and then postulating new mental states to cover up for the holes in our initial description. In this practice, we quickly reach a point where our main limiting factor is our imagination.  That's my fear also.  My worry is not that there aren't any such inner states to describe, but that our description is theory-rich and data-poor, and therefore we may be misdescribing them rather badly.  I hope so, and I hope more data might shed some light on these questions. However, as of now I can't see a way out of the trap. Accepting "inner states" to any degree seems to entail accepting the whole ridiculous pantheon of irreducible and incommensurable qualia. Rejecting "inner states" means discounting phenomenological observation altogether, which seems almost as ridiculous.  Can't we be pretty sure that animals experience pain? They behave like they're in pain, they have neural wiring similar to that which processes pain in humans, similar stimuli seem to cause pain in animals.   I'm not as confident. We don't know where in the brain qualia are produced, if they even exist (and if they are even produced by the brain, if they exist.) They may be produced only in the prefrontal cortex, which animals don't possess to the same degree. Animals may simply process the stimuli of pain without any accompanying qualia. It's impossible to know, but I also think it's immoral to assume that they don't and that it's ok to hurt animals.  (btw, the fact that almost all moral systems are implicitly based on the existence of qualia is what makes a lot of people so leery about qualophobes, regardless of the evidence.)  This isn't obvious to me. Actually since qualia fluctuate over time, it seems to me that they are almost certainly processes.  How do qualia fluctuate in your view? Do you mean only if the stimuli changes? We would agree there. But not if the stimuli remains the same. They seem to be point-like experiences to me. Sure, a color will fade if you look at it too long because the rods in your eyes get saturated, but that's a different issue.  A desktop computer is a serial processor and will process these in sequence... whereas our brain's architecture is massively parallel, allowing it to perform many computations simultaneously.   Actually, modern computers are massively parallel as well. I'm not denying that the brain processes imagery in parallel. Obviously it does. What bothers me is that these parallel processes then seem to produce outputs that are presented to our awareness as a unity.  Blindsight shows that visual stimuli response can function independently of any visual experience. This is a major problem for reductionists.  I have a feeling you're going to tell me this doesn't help, but I'm not sure why.  I'm concerned with how we experience a process as a unity, a point-like experience. That's where I see a weakness in the reductionist argument.   If the non-reductionists can somehow tame the zoo of qualia, I might "go over" to their side. I'm not there yet though. I'm more thinking a third approach might be needed, but I have no idea what that could be.   I'm also more sympathetic now than I used to be to the epistemological pessimists who think the mind can no more think about itself than a hammer can hammer itself, that our minds are designed to be "turned outwards towards the world" and that too much introspection on mental states inevitably leads to logical knots, simply because we're not designed to process that sort of information.    I'm not too familiar with this position. Is this Dennett's view?  More or less. Though he's too canny to ever say so in such simple terms, in my reading he thinks both qualia and consciousness are "null pointers" - words that don't really refer to anything meaningful. For a while I thought he had the true picture - right down the the competing networks of Darwinian neurons fighting for dopamine - but now I'm not so sure.  higher vs. lower functions...  I would take a Heideggerian approach to this question. Anything "ready to hand" that we can use in a transparent fashion without  rational thinking is a lower function, even if it was set by practicing it as a higher function (for example that choke hold, which had to be puzzled out and learned before it became automatic) Anything "unready to hand" that requires us to activate our reasoning skills is a higher function.   I'm not sure if I agree with the entailment from propositional attitudes to qualia or not. If I say "I believe that 2+2=4" how would we characterize the corresponding quale?  *Believing* it, as opposed to merely using the fact in a process, would entail the quale of the emotion of belief, the feeling we get when we look at something we know to be true. 2 + 2 = 5 is not just a false statement, it triggers a different quale when we see it (in the qualophile's view.)  we want to know why all this processing is accompanied by "inner feels." Maybe 'qualia' is not the best concept with which to get a handle on the problem, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't seem like a solution.  Exactly.  I agree. However, the reason *why* I agree has to do with the simultaneity of visual perception, which I will try to explain below.  I think a strong case can be made for the existence of qualia in non-linguistic animals (think animal pain, blue dot on the forehead test, food preferences, etc.)  I'm not sure. If you believe in qualia, you believe there's a difference between "seeing blue" the way a computer can (or seeing a face the way Cottrel's network can), and really *seeing blue* (seeing the quale not processing the wavelength.) Since we can't communicate like this with animals, we can't know for certain either way.  Damn. Sorry man, I'm just not understanding why this is a problem.  Ok, I'll be glad to try again. Thanks for sticking with this discussion!   Reductionist theories of mind run into a problem when they encounter mental phenomena that *don't seem to be processes*. Thought is a process. Emotion, Demasio and others have argued with merit, is a process. Qualia are obviously not processes but the very concept of qualia is shaky.   But what about visual perception? Phenomenologically, it doesn't seem (and seeming is what's important here, since we're talking about inner states) that I see first the cat, then the lamp, and process these two concepts like a computer program would that could recognize multiple objects in a picture (these do exist.)  Rather, I seem to apprehend both of them *at the same time*. Visual perception appears not to be a process but rather a *pointlike experience* that is nevertheless very rich in data.  It is the nature of visual perception, at once pointlike in time and vast in the amount of stimuli that is perceived, that seems very un-process-like.  If we accept that it is not a process, we should also be more open to the idea that other non-processed mental states like qualia also might exist (where there's one monkey, there's more...).   I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.  But this opens a huge can of worms. Qualia must either be null or *radically* Other, beyond all category of thought or understanding. Even a thoroughgoing dualism in the traditional sense seems to leave no room for qualia. You would need an unbounded pluralism of incommensurable experiences, each its own separate ineffable Universe and yet somehow united within our minds. That sounds like the sort of conceptual disaster that usually results from having started from wrong premises.  So I'm still torn on the qualia issue.  Is there a wiki page on this?  I couldn't find anything more specific than stuff on qualia and the Hard Problem. There are some technical articles that talk about the problems of simultaneity and I remember reading about this issue in Penrose and Chalmers (who proposed quantum and dualistic solutions, respectively.)   making the most serious attempts to give a legitimate explanation of qualia (as opposed to the defeatists who seem to suggest that qualia are magical and inexplicable).  Or those who think they're just a trick of language?  "Language of thought" folks believe that this is essentially language-like whereas eliminativists of the Churchland variety think that the brain's basic cognitive processes are rather non-language-like  I think both views are simplistic. Our "higher" cognitive functions are obviously language-like in processing, at least in my view, whereas "instinct"-type reactions are not. Habits fall in between the two - that's why they can be so hard to break.  As far as I can tell the questions are entirely independent.   Why I think the two issues are fundamentally the same is that, as far as I understand the concept, a propositional attitude must have an intentional object. It is hard to see how such an object can be anything other than a quale.   If there truly are propositional attitudes such as "I would like to have a beer," rather than simple processes that report such sentences as part of their functioning, then the quale for the taste of beer is implied.  I know the eliminationists don't believe in these attitudes, and I thought they didn't believe in quales either, but you say they are merely "reductionist" in relation to quales. I don't quite see the difference because according to the classic definition at least, quales are irreducible. A reduced quale is a non-existent one.  Skeptical in what sense? Skeptical that the term 'qualia' refers to anything at all?   Yes. For a while I was in the "it's all just a trick of language" school and I still think those arguments have a lot of merit. For example, if there is a quale that embodies "redness," when we see a color shift for example in a computer graphics display, we should notice a sharp cutoff where "redness" changes to "orangeness," but we don't.   Also, people who speak languages that don't distinguish between "blue" and "green," Japanese for example, have been shown to be able to see less shades in that color range than English-speakers. All this points to quales somehow arising from language and not being fundamental.  Where I've started to doubt that view, however, is in the appearance of the simultaneity of visual perception. Looking at the room right now, I see a lamp, and a cat, *apparently at the same time*, and as distinct objects, not a blob combining the qualities of both (a furry, purring lamp for example.)   How is this possible? If the mind is a mere process, how does this perception arise? There should only be reaction to visual stimuli, as with the Blindsight phenomenon, but nothing else. Yet something else appears that, unlike color quales, it is quite difficult to explain as a trick of language.  Before you chalk me up as a disciple of the Time Cube guy, the two dimensions of time and String Theory stuff was partly tongue-in-cheek, but this problem seems so vexing I wonder if this or a similarly bizarre explanation will eventually be needed.  What I was referring to is that in String Theory there are "extra" dimensions that are not linear, but rather curled around the three dimensions we know and love. Much like a tightrope walker will perceive a tightrope as one dimension, but an ant will see two (the ant can go forward and backward as well as around the "curled up" dimension that composes the rope itself.), in String Theory at a small scale our Universe has 10 or 11 spatial dimensions, not 3.  What I was proposing was that perhaps time also has a String Theory-like "curled up" dimension and that's how visual perception can be a process yet still somehow seem presented as a unity to the mind.  And of course Roger Penrose is a physicist who became interested in the philosophy of the mind and concluded that quantum physics must somehow be involved, launching an entire industry of bad New Age books misinterpreting his ideas.   Thanks for the detailed reply. You're lucky you got to work with some of the most eminent modern philosophers - whether I agree with them or not, that's quite an experience and one I wish I could have had.  So obviously your experience with them is very extensive and I'll take your word for it on what their true views are. However, I am puzzled by a couple of things you said:  believe that neuroscience science will explain qualia.  That is the qualophobic position, if I am correct. "phobic" is just an unfortunate appelation that this position got stuck with. It doesn't literally mean they are *afraid* to address the issue qualia, just that they think qualia can be reduced to neurology without either a dualistic or an emergent order.  they all agree that there is something wrong with folk psychology but they can disagree radically as to what (for the Churchlands, it's propositional attitudes, for others it's qualia or consciousness).  I don't think there's really much of a difference between propositional attitudes and qualia, fundamentally. They both seem to refer to mental states that can't be reduced to mere *processes*, and that's the real issue in my book.  I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door.   It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue. Why should it appear simultaneous? How does this unity, however illusory it might be, manifest? I don't know of any reductionist philosopher who's explained that to my satisfaction.  I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.  So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best"     I think he meant in physics, where three dimensions are privileged (see r3m0t's post), but that's interesting - I never knew that.   I don't think any philosopher from Plato on would disagree that "love" is a muddled concept that refers to many different things.   I do think the Churchlands are far more radical than the rather uncontroversial critique you ascribe to them: In my reading of their position, they think "love" refers to not many different states, but to *nothing* - that the behaviors we ascribe to "love" have *no affective states behind them whatsoever*, any more than there is some being called Zeus behind the phenomenon of thunder.  In essence they are extreme qualophobes - they not only deny external qualia like "red," but internal qualia as well such as emotions. Some see them and the rest of the EM school as the heirs to the Behaviorists, but all the Behaviorists said was that the "black box" of internal states could not be studied scientifically - they never said that internal states didn't exist.  I've by no means read their corpus, so their position may have evolved since my last encounter with their work, but that's how I read their position at the time.

Before you suggest "Ghost in the Shell," this was NOT Ghost in the Shell, I've seen every movie and episode, and this wasn't it.  What I remember for sure: It was quite similar to Ghost in the Shell. It involved cops in Japan with tank-like robot assistants. The plot was convoluted, but in the end it was revealed the evil mastermind was an old man who lived in a giant dome who was trying to merge trees and robots to create a new form of life. In the end his plot was foiled, but all the tank-robots were destroyed in the process.  Stuff I *think* I remember: It was on Adult Swim, in the early 2000's, but my friend thinks it was on MTV instead.

 Indeed, Israel is far worse.            eval-buffer is an EmacsLisp command.       a lot but half of our disappointment in Obama is that things cant get done in the rest of congress.  Lots of stuff he didn't do that he could have done: investigate war crimes, reign in the NSA, directed Holder to prosecute financial crimes instead of drug crimes and copyright "crimes"; he could have appointed someone other than a telecom industry exec to oversee the FCC (who is now predictably dismantling net neutrality) .  Those items, just off the top of my head, demonstrate that Obama is a conservative, like his hero Ronald Reagan.  Now, in terms of policy initiatives, he scuttled the hugely popular public option and universal care behind closed doors with industry execs, and implemented a complex Heritage institute plan that forces us all to be customers of the for-profit insurance industry.   Hilary is more likely to get congress moving again and you know it  Hillary is more likely to serve monied interests.  That's all she's likely to do (and you know it).   Good luck on Hillary doing anything but servicing her lobbyists.      Exactly what was said about Obama.   Krugman called it: http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2009/12/krugman-did-identify-the-housing-bubble-in-2005.html   Python, Ruby, Node.js, Objective-C, now looking at Go.  No Haskell/ML ever, apart from casual perusing, I'm afraid.      Extensive public record, her research focus as a professor, and of course, major legislation she's sponsored and gotten passed.      Sadly, Warren is a two-issue candidate, with those issues being financial reform,  and being a woman who is not Hillary.   That is just plain wrong.  She's been quite prominent on unions, domestic wiretapping, taxation, education loan reform, workplace safety, civil rights, bankruptcy, corporate power, and energy policy.     In 2008 we fielded a candidate with a formidable progressive brand and platform rather than a formidable progressive record.  Warren has an incredible record for her short tenure, unlike Obama.   And Obama was not a progressive;  he even stated that publicly, saying that his ardent followers were attributing their politics to him incorrectly.  And he proved this in the primaries by supporting telecom immunity (against wiretapping charges) and Joe Lieberman over the progressive Ned Lamont, just to name a couple of issues.  Obama was at best a cypher if you weren't paying attention, but it was actually pretty obvious in the primaries that he was a conservative.          Seriously?      It's not "moderated down to a level" - it's been censored.   Oh dear.  Quite right.  (It's been about 5 years since I used CL.)  It should have been:       (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)   *EDIT*: fixed         You don't replace mappings in the symbol table - you store mappings in a separate hash-table:      (defconstant +query-operators+ (make-hash-table))     (defun equal-query-op (var arg)        (format nil "~a=~a" var arg))     (defun not-equal-query-op (var arg)        (format nil "~a~!=~a" var arg))     (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)     (setf (gethash '!= +query-operators+) #'not-equal-query-op)  Then, you just need a function that takes a list with a query operator as the first element and returns the parameter string:      (defun query-param (qexp)        (let ((op (first qexp))              (op-args (rest qexp)))           (apply (gethash op +query-operators+) op-args)))  And just map this method over the list:      (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones)))  Which will yield a list of strings:      ("first.name=bob" "last.name!=jones")  Which can be concatenated with FORMAT:      (format nil "~{~a~^ ~}"             (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones))))  Which gives:      "first.name=bob last.name!=jones"              ----------------------- **EDIT**: fixed bugs (thanks, /u/spacebat)    just another downside of attaching healthcare to employment  Yup, Hobby Lobby showed us that.   How many different comparison operators do you have?  Is it just != and = or are there more?    And "name.last!=jones" is valid but odd query syntax.  A typical web framework will pass a parameter named "name.last!" to the handler function.  So how are you going to encode other comparators?  The most straightforward and lispiest way is what someone else here suggested:  (query 'person '((= name.first bob) (!= name.last jones)))  Yes you will need to provide functions to do the conversion of lists into strings.  If you have a small number of operators, honestly an if or cond expression wouldn't be awful.     Alternatively, you could keep a hash-table that maps the operator symbols (=, !=, etc) to parser functions.  The table would map the equal symbol to the = parser, etc.  Does that make sense?          Edit: Just for reference, [here](http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-obama-care/120313-681526-cancer-patient-bill-elliott-audited-over-obamacare.htm ) is a story about an unitended effect of the ACA. It just makes me think that the people who supported the ACA didn't actually care enough the effects to do any prior research or put any more work into the bill to ensure this kind of thing didn't happen  Actually, the rightwing outlets reporting this are the ones that didn't do the research.  The story you're referencing is full of holes and untruths.  This has been a pretty common pattern for anti-Obamacare pieces reported on rightwing sites like the one you linked.  http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-news-cancer-patient-bill-elliott-doesnt-have-to-die/  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/04/obamacare-horror-stories-debunked  http://www.newshounds.us/megyn_kelly_s_phony_obamacare_victim_doesn_t_need_to_die_11082013                                                                                                                                                                Every time I try to play a video from MSNBC, I get a spinning peacock symbol but no video.               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stone   While the monetary system of Yap appears to use these giant stones as tokens, in fact it relies on an oral history of ownership. Being too large to move, buying an item with these stones is as easy as saying it no longer belongs to you. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person you passed it on tono physical movement of the stone is required.             I'm really puzzled by the hate for 47 Ronin.  It received a 13% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes (and was at 0% for top critics).  I really don't understand - it's not the greatest film, but it's certainly very far from the worst.  The visuals are gorgeous, and the script was reasonable - it certainly wasn't insulting like so many others that get much higher marks.  There weren't grating characters, the CGI was deployed tastefully and well done.  Overall it was a pretty fun romp.                                                                        As far as I can tell, the Ether IPO hasn't started, but the AlethZero client allows you to mine ether.  Is this ether valid?  Or is the current blockchain going to be somehow discarded when the IPO happens?                                                                                                                                                                                                              The default orangered upvote count color provided by RES makes Reddit extremely difficult to parse.  The default upvote count draws the eyes away from the title at each line and toward the orangered highlight color at each line.  Compare here: http://imgur.com/a/CEJWX  Orangered is a strong color which Reddit uses to highlight and distinguish noteworthy elements:        * user has upvoted an article    * user has selected a tab (hot/new/etc)    * user has new mail  Using orangered for # of upvotes adds a highlight on every line and creates a number of problems:       * confuses the meaning of the highlight color   * draws attention to a minor detail   * reduces the readability of the site.    I initially immediately uninstalled RES because of this particular feature.  I bet many other first-time users have had the same response.  It's worth an A/B test.    (I only kept RES this time after I discovered I could customize it to a neutral color.)  For my two cents, I think the upvote/downvote color should be the same gray color as other elements in that line (#888888), perhaps distinguishing up and downvotes using + and -.  E.g., (+100|-10).                       	189
 Did it make a sound?   Eva Green is the name of the BioRad PCR reagent we use.   No.   Is that from the top of the Stadium?   Yes, as you vaporize your gas would create a momentary buffer for your space ship.   You have cancer.   It looks to me like Solanum quitoense.      This is a common misconception. Adults invented cinnamon toast crunch. I personally put it in my coffee.   The real trick is to just spend one Sunday brushing your teeth and you are good to go for a year.   If Binge drinking 5 or more drinks, and the "bottle" is the unit of wine, does that mean I can drink 4 bottles of wine in a sitting without binging?   A catalyst stabliizes the intermediate molecule. You can think that in the process of the beginning products going to the ending products, this is a middle point where they are all together and it's some combination of bonds. Even "half bonds". This step is the unstable step. It takes a lot of energy to hold it in this step.  A catalyst, will take the two starting products, and stablize the half-bonded middle step. Then it could either slide back to start, or slide down to the lower energy end products.  All this essentially means it lower the barrier of the activation engery, allowing the reaction to more easily move to end point.  [A graph of above.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Catalyst_effect.png)   If it's coming from all directions, the light receptors wouldn't meaure a difference between any two directions, so it would act like normal and grow upward due to gravity.   Oh damn! You are right! I knew I fixed that decimal the wrong direction.   There's no need to guess. It can be calculated.   Also, for reference, if the Earth was the size of a basball the moon would be about 7.5 feet away and the Milky way would be 3.4 billion miles wide.  Space is big.   Fun Question. So, The Milky way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away. So, Andromeda is about 25 time farther away than the milkyway is wide.  A baseball is 7.3cm in diameter. 7.3cm * 25 = 1.825 meters or about 6 feet.  Space is big.  Edit: misplaced a decimal. And Again   Yes, it's about that simple. Two things you might want to know though. Many plants (Magnolias included) prefer to be cross-pollinated, as in, pollen from one plant fertillizing the flower of a different plant. It's more robust on a genetic level for the species. You can self-pollinate (essentially inbreeding). It will work for Magnolias, but you may get a lower seed set than if you had another tree around.  The second is that some plants, to encouage outcrossing, mature the pollen and the stigma (the receptive female part of the flower) at different times. I don't think this happens in Magnolias, but to be safe try several flowers at once.  Good luck!   Yep, it will work. It's best when you can see the pollen grains starting to fall out of the stamens, just like in your photo. Fun fact: Magnolias are a very anceint lineage of flowering plants. They pollinated by beetles because when Magnolias evolved, bees were millions of years in the future.   It looks much more like an opportunistic infection. In other words, it moved in after the damage was done. Could you take a closer photo? As close as you can make it clear.      I'm a plant path grad student. I love it. I like biological interactions. It's a field (like much of biology) where you can spend your time in fields or forests or in the lab running constant PCR.   Looks like a Ganoderma. Likely Ganoderma tsugae. Nice shot!   Most of the time, no. If you compress it AND drop the temperature, then yes, almost all gases will form a solid at some point.  The reason a thing is a gas is becuase it has enough energy to overcome the molecules attraction to one another. This attraction is fairly weak for things that are gases at room temperature (hence why they are gases). If you take many gases and compress them, but keep the temperature around 70F (25C), they will form a [superfluid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity). Superfluidity is a special and weird and very cool form of matter.    They also have 8 sets of chromosomes (Octoploidy) and most cultivated ones are hybrids between two continents. And are delicious.  	25

I can hear sound and barely see an image if I hold screen at an angle. Can it be repaired cheaply and easily?  Also (sorry).... What is this? Can I connect the Game Gear to my TV or monitor? http://imgur.com/JVbpcDu            Ok, so about 7 years ago, I was working out pretty hard and supplementing Creatine. I was taking the capsules, which you are supposed to swallow with a LARGE glass of water. Well, one morning I was running late for work, after the gym, and I throw the capsules in my mouth and swallow them at the water fountain. About a mile down the road my throat starts drying up severely and then I cough... POOF... Creatine powder everywhere and it tastes like shit so I start gagging until I pull over, open the door, and puke...and puke...and puke. The Creatine powder coated my throat so bad I couldn't stop gagging.  Also, I took my glasses off in the process of puking and set them on my seat... I sat on them and broke them when I got back into the car.  TL;DR Creatine and then sat on my glasses, breaking them.

Wikitree seems like a cool website   [Edward Digges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Digges) served as one of the Colonial Governor of Virginia.    On his [tombstone](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr GRid=32117881) it states, among other things:  "...He had issue **6 sons and 7 daughters** by the body of Elizabeth his wife who of her conjugal affection hath dedicated to him this Memorial."

[Catherine](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr GRid=68821007) married William Herndon in 1677.  William supported Nathaniel Bacon, and his [rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon's_Rebellion), which could have given cause for Edward to disown Catherine.    According to this [post](http://genforum.genealogy.com/cgi-bin/pageload.cgi?doubts::herndon::457.html), the New England Historical and Genealogical Society doubts Catherine is the daughter of Edward.  But I can't find the actual document.    Is there anything out there that could give more evidence towards lineage or not?    What the fuck is this fucking shit?!

They've been here for a while!   I almost had this happen to me.  I had some random very specific question about Word, and couldn't find anything online.  So I called my university's IT support and asked them.  They had no idea, but gave me a number to Microsoft Office tech.  Called that number, everything seemed fine at first.  He remotely logged into my computer via Logmein. But "bells" started going off and he said I had a virus on my computer etc etc, but he could fix it.  At that point, I realized it wasn't Microsoft and I let some random person into my computer.  I shut down that conversation and ran a bunch of scans. I also spoke to the "higher level" IT people at my university and they ran stuff as well.  It sounded like a Scare scam to them.  They seemed to have gotten an old Microsoft phone number, but websites still has MS as the listed business.  Learned me a big lesson.     I understand that bra.  But its an obvious punchline.  Like Kevin Hart with his "I'm a small black man" stuff.  It would be really funny and unexpected if more jokes weren't about that.     Oh I get it.....it is cause he is fat.

Whenever the "Alt" button is pressed, paragraph's are highlighted in grey, allowing me to used Readline, if needed.  But it keeps you from clicking hyperlinks. (Which was EXTREMELY annoying, until I figured the Alt key was doing it.  I almost deleted it)  But I use the Alt-button for other tasks, mostly Alt-Tab to other window screens.  That task "activates" Readline, forcing me to go through the steps to unactivate it.  It's not a serious issue, but a major annoyance.  I am still pretty novice with the intricacies of your app, so there could be an easy fix on the user-side.    [Here](http://i.imgur.com/zICJ6xD.png) are the settings I have currently marked.

 You didn't specify what type of order you're making.  You can't really make an order like you described.  The closest thing would be a limit order, in which case as soon as the order is submitted, it is executed at the current bid price (essentially converted to a market order), since the current price is above your limit price.  There's no scenario I know of in which what you proposed would have any impact on the stock's price, from a pure price point of view.    That said, if you have a large amount of stock that you unload, that volume alone might will usually have an impact on the stock's price.  That's why it's important to watch institutional investors, since they generally invest much larger sums of money into equities.  So, for example, when they start buying $FB because it recently got added to the S P, you can expect to see a positive impact on the price.   Investing is like cooking...every chef has a different style.   Start slow and develop a sense of your risk tolerance.   Knowledge is power...start reading the internet voraciously about anything and everything related potential investments.  You might think you know tech sector, but understanding how a stock is traded (the "technicals") is not the same thing as a company's fundamentals.    "you know nothing, John Snow..."        	5
 Lyk dis if u cry evertim   Where are you that there's this much snow? Because there as hell doesn't seem to be that much anywhere else in Indiana.   So then who's the Tecmo Super Bo?   Fortunately we figured that out this year.   JUCO transfers like Aaron Rodgers I'd be ok with us taking. I don't want us taking guys who had trouble qualifying academically, but if it was a skill thing I don't see a reason we couldn't, or at least have 1 exception a year for it or something.   AXE Body Spray: Because who doesn't want to smell like a middle school locker room?   I won't miss his ability to somehow make our DBs forget how to cover.   Same idea but with icy hot.   Yeah I got eliminated from valedictorian my first semester of high school when I took electives. The salutatorian was 2nd because he accidentally took an extra art class freshman year.   I wish this was the first thread where I'd read about someone sticking their dick in milk today.   He did Parks and Rec instead.   Terrifying.   They said learned how to dress.   Every time I see a picture of Shaun White I think why is someone talking about Carrot Top?   Yeah I'm at Notre Dame and our highest paid employee is our investment officer. And he's still only making a fraction of what he'd make in the private sector.   I have full faith in us being the first 1 seed to lose in the first round if we ever get seeded that highly.   Your mistake for having faith in us to win.   I thought everyone thought that.   We finally found the one person who would hit the share button when watching porn.   My marketing class was basically teaching us how to do market research and what you needed to know. I.e. how to figure out where to sell, who to target, what types of products will be successful, etc.   Best: Notre Dame beating Stanford this year.  Worst: Losing to Boston College in 2002 or the Bartman play.   Seeley Booth vs. Angel.  On the other side of the spectrum, Miachel Cera as George Michael and Evan would be pretty even, too.   Lynyrd Skynyrd, Public Enemy, and Lady Gaga.   Buffy taught me no.   I work at my campus dining hall. This kid got fired while making personal pizzas for people for insulting students, throwing knives, and using the word "nigdick", his own invention. After he graduated, this wonderful human being enrolled in seminary, but then I ran into him at a bar later and learned he dropped out because "celibacy sucks". He is one of 2 people to have fired in probably the last 6 or 7 years, the other being a student manager who gave out tequila shots to students in the basement. Another was almost fired for dealing to full time staff, but he got arrested first.   Doubly so for /r/funny.   We had a presentation from a guy that does innovation for a beer company. The one time I didn't want to see a presentation on beer.   But Scotty doesn't know.   He went to IU though.   I had an RA that used to do this.   Click. That shit was supposed to be Adam Sandler playing with time and kicking people in the balls.    The Ivy League is all private.   Ring by Spring.   "Memories"   Should have masturbated more.

Debt can even be good if you can invest the money toward something with a higher rate than the interest you're paying. If I'm paying say 4% interest on my house and I have extra money after monthly payments, I could use that money to pay off extra money on my mortgage. However, given that the market tends to average somewhere between 8 and 12% in a year that's not a crash, you're usually better off investing that money elsewhere.   I had this same thing happen with my ex.   The only one I remember was someone bought condoms and a drug test. She paid all in singles.   This happens to me all the time Not having Friday classes really fucks with my head.   It make you look like Dwight.   Freitag just felt wrong though. There needs to be a Yeagley coaching there forever.   That's a cheap wedding.   Next: Beer 30!   Beer 30 has my favorite can ever though.   I took it as part of a job application. It was really easy.   Hamm's   Maybe LSU is just more willing to rise above it.  In all honesty it's most likely because of the way it was phrased. If they mentioned LSU doing it, too, Louisiana probably would have been ok with it.   I don't think anyone underrated Samardzija when he was here. Everyone knew he was awesome. I'd go with Jimmy personally. He had a great year for us his junior year, but had an awful o-line and a defense that didn't tackle, they just pushed. Was he an asshole? Yes. But a damn good player.   I've been really impressed with Wilson. I think he's going to lead you guys to a level that you haven't reached since Mallory. Also the win for Hoep in 2007 was just awesome. Considering how bad 2007 was for ND, IU at least gave me something to be happy about.   Fucking Gary Gray and Fucking Tommy Rees.   I don't think I've ever had a minimum time for presentations. Questions counting for time would screw me over every time because it'd end up pushing my presentations over the time limit.   Shit I just assumed that's what those were.   My nightmares of ND football all involve Tommy.   That has nothing to do with snow and everything to do with it being 465. That's awful driving no matter what time of year.   Hell yeah Chilly Willies.   What part of Indiana is this? Every part I've been in has been fine driving with snow.   Tell that to an accounting firm.   I'll agree with you on that first one. We have an assload of bandwagon fans. That's pretty much what leads to all of those other 3. We get preferential treatment because we have a lot of fans so our games = ratings and people will go to them as well. It's that combined with the fact that we have a fair amount of wealthy alumni, so they'll pay to go. 3 comes mostly from the bandwagon fans. Most alumni and students have the most pessimistic views of ND. As for 4, there's no reason for us to join financially so why should we? That comes from the first 2.   The Big Ten is an awful idea. I'd completely prefer the ACC. The ACC has schools that are way more similar to us, such as Duke, BC, Wake, Miami, and Syracuse. In the Big Ten we'd have Northwestern. I don't want to be one of the only 2 private schools in our conference. Conference affiliation need to be about more than athletics. Only reason I'd prefer the Big Ten would be to join the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. Still don't want to join one though.   He threw a really pretty ball by his junior year, too. I don't think he gets enough credit for how good he was his last year because he spent 3 years with a defense that didn't know how to tackle.   If it's in the game, it's in the game.   It won't be 600. It'll be 599 US Dollars.   I felt like in this scenario it was the equivalent of shouting while someone is talking and saying I can't hear you.  "Please stop writing to me"  "I can't understand a word you're saying"   We had a 3 week debate 2 years ago about them. Started by a guy who was against them.   He didn't end up taking it I think. I think that was before he came back for another year to get enough credits for the CPA exam.   That engineering wasn't for me. Almost failed out of school before I realized it. Made the switch to business and I've enjoyed it so much more and done way better.   I used to live in Bloomington, so IU apparel was huge there. I worked at a Kmart, and there was one month we got a huge shipment of Oklahoma gear. I'm pretty sure someone fucked up because of the similar logos. Needless to say they didn't sell very well.   A friend of mine took a year off from college because he had cancer. At an interview the interviewer said "I notice you took a year off from college. Were you spending a year finding yourself?" in kind of a smarmy tone. He of course replied no, he was fighting cancer. He got an offer.   My roommate did this for a summer and only sold one thing. But he referred a guy who got really into it and so he made a bunch from that.   Fucking magnets, how do they work?   But that means you're missing Pigtostal!   We've got a couple of those.   It's not that we're too good to join a conference, it's that there's no reason for us to. We're not going to join one for the sake of joining one.   We've won national championships in women's soccer, fencing, and women's basketball recently, and are competing in each of those every year. We're also really strong in men's soccer, men's lacrosse, and men's hockey, and have a good but not great men's basketball program. I think our tennis teams are usually pretty good, too. Women's lacrosse has also been good in the last few years. Our rugby team was good until they got disbanded for selling the vans they rented to go on a trip in the 90s to buy alcohol and drugs, but it's back and doing alright.   Except in 1989.   This is why I don't want us to join the Big Ten. No desire to be on the wrong end of a bunch of 2-whatever votes.   It shouldn't take Mad Men for you to realize this.   I think I'd take another year of Eifert over Rudolph honestly. It'd be pretty close. I also think we're weaker at WR next year than TE so I'd probably go with Golden. Plus Golden was just awesome.   Mendoza!   And as Amy Poehler once said, BC is the Harvard of Boston.   Someone never read [The Official Pokemon Handbook](http://i.imgur.com/YOkOqpo.jpg) as a kid.

    [This heathen] (http://www.evike.com/products/51540/)  [Also the short one] (http://www.evike.com/products/51534/)   So in a toaster, there must be something that controls the amount of heat allowed to be put in the wirey things that make the heat.  In theory, could I take out or disable whatever this is and put the toaster together and see what happens? Instant toast?             THANKS CRATE AND XYSTED FOR SHOWING ME THE LIGHT         I'm doing a presentation on depression in adolescence for my sociology class and since I have no friends or people to survey at my school I'd like to ask you guys some questions here if that's allowed. If only teens could answer that'd be ideal, but if you guys remember being depressed as teens/have had depression since your teen years I'd love those answers too.   1. How old are you?   2. Are you male of female?   3. At what age were you diagnosed with depression?   4. What is depression like for you?   5. What is the root of your depression?    If this type of post then I don't mind if it's deleted, but if you guys could answer I'd love to bring light to this topic in my presentation. This survey would help a lot.    I really want to do a loadout with all OD green gear, or a mixture of OD green and tan. I'm mostly leaning towards all OD though because camo can be a hassle and I just want something simple, effective, and that won't break the budget.   How effective can solid color loadouts be? Do any of you guys have solid colored loadouts you could post for reference?       I got my feels hurt :(   I'm super excited. Not sure of the quality but there are plenty of seeders and the comments say it's good quality.   https://kickass.so/american-sniper-2014-dvdscr-x264-playnow-t10047701.html#main   I keep getting flooded with different suggestions from Meep and Dacrate and I just need a solid list of three shows. Lately my thing has been slice of life, shit with good lessons at the end of show, mind fucks, , and good character development (i.e. toradora, mikakunin de shinkoukei, sakurasou no pet na kanojo, welcome to the nhk)  I need answers and options people, shoot.                   Cameroncock said it would be today and I can't find anything saying so nor do I have the one year club thingy. I was assuming that I'd get that right when it was my cakeday or something. What do. I want to shitpost mp5k on /r/airsoft.    What are your guys' New Years resolutions? Mine is to do more meaningful things and to be better than I am now.    lolwut  I DIDN'T SPELL ANYTHING WRONG      I looked up the soundtracks and bgm's on youtube and I can't seem to find the song I'm looking for. It sounds like there are some sorts of deeper string instruments, and it plays during the scene that the Sleeping Knights are taking their picture by the wall. It also plays before this when Asuna and Kirito are flying back to their cabin they lived in during the Aincrad arc. It appears countless other times in the show but this is all I could think of for how to find it off of the top of my head. Any help would be great, I need to download this song somehow.       I've decided on playing a designated marksman/sniper-ish role and I've been researching a lot of different rifles and found myself really digging really long snipers and guns of the 7.62 variety. After looking around I thought a G3 would really fit this role. Sadly, the only decent option would be the Classic Army G3, which I can't find in stock anywhere or the Tokyo Marui G3, but I don't like ordering from non-American retailers because of shipping price. This left me with the option of the JG G3, or the Marui PSG-1 which I was far more welcoming of. Also, I love how it looks and it's *loooooong*.  After digging through pages of Google searches and picking through YouTube trying to find a decent review or video of it in action, I couldn't find much. All that I really got out of my research was that it had a weird air nozzle or cylinder or something, it's old, and it's **creaky.** The creaky thing was the most stressed out of anything, which I don't really mind.   Now, I'm not the tech savviest guy. I can change a hop-up, motor, and some other junk. Nothing too godly. My concern is that this gun won't perform as I need it to stock, and I'm not sure I can do what I need to get it shooting great. I know there are plenty of other guns in the price point that will outperform this gun a thousand times over, but I can't get over the great look of the PSG and I want something unique.   Will the Marui PSG-1 be worth it if I get it? Will it make all of my wildest operator dreams come true? Or should I get researching another option for my designated marksman adventures?   I'm delving into the world of sneakier gameplay and the designated marksman sort of role, and have mostly everything planned out. Except for a side arm. Now I've had bad experiences with GBB's and I want something that I can play with all year that won't die on me. Now I've narrowed down my choices and read/watched about every review about some of my choices, but I'm still iffy.  Tokyo Marui MP7 AEP is my first choice because I've heard nothing but good things about it, I heard that it's quieter and have seen videos of it shooting and it seemed quieter than the normal AEG/AEP.   My next choice would be the Galaxy/CYMA MP5K but it's hard to find in the US and I've heard mixed reviews about it. What's nice about the MP5K is that it uses a normal gearbox so maintainence isn't as big of a deal.   My final choice would be the JG MAC-10 or possibly the marui, but I want to keep it HK for the sake of my guns matching. The JG seems nice though and sturdy. It's also really really quiet from the videos I've seen of it shooting.   I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. What are your guys' opinions? Are any of these a good choice? Do you guys have any good options or ideas?   All of my what, http://www.evike.com/products/50670/               To give a little background, I just turned 17 on the third, don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Some of my Reddit friends may see that I posted this, I don't really care. I want to travel the world and I want more now. I live in a shitty small town of only 1,000 to 1,200 people. At this point in my life my grades are only good enough to get out of highschool. I own a small business doing graphic design and articles, and I wash dishes at a local restaurant and started training to cook, but that won't get me anywhere. I need to take charge but it's so hard. When I graduate I'm either going to be a neet, or working my shitty jobs living in a shitty apartment. Now, I've had plans to take two years of general studies and get some sort of art degree, but I don't think that will get me where I want to be or anything. I just want to help people and see the world, and get away.  Now that that's out of the way. I would follow my uncle's footsteps and join the military, but even then I don't think it'd be worth it. I don't believe in anything that we're fighting for. Would joining the peace corps or whatever work? Should I just pack up and leave when I turn 18 and freelance? I'm at my wits end, but the only thing I really want now is to be away and to help people.    I thought it was bullpups, ak's, and other things but I've finally realized, it's 7.62 stuff with big magazines. SCAR-H's, FAL's, M14's, G3's. Love em'.      In a group of friends we are conducting one of the first studies on weaboos, why they happen, and other stuff. We're even going as far as going to an anime con to interview ourselves some weabs and get primary source information. Then we're filming it all, and making a documentary. Wish me luck. You guys got any articles or sources?         I got this idea for a show. You take a bunch of tactical gear with googly eyes and attach them to strings like puppets, and the main character is a shemagh with googly eyes who has a blog. They are all best friends. It would be called, "Shemagh with a Blog."  Let's make millions.      Feelsgoodman.                  I have to record all results so I have to put that and the sweary words in my report lol. She probably won't care though and I got enough info to complete the assignment, thanks.          I just stuffed that fucker with toilet paper and turned it on over and over again. By the time I was done it was making smoke. Should I go back and stop it?                        https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2jwc9k/vladimir_lenin_and_me/  You know, with your obsession with Russian stuff lately this only makes sense.    **SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY** ONLY WITNESS THE HANDICAPPED HORROR, THE BED RIDDEN BEDLAM, AND THE RETRIBUTION OF THE RETARDED. IT'S GOING **DOWN**.   If they ever made a live action movie of the anime Steins;Gate, [Keanu Reeves] (https://hollywoodhatesme.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/keanu-reeves.jpg) would be perfect for the part of the main character [Okabe Rintarou] (http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122643.jpg) if he slicked back his hair messily.           All of the sudden I have this harem of SMG's I want to buy and I am very confuse. It's between the new [Echo 1 Spectre] (http://www.evike.com/products/49769) and the [KWA Scorpion.] (http://www.evike.com/products/49710) Turns out Tuesday I got paid so now I have $200~ more than I thought. I'm on the verge of just buying both guns. Will I regret this decision? I still have to pay my dad for my car but that would only be another month of work. I am confuse.    Now all Eastern bloc and Russian guns seem cool to me. The want started with an AKS-74UN then to RPK, but now I just want to buy everything Russian and Eastern European. Fuck.    [Linkerino.] (http://www.evike.com/products/49710/)  I'm thinking of just picking one up next check for plinking around and for fun until more magazines come out. Also, people will be scouring YouTube for reviews and even if I put out a average to shit-tier review people will eat it up and I'll get views.    And yes EzDeezer, I know American Psycho is. *Shhhhh*  I haven't watch anything but Comedy Central and anime for months so my knowledge of movies is pretty dead. Also I need shit to read and keep me busy in class.   **DISCUSS**      Drawing sucks. I will post my shitty art project tomorrow because it is ber operator.   Have any of you guys even taken a shitty drawing class?                     Look promising at least. I've still had my HERO2 for awhile so it might be time for an upgrade. What action cams do you guys have?  Edit: Linkerino, http://www.evike.com/products/49539/      That is all. Also I know about the other chat sub for the super secret cool kids so you guys should approve me.          If so, **OH MY GOD IT'S SO MUCH MOR-**   They're making  up for that last season if you ask me, but now there's guns and stuff so it's like 25% better.    So every day of the week is dress up, and I think that I'm going to dress up like a terrorist as a joke. Monday is dress like a hero day so I think that'll be funny.    I think pudding is a beverage.    Usually I get up do all of my morning stuff and go to school. Today I grabbed a handful of anxiety medicine and some sort of pain killers and jammed them in my pocket. Took something my dad was taking for eye surgery pain and that made the walk to school way better. It was fucking awesome.   Walking to school was awesome. Sitting in class was awesome. I actually talked to people and didn't give a fuck about how I looked. Psycho ex girlfriend's friend stabbed me in the hand with a pencil and I shrugged it off and called her a stupid cunt. Everything was fun and had meaning. It was weird.   Whenever I would get in trouble in class before the teacher said what I did bad I would just take the detention, tell them what I did, explain why I know it's wrong and why I have fun being a dick, and then I'd go off to my next class. They didn't even have anything to say I was so on top of shit all day.          That is all. They didn't like my shitty average M4. Should I take a picture of it on my bed in the dark with a cellphone or something, because there are people who are getting more upvotes just doing that.       It's like six terabytes of the word poop and I'm going to put it in the shared files so a bunch of people open it. *Hue hue hue*         Supposedly there's a bunch of methane in Texas drinking water or something the front page told me. Catbrain needs to light the water from his tap on fire and post the results.       They don't though.   What things do you guys like to dip in coffee? I like me a good apple cider doughnut or cinnamon Poptart with my coffee. One time I even dipped beef jerky in coffee (who knows why) and it tasted pretty good.       Found it on /r/teenagers, just type in mermur.it and it'll pop up.       I know the SRC is more realistic, and the KWA is better performance wise, but this gun is a nice middle ground. Should I get this pistol and take the risk? I know it will be better than the SRC because I've seen shotty reviews on the SRC. The SRC looks like a better collector's weapon than a skirmishing weapon. I really want a TT-33, and I really want a pistol. [The gun in question.] (http://www.evike.com/products/44404/)   I'm so tired and depressed I can't even force any jokes today. Feels like I'm going to crash and burn.    I don't think it's too bad for a first time  http://i.imgur.com/l9Knbacl.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/0jqUAMpl.jpg      What would happen if someone were to poo in a metal box, and then weld a lid on there and leave the box for a few years. Like, would the poo be gone?    I wish there was a game like Skyrim with a vast free roam and mountains, but imagine if there were huge and unimaginable monsters and beasts. Like mind boggling size and awe. I've always been fascinated with that concept and I wish something would come out. I'm talking like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/I6Vh4L1.jpg) big that just roam around and shit. The best part would be landscapes like Skyrim where you can just fucking go and go man.    Makes you feel like you're fucking autistic and when you have no missing assignments on a Monday you get a treat like a fucking child. There's also this point system she's talking about with coupons like I'm in second grade. The only upside is that I can usually burn through two episodes of an anime and she doesn't notice. Wtf.    I have no clue what is happening. I just take everything home and do it there.      Do not watch this. It will make you sad.   :(   :(   I am seeing if we can or not by posting this. Don't mind little old me.   Edit: No, no we can't.  *Sigh*   Now I have to wait six days to watch the new SAO? Last week I could watch it right when I woke up. Now I can't watch it before going to my shitty job like I always do. Wtf.    So right after I grabbed on to the casket to pallbearerer or whatever my phone went off. The Fresh Prince of Bell Air theme song. It rang throughout the crowd of appalled family members and the large cemetery. Since the casket was so heavy, and we were already carrying it I couldn't get to my phone to turn it off and the phone was left in my pocket to play the whole time we carried it to the grave. What the fuck. Why.    Just kidding they aren't. I don't want to go. I am not sad and I don't care that the relative that died is dead. This is more painful to me because now I can't go to work tonight. I would rather make money.    What is happening I am very confuse.   Edit: I am not learning anything wtf   I'm a fairly short guy and I ordered a Barrett as most of the regulars on the sub know. I've watched a lot of videos but I never realized how big the Barrett actually is. It's like 4.7 feet long, and I'm not a very tall guy. Will this be fine? Will I die of exhaustion just heaving it around?       This thing just began working so I can post some shit. I have nothing to post, but do you guys have to deal with stupid shit like this? School issued Ipads or anything?   Yeah it just turned on and has been running on the charger for about ten minutes. Lel.       After five years of usage my DSi died today. It's been across the US from Wisconsin, to South Dakota. It's even been to Canada. My DSi has gone with me through various moves, and different houses as well. I was 11 when I first got it. I remember going to Gamestop with my dad to get it, and being first in line at the stroke of 12:00 AM. I remember the giddy excitement and first turning it on and tinkering with it during the car ride home. I remember pure joy.   It didn't have a name or anything, just my initials carved in the back. I've beaten countless games, and played through many games of Pokemon with it. I've beaten many people too with my DSi, and won many battles. I've had many great times during lunch with friends playing Pokemon,  trading, battling. I've had countless adventures. I've had many a good memory with my DSi in hand.   Over the course of the past five years I've taken my DSi all over the US. When I was 11, I took my DSi to Washington, Alaska, and even Canada. I remember taking it to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, and through the bustling Pike's Place Fish Market. While taking a cruise in Alaska I played my DSi looking to the open ocean. I took it to the beautiful Butchart Gardens of British Columbia, Canada. When I was living at my grandfathers farm my sisters and I took a trip to South Dakota. I remember sitting in the beating sun looking over the barren Badlands with my DSi in hand. I even took pictures of a rabbit we found with my DSi.   While moving from my grandfathers house to where I lived on the golf course I remember buying Pokemon White, the game I played until today. By now the corners were smashed/damaged and the L and R buttons on top didn't even work. As long as I could play Pokemon I was content. While working on the house, painting, and during the move I remember good times defeating the new game while taking breaks. While living at this house though I took a break from my DSi. This time was spent diving into the world of Call of Duty and X-box, so I would fit in with others. My DSi took it's rest in my desk drawer collecting dust.   A year or so would pass, and eventually I would move into the house I am living in now. During the move I found my DSi, and dug up a charger. After plugging it in, bingo, it worked. I started a new game on Pokemon White and began to play a lot more. My X-box had become repetitive, but I found time for both game systems. This past year was the most time I had ever spent playing on my DSi and I even made a good friend in the process.   With the introduction of school issued I-pads I figured, more people were playing games, and if I were to play my DSi nobody would care. This I was correct on, and I would begin my day in Photography class on Pokemon White smart mouthing the teacher. This I regret, however playing I do not. I would find time in the hallways to play, during my study halls in the school library, and in Geometry class. I had been playing one day during lunch and a now good friend Jacob struck up a conversation about what I was playing. Before this I never talked with about much, and Pokemon became our common ground. Every day we would play during lunch and get stronger, battle, trade. This past year was great, and my DSi was being used to it's full potential.   Today, while waiting for my student teacher conference I sat in the car, and sipped on my cup of coffee. I felt around in my pocket for my DSi, which I always carried with me. I flipped it open as usual, clicked and tapped away, and played Pokemon like usual. While playing the screen froze. Odd enough, but I thought it was probably the cartridge. I turned it off, closed it, and took out the game. I inspected the game, and the slot. Everything seemed normal so I plugged the game cartridge back in and turned it on. It turned on, but the screen was white. It remained frozen and then shut off. Since the battery was fully charged from the night before, I attempted to turn it on again. Nothing. I had assumed the worst, closed my DSi, and came to terms with it's demise before going to my conference.   5 years of pure joy is what my Nintendo DSi had brought me, and it was worth every penny. There are so many other adventures I've left out of this, but so many that will not be forgotten. I used my DSi until the day it couldn't run, and simply couldn't turn on. 5 years of pure joy.   http://imgur.com/a/T26Ny      I have one last chance to make my last day of summer mean something.   Just kidding, I'm probably going to watch anime and eat in the dark while people do things and don't invite me.       Mine was probably about a minute ago, I picked up a sock to blow my nose and it was  a fap sock. I still blew my nose with it though.   Either that, or to get my current job I got the old cook re-addicted to crack so he would get fired.       Ground up.    Pretty shitty last day to say the least, and I had it all planned out to make it the best last day of summer ever.   **Fuck Up No. 1**   I planned to go for a walk with this girl I like and then go back to her place to play guitar and shit. This was supposed to be at 12:00 in the afternoon, I woke up merely twenty minutes ago as I write this.  **Fuck Up No. 2**   My pizza oven broke and my regular oven isn't working. I really really wanted a stuffed crust Tombstone pizza to lift my mood.  **Fuck Up No. 3**   The girl mentioned before called me. You know when you answer the phone and you're nervous and you accidentally hang up? Ha, well of course that happened. Oh also, now she thinks I'm mad at her.   **Fuck Up No. 4**   So when I'm bummed out, sometimes shooting my airsoft guns is fun. I went to grab my good ol' [JG AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/BqMGLVH.jpg) from the wall to plink around at some cans. It would not fire. I take off the barrel and receiver and look around inside looking for some sort of answer. Nothing. Fucked. My dad is letting me order my new gun when he gets home anyways, so hey not too bad.   **Fuck up No. 5**   My grandmother died. Fell down the stairs, hit her head, aneurysm, whatever. I don't care that she died, I just don't want to miss work for a funeral. I want to make money. Also, I have to be a pallbearer and I don't want to carry heavy things while people stare at me. Fuck.   Well at least I have some anime and instant coffee to make this day at least 25% better. How is/was your guys' last day of summer?             My friend called me a bitch, I ain't even mad. Now I hear [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-t06qBtiJk) song and get bummed out.       Their new album is out October 7th if any of y'all are stoked. I know I'm super fucking pumped because I'm 83% sure it will redeem their last piece of shit. The name of the album is kind of lame though (Everything Will Be All Right in the End) so we'll see.    I'm such a loser that I've watched so much anime to know what some of the Japanese stuff says.   HA.    I was just having a conversation with a friend and realized this, I mean I guess that's how any band name is formed but still.   Like, "Ricky Ross and the Staplers"   "Plywood and Pete"   "Street Curb something something"   "Camera Lense McCarmichael and the Nickel Train"   The possibilities are endless.    Well I guess how they smell is a matter of opinion, but I'm talking about [these] (http://stinkbugsguide.net/brown-marmorated-stink-bug.jpg) little fuckers. But you know I always thought, where do they come from? What do the little baby ones look like?  Well, while I was cleaning up dog poo today I looked in the garden wheelbarrow where there were some old zucchini and sure enough, there were [little baby ones living all over it.] (http://i.imgur.com/P8o8A93.jpg)   Sorry, the picture is bad because they were flying at me and stuff, but they were the same thing. I'm like 97% percent sure.  Edit: Well fuck I guess I can take [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwPsqP87l64feature=youtu.be) too.      This is somewhat random but I just stumbled upon the thought reading some manga.    For me,   **1.** Coffee   **2.** Elite Force BB's   **3.** New book/manga   **4.** The oven at work   **5.** Autumn leaves    What about you guys?  Edit: Oh yeah, A1 steak sauce. That stuff is my shit.    I told him that just because the gun is heavy doesn't mean it's realistic and he replied,   "I know but I mean the heaviness makes it feel like you have a real weapon. Air soft is a great sport don't get me wrong but paintball is more of a rush when playing since being shot in the head with a paintball gun can kill you if they cheat where as with air soft gun hurt but the worst it can do is break skin or hit an eye."  Wat.   Edit: I looked up the annual injuries in paintball, averaging around 20 per every 100,00 annual players. I also showed him a chart and demolished this argument. I'll post what he says next.   Another Edit: He said he had to go do chores and that the argument was over. Ha.      Yeah, it doesn't work worth shit. Fuck whoever told me this.   Also, Starbucks Instant coffee packets actually taste like real coffee and they don't taste bad.    I want some to randomly put in montage parodies or airsoft montages. I like [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upkYQqbrjSc) song.   You guys got any?  	138
 Hes retired    It was a movie about a guy who lost his family in a car crash and the girl who killed them a drama story basically, it could have been its own movie without the Other Earth storyline.    Yeah I mean it was a good movie I liked it but just seems like a huge wasted opportunity.    Yeah the first one was stupid but I did like the AVP fight scene thats about it. The second was a little better but not that much.    Another Earth    Its pretty good cant wait to see what the rest of the season brings!!!!!!    Yeah she is now the new Jennifer Lawrence and Shailene Woodley.    She was a little underrated before both this and Jack Reacher made her a little bigger. Hopefully she gets some well deserved recognition for this one!!! Might I also mention that she was very sexy in GG too.    Yes she was really good in it I am hoping this movie raises her profile more.    I dont think neither won its left deliberately ambiguis.    I watched a trailer for this movie with Haley Joel Osment called Home of the Giants and it literally gave away the entire movie. I felt bad now after watching the trailer first from that point on I never do that.    Maybe    I liked it, it was Homeland I like how they have a new start with new storylines and stuff. Just what this show needs.    Whenever I have an argument or someone has wronged me I usually imagine myself getting revenge on the person often in horrific ways. Example I was fired a few months ago and the boss was so unforgiving about it he is an ass and sometimes I imagine myself returning to work there and taking him out. the same with my dad I dont like him that mush and I imagine making him pay. Just thought I would put that to writing.    I also remember a movie with Robert Redford and Willem dafoe called The clearing that is rated R for literally 1 F bomb.    As well as some graphic nudity.    I Love You Phillip Morris.    Lost in Translation is rated R for one brief scene of nudity but I have seen other pg13 movies with more nudity than that that didnt get R.    jax doesnt know that he was high when he said it plus he doesnt really have a good track record with the club.    I wish he had killed Lin and all of his guys that way he can be done with this pointless vendetta.    thats what I was thinking and I hope that that happens.    Me too what scares me the most about that is that it can actually happen that thought just gives me the shivers.     I just used my fist to break my fall that was it.    Just leave dude dont let your life get any worse.    Yeah true.    Its entertaining, thats about it.    I dot have a job ATM so whenever I somehow scrape together some cash and I am a little short I go into my dads room and grab a few quarters. Over the past year it must have equaled 20 dollars. I kinda feel bad but not really cuz he is an asshole.    Jesus FUCKING CHRIST!!!!!!! I didnt mean to hit you it was an accident I tripped and hit you on the back with my fist it was a complete accident you did not need to act like i actually hit you for no reason because I didnt!!!!! And you made me look like a fool in front of my fucking MOTHER!!!!!!! You are a piece of shit I always hated you!!!!!! You dont know what an accident is or use common sense like I was trying to explain to you, you just started yelling at me for no fucking reason!!!!! You are a piece of shit and I officially hate you now.    Mike Myers - The Love guru    Charlie Wilson is indirectly responsible for 9/11.    it took WAY to long to come out and it just wasnt as good as its predecessor.    Yes    Never seen it.    Good one    What are some good ones???    Best Actress fo sho if she gets a nom tho.    Yes she probably went to China for a few years in the universe anyways.    I used to get Abbie Cornish and Katherine Heigl confused     Christopher Meloni and Elias Koteas    YES!!!!!!!!!!!    Also because of all the nudity and stuff plus I thought anything Gay related automatically got an R Rating.    Joe Dirts dad    I always wondered why Chuck and Larry is Rated PG13 it seems R Rated to me.    LOVED it it was an exact adaptation of the book also loved the performances especially Rosamund Pike she was so DAM SEXY in that movie!!!!!!    Yes he is a good actor and one of my favorites I wish he would become an A Lister again. He just needs the right role I guess.    Exactly.    I didnt like it at all I wish at least one of them died or something. Cant wait to see the movie tho!!!!!    Fina-Freakin-LY    Bale    let the Harry Potter jokes begin!!!!!    Breaking Bad    They r all about the same but my personal favorite out of the 3 is Phoenix he is so good in all of his roles.    Tusk and I want my mind erased of everything I knew about the movie beforehand too so I could watch it blind.    yes I will.    LOVED IT!!!!! A bit disturbing at some parts but still funny and weird all at the same time.    Yes    halloween the original.    Interesting    Yeah I am, almost done with the book just like 80 pages left and stuff.    K I got some reading to do then but first i have to finish Gone Girl in time for Friday LOL.    Oh alright im gonna keep going I think I heard Brans storyline doesnt add up in the books and tv show anyways.    Yes thats why they became decepticons they r basically Megatrons Children.    Alright cool I will keep reading then, its just so long and I already know whats gonna happen.    BOOOOOOOOOOOO    I am currently reading the Game of Thrones books and I am on book 2 a clash of kings but I am wondering if I should just skip ahead to book 4 because I have already seen the tv show and know what happens. what should I do??    I liked it a very realistic revenge film and well made to for a debut film.    cool    Gemmas secret not getting out.    Yeah I like seeing them at church now it doesnt really happen that much.    Wolverine 3 will come out a year later I believe.    All    Star Wars    Yes would love to see more of Davids adventures and what villains he would encounter.    Yeah he is a good actor wish he was in more movies that would challenge him tho instead of just playing Bruce Willis all the time.    Mostly cuz he is a part of a worldwide Cult but aside from that I like him he is a good actor and I have only seen him in a few bad movies.    Good    Did u miss Mel Gibson???    The Cabin in the Woods I thought it was gonna be another horror movie where everyone dies but I was pleasantly surprised now it is one of my favorite movies.    Furry Vengeance happened.    Why is there a picture of Godzilla???    i am a student studying something else now and i am currently looking for a new job.    I went to film school for a year and a half.    I agree with everything u just typed I hope Dumb to will bring his career back and that he will become a leading man again it has been forever and yeah I dont think I will ever watch Mr Poppers Peguins even if he is in it. He is like my all time favorite actor.    Jim Carrey    Finally some good news about this project.    Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.    Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.    Oh yeah thats what I like.    It is awesome nothing can stop it now!!!! I am glad AOS is here that way I can get my weekly dose.    It could go either way I wouldnt mind seeing Marks be a badass again and actually killing someone.    So the club is now going to kill at least 3 people every episode now?? AWESOME!!!!!     Yes loved that part its good to see Marks threatening people again instead of being all goody goody.    Not really movie news plus that is Colin Farrell    Cant wait for the trailer!!!!    Not at all    Oh yes and IMO there has never been a more perfect time to play that song in a movie.    Thank you    Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks also Jim Carrey    Interesting theory how have I not thought of this already.    LOL    O okay well I am not religious even if I was I wouldnt care LOL.    I have always wanted to read the books and see what happens. I think I will now.    probably       Likely Juice before he is finally killed by Jax.    He was just misunderstood or something like that.    Jason Bateman NOOOO!!!!!!!!    Yeah that would have been cool.    YES!!!!!!!    Hobo With a Shotgun    Memento, The Dark Knight, Star Wars Episode III, and now Tusk   	111

 Dude I know... BS2 gets hate sometimes but I loved it, while the story did have afew plot holes I felt it improved on everything else especially combat and atmosphere (plus Minerva's den is probably one of my fave DLC's of all time)   Didn't superman kill more people in MOS then Godzilla in the latest Godzilla film?    Should I buy it? (I own all the bioshocks and love them all to death especially BS2) EDIT: Bought SS2 and I'm really surprised on how well it holds up (game play wise any way) It was definitely worth the 3$ and I also am hearing some sound effects that were used in BS1     I found a bunk file in my uninstall, removed it and everything is fine now :)    At my school some kids have speakers in their back packs... Needless to say its fucking irritating    Thanks :)   Recently I downloaded VLC media player off a bad site and it screwed with internet explorer and chrome (slower then normal and pop-ups). I was able to find where the junk files installed and deleted the file and completely cleared my browser cash but chrome is still running slow and while it happens a lot less then before I'm still getting pop-ups. Virus scans show nothing (windows defender) (I don't know my specs from memory so I will update this later if need be).   Wow man! Thanks for this, I could never really pin down what nu-style was so I guessed as much but form the bottom of my heart... Thanks :) P.S. Yoji is awesome (still trying to find a place where I can buy airport :/)   One of Shingo's older songs, the kick isn't great and with youtube being what it was back in 09 the quality is a little rough. Look past that however and you will be hooked! P.S. If your into speedcore check out Shingo's other alias Round Wave Crusher (RWC)      I AM RADIATING HYPE LIKE A SUPER SAYAN!   I see what you mean   I use to draw the line at Gabber but now I've heard it all, Speedcore all the way up to extra tone. I traveled to the edge of the abyss, listened and enjoyed what I heard :^ )   :( I didn't get to see the show because the the venue was 18+    Slum Village - Fall in love (Moody Good Remix)   Life with a monster girl..... ^^^^^^^^^^^Iwasneverhere   Captain: "Run full speed and just don't think about it"  Crew member: "But captain I don't think..."   Captain: "Don't think about it"    OMG! That's the exact sign from FO3   FO:NV   EDIT: Just rememberd that Bethesda was the publisher for this game   His FB page is still active but as for realeases IDK      I don't really know of any albums but have you tried hard trance? :) It's great for zoning out and quite a few of the songs I have heard have a bit of a sci-if feel to them :) check out the song "disarray" by Lisa lashes, Alex kidd   Kidd kaos (be sure to let me know if you need suggestions :D   Not exactaly what I'm looking for but thanks for showing me this :) it's got a really nostalgic vibe to it   Dose anyone know of any songs that have propaganda samples form WWII or The Cold War?   Do you guys know of any songs with samples of propaganda from WWII or The Cold War   He also tweeted at nanobii that he loved his music    Yes! Happy Hardcore FTW! If you like this track you might also like UK Hardcore and Hands-Up!   You mean Castles in the sky by DJ Satomi? That song is my jam!      Ohhhh.... I see what you mean and no I don't think so   Man... Qlimax 2006 looked like it was a lot of fun! Who did the anthem for this one?   I don't understand the question   NP :)   Neilio releases on labels like dirtyworkz and skranix (Hardstyle labes)   I haven't heard of any of those guys before! Guess I got to do some searching :)    Track list:   Showtek - FTS (Peacekeepers edit)  PREFIX   Destiny - Artillery   Kold Konexion - GFY  E-Force   Luna - Masterclass (hardcore edit)  Art of Fighters - Tears Of Blood (Merkurius remix)  Koozah - Type Zero   Mayhem   Antiserum - Bangladesh/Trippy (AniMe Bootleg)  Alek Szahala - Voices Of Babylon  Trancend - Frankenstein   Brodster - Aviation   nanobii - sugar rush  Rhythmics - Candy   Angerfist - Temple Of Disease  Meander - Greyscale  Nosferatu   Tha Playah - Fade To Nothing  Angerfist - Street Fighter  Angerfist - Incoming  Lolishit - Breakawaii  Round Wave Crusher - Throw Your Pet Into The Animal Crusher   Round Wave Crusher - Nonononononononon (Best girl)  Round Wave Crusher - Happy Hardgore (Torrent This)  Round Wave Crusher - Reach the Speed (Immortal core)  Round Wave Crusher - Bloodiest Moon (Brutal Emotions)  Round Wave Crusher - Born In 1600 (Bpm)  Round Wave Crusher - ENDINGCORE (This track IS MINE!!!)      Da Tweekaz are incredible!! They make the best euphoric stuff   I'm really not trying to be a genre nazi but, Hardcore + DnB = Crossbreed and Breakbeat + Hardcore = Breakcore   Also if your looking to get into freeform check out [Alek Szahala](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc)   Also while he isn't japanese, Shingo DJ/Round Wave Crusher has done a lot of touhou remixes and samples a lot of Hentai/Anime for his songs   Sure :)  [Kobaryo](http://youtu.be/vnc6VykRI7E)  [M-Project](http://youtu.be/YwObmfcw0xw)  [M1dy](http://youtu.be/DTnHdWA9WTE)   Duuuudeee!!! Japanese hard dance is the best! Kobaryo, M-Project and M1dy FTW!!   Remember when Prizyms first started posting Hardstyle to the sub? Well it's been a while and I have to ask, how dose everyone feel about hard dance now? I Actually love it more then I ever thought I would! I've been listening to genres I though I would always hate (speedcore and beond)       LOVE R.O. Belgian swing was amazing!    theirs a art to being a charming ass and Joel nails it    "Dike Martians" I guess monstercat's home planet was pretty kinky (   )   He also loves hardstyle   Especially so if said artists have done work with noisia!   You guys should bug nick to get a reddit account   Maby a part for string bass? :D   It's awesome knowing that you like bee and puppy cat   EDIT: what did you think of the first two episodes?   All we need is nick and the entirety of evol intent will be here      Computer club ILY M8 p.s. The liquid was amazing 3   Monstercat should meet a girl monstercat at some point. I think that would be cute   Prizymz actually is spinnin' (he dose their cover art)      If your not familiar with EVOL Intent, it is a group of three guys (one of those guys being bro safari) who mainly make DnB and have done songs with Noisia and give out a lot of their music for free over soundcloud    Your GQ comes with a free car, but you gotta pay tax    Ill do my best senpai!!!! (  )   any idea where i can find some good reads on supersaws? :)   Dose anyone know of any good patches/tutorials? I have the FL signature bundle and harmor if that helps :)      [Downlink and Calvertron - Immortal (F3tch Remix)](http://www.beatport.com/track/immortal-f3tch-remix/5773480)        TFW when you don't have a monstercat to snuggle with   Kawaii AF + DnB x nanobii - possible cover art by skrillbug if he chooses to finish this = ()*:    It's one of the songs that got me started on trance    Wow that's a good remix! [heres a link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y) to RWC's remix of reach for the moon immortal smoke   If your interested you should checkout some of shingo's other thohou remixes, he's done a lot. (He's also remixed a few songs as Round Wave Crusher)   I will do the best I can :)   Just downloaded Bad Boi   the uncaged remixes. Looking at my Traktor library I'm sitting on a lot of PBN songs, sooo mega mix anyone.... All the PBN songs I have (excluding the one's I can't mix nicely) originals and remixes   Not a huge fan of the kick in this one but if you look past it and listen to the melody you will be hooked!!!       That sounds awesome!!!! It could be a genre use to classify futile Japan style trance   Why can't people just leave the poor guy alone?   Plus more money to swery means a better chance of D4 Pt.2 coming out   Your pickles come with a free car but you got to pay tax on it   Swery should get a reddit account so people can ask him about clam chowder    I see him!     0_0 wow... And I thought Mordor was inhospitable before. This would actually be really cool in the movies though, a place where you are either freezing or super hot, all while being watched by the eye   Like pats many little babby yelps could be used for text notifications   "AH!" Ooo it looks like I got a text   Oh wow :( I just got a really sad though in my head... It's of shep. Going into the gun room and seeing one of the those tags hanging from one of the guns and silently weeping because she got the Turian she loved killed   Ya up here in Wisconsin it gets down to -10 F at night   Come on man learn the lore, everyone knows the Asari evolved from crabs /s   you'd probably want WAV. or higher for modding   EDIT: Actually you could use MP3's it just depends on how well compressed they are   I didn't notice the legs until you guys pointed it out.... jeez it looks like Liara was staying in the uncanny valley when this was painted     The thumbnail makes it look like shes doing [this](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121209083120/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/a/a6/Mckayla_is_Unimpressed.png), Cool shep. though! :D   Bring it here bro *opens arms for hugz*   I think they would make really cool one shots for DJing   I would really like one in red (purple is a sweet color but I've always liked the red hoods better)    Oh the fun I will have with this in FL 11   Freeform!!!! Check out Alek Szahala    You might like freeform :) it's a combination of hardcore and trance. [Check this one out](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc)         Woa... :0 thanks dude!   I've been getting into the genre lately and I was woundering if some one could give me some suggestions :)   Actually their all full tracks (with a few edits thrown in)   I accidentally deleted my comment with all the songs I linked :I I'll just give them to you and link them later   Ophidian - Sounds of the machine   Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) - Greyscale  Angerfist - And Jeasus wept   Kobaryo - Clock Control   I:gor - The Devil has a name  Outside Agency - Hours   Dreams  S3rl - Feel the melody    Thanks man!   In E-force's song seven the tempo goes up at the second climax and then goes back to 150 for the next, dose anyone know what the tempo goes up to? I'm having a hard time figuring it out    If you showed him a pic of that he would block you on Twitter    Hard Dance: Kobaryo (he's already had a few releases on mob squad but it would be cool to see him bring the gabber sound to MC)   All right m7s let's get to know eachother a little better :), I absolutely love hard dance! If you don't know what that is it's stuff like hardcore, hardstyle, hard house, hard trance .etc   How did you get out of Skyrim with the war going on? (Torbjrn is the most Skyrimish name I have ever heard)   Scary monsters and nice sprites will always have a special place in my heart   Lisa lashes v.s Alex Kidd and Kidd Kaos - Dissaray (amazing hard trance)   Oh..... OH! Ow    During sophomore year (last year) this freshman girl came to school with face paint on. I'm talking full face cheeta patern..... P.S. You sound like a cool girl :)   toonie?   I remember back in middle school in the wake of COD black ops people would sharpen pencils to a dangerous point and whip them at each other while yelling "Tomahawk!" I think one kid got stuck in the leg with a colored pencil    I followed the advice given to me and I have to say I'm happy with how it turned out, I updated the [PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing) and the [mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession-update) (this one flows a lot better), I also dropped Breakcore in favor of Tekstyle and I think a certain someone on this sub will be happy with my hardstyle song choice ;) *cough cough* /u/audiofrq       I know the pic he's talking about!! Allow me to do some digging   EDIT: [Found it!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/bb0681713936b617bc3d3ac099dbaee7/tumblr_muqkczkYBi1s0aezvo1_250.png) sorry the image is so small   [this](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/skeleton-war)    Fuck boy (can't quote right because I'm on mobile), When the skeleton war starts I'm going to find Cameron Dallas and put his head on a pike   Have you heard his latest album? One word... Lush   we must de-Liam them before the milk goes sour and makes woolie (and anyone really) vomit    Where do I sign up?!   Woa Jack of sound... on Mcat.... 3   The R Is Silent is amazing! great combo of neruo and dubstep   Did anyone notice the ships shadow? It was like 20FPS    ...will help Liam pay off his vita, ...will help us get Liam out of the vents, ...will help Liam get gud, ...Will help save school girls from Liam (all I got for now)  EDIT: it should cut to Liam holding his vita crying and saying it was worth it surrounded by the 3 games the vita has   It would be cool to see this girl do a cover of bad apple   Probably ment to say "what the F" but engrish    He was trained by a master of CQC   0_0 I never knew you were on reddit! Also thank you for answering my question, I think I speak for everyone on here when I say that I can't wait!   Thanks! This will help a lot with kick making    So in less techinal terms it's the "Punch" at the beginning of the kick? P.s. Thank you :)   Sorry for the noobish question but I've been seeing the term a lot and I don't really have a firm grasp on it   It would be cool to see more electro from him but I have to say his mid-tempo stuff is my favorite   Check that reverse bass!      I remember reading some where that ophidian and Sam were working on something together, did anything ever come out of it?   If be fine with that especially if we get more songs like mirror mirror   Get your sides to send picks (especially of the clam chowder)   Yes yes yes yes!!!   Me too ^^^^choo^^^^choo   Sadly my presentation can only be 10min and putting showtek in there is just me forgetting to put "(older work)" next to them   Oh I didn't mean boring in that way, what I meant was if you find that it's becoming a slog or if your getting bored working on a track taking a little video game (or anything else really) break can be refreshing and will inspire/clear your mind   Hmmm.. You do have some good points, I'll rework it a bit and see if I can get a better progression out of it. Also before I replaced it with "worth fighting for" the song I had was Accelerate, the reason I changed it was it didn't think it went with all the other songs I have in the mix    Same with me but just remember when it starts to get boring a little break can make you feel awesome :)   VIDEO GAMES!!!    Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)    [Based freq gave a good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/287r9t/holy_shtball_these_kicks_sound_like_nuclear/ci8ww6v)   I searched "kpop hardstyle"      He's soo cute   [ummmmmm](https://soundcloud.com/djmatduke/matduke-utopia)   IDK what arion's been up too and as for GQ he might be working on some music    Kai wachi hype!   Never never never never compare yourself to your favorite producer/s it never helps the creative process and it will make you feel bad about your self. I'm an aspiring hard dance producer and when ever I think I have a good kick I remember how sweet and amazing ophidians, audiofreqs, zatoxs, angerfists, nosferatus.etc kicks sound and I feel so bad. Take your time, watch some videos (seamlessR FTW) and most importantly have fun because if your not having fun your basically working a day job you payed 600$+ for   Link to the space fund plz   For those wondering where this is from, in the gal gun video Liam said that plague sent him a link to these. Oh plague senpai... (`) you with your ahegao faces and busty furry girls (still waiting on the fan art of the lizard girls from bug island plague)      	156
 The countries with the highest percentages of white people tend to be the most developed and have better quality of life and gender equality.   Are you Dick Cheney?   I live in Portugal and I've never seen actual snow in real life. Scandinavians are so lucky :/   Cock-a-doodle-doo   Unknown   "I'm sure Battlefield.4-RELOADED is a virus"   And then you found out it was on ThePirateBay? :P      The Internet as we now know it. I find it amazing we can send a message to the other side of the world in less than 1 second, store thousands and thousands of photos when we once need countless albums...   Visiting London for 6 days with my classmates/friends. It'll be next year, and of course I'm going.   Would people in Sweden consider someone white if they have black hair, dark brown eyes and slightly tanned skin?   CyberGhost is great as well, and they offer a free version. Premium is worth it, though.   Most brands are worth the money unless they're incredibly overpriced (like Apple, for instance). Some generic brands are good enough, but you never have the guarantee you're getting a quality product. Two things from these brands you should avoid are shower gel and toothpaste.   If so, tell me a bit about your experience. I'm a newbie that cracks simple programs for entertainment.   Ignite.   North   Crysis 3. I enjoyed the alpha/beta multiplayer, so I bought the full game. 1st mistake was buying it on a local retail store instead of some online key store. 2nd mistake was buying it at all :)   My Portuguese teacher wanted my to help her make a PowerPoint presentation of some poems we were forced to write. I don't get paid anything in the first place, needless to say I refused :)   A friend's gameboy, when I was like 5 years old or so. I freaked out when I saw it stopped working. The guarantee wouldn't cover it, so my parents ended up paying either for the repairs or for a new one (can't remember).   They saved money on toilet paper to buy all that expensive cool stuff ^^   I didn't win the "genetic lottery" at all. I have dark brown eyes, black hair, big nose, big lips considering that I'm white (or at least I think I am), wide teeth that have gone yellow-ish even though I never had teeth problems and always washed them, and tanned skin. I would love to have light blue eyes, small nose, normal-sized lips, normal white teeth and fair skin. The only thing I like is being tall, actually.   No. There are no real movies in 4k yet, many TV channels still broadcast in 720p and the price of a 4k TV is ridiculous. By the time 4k gets popular, they will be 1/2 or 1/3 of their current price. As someone suggested, a 4k monitor might make a difference, though. 4k gaming is great, and a huge monitor can be great if you usually have many windows opened.   Wait a day before spending money on something you've just seen and are really excited about. I guarantee that in many cases the "excitement" just goes away and you save some money.   I never quite knew how to socialize, specially with people I didn't know. The older ones in the parties always found something to make fun of me, and I was never seen as an equal to other people in the party.   Just the way I style it, I guess.   Programming   Every single one from my friends.    Sardines.   XVIDEOS   MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST   I have this memory of looking up in crib and seeing those crib toys. Probably a fake memory though.   Besides of the basic info about yourself, try to memorize the names of new people you just met. If you meet them again, they'll feel nice as they were remembered, and if you need anything from them you're more likely to get it.   Gravity. It was so boring and pointless (in my opinion). If there are guys who like it, I recommend checking their testosterone levels.   Meeting a tourist girl around my age. I create various scenarios and daydream.     I hate them, I'd much rather date a flat chick. Having fake breasts means you're not confident about yourself to the point you wanna "get a masK".   "Your hair's cool" - some friend   1911  	37
 That USED to happen to me early into my usage.   They have a form of it called Lunesta (Eszopiclone).    None anymore but I used to smoke Marlboro and Mayfair (a British brand).   Isn't it Sched 1?   Overdosing on opiates, especially heroin, would usually kill you quite fast and painlessly when you IV (that's why it's my get out free card). You basically just pass out and not wake up again. Dunno about snorting though, just sounds like you got super high like everyone else is saying.    Damn... This sub is actually starting to give gold now, seen it a few places on here... We have evolved!   The question is relatively simple but basically every time I don't use I get very, very agitated and angry. The only way to solve it is to know I'm getting some pills or whatever. Does anyone else get this? Is it common?   Having to confess a porn addiction for just watching porn at 17 is total and utter retardation. What a shitty situation... *Fucking religion*.   Nice one. /s   The US doesn't control everything you know... Just sayin'...    Do you think these riots will cause something bigger to happen in Mexico? Like a revolution?    What I mean by BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder, it's extremely complex, but the symptoms he has from it are basically, suicide threats, and what you just described there "*He's also telling me I'm better off leaving him one moment then demanding we get artificial insemination*" which rings borderline for me. The cold rage as you describe it, definitely sounds either like sociopathy or narcissistic personality disorder, or both (both of them happening together is very common).   NPD and Sociopathy (anti social personality disorder, but I don't like calling it that because it's way too broad of a term) happen very, very, very commonly. More commonly than I would like to believe.   He needs either a form of intensive treatment, or you just leaving him, as hard as that may be.    This sounds like an incredibly difficult situation. It's downright emotional/psychological abuse, and that can be worse than physical abuse because it lingers for a very long time once you're out of the relationship. Like the others here have said, I've never seen someone with depression persistently abuse their SO, yeah, maybe it happens but it's relatively rare, especially at a persistent rate. I would also like to know what you mean by cold rage? I have an idea, but not sure what you exactly mean by it. Another likely possibility is that he has a personality disorder and not depression, this could range from BPD (which is things like, threats of suicide, self harm etc. among other things of course), Anti-Social PD (basically sociopathy/psychopathy, but I believe it's a more broad term), Narcissistic personality disorder (which, is actually somewhat likely in this case).   My advice is to take a break and check him into a hospital if you can, in fear for his and yourself's safety. On the break, think, think about your relationship, and think about who he really is and if he deserves to be with you in his current state.   I'm not a doctor, so I can't exactly say if he's depressed or has a PD or nothing, I just don't exactly know for sure.   Also, you're definitely not too "old" to have kids, that's silly, 28 yrs old is a decade and a half away from being too "old". Also, fat at 165? That's just simply bullying, and false.   Anyway, I hope you get through this, life is hard and it's even harder when someone is somewhat weighing you down... As hard as that is to hear.    You'll most likely not get a heart attack. I have a history of heart disease in my family, and Ritalin (which is more hard on your heart I believe) has never gave me a heart attack and I've been on and off it for at least 7-8 years. Also, frequent heart burn isn't a thing to do with your heart, it's stomach acid jumping up to the throat and chest and you SHOULD get it checked out, because if it's really frequent it could be GERD.    Seroquel is pretty sedating, and by pretty, I mean really, really sedating until you build a good enough tolerance (which is also hard for me because I come off my meds). I am not Bipolar though, just schizophrenic. For some people it doesn't work (or it's just so sedating that there is no point in taking it).   It takes away the good feelings for anyone I believe because it basically blocks dopamine (among other things).   The sedation may go away (it does for me if I take it for long enough) or it may not... Will it work? Maybe, or maybe not (if you've been taking it longer than 2.5 weeks and it still hasn't made you feel better, then change the med.   I would ask your doc for depakote or lithium, and try that with another anti psychotic (abilify might work for you).    So here's the thing, I know that the game is supposed to be "emotional" or whatever, but I just don't see it. This game (whether I am watching someone play it or I am playing it myself) doesn't affect me. Is it meant to? I don't feel sad, or anything when someone dies, or when I read something that's supposed to be sad, etc... So my question is, is this game meant to be emotional and is it meant to affect me in any way?    Yep, for schizophrenia... I'm not honest with my psychiatrist for reasons but I don't see a psychologist.    I agree with everything you say. Some may say I'm even on the extreme end of "freedom of choice" because I believe that most drugs (including highly researched opiates) should be as legal as alcohol (with a little more regulation of course).    That stopping isn't as easy as it seems... That alcoholics can actually be worse than drug addicts (and most of the time are)... That alcohol kills way more people, than heroin.    Psuedoephedrine is technically "addictive".   But it's quite sad. It makes me really wonder how many people are cheating...   Well, that's fucked up... I'm guessing you live in the US?   On probation at 15?    I don't understand why 14-15 year old's would be concerned with getting a piss test...   Usually they would use something like a benzodiazepine for nausea, and high doses of opiate pain medications (for pain). Both of them get you high.   It also might make you feel nauseas because weed is an anti emetic (I believe).    I wonder what it must be like to detox from long term use of laudanum. I've never tried PST, and this is what pretty much scares me to try it.    That's a rip off imo. You won't be able to make that money back.   She didn't know if it was weed or chloroform.   [I didn't know Oxy could cause it](http://gyazo.com/2209fb4ee40eba0d13a15ea827d55d66)   He looks like there's no one home in there. "It might have rabies", yeah because when an animal has a disease you want to slit it's throat and get its contaminated blood all over you. *smh*  What an idiotic criminal.    "ALL OF THIS IS ON RECORD"   It's so fake it's funny.    I feel like a lot of people wear merchandise to look cool, or to fit into a certain club at school. Not saying that's what you do keep in mind.    I know a lot of people that say that they don't like the feeling... I don't get what's different about us and them. It's weird, I might have to ask them.    It's extremely irritating. Kurt Cobain wouldn't even want people buying Nirvana T-Shirts anyway, I'm sure... Especially the people that just wear it to see better than others.    You're right, it's basically the hydrocodone of the UK... It doesn't mean that there isn't other opiates around though.    I hear that a lot by people that take opiate prescriptions for pain and stuff, that they don't like it... I wonder what makes it different from us and them?   If it was Fentanyl wouldn't that have been really overpowering for him or worse, kill him?   It's always wisdom teeth I hear about (especially with people in the US). What is it with people getting easy opiates through dentistry? My teeth have always been perfect, damn...   The face looks odd for the coat and body, still cute though... Should post on /r/aww.   I guess I take it for mental problems as well, even though I'm prescribed Seroquel for my Schizophrenia. Apparently opiates have strong anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic effects.   I feel you brother, keep on going, you'll eventually reach that peace of mind, one day.    I'm from the UK too, and finding Oxy is kinda difficult, but not too hard, and hydro is not prescribed here for some reason, and finding morphine is quite easy, it's probably the most prescribed pain pill for chronic pain (other than Tramadol for the chronic pain), cancer pain etc. in the UK. The reason it's harder to find pills here in the UK is because the "black market" so to speak for pills don't really exist. In the UK (especially scotland) the black market is FILLED with heroin rather than pills (sadly).    Peoples pupils react a little slower, differently etc. But yeah, that's generally true, but as I said, peoples pupils ARE different. Also, going up to a guy looking into his pupils would be kinda weird if you ask me.   I hope your brother is safe, and when he comes back (notice I say when because it's positive, *yay*) try and get him some psychological help because when someone is using computer duster, they need psychological help because he is probably running away from something or he's trying to deal with some sort of emotional stress.    Nitrous is safer, it's used medically...   Edit: I know not everything used medically is safe, but somewhat gives credibility that nitrous is a lot safer than fucking Computer Duster.    What about nitrous?   I have a question. What if someone looks at their usage and doesn't see a problem (when it probably is) or just doesn't care?   I've never tried Fent, so how long does it last for *you*?   He COULD be using stimulants. On the other hand, he could just be very hyperactive or have ADHD? Who knows. Does it really matter to you though?   One word... Lighting.    It's sorry, not, "sowwie".   I started taking opiates for persistent headaches that I still get when I come off of them (even when I'm past the withdrawal), but when I'm on them I get no headaches whatsoever. These headaches were sometimes extremely debilitating and have made me wake up in pain and throw up, other times they're just a 2-4 on the pain scale but can go up to an easy 7-8. I've never had them really checked out, but I did have an MRI and Lumbar Puncture a few months ago and nothing came up, so obviously it's not a tumour or anything... I've not told doctors about my headaches so I've never had them diagnosed, but I came to the suspicion that they're cluster headaches.  *I take opiates for the high as well, but I legitimately need them for pain.*  Now I have a pain in my tailbone area that's been going on for about 3 weeks I would say, I had it checked out last week and the doctor just gave me some shitty Naproxen (which didn't even touch the pain at all) it's EXTREMELY uncomfortable to sit down and about 7-10 when getting up from the seat. Anyway, that's why I take opiates aswell as chasing that high.  What's your story?   I'm sorry brother, sending positive vibes your way.    Alex Jones: "YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE... But first buy my T-Shirts and my DNA FORCE"   Good luck finding that, I'll be here when you do.    You like it more than heroin? Damn, I gotta try it sometime.    Well, basically, I've liked Nirvana for a couple of months as of now, their music is/was just great, but when I mention I like Nirvana or whatever, someone, somewhere, always says, "Then why don't you have Nirvana T-shirts", or, "You're not a true fan of *enter musician here* if you don't have their *MERCH*". It pisses me off because it basically says, even if you like a band or musician or whatever, if you don't have their "merch" then you're not a true fan or a big of a fan as me... As if it's a contest, FUCK YOU to whoever does this.    I doubt she would use your hand, that would be lack of trust on another level right there. 1.5 weeks is a long time without talking to your GF/BF/Wife/Husband. I hope (for you) that maybe she's either just, 1.) Sick (Cold, Flu, Allergies, whatever). 2.) Just busy. Hopefully she isn't mad with you or breaking up with you. All the best, stay calm because worrying  and panicking just makes things 10x worse for you.    If you've been with her for a while, at least 3 months, then the likely hood of a vengeful ex is pretty slim. Does she know your pass code on your phone? I would just chill out for now and wait and see what happens... I take it she's ignored further text's?    Just before me and my ex-GF fully broke up we didn't speak to each other for a week or two, but then again, before that we hadn't even seen each other in person for months. Also, how do you think she would've found out?    Opiate crack.   [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_fever)   Well... Good for you?   No, I am Renton from trainspotting.    Damn, I wish my psychiatrist or whatever got high...    Some people like the 90s grunge junkie look.   I always thought having an uncontrollable erection would be great, because if you took some opiates with it you could last forever.   You're saying that without giving much information. When someone wants to do something and someone says, "No, do not do it", or anything like that, it makes them want to do it more.    You sayin' we're fucked up here? Wanna fight about it? Just kidding, I agree with you 100%.    "Disappear"   Calling an ambulance was probably the best thing ever. You weren't even there and you still called one for her, that's great. On the other hand, It's not great that you HAD to call the ambulance, I wish you all the luck, I hope she pulls through, my love goes to you and your friend.   GHB and Benzo's are a no no no no no no mix.    Yeah, you definitely don't retain full tolerance forever and ever, that'd just be biologically impossible, but I'm sure that I heard somewhere that your body can handle it better than people that are completely naive.    Snort all the dust off the screen? I don't know, just a suggestion.    That's something I'm gonna research, your tolerance obviously lowers after months, but I've heard that once you're addicted or tolerant to opiates that your brain recognizes what's happening once you take it again... It's interesting, I don't fully understand it and I don't think anyone really does.    Yeah, but your body was still quite familiar with opiates.    Then no, there was no build up of MDMA, and even if there was "build up", it would not even be close to enough to get high.    They inject into their feet, not their toes, so the doctors made a massive mistake there. I'm the same way, I've had nurses poke holes all over me at the same time trying to find a vein, and I think one poked it in a vein so much she collapsed the vein, or at least damaged it.    Why would they even say, "in his toes", I've never heard of a heroin addict injecting into their toes.    Lol, have fun fucking your seeds.    If you take them all at once? That could be potentially fatal, especially mixing Oxycodone and Morphine at the same times.    Being addicted to a drug isn't fun. Having to NEED a substance in your body as if it's food or water is soul crushing. It could take you years and years and years until the addiction finally ruins you and everything around you is gone, and then, you'll probably get help but because the substance had/has such a massive grip on you, what's stopping you going back when things get a little tough? Nothing, unless you have something or someone that keeps you going.  When you're addicted to something (Opiates for me) even if it's ruined everything in your life and you finally get help, you can still (and probably will) relapse a few times into that same thing, that destroyed you.    When was the last time you took MDMA when this happened?   There's mushrooms and various research chemicals, but that's about it when it comes to psychedelics IME. Meth is extremely neurotoxic same with Cocaine, Dexedrine and Adderall, Ritalin etc. They literally damage your brain, but not only that, they damage the shit out of your heart if you do it long enough. While opiates, don't damage organs at all, the biggest risk from using an opiate is severe repository depression and stopping breathing.   It's extremely easy to get E here too, but I've just not been involved in that scene in particular yet. I've never tried nitrous but I'm sure it'll cross my path, either medically or just recreationally. DMT is something I wanna try but it's not easy to get here I don't think, the easiest psychedelic to get is shrooms.   The drugs I have most exp. with are Opiates and Stimulants. The funny thing is, the Amphetamine I've done was from the street, Amphetamine Paste (Oral). The few times I've got it though it's never really hit me as hard as say, Ritalin, for some reason, but Ritalin is said to be the pharmaceutical cocaine.    It comes from Afghanistan (the street stuff), but I've heard lately that we grow our own poppy plants for our pharmaceutical stuff, especially the pharma diamorphine. Morphine and Codeine is probably what I will stick with forever because my tolerance never seems to go too high, even after a year and a bit of pretty much non stop abuse. It probably did boost tourism in Glasgow, but it's funny because the movie and book are set in Edinburgh.    The DHC here the 30mg (per pill) is basically our hydrocodone, and some people say it's better than hydro, and I use that sometimes because it just lasts a lot longer, and feels kinda like dihydromorphine.    The weirdest thing about my drug history is that I started off abusing stimulants, especially high doses of snorted Ritalin (which will most likely fry your brain if you binge on that stuff for more than a week), and Amphetamine a few times, then basically I saw some codeine 30mg (per pill) and started off abusing Morphine and other kinds of opiates from there.   Btw, I've only tried Tamazepam 20mg (for sleep during WD), Valium and some Librium I found that was quite old. What's the Valium like for you on a recreational point of view? They never seemed to do much for me.     I love trainspotting, you can't be Scottish and not have watched/read trainspotting. Also, I can read Scots, I'm from Scotland lol. Yeah, I read it just there because you posted it on this thread, everything said in trainspotting is spot on about heroin, and it really shows the problem with heroin in Scotland. I can literally go down to the local store which is 2-5 mins away walking and see at least 1 to 5 heroin addicts, it's stupidly easy to get heroin here.   This is my favourite "quote" from the movie: "People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pissed. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit."   Looks like photoshop to me.   Note: Sarcasm is fun.   I had undiagnosed chronic pain, especially really bad headaches (which was the thing I had the longest) which basically felt like my brain exploding  but nothing showed on an MRI or Spinal Tap, and recently I've been having really bad pain in my lower back, tailbone and legs. I had nothing prescribed and didn't even know what an opiate really was back then, so I saw some tramadol and codeine 30s in my cabinet and took some and it made me feel good while taking away all pain. I've not had a headache while on opiates but when off them, it's extremely painful and nothing else solves them.   Pain sucks bro, especially persistent pain and some doctors won't even prescribe chronic opiates for longer than a few years, when someone might need them for basically ever.   I've always heard opiate addicts quit for 15-20-30 years and still relapsing and sometimes dying even, opiates have a weird, sometimes life long grip on someone, especially someone with pain.   Why don't you get a suboxone doc or whatever once you want to quit?   tl;dr: I started using for pain and recreation at the same time basically.    Whatever I can get my hands on really, usually 210-240mg codeine a day and/or 30-100 mg of morphine (depending on ROA), and sometimes 180-210 mg of DHC, which is said to be equivalent to hydrocodone if not better.  A 500mg a day of oxy would've fucked me so hard.  I've only been an "addict" for a year and a few months. You? (If you don't mind answering how long you've been taking opiates).   Edit: I believe I'm an extensive metaboliser of codeine basically. Living in Scotland, I could easily go and get heroin in about 5 mins, thank god I haven't done that... Yet.    Diamorphine is just a short way of saying diacetylmorphine, and yes, the UK does use pharma grade heroin in a hospital setting. I've also seen morphine liquid suspension here, my next door neighbour had some of it when he was dying sadly of cancer.   Yeah in America you get straight up Oxymorphone,   Edit: Diamorphine and Diacetylmorphine are both heroin, diamorphine is just a short version of saying diacetylmorphine.    They are, but the black market for the Rx opiates aren't here and some drugs don't get prescribed (eg. hydrocodone) but others do like, Oxy, DHC, Diamorphine (in some cases). But the black market for the Rx's don't really exist apart from benzos.   Also, before they prescribe oxy they usually prescribe morphine pills or liquid.    Oxymorphone is a lot stronger than oxycodone because it's the straight drug in your system, 15mg of oxycodone isn't 15mg of oxymorphone, it's just that one of the metabolites of oxycodone is oxymorphone, you follow me? Btw, oxycodone isn't a "pro drug" it just has oxymorphone metabolites.   I live in the UK and have never heard of anyone being prescribe oxyMORPHONE but oxycodone is quite common for chronic pain. Does Australia not use diamorphine (in a hospital setting or on prescription for terminally ill, usually cancer, patients) like here in the UK? Because I thought I heard someone that you guys do use it, but I'm probably extremely mistaken.    Yep, heroin is basically a bullet train going to the brain and once it's there it converts into morphine. Not all opiates convert into morphine though, for example oxycodone and hydrocodone convert into oxymorphone and hydromorphone.    You get Oxy, DHC (which some say is better than hydrocodone) and various other opiates in the UK (Including diamorphine in a hospital setting).   No problem.   I've always liked codeine and morphine better than almost any other opiate. People always hate on codeine because they "don't feel anything" but there's multiple factors into why you wouldn't feel much and one of the main reasons is the lack of the (or lowered function) enzyme needed to make CodeineMorphine.   Codeine is a pro drug, so basically in order for it to work it needs to be converted/metabolised in the liver by an enzyme called CYP2D6, some people either lack this COMPLETELY or the function of it is basically nil, therefore they can't convert it into morphine as much or at all.  This will kinda explain it a little: http://gyazo.com/5c16983af33c7ce3663fd3804b7e6448   IVing things, if done correctly with good techniques, can be really safe (of course not as safe as taking a pill, snorting normally or any other method that doesn't require much technique). Keep in mind also that heroin addicts for example pretty much need to move on to IV because once your tolerance gets stupidly high, smoking, snorting or whatever just doesn't cut it any more and it gets insanely pricey. IVing heroin is cheaper because you need less.    Codeine for me is quite good, you have to realize that maybe you're just an ultra poor metaboliser, or just a bad metaboliser.  I for one know that I'm a very good, maybe even ultra rapid metaboliser... Hate it when people bash on codeine.   Good luck, opportunities like this should always be seized.    I take it you're giving up opiates? If so, good luck bro, see you on the other side one day.    Ritalin (Methylphenidate) is what I'm more experienced with, coke costs too much for all that hassle imo.    Pretty in pink bro.   Methylphenidate makes me crave it so much I redose stupidly high doses until it's all gone.  	103

I don't know enough about James Wilson or whether this is accurate to respond to this. Part of the problem is she jumps about and talks about a lot more than just the pledge of allegiance.

This was her response after I explained that God was added to the pledge of allegiance in 1954 and explaining the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

And the Constitution His legal lectures (three books) were used in the first organized legal training for law students. You can still get copies of those books. Here is what he said. Law made for men and nations flows from the same divine source the law of God, what we do must be founded on what he has done. The deficiency of our laws must be supplied by the perfections of his.   Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is Divine.   In factthe early court made numerous decision defending the Ten Commandments. You were just as likely to find the Ten Commandments hanging in a government building and school, as you were a church.   Marshall said the Ten Commandments must be fundamental precepts of our civil society   Quotes from George Washington:   You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are.   While we are zealously performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian. The blessing and protection of Heaven are at all times necessary but especially so in times of public distress and danger. The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier, defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country.   I now make it my earnest prayer that God would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of the mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion."

I usually fly to LA from SF bay area and rent a car, but I decided to rent a car and spend a day driving down there next month. The cost is about the same (an extra two days of rental car + gas = plane ticket), but it does mean a lot more time - something I am willing to accept to avoid the screening machines.   Unfortunately, this isn't going to be possible for many of the longer flights that I must take, but I'm hoping if enough people start opting out of shorter flights, the airlines will also start to place pressure on this issue.      I have always thought I believed that all human beings are equal. I recently started thinking that I could save someone's life if I were to donate one of my kidneys to someone in need of one. Why is it that I hesitate in doing this because I don't know the person it will go to when I wouldn't hesitate to do the same for someone I know. Does this mean that I really don't believe that all human life is equal?

Local people says that the wetland site was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150 m from the railway line..."  "Yet it is evident that," Wadi Gaza used to flow in winter and bring huge amounts of rainwater, disturbing the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip" (Goodson, 1999). Also due to interviews with the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring huge amounts of water."  [Source](http://vinc.s.free.fr/IMG/palsd_hydro-2.pdf)   First they blame Israel for diverting their natural resources and creating a shortage of water. Then, when it rains an abundant amount of water in a short period of time and the Wadi naturally overflows, Israel is blamed for flooding. Logical?  Could flooding possibly be because Hamas won't build proper infrastructure?

 Posting about it same day? Dude, too soon. Don't you have some family stuff to attend to?   Rocket salad?  I think they meant *roquette* salad, which is a kind of arugula.

I travel for work constantly, I'm actually writing this in an airport. My best tip is to eliminate checked baggage. This won't help if you're going on vacation, but I can't tell you how many time this has saved me.   Tight connect? Your luggage doesn't get left behind.   Want to grab an earlier connecting flight? The first thing they'll ask is if you have checked luggage.   If you eliminate checked luggage, you can literally walk off the plane and to your car or hop into a cab without breaking stride.   This goes without saying, but the airline can't lose your luggage if its with you.   Note:  Please use only approved size luggage for carry on travel. If I see you on a flight with your whole life in multiple suitcases, I'll recline my seat into your lap as far as it can go.    up up down down left right left right A B A B start.   I literally just got wood.    I literally just teared up in awe.   People who board flights out of turn. When they call seating zone 3, if you're in zone 4, the agent at the counter should turn you away. But no one ever gets turned away! They just let them right on the plane like a reward for being bold enough to try or something. As a guy who travels for work, this drives me nuts.   	10
    Oh, well. I guess I'd better stop using Ruby then. It was fun while it lasted.  Seriously though, I think Ruby/Python comparisons are unhelpful. Both are good, complete, mature languages, similar, but different. They both have good web frameworks. Some programmers seem to "click" with one approach more than the other, and that's natural too--our brains don't all work the same. A programmer with experience in one who "tries out" the other will probably be disappointed, and while they can have a helpful fresh perspective and spot issues that need to be corrected, many of their negative reactions generally result from a lack of experience with the new language and familiarity with the old (and therefore largely irrelevant).        Looks very useful. Beast (http://beast.caboo.se/) is my favorite Rails forum (and Mephisto my favorite blogging system).               Completely agree with you on the plugins. There are quite a few plugins that are much more widely used (and useful) than a basic admin interface.    Does *anyone* still use Windows?    Nice to see a comparison that's not slanted or flame-throwing.  Unfortunately, while the presentation prominently features the Admin advantage from Django, it fails to mention that AjaxScaffold (and several others) provide similar (or more) functionality for Rails. Having said that, most sites need a more customized Admin interface than provided by either Django or AjaxScaffold and the like, so the advantage provided by either is more likely to be leveraged only while prototyping or as a "extra".               As far as a beginner's programming language, I think Ruby is better than PHP. I've found Ruby easy enough for my 9 year old daughter to learn and write programs in. PHP handicaps you by not forcing you to think in an object oriented fashion, which you'll have to learn eventually anyway. PHP is nice for putting up a quick webpage (and certainly easier to deploy than Ruby), but doesn't provide a solid programming foundation (which it was never intended for anyway). Ruby is very well thought-out and structured.   words = %w(zero one two three four five six seven eight nine)  (it's nice not to have to hassle with all the quote marks)       	18

I was trying to fix my IR remote for my Nikon D90, with no luck. I remembered I had some radios and a cable, which I used as a remote shooter in the past, but the cable was broken and I was beggining to feel defeated.      Then I thought that maybe my S4 Mini had a IR transmitter, and searched for an app. Found one, installed it, and thought "this won't work, I'm sure". Great was my surprise when it actually worked PERFECTLY! I now have a remote IR shooter on my smartphone. I should've realised earlier, but well.

I'm definitely going to watch this video.   So, I've been having some issues lately that gave me some panic attacks and constant fear, and last night my fear "peaked" and I was very paranoid about very very stupid things.      I've been thinking about meditating for some time now, and lurked this subreddit and read a bunch of the top posts to get good info on how to do it. I started today, feeling very down, seeing very desaturated colors, and with some fear still in my heart.     I sat in a towel, with my legs crossed, and the tip of my thumbs touching (I did as described on the #1 top post here). I concentrated on my breathing after puting the alarm for 10 minutes, and started focusing. At first, lots of thoughts came by, that meditation wasn't for me, that it will accomplish nothing, etc etc, but as I read, I contemplated the thoughts and let them flow and pass by.                   Later, I began to relax, and to feel good. I could see my problems with a lot of perspective, and they started to feel very solvable. This brought a smile and a feeling of happiness. Over the course of those 10 minutes, I relaxed and reached a very clear mental status. I'm now totally and utterly astonished about my experience. It served me in a great deal, and although I know this is the first step of many, just doing it makes me feel great.  I look foward to do this again tomorrow, and the day after that. And the day after that as well. I have a trip in 2 weeks, in which I'm hoping to practice this as well.            It was beautiful and very helpful, and I wished to share that with you.

 My guess is that it will air in January. I've noticed over the past six or so years of watching currently airing anime that the vast majority of the time when they announce a show it is one full season away from airing.   The actual explanation of this is that they do not want to lose the hype from the fanbase for the second season by making them wait. Yes, there are some outliers such as Grisaia (Which is finally airing this season) and Dog Days''' (Airing this January) both of which were announced years ago.   For those of you who are "out of the loop", [have a look at this](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/23hraj/ghandi_nukes_and_civilization_v/) which explains the above comments.   As a heads up, mentioning illegal streaming/downloading sites is the same as linking them and it is not allowed in the rules. Any and all posts mentioning these types of sites will be removed.   [They knew all along.](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/2008/07/11/050-gooey-kablooie/)   How about Toradora? It is regarded as a really good romance/comedy anime.   Most apps don't unless you press a button to bring it up.   Considering that there are only five characters in the demo it should be a 20% chance, but I agree that it tends to prefer certain characters.   Thing is, he returns nothing as he is void.   I got it for them, but I hope people remember to tag their posts. (It could have also been someone submitting it from an app and they haven't seen the sidebar yet.)   They went over that by saying, "How would you explain this to them?".   That was the PS3. The PS3 used the cell architecture which was new for the PS3, this is what made it hard for valve.  The PS4, on the other hand, uses a 64 bit architecture and the OS is a certain distro/version of linux. Valve has been pouring a lot into putting their games, and others, on Linux. (What do you think SteamOS is?)    According to the first season, she is a college student. I am not sure why she looked younger in the first season, other than she is short.   Getting the "internet" to agree on something is like trying to herd cats, it just isn't going to happen.   Not only that but it has a new OP and ED song and animation. It would be a bit silly to make something new when they could just reuse the old versions. My guess is that they are looking for sales of the blu-ray version to help spur a second season.   It seems interesting. I wish it was scaned/translated.   Now go read the novels. (You can buy them in English! Well, not all of them but they are translating all of them!)

A bit of an odd question but I thought I should ask it here. My Mother, who is an elementary school media specialist (as she teaches more than just books), is looking to get a few series for the library. These would be, mainly, for fourth and fifth graders.  I know Shounen Jump would be a good place to start but even then some of the content could be iffy.  There are other graphic novels (not manga) in the library but I do not know what ones.   Possible ideas: Azumanga Dioh, Yotsuba!   I came across a thread on GameFaqs that you can use a DAC on the PS4 by just plugging it in.   I tried it for myself and it worked! (Quite well too.) I am unsure of whether or not you have to change the audio output to bitstream, which I did before trying, but it worked.   I tried the Audioengine D1 but I would imagine that others would work too.  ---  You may be asking yourself, why does the PS4 have this and not mp3/flac/wav/ogg support? My guess is that since the PS4's OS is based off of linux they kept the drivers needed for this to work. (Heck, it is probably part of the kernel)   .   I've made up my mind to get the HD650's but I saw that people recommended getting a DAC/amp for them. I *already own* the Audioengine D1 but I was wondering how well the two go together and if it has enough power to run the HD650's. (The D1 is also an amp)      I normally sit in the chat of a group that I am in, along with ~10-20 others, which makes it into a sort of IRC thing.   The issue is that for the past few days every single link except for youtube.com and steampowered.com results in having to [click through Steam's website](https://i.imgur.com/8yWhm3z.png) to get to the actual link. Even imgur is being affected by this.  I only click links I trust and from people I know. I just want it to stop as it adds anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds extra loading time. (Having to load the page, click the button, wait for the actual site to load.) When you normally click anywhere from 10 to 15 links or more a night it adds up to be quite a bit of time.   I bought Contraption Maker ($15 value) and it, apparently, comes with a copy to give to someone. Since the game gave me a second copy, each copy is worth $7.50 so I'm just asking for a $5 amazon gift card. (Paypal and Bitcoin are also options)  If you ever played the old Incredible Machine series, this is in the same vein and it is even made by some of the people who worked on that series.   This trade will occur through Steam since it is a gift.

This grants Rumble a non-exclusive license to your video. (ie. They can still use it with their partners, but you still own it.)  * **Not for Sale** - Who'd want to do that?  --  **What is Rumble looking for in a video?**  * Good title and description    * They changed my title and description, but make sure it is a good one such that the editors know what it is about. * *Original content* * High Quality Video (ie. Something that looks nice rather than thrown together.)  --- **What if I don't have any videos to upload?**     * You can make about $0.25 a day through tagging videos.

The reason I am asking is that I am going on a two week study abroad trip to Japan in May. While we are in Japan, there is a [big shinto festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanja_Matsuri) that they have figured out a way for us to go see. While no one in the class will be partaking in this from a religious perspective, nevertheless we will be there. As such, I am unsure of what the Bible says to do in these sorts of situations.

The closest that I have gotten to beating a JRPG was: Superstar Saga, Ar Tonelico: Qoga, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door and also some of the recent Zelda games.  The only one I finished, and due to using action replay, was Final Fantasy IV for the DS.   I recently got into Dogecoin and I have ~10 doge that I am trying to send to Cryptsy. When I try and send the entire amount (or less for that matter) I get an error stating, "Error: Transaction creation failed". I am on the 1.4.1 release of the wallet software and it has just finished downloading about 30k block records.   Is there anything that I can do to fix this?  ------------------------------------  PS: I looked in the related subreddits guide to see if there was a tech support one and I also checked for an IRC to go on but I didn't find anything. I've also searched online for a solution to no avail.   Hopefully this sort of post is okay here as I didn't see anything regarding it in the rules section.   Well, let's see what SHAFT has in store for this week as the fake couple has been formed!         For those of you who have been on /r/beermoney for a while, you may remember when some people came on and promised a new and better rewards/survey site. Nothing really came of it and for the past few months the subreddit, /r/MegaPoints, had been set as private.  Hopefully this means that the site will be coming to fruition in the near future.  ***  **NOTE:** I am not affiliated with megapoints, I just happened to remember about it and decided to check to see if anything was new.         I am, currently, in the process of having the program process the data after downloading the full English Wikipedia file(s), but I do not know where it is in the grand scheme of things.   It would be nice to have a progress bar/screen (like it had when downloading the 10Gb file) letting the user know how much longer and such it has for processing.   While this may seem to be a "Well, duh" thing but you cannot setup remote play on the Vita while you are on a different network. I had the correct numbers so that I could connect to it, but to no avail.  I attempted to setup remote play on my Vita using skype as my PS4 is six hours away by car and I cannot get to it until the middle of December. (Due to the reports of issues, I had my Mom set it up to make sure it all worked)         Will you have your PS4 shipped home or to your university?   The reason I am asking is that I am torn between having it sent home, or if I should get it shipped here. My main concern is that it would interfere with my studying for finals. (Which start on December 6^th ) Yet, if I have it shipped home, I might be too antsy around finals about finally being able to play it.  Also, if you do respond, could you state when your finals are?   Subs are out! I am looking forward to see if he thinks that he is an invader or not.      So far, and I am about 6 minutes in, the episode is pretty good and *seemingly* better than last week's.  I found the whole *Jaws*-esque theme and the [profile picture for "god"](http://i.imgur.com/En6G8lI.jpg) in his cell phone were pretty funny.   I, recently, made a post on the /r/games subreddit with a link and when I looked at the vote distribution. I noticed something really weird, [I had a negative downvote.](http://i.imgur.com/yzYWBxm.png)  Well, someone must of either fixed the bug or downvoted it such that it is back to having 0 downvotes.            This has been an idea of mine for a while, but I think it would be a good idea to have either on the wiki or on some image, a list of anime that are similar to other shows on television.   This would allow people who are new to anime to find a common ground rather than having to guess and possible turned away from it.       For those of you who have clicked on this and wondering what in the world I am talking about, there was a post up about a month ago about it on this subreddit. [Here is a link to that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1ktmvf/get_some_steady_brewfunds_seeking_privatecharter/).  TL;DR: It is a panel that asks those on the panel to respond to a question with five or more sentences. Once they read over and approve your response, they will send you a link to redeem a $25 gift card for another site where you can get gift cards ranging from Amazon to iTunes. This will happen once a month for the next year, well 11 months from this point in time.

I have played Tales of Xillia on my PS3 and I really like it so far but I was wondering if I should get Tales of the Abyss for my 3DS.   I really lime JRPGs but I never really seems to finish them.    So, what are your thoughts?        	123
 Wait... the smiling man is a Let's not meet post? My day just got a whole lot more sleepless... Fuck.   I actually just looked it up. I feel like an idiot... Thank you though. Criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but an opportunity to learn. :]          I will admit, I ain't really good at grammar and such. I tried my best but I'll keep working on my writing skill. I'm looking up the words you gave me. Either my teacher's never taught me that in school, or I forgot. I wasn't a good learner in school. But I'll work on it for sure.   Ya, I'm trying to get better with my grammar and such. Sorry about that. Though, I'm glad you found it interesting. Fun fact: Never have eaten a cake after that. NEVER AGAIN.   For the past five or so week's my throat has been having this itch. It started out simple enough.  Ironically, it happened on my birthday. My mom, dad, little brother, big sister, and her two kids were there.  The cake was very beautiful. Icing roses, and amazing artwork by my sister made with some gooey candy stuff that I can't quite remember the name of.  A little card, kind of like the one you would get from a business place with contact info on it, seated itself atop the cake with the writing "Happy Birthday!" It was a good day.  One of my nephews was whacking around a foam sword, unintentionally breaking three of the most expensive things in my house.  I joked with my sister that we should keep a tally on how many things would be in pieces before the day would end.  She laughed and turned to face me.  Because of this, she didn't see my nephew coming full force with his foam sword.  Splat, the cake was mushed to a pulp. My sister scolded her son for a second.  She then took away the foam swords and apologized.  I told her it was nothing. She gave me a look and fixed her eyes on the cake. "It's still good" I said.  I then proceeded to convince her along with the rest of the family that this was the case.  After all, it would be a bitch to fix up another one. And, I honestly didn't think I deserved that much treatment. That was the reason I convinced them it was fine; the cake was still good.   When all was good and done, I said my good bye's to my family before they went home.  I was in good spirits, I didn't even notice that little tickle in my throat.  It wasn't until I was laying silent in bed, moon looming over me. Swallowing, I felt this strange tingle of pain.  I got some water, and then the pain seemed to settle. over the course of two days, it got worse.  It wasn't pain this time, it was a tickle. After the third day, I just couldn't concentrate on anything.  Because of this, I decided to see a Doctor. I thought of a bunch of thing's this tickle could possibly be.  A sexual disease, flu, my smoking catching up with me, and loads more.  If your curios about the first one, I just started dating this wonderful girl. You never know. Let's move on.  The Doctor thought nothing of it when i told him how it felt. He "diagnosed" that I had a sore throat, or an allergy. I took what he had said as the truth. No reason to worry, right?  It wasn't really hurting at this point, so I couldn't say other wise.  Well, unfortunately, it turned back into a sore throat a day later.  I decided to call in sick, my throat bothered me enough to do so.  With enough sleep and a healthy dose of water, I would get over this I thought.  I had no idea how bad things would escalate.  That same god damn tickle turned into an itch. Sooner or later I started to scratch the outside of my neck.  Then, inside my throat as well. It wasn't like before where I would swallow constantly to stop the pain.  This time I used my nail's to sooth the pain in my throat. My neck for some weird reason became more of a problem as time went on as well. I started scratching a lot there too. Without even thinking, I started to scratch.  When the pain would engulf my throat and neck, I would scratch.  Later on, If I wasn't scratching, I could feel the pain. Over a short period of time this itch got out of hand.  The pain kept getting severe, and more so as time went on. I kept scratching.  From then on, the blind's remained closed since the light from outside started to hurt my eyes.  With the blinds closed, it hurt less to see. Funny enough though, with the blinds closed I could barely see.  I was okay with it though. I always preferred the dark anyway.    After awhile, I started getting call's from work after four days of being absent; I stopped answering them.  After three week's of this itch, I was kinda loopy. I knew this wasn't normal, something was going on.  The problem with knowing something's wrong is when you don't quite know what that problem is.  A day literally felt like a week.  In the back of my mind, I even started to think that a ghost or a demon was behind this.  I never thought that was the issue, though it was hard trying to keep it out of mind. Soon, it got hard to talk.  At one point, I almost felt as if i couldn't say a word without pain rushing behind my sentences.  My throat was completely void of any moisture.  Truthfully, I didn't think it was as bad as it was, despite knowing this was not your normal sore throat.  In my head, my logical calm self was in charge.  It said "Mike, you should really see a doctor soon and get back to your boss about this."  I was worried, but not as much as I should have been.  After some debate in my head, I decided to call the doctor to schedule another appointment.  My head started to feel clouded, and I couldn't think straight without mustering enough mentality to do so.  My hand reached for my cell, it was charging in front of the alarm clock. God, when was the last time I used it?  I stopped as my hand touched the phone. Something looked off.  I didn't notice it at first, and I cannot comprehend how I didn't notice sooner.  How often I was scratching, all I did was sleep, thought's seeming cloudy, thinking it was just the same pain I had in my throat from the very start. I had blood on my fingers.  I tried to yell out "Jesus Christ!", but it was so painful I couldn't bear one letter.  If the light from the alarm clock didn't alert me when I went to grab my phone, I don't know how much longer that stained hand would have gone unnoticed.  Despite the major headache that ensued from getting up too quickly, I opened the blinds.  The Light felt like a literal stab in the eyes. I didn't let that stop me from turning around to check my bed.  I couldn't tell that there was a nice big blotch of blood on my bed, my vision was way to impaired too.  I just stood there until I could see exactly what I suspected to see.  The only thing that scared me is it was a little bigger than I first thought.  I looked down afterwards to see a puddle forming in front of me.  I shoved my fingers down my throat to where I had been scratching. There was an indent. I felt my neck. There was a slight, shallow indent. And from what I could see, a whole lot of blood. Things started to blur.   I was absolutely terrified.  I started to black out, so I tried to reach for my phone to call 911.  I tripped, and landed with my face leaning against the bed.  I tried my best to get up, yet due to my blood loss I kept fumbling over and over again.  I really thought I was going to die right there.  Although, my will power, or instinct, whatever you call it, came over me and I forced myself up.  My vision was literally coming in and out as I stumbled over my bed. It felt kinda like slow motion.  That's the best way I could describe it.  Sounds a little dramatic, but I wasn't scared anymore; I was trying to survive.  I finally got to my phone and then attempted to dial 911.  I don't remember if I got it wrong once or twice, just that I wanted to cry when I messed up.   Finally, the ring. *ring* *ring* *ri-* "Hello, this is 911, what's your emergency?"   I felt so woozy as I tried to speak. When I finally did mange to focus enough to speak, I couldn't.  My throat, my fucking throat hurt so immensely that I couldn't even say a word. I was dying, I could feel it.  Once again, I was scared. I then screamed in my mind "Your gonna die, so just yell. Yell as hard as you can."  I slammed the phone on the counter, Then I yelled at the top of my lungs.  It was the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. After that last desperate call for help, nothing, black.  I woke up in a hospital bed, light hurting my eyes. My family wasn't there yet.  I looked around until I saw a doctor walking towards me, he wanted to make sure I was looking fine and stable.  He then explained everything that happened to me. how lucky I was to be alive, my family should be here soon, the condition I was is, and the surgical process they went through.   You want to hear the funny part of this story?   During surgery, they removed a certain something from my throat.   It was a small, cardboard like paper. You know the one's they give to you at business places with their contact info and all that? It was like that. There was also something written on it.  "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"    Honestly, I haven't seen him in a few days. I'll keep you posted.   Honestly... I agree with this. Damn, guess i gotta start being a bit more nice...   My apologies. As you read, I wrote this late at night. I was really tired and posted this once I thought I proof read it as much as I needed too. Oh dear god was I wrong. I'm in the middle of editing it now, so soon it can be legible. Thank you for being honest. criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but as a lesson to be learned. Thank you, friend. :]    	8
 What's Golden - Jurassic 5   I put tweezers in a plug socket when I was young because I thought they fit together well. They did.   Toddlers and tiara's      I don't think you really understood the book.  	5
    This is more than a disgrace, it's a bit disappointing factually.    Clifford is out of character but not bloodlusted.          Destoroyah has been killed, but Godzilla is still going to melt down. Can Elsa freeze him and save the Earth? If not, can she do it with the help of:  Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)  Articuno (Pokemon)  Kyurem (Pokemon)  Frozone (The Incredibles)  Iceman (X-Men)      1) in-character  2) out-of-character  3) completely bloodlusted  Bonus: what lantern ring would he use and who could he beat then?            Who can use the most powerful thing in the universe -rock and roll- to its fullest?    Aside from the original version and the English translation, what are your favorite versions of the song? I have 8 on my phone and I hunger for more.   edit: i only just now realized I typed the title like a lolcat.       As proven by Ramiel's AT field being broken by the Positron Sniper Rifle, AT field's aren't infallible to non-Lance of Longinus weapons. So who's the weakest can break one?      Who's the strongest these fusions could beat, and who could beat them?  Godzilla and Mothra- Mothrilla  King Ghidorah and Godzilla- Godzorah  Gidorah and Gigan- Gigorah  Gorosaurus and Zilla (Godzilla 98)- GINOsaurus               [Bulbapedia entry on Victini](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Victini_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29)  The Victini I will be using in this battle, however, has some improvements. In one hand it is using Excalibur, and in the other it wields the Lance of Longinus (the Bible one). It is also being watched over by its patron god, Nike. To top it off, this Victini is wearing a brand new set of plot armor. With all this on it, who can still bring it down?   1: Mothra vs the male M.U.T.O.  2: Rodan vs the male M.U.T.O.  3: Mothra vs the female M.U.T.O.  4: Rodan vs the female M.U.T.O.  5: 2v2 tag team match  If any of the rounds is too one-sided, the weaker monster gets to call in their partner   Groudon, legendary pokemon of the continents, has been captured by Brendan. When he is, he creates an earthquake which awakens the King of the Monsters, Godzilla. Groudon is as powerful as it can be when it confronts Godzilla. Assume Groudon is playing by anime rules, meaning it isn't bound by EVs, IVs, four move slots, or level.          Is there a legendary responsible for the randomness of the universe?  I've been breeding Espurrs for literally months now. I have boxes and boxes full of Espurrs and I still don't have a shiny. Who do I turn to now?    Shinji's Angels attack Daten City in the order of their numbering in the show (starting with Sachiel because we haven't seen any non-impact feats from the first two), Panty and Stocking get a week in between each attack to recover.   EDIT: Stocking's katanas now have the ability to cut through AT fields like beast Unit-02 in 2.22. This means that they can break the AT fields, but she will struggle with stronger ones.    I like most of the cross explosions in the rebuilds when the angels die, or the angels use an attack, or really anything happens to the angels. I want a wallpaper (preferably 1366x768) of one of them, but all I can find is Sachiel's death. Do you guys have any other ones?      Craig Boone, badass sniper of the wastes, is given a job to kill the Dark Knight.   Boone gets 7 days of prep time. Batman has an anonymous tip that someone will try to kill him, but not where, when, or how.   BONUS: no morals Batman vs a deathclaw.    Two items enchanted to guarantee victory. They are pitted against each other, what happens?   By my count there are 5.25 Saiyans in the universe: Vetega, Goku, Tarble (100% Saiyan), Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Bulla (50% Saiyans, 2 Saiyans total) and Pan (.25 saiyans) are there any i missed who are still alive when Goku flies off to train Uub?               Gigan has decided to attack Tokyo-3 because he's Gigan and he does what he *wants*. SEELE decides that this is the time to send in the Mass-production Evangelion units. He fights them one-on-one, and if he can defeat them he then fights the real Evas. First Unit-00, then unit-02, and finally unit-01. Gigan has his quad-chainsaw armor and between fights he can rest and heal.       [The tardigrade](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade)  One of these has been mutated to the size of 100 meters, with all its existing powers scaled up. In addition, it also has the ability to breathe radiation (think Godzilla's atomic breath) if it absorbs enough before firing. The fight will take place in one of three places:  1: A Forest, with the pond that the Tardigrade originated in. It is not near any towns, but there are wildlife and people there if your character still has morals.   2: Tokyo. Come on, it's a giant monster, how is it *not* going to attack Tokyo? The fight will begin at 4pm Tokyo time. This is real-world Tokyo, so they don't have Mechagodzilla or any variation thereof.   3: The ISS. Combatants will have to bounce off of space debris to attack, as well as contending with Newton's third law.    [this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0)  Based on Unit-01's height and the speed at which the wheels are turning, how fast is the bike?               I love Army of Darkness and I want to know how to say it. It's as simple as that. I suppose *baby* could be swapped out for any regional slang for a loved one.       Both cryomancers are attempting to stop Mothra who is attacking the city they're in because someone kidnapped the Shojibin. Again. So, they decide to try and freeze her so she'll stop destroying the city. Through teamwork, will they be able to bring down Mothra without killing her, will they have to use excessive force, or will they just fail.   Bonus: how many Elsa's would be needed to cool down Burning Godzilla from Godzilla vs Destoroyah?   I like that shot where they're hugging and amir is in Annette, but I'm a loser and a Jew who can't edit worth shit. Can one of you coy divas make it for me?   The fight takes place in Tokyo. An army of Liberty Primes are marching to spread freedom to their mecha brothers, who are deployed in an effort to stop them. All the Mecha-Gs are deployed at once, how many Liberty Primes are needed before the Mecha-Gs are overwhelmed?   Lex Luthor kidnaps the Cosmos (like every other greedy businessman), and so Mothra does what she always does and tears apart Metropolis to save her fairies. Because she's tearing apart the city, Superman has come to stop her.   I think that Mothra would win because she has magic, but my friend think Supes would win.    Sephiroth replaces Kaworu as the white-haired Lilim body containing the soul of Adam and fifth child. He waits until the MP-Evas are completed to try to break into Terminal Dogma. Because of convenience, Unit-00 is also fully repaired and Asuka can pilot again. Because his soul is Adam, Sephiroth can cast an AT-field. This is his one-winged form from ACC, not his Safir form from FFVII.    Is his body of Adam? I know he has Adam's soul and is therefore an Angeru, but is his body that of a Lilim or a child of Adam with a human-like form?      I did a report on origin stories from different cultures (I.e. Not Big Bang or Judeo-Christian Genesis) and my teacher let me use the Arceus creation story. So thank you for helping me with actual things in my real life. Praise Arceus!   As in a game focusing solely on Mothra herself (and probably also Leo). What kind of gameplay would you want while controlling her? How many forced karaoke sections with the Cosmos would you want?    Something went wrong with SEELE's Dead Sea Scrolls. Ramiel (the 5th angel in NGE, 6th in 1.11) and Leliel (12th Angel in NGE, the black and white orb that ate unit 01) end up in Tokyo-3 at the same time. Baffled, their only option is to battle it out.    Let's assume Jesus is willing to kill if he seems it necessary.    Nigguh wut the fuk      The fight takes place in Steelport, and the Boss has the Iron Saint suit and has upgraded his/her powers to the maximum.                   The MP-Eva gets the sword/spear of Longinus replica and nothing else. It does not start out with knowledge of how to kill a Titan. Titan Shifters are included and all the Titans are working together. The Titans have access to the real Lance of Longinus but would need to retrieve it from Terminal Dogma. The fight takes place inside the Geofront.    The American military as portrayed in games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Medal of Honor, have been convinced that Dr. Doom is a brown person who speaks foreign, so they invade Latveria. Both armies get a week of prep time before the invasion.    From what I can tell, all the Evangelion related merchandise is either the Eva's themselves or Asuka/Rei/Mari in suggestive poses. But is there anything with the Lance? It's one of my favorite things from Evangelion and I haven't seen anything of it except for one with half-naked Rei.                I really want to play an Evangelion game but I've heard they're pretty bad. Is there a good one or am I better off modding an Eva into a game I already own?   Both get all their equipment maxed out. The fight takes place in DOOM's depiction of Hell. Who wins?    Mothra discovers that she can grow into a Titan version of herself and grow by 1000%. As a Titan, she has an increased healing factor and is only vulnerable in the nape of her neck (which I guess is right below the skull for her), which is where her original body is located. She also gets the crystallization thing that the Female Titan did.   At the same time, Godzilla discovers that he's part Saiyan (somehow) and can become a super saiyan. In this state, he is 50X more powerful in every regard and drains energy quicker.    Being the Kaiju they are, the have no choice but to use their newfound powers and do battle in Tokyo.       I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx and I want to upgrade the APU to an AMD A10 because it's cheaper than building a whole new PC for gaming. Can I do it or do I just need to get a real PC?            Round 1: no weapons  Round 2: Gypsy gets all the equipped weapons, Unit-01 gets the knife thing, one of the huge gun Shinji used against the fourth Angel, and access to (but not starting with) the Lance of Longinus.   Both fights take place in Neo-Tokyo.    Round 1: A rock-off between the two bands.   Round 2: A battle between them based on feats and abilities from their songs.   Round 3: NSP take the place of Tenacious D during the Pick of Destiny movie. Can they retrieve the Pick and defeat Satan?   The first round is a fight, taking place in a colosseum. Ash gets his Chainsaw, robot hand, and Boomstick. RMWAS gets what he keeps on him.   Round 2 has RMWAS take Ash's place in Army of Darkness after Ash already misspoke the words and awoke the army of the dead. He doesn't get the things in the Oldsmobile, but does get his normal gear. Can he defeat evil Ash and protect the Necronomicon?    My perfect fighter is as follows:   Begin with Godzilla. All the feats and abilities of every Godzilla combined. Next, add in the wings of Mothra, scaled appropriately. Add in Saiyan DNA and have him be trained by Goku and Vegeta. He has the ability to become SSJ3 maximum. He also absorbs Kryptonian DNA and gets all Superman's powers. He gains the mind of Rational Man With a Shotgun and invests in Wayne Enterprises, making him the richest monster alive. He somehow becomes a Titan Shifter and the Dragonborn, gaining all abilities related to that, once again scaled up (about 750%). He gains scaled up Sonic's legs and ability to transform, then gains 400 rings and the Super Emeralds (meaning he's Hyper Sonic now). His biggest Form now pilots a scaled up Evangelion Unit-01, wielding a scaled-up Lance of Longinus. His Evangelion now has all his powers because of reasons. His bones and his Evangelion are made of Adamantium.  He gains Martian Manhunter's psychic abilities and is trained by him.   Who can he beat?      Dragon Ball Z's Android 17 and Android 18 face off against OG Mechagodzilla, Moguera, and Kiryu. First, 17 vs each Mechagodzilla, gauntlet-style. Then 18 runs the gauntlet. If they don't win either, they fight the same gauntlet together.    [Zilla](http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Zilla) (not real Godzilla, the one from the 1998 movie) gets dropped into Jurassic Park during the events of the first movie right after the outbreak, meaning Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson are still there.   Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla).   Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla).   Round 3: She, and only she, must murder every creature on the island. No kids, just murder. No presence, just murder.    To the death/regeneration. The Doctor is Tennant and gets everything he usually carries.   My friend thinks the Terminator would win and I think he's full of shit.       Elsa #1 is taken from Arendelle after the death of her parent and trained by Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat) for three years until Coronation day.   Elsa #2 is taken at the same time to Charles Xavier's School for the gifted from X-Men, where she trains her powers for three years and also probably bangs Iceman.    When the time comes that they must be crowned Queen, they end up going to the same Arendelle through some multiverse mistake, and decide the only logical choice is a fight it out.   Bonus: Sub-Zero vs Charles Xavier at singing "Let it Go".    Everyone, ever, is entered into the next Mortal Kombat tournament. After every round, the winner MUST perform their fatality. This is how they advance to the next round. They are judged in one of 3 categories: Disturbingness (How shocking it is to watch and how likely someone is to get PTSD from watching it), Violence (How excessive the force used is or how gorey the fatality is), and Awesomeness (How inventive the fatality is). I have both Disturbing and visceral because the most visceral one might not be the most disturbing.   The judges for the PTSD category: A US marine, the ESRB (their decision counts as one of three votes), and your mother  The judges for the Visceral category: A janitor (judging how  much he'll have to clean up), Sephiroth, and Walter White  The judges for the Replay category: A frat bro, TF2's Heavy, and the Boss (Saints Row)  Each judge gives a rating out of ten, and the contestant's score is the total of the three scores. Which character would take home the gold in each category and how would they do it?   Was it in the manga? Because in the show and movies there was only numbers, save for Lilith, Adam, and Kaworu.    That wasn't a mistype. I want to know who can consume his delicious Saiyan flesh, preferably not in one bite because that takes all the fun away.   Bonus, who could prepare him the best?   Elsa fights against an Elsa-sized Eva unit 002 (because Shinji's a pansy). Asuka is scaled down appropriately as well as all the Eva's functions (So its AT field is only as strong as that of a human). If she loses in a match with the Eva's umbilical cord, can she survive for five minutes with no cord?   Arceus is said to have created the universe with its "Ten Thousand Arms", despite having a significant lack of any arms whatsoever. Also, its base stat total is less than that of Mega-Mewtwos X and Y, which shouldn't be possible for a mortal when comparing itself to an Omnipotent. Speaking of which, Arceus can't even learn all the moves in the games. So, there's only one logical conclusion I can come to. The Arceus who appears before Lucas and Dawn in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, is not at His fully realized form. Similar to how the Judeo-Christian God appeared before Moses as a perpetually burning bush, Arceus limits His power before stepping into the world of mortals. Because the True Form is a abstract concept, and not necessarily equine, or even perceptible to the human mind. Like Cthulhu, perhaps Arceus exists in a higher dimension, and simply wqants to limit himself to a 3-dimensional form to keep from driving the Pokemon Master insane.   That's my theory, anyway. What do you guys think?         [Elesa](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Elesa)  Elsa fights against Elesa's teams all by herself, without being able to spawn any Marshmallows. If she gets KO'd, she is allowed to spawn up to one Snowman at a time in the rematch. If she does, it becomes a normal Pokemon battle, with Elsa as the trainer, though she is allowed to switch in at any tine.    In all of the multiverse, is there anyone who's more emo than Shinji? Bonus if they aren't a joke character.       Your favorite character fights every pokemon in the Pokedex, gauntlet-style, in order. They start with Bulbasaur, then Ivysaur, then Venusaur, and so on. If they lose, they move on to the starters of the next generation (so if they lose Gen I, they start again at Chickorita). How far do they get, and which pokemon finally beats them?         A baseball team consisting of Goku, Superman, Godzilla, Hulk, Mewtwo, Evangelion unit-001 (including Shinji), Cloud Strife, One-Punch Man, and Eren Jeager's Titan Form. The game is scaled up to the size of Godzilla and the team gets a year of prep time to accommodate for the huge bats and balls.   Game 1: A team of Pacific Rim Jeagers.   Game 2: An all-star team of real baseball champions, each of them is Eva sized.   Game 3: A team of Majin Buus  Game 4: 1v9, Cthulhu  Bonus: The entire team pilots an infinity Jeager-style (without Godzilla). Who's the strongest foe they can beat?   Elizabeth Comstock AKA Anna Dewitt vs the Doctor with his TARDIS  It's good, old-fashioned, time travel race. Starting in Columbia, who can get to Paris in 1983 to catch Revenge of the Jedi first?   Evangelion-001, with Shinji as its pilot, fights against legendary pokemon because I assume it would wipe the floor with anything short of legendary. Who's the strongest it can beat? Who's the strongest pokemon all three Evangelions can beat?   Typing feels amazing and I just don't want to stop ever. Give me an excuse to keep typing.    Elsa has started the eternal winter, so the sun has been blocked out for a day. Superman comes to find her and bring back summer, but is met with that magic blast thing that she nearly killed Anna with. Knowing a kiss from Hans probably won't save his life, Superman has no choice but to fight Elsa. Can she survive the onslaught long enough for Supes to freeze to death? Golden Age Superman, end of the movie Elsa with control of her powers.       After the death of Aeris, Cloud becomes a super Saiyan instead of a whiny bitch (looking at you, Advent Children.)   He gets his Ultima sword and Ultima, KOTR, mega-All, and any other Materia he needs. He would be at max level before the transformation. His hair is really, *really*, blond. Who could he beat?            The battle takes place on Namek because why not. Mewtwo can evolve into one of his Mega-evolutions and Frieza starts in his base form.       Midgar from Final Fantasy VII is under attack from the King of Monsters.   Round 1: Beginning of the game, Cloud has not yet joined AVALANCHE Round 2: Beginning of the game, level 7 Cloud has Barret and Tifa.  Round 3: No Cloud, but the city has the Sister Ray.  Round 4: End of disc 2, during the raid.  Round 5: 1v1 Cloud vs Godzilla Round 5.5: Winner gets to call in either Barret and Tifa or Mothra and Rodan is they get stomped too hard.   Bonus: How does Big G do against the individual Weapons? Ultimate, Diamond, Emerald, and Ruby.       The chainsaws are automatically started and never run out of fuel. The shotgun needs to be reloaded but has infinite ammo. Also, the man with the shotgun dick still has his testicles, so he needs to worry about recoil.    The new Godzilla was the first one I've seen, and now I really want to see more Godzilla movies. Where can I watch the old ones online and where should I start?    The male and female individually, then together.    Me neither            Round 1: Marty is 'Clint Eastwood' in the third movie, so he has his Peacemaker and ammo, and access to the hover board. Ash is from Army of Darkness, with either the Chainsaw or his robot hand, plus the Boomstick.   Round 2: the DeLorean vs the Oldsmobile. The Oldsmobile is the armored version from Army of Darkness, and the DeLorean can't fly and is equipped with the Mr. Fusion, but the Time Circuits are scrambled so Marty can't time travel. It's a race from the Empire State Building to Yankee Stadium.   Round 3: once they get to Yankee Stadium, it's a car-battle to the death. All of a sudden, the DeLorean can fly again, but still no time travel.   In all three rounds, Marty has no problem killing Ash.          In Super Smash Bros Brawl. Who do they choose and who wins?   Game rules: no items, Final Destination, 5 minutes, best of 5 rounds  Bonus: let them use the Smash Ball.       If your favorite character is already evil enough to control a goatee, they fight themselves with no goatee.             Round 1: 4-way debate about something they know nothing about.   Round 2: /u/Unidan and Bill Nye vs. Tyson and Mr. Rogers in a team rap battle.   Round 3: all four have to separately convince Galactus not to consume Earth  Round 4: /u/Unidan and Mr. Rogers are counter-terrorist vs. Nye and Tyson as terrorists in a Counter-Strike (Source because why not). Best of five rounds.   Round 5: everyone is leading their own equally powerful nation, each the size and wealth of the Cold War USA. Assuming Nye and Tyson don't know how to actually build a rocket, who wins the Space Race?  Round 6: Everyone gets their choice of a Buster Sword, dagger, or one- or two-handed axe. They are dropped into the Capital Wasteland from Fallout 3 one week before the Lone Wanderer escapes and must survive. The first person to find anything from the game can have it. Who lasts the longest?      They have to be attractive because of their own charisma, not power of any kind. So no, DOOM can't win because he can tell any Latverian woman to sleep with him.    Deadpool and Joker aren't allowed to kill, they just have to rustle as many Jimmies as possible.   for the lazy: /r/braveryjerk and /r/coaxedintoasnafu   I'm running Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion dv6, and after LEGO Marvel Superheroes crashed on me, I was told that Aero ran out of memory and Windows changed to a less memory-intensive theme. But now that I have a whole lot of RAM available, the theme won't change back to the one I had before. I've tried manually changing it back in Control Panel but it didn't work.    Protectors of the American way decide to run the country. Who are their running mates, who wins the votes and from which states? Does the winner do a good job and get re-elected or does the loser come back four years later and fix the place?  EDIT: congress has made an amendment so Kryptonians can run.    Out of everything, which is the most entertaining way to:  Travel a few blocks Commute to work Long-distance road trip (Cross-Country) Long-Distance (space travel)   Anything that he can do as a Kryptonian (so no Super Saiyan transformation, no almost-death-thing whose name escapes me).    Raditz gains the ability to come back every time he dies. He's always just as strong as he was at the time of his first death, but he decides to try and take out some of the strongest warriors in the multiverse.  How many times does he have to try before he wins? In no particular order, the combatants:  Mewtwo The Boss (Saints Row IV) Frieza Hercules Super Perfect Cell Batman Superman Deadpool Wolverine Thor Goku (Namek Saga, non-super Saiyan) Gohan (SSJ2, Cell Games) Vegeta (peak, non-super Saiyan) Goku (absolute maximum) Vegeta (absolute maximum) Android 18 Cloud Strife Link Dragonborn Chell (with portal gun) Gordon Freeman Terra (Final Fantasy VI) Sephiroth Lord Bills Super Sonic Himself, from DBZ: Abridged    Goku from Battle of the Gods vs. A basket of week-old kittens.    Octodad from Octodad: Dadliest Catch vs. Goat from Goat Simulator.       [Mewtwo](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mewtwo_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)) with all its powers from X and Y, including one megastone per fight.             At basketball.    Since Godzilla would probably lose to all 700-something Pokemon, how would he fare against only the Pokemon in OU?    List of current OU:  Aegislash, Alakazam, Azumarill, Bisharp, Blissey, Breloom, Charizard, Clefable, Conkeldurr, Deoxys's Speed form, Ditto, Dragonite, Espeon, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Galvantula, Garchomp, Genesect, Gengar, Gliscor, Goodra, Greninja, Gyarados, Heatran, Kangaskhan, Klefki, Landorus, Landorus's Therian form, Latios, Lucario, Mamoswine, Mandibuzz, Mawile, Pinsir, Washing Machine Rotom, Scizor, Skarmory, Smeargle, Talonflame, Thundurus, Togekiss, Trevenant, Tyranitar, Venusaur, Volcarona  Banned Items: Soul Dew, Gengarite, Kangaskhanite, Lucarionite  Anything that can mega evolve is allowed to unless its item is banned or hasn't been announced yet.    Anna is obviously the younger if the two. Elsa actually came of age on Coronation Day, which would mean Anna is still underage. Why does Anna even consider marriage at all, and why would Elsa not point that out?    The battle takes place in my kitchen. Maximum of 30 mins prep time. Both are Bloodlusted  Round 1: Which is more delicious for dinner after a day of work? Round 2: Maximum power, cooked by an expert of each food.  Round 3: Both are armed with medieval broadswords.   Bonus: Which would have an easier time killing Batman?   I haven't seen /u/Zoltarr777, /u/DeadeyeSigma, or /u/pokefollower in a while. Where are you guys? It's pretty much just me and /u/toonlink10 left.    Rules: No new things out of the blue. It has to have some connection to your actual feats. That's it.          All the omnipotent gods (I.e not limited to one region like the Greek or Norse gods) are competing against each other.   Round 1: who can build the best universe the fastest? Starting with nothing, they must build a utopian paradise and fill it with diverse life, laws of physics, light sources, and anything a civilization would need to survive.   Round 2: who can build the best world in 6 days? Whose universe would last the longest without all the civilizations tearing each other apart? Given six full days, as long as it took in Genesis, who will win this interdimensional game of Civ?  Round 3: Who can destroy said universe with natural disasters most uniquely? Not just a snap of the fingers and the universe is gone, something like Noah's flood.   Round 4: bloodlusted fight to the death takes place in a limbo state, a complete absence if anything.    Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him?   Mewtwo is encountered in three games, all at level 70: FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver (We're assuming the remakes are canon because they're more recent) and X/Y. The Mewtwo in HGSS is rumored to be Red's Mewtwo after being released, but since HGSS takes place two years after FRLG, this can't be true because Mewtwo is still level 70. If it was released by Red, it would have leveled up by at least one at some point. Levels represent a pokemon's natural growth, with an older pokemon being a higher level due to its age rather than directly being linked to power. In the game, this manifests in levels, but for this theory we'll assume that level=age. This means that Mewtwo is the same age two years later, which can't be possible. Therefore, the Mewtwo as caught by Ethan and Lyra is a different Mewtwo from the one caught by Red and Leaf. Then there's the matter of Calem and Serena's Mewtwo, which is again level 70, and this time there's two in Kalos: Mewtwo X and Mewtwo Y, one for each Mega Stone. It's implied that X and Y take place around the same time as Red and Blue, because Blue was actually in Kalos and the one person who mentioned him doesn't mention that he's a champion or gym leader, meaning at that point he hadn't beaten the Pokemon League yet. This could also be when Sycamore got his hands on Kanto starters, but that's a different theory. So there's two Mewtwos in Kalos, and two in Kanto, albiet at different times. There's another theory stating that the Mewtwo in Kalos is in fact Red's, which ran away to live in secrecy, but it didn't age, so that's out of the question. Since the one Mewtwo we have canon information about, Red's, was the son of Mew, born on February 6, we can assume this means that the three other Mewtwos are also directly the children of Mews. Mewtwo is a mutation of the Mew DNA, meaning Mewtwo can't reproduce stably. The Kanto Mew probably gave birth to both Mewtwos which have inhabited Cerulean Cave (at different times), and the Kalos Mew probably had twin Mewtwos. This isn't even taking into account non-main series games like Mystery Dungeon or Ranger.    Assuming he knows how to work a modern car. He also tries to steal as much as he can from Wayne Manor and the Batcave.       What are the strongest and weakest characters you can think of, and what's the most balanced battle they could be in?      	165
 Really?, I guess the morals of the whole Bible were cherry-picked to death by the founders of the US or at least the Republican party?   You make the declaration that your Christian god has given us absolute moral laws to abide by given your view. You say that this is a nation of freedom of religion as long as all other religions acknowledge that your religion is dominate and others must just suck it up.    As far as I can read, the bible and it's new and old parts are as immoral as any book comes.  If you want to ban an obscene book from the public or school libraries it would be this book although I would never do that because I don't believe in banning books.    I'd like to remind you that other religions say their morals are as right as yours.  You've decided to put your faith in a Christian god.  Good luck with that!   Have you ever considered that the image that God created mankind is not a physical mirror image but a potential mirror image of His intent and His compassion reflected in your soul/spirit?     Maybe "God' intentionally made the possibility of what "we" would call an aberration of nature for a purpose. Maybe he had a purpose for these people?   I'm not one to delve into knowing the mind of such a God but it seems to me that if there is a god, all his creations were meant for some purpose even if they don't fit into our limited and contrived boxes and as such maybe, just maybe, this god is testing your compassion and what this god gave people as far as intellect.    I kinda remember a sermon were Jesus said something along the lines of "as you treat the least fortunate then my father shall treat you".  Jog my memory please!     You define these Christians as hypocritical.  I do not.  A thorough reading of the Bible states that true believers are compelled to spread the gospel of Christ and make unbelievers understand the consequences of the choice they are given.  If they then choose to not follow the rules and commandments of Christianity then they shall burn in hell if the Christians don't do it first.  They've just replaced the actual burning with yelling taunts and insults. Everyone likes  some encouragement!  The tired argument that Fundamental Christians are tolerant is laughable.  They are as intolerant as the most Fundamentalist Muslim radicals.   A true follower of Christianity understands this and I respect their devout faith. It certainly rings truer than the milk-toasty pick and choose bible verses that fits whatever society you're in now deems moral for the majority of Christians of late. Talk about hypocritical!   I'm saying that the true Christians aren't hypocritical or self-apologizing for their persecution of non-Christians. They truly believe that conversion is a matter of everlasting life.  Where I would rein them in is when it comes to mine or my children's rights to a neutral place to work or go to school.   Okay, I'm getting the picture now.  I've had to pay the property tax on my mothers house too.  I wouldn't include that in my own tax bill though.  You and your sister and mother have moved back on to help offset his tax burden and their housing situation.  That is your (PA=you'ins) choice but you didn't have to.  So don't include this in you recap of taxes you have to pay.  The $1600+ would be the same as if you were buying food, repairs to the home, insurance or paid for a replacement AC.    What I'm saying is you misrepresented yourself in your original argument with ACA concerning your tax liabilities.      "If in your world "Christians" are bullying non Christian people, then they aren't Christians at all."  In the real world, real Christians from many denominations have not only bullied but persecuted and many times murdered non-Christians or Christians from other sects all over the world.  Your No True Scotsman argument is quite false.  As far as your question about my own experience I would like to point out that I never said I was persecuted.  I said members of my family were bullied in school by Christians.  One example I can give you among many was the bullying my niece received at her school from her classmates when she "revealed" that her grandparents were Buddhist.  One would have thought by the reactions she received that she had said her grandparents were Satanist that practiced ritual baby killings.  The mean comments and ostracizing she got from the other kids were vicious and unrelenting even though she, herself was Christan  She would come home and cry uncontrollably because she couldn't defend herself or her grandparents at her age and none of her teachers ever tried stop the bullying.  This is the reason that these clubs, even in elementary schools are needed.    It's not an agenda supposedly pushing atheism or even homosexuality.  It's about giving children of different backgrounds, different faiths or lack of, and sexual orientation a safe place to express themselves, vent, and connect with others of like mind.  The sad thing is many schools willfully oppose and actively try to prevent these non-traditional clubs from forming.      I'm going to assume that the 30.57% for property tax is based on the % of the total taxes you pay which you state is $16,000.  That would mean your property tax is around $4800.    I pay about $1800 a year in property tax on a house appraised at $100,000. Assuming rates in PA are the same, you are living in a home valued at around $250,000 on a income of $25,000?    I can see where you might appreciate the help of your relatives.  With such a limited income you couldn't afford a mortgage, insurance, and taxes.  Did you inherit this property?     Your total tax rate is 64% (or higher because standard deductions weren't included) in your earnings bracket? Where the heck do you live that state or city taxes are that high?   How are they using bulling as a weapon?  A weapon against what? The fact that Christians in the the USA have dominated and bullied other members of other religions for centuries and are now crying discrimination because they can't bully and discriminate? You should apologize! The only agenda I see from atheists is full inclusion into society and the protection of their children from hateful comments like, "you and your whole family is going to burn in Hell" from a 8 year old classmate.    Whether or not you are aware of Christian religious bulling in schools it in fact happens and my family has has been in its cross-hairs.  If you think that atheist are only the bully maybe you're confused with the rights that adult atheists have tried to stand up for but, as far as the school yard persecution, that is alive and well and these clubs may help to keep these groups (non-christians and atheists) safe and maybe even excepted despite the bigotry and myopic views that are handed down to the unfortunate children of ignorant parents.    In a convenience store in New Orleans in front of the clerk an old black man asked me if I wanted to be a virgin again and said he could do it.  I was a 34 yr old white woman holding my 4 yr old son's hand.      Are you writing a dissertation or something? To your questions, he doesn't subscribe to any hard religions and is keeping his mind open but doesn't identify with Satanism anymore.  I think your comment was valid.  The point I was trying to make is that non-religious parents sometimes make the same mistakes as religious ones....in that your children aren't really your own. That you may wish for a  cookie-cutter imprint on them, don't expect it because they are separate human beings with a mind of their own.    Funny but I did research Satanism at the time and came up with more or less the same conclusion although I refrained from quizzes.   He's 18 now and has a completely different perspective.  He does play the bass and after a brief love affair with Pantera has embraced Jazz and Blues.  His IQ is around 160 and will be entering the Navy's nuke program soon unless I can talk him out of being a MU!  To all the freethinker parents out there beware and yes, it's a good idea to teach your child basic religious instruction.   I'm shaking my head in disbelief that you've equated physical strength to intellectual and emotional strength. Women are for the most part, physically weaker then men. So what. The largest mammal on the earth is a female. Do you really equate that to some elementary school yard argument that men are, as a gender, smarter then women and thus supports the bibles' arguments of gender inequality when it comes to matters of social involvement in religion and politics?   Being an atheist I thought very hard about my influence on my child.  I wanted him to be a freethinker and hoped he would come close to the same conclusions I've come to so I tried to teach him critical thinking skills assuming he would reach the "right" conclusion.  Was I ever thrown for a loop when he announced he was a Satanist on his Facebook page when he was 15!    Well if we are to dive into the reasons gay marriage should be illegal under the Christian Flag then we should also consider the circumstances that would allow marriages to be legal under the same flag.    First, polygamy.  Many of the Old Testament Prophets and Patriarchs had multiple wives, including Lamech, Abraham, Jacob, Esau, Gideon, Saul, David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Elkanah, Ashur, Abijah and Jehoiada. Some interpretations also suggest Moses had a second wife in Tharbis. Other polygamists identified in the Bible include Ahab, Ahasuerus, Ashur, Belshazzar, Benhadad, Caleb, Eliphaz, Ezra, Jehoiachin, Jehoram, Jerahmeel, Joash, Machir, Manasseh, Mered, Nahor, Simeon, and Zedekiah.  Second, the age of the bride was usually customary to be 12 years or even younger.   Third, that rape victims were required to marry their rapist since their value as property was diminished. Deuteronomy 22:28-29.  Forth, slaves or prisoners of war were forced in marriage. Numbers 31:7-18 and Judges 21: 10-24.  Want to base US laws on what your myopic view of Christianity deems fitting as marriage then go right ahead and see how your Christian flag gets saluted!    Indulge me to allow the rephrasing of your statement:   "The argument is that men and women differ and are not the same. You guys like to foment the idea that that is not true - that men and women are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect."  The argument is that blacks and whites differ and are not the same. You guys like to (sic)foment the idea that that is not true - that blacks and whites are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect.  Sounds a lot like an argument for the Jim Crow, separate but equal laws doesn't it?   Racism and sexism are both based on fear and the idea of superiority, dominance and submission.  The fact is the bible, from the beginning to the end, stresses the superiority of men over women. Whether one can prove Paul promoted this or not is irrelevant since the rest of the "good book" is quite clear.    You made the statement that men and women differ in some sort of mental capacity that affects their abilities to respond or react which somehow prevents a woman from being equal to a man. I asked you for examples and instead you asked me for examples from my experience in the military which I will provide after you defend your original statement.       rape seed oil = canola oil.    I'd like you to show some examples where women and men have different capabilities, responses or reactions that aren't culturally ingrained.    As a former military member I've seen the gamut and find that men are no more different in their intellectual makeup then women especially under stress.      B. This one always got me.  Eve was deceived by a smooth talking serpent that claimed to know the mind of God and what would happen to them.  Since Eve didn't know right from wrong how could she make an ethical decision based on her experience. (If you've ever had young children you will know that telling them not to do something doesn't mean they understand that it's wrong or evil). Adam is influenced by Eve, who is, for all intent and purposes is a lessor creature and as naive as he is but he succumbs to, not a sly talking serpent, but a mere woman. Does he get the brunt of God's wrath for being gullible? No! Eve does! She has to bear children in pain for her "crime" alone. They both have to leave Eden but Adam had no specific punishment for his "crime".  Sorry, but just typing this out makes the story even more ridiculous!    From my experience and that of my mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great great grandmother etc., we all agree that all men and women came from a women body following the conception required from both sexes.    The fact that the bible considers women an afterthought and not made in the same image or glory of god is the reason that half of the human population has been treated like sub-humans without the basic freedoms of thought, speech, movement or self-determination that the average man enjoys.  Paul clearly defines a woman's role as existing for the benefit of men. To me, it's not much different then Playboy's exploitation of women.     As to your original question.....YES!   My ex was a framer/carpenter and grew a beard every winter.  I went through this same thing every spring when he shaved it off although it was kinda like makin' out with a different guy for awhile!   First person to mention emotional pain. That kind of pain can last a long time and no medicine can really help.  I'd give you gold if I had it.  Sorry for your loss.   Diverticulitis!  Occurs when small indigestible things like seeds, corn or bits of nuts get stuck in small pockets that have formed in the lower intestine and then become infected.  When the first bout occurred they gave me 1.0 gram of dilaudid which is 8x stronger than morphine and that wasn't even close enough to allow me to stand up straight!  The worst part is that I'm a chef and can no longer eat anything that has those ingredients.     I think Annie Oakley said it best when she said men, that were a sure shot, were considered marksmen but when she did it, it was trick-shooting.    In this day and age, the favorite double standard between male and female managers is that men have an opinion on how to get things done and women have an opinionated view that is female centered. Complete BS!    Good for you bitch!   As the overweight middle-aged woman that uses the scooters in the grocery store and gets the occasional funny looks from some people I don't even know, I say screw them.  This is what they don't know.  I'm a military veteran that is 90% disabled. I can walk short distances but prolonged standing or walking is excruciating. The steroids I'm given have significantly contributed to my size along with depression and PTSD. I resisted using a cart at shopping outings but my husband loves to shop and browse so I gave in.     So to all the redditors out there that say I'm not a person, I'm gross, don't have any self-discipline, selfish because I took a cart from an old person, or whatever other vitriolic spew comes forth, I'll tell you to look in the mirror. How many of you have served your country and suffered from it?  To those that have served you know, but the majority of comments are from those that have no clue and to those I say you're welcome. Every time I get those looks or comments here I hold my head up high and wish everyone a peaceful good day!       The problem is that you're being intellectually dishonest with yourself and you aren't living in the reality that those "words" can motivate people to justify their position that they are entitled to withhold a persons right to full representation in government and in the free market.   Here in Texas, I'm not allowed to hold a public office even though I'm a highly decorated and disabled veteran of the military.  Why?  Because I'm an atheist and I refuse to say that an ice cream cone on a hot summers day is my definition of a god.      The church I grew up and was confirmed in refused to let me get married there because I hadn't attended in 8 years. I was a minor and my mother moved to another side of our city. He was British so this didn't surprise me although I was disappointed with the congregation's reaction.   Heh, my mom was talking about this and I can't help but chime in on the subject (I am her son).  Honestly, I really have no opinion on the subject, as I have never had a partner say "Eeew, I don't like you being cut, so we just aren't going to have sex." or vice versa.  I am not any happier or in any way saddened by being cut.  Hey, at the very bottom line, I'm a little grateful for being able to be lazy with hygiene (although I'm not) and get away with it.  Also: As I know no different, I can't say for sure that I'm as sexually "effective" as I would otherwise be, but I'm not impotent, and that's the (relatively, because I don't plan on having any kids any time soon) important part.  Oh, and I know a few people that are Jewish, and it's more about honoring Abraham than appeasing any kind of god.   Your putting up a paper tiger.    Explain to me why I, as a disabled military veteran with an approved dog can be refused service from a taxi driver because his religious beliefs think that dogs are unclean or my religious beliefs won't let you carry a bottle of wine in my luggage.  What if, as a taxi business, I wouldn't pick you up and drop you off at your home because my religious beliefs dictated that as a woman you have no rights?     Are you a parent?    I covered the ability to provide part.  My analysis is not "silly". If you're too lazy to research the topic then try this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGx4IlppSgU Although not comprehensive into full series of the Mask of Men it's a starting point!    I'm not ashamed but I do regret my part in the decision. His father had a say in the matter too.  However, your anger at me is misdirected.  Our society puts a lot of pressure to conform and while my decision was partially based on this I do not think he is deformed or had his sexuality affected in any way.    With that being said, I'm sure your own mother and father would like to circumcise whatever organ that causes the vitriolic bile that spews from your mouth and replace it with a civilized prosthetic.          No. There were studies then that indicated circumcision reduced the rate of cancer and other diseases but they were later  dismissed because the subjects studied were in third-world countries were sanitation/hygiene weren't considered a priority.        Hoping it's not a nail!   As an Atheist/Buddhist I had my son circumcised because of health reasons and concerns from his father as far as being different.  I've asked him as an adult and he has no problem with it.  As as women and have experienced both I'd say I prefer a circumcised penis. Sorry Foreskin!    Only the balls man, only the balls! Dicks don't cause pregnancy, nads do.  Keep the penis!   I think you hit the nail on the head!    Unlike girls, that naturally "become" women based on their first menses, some cultures feel the need to provide a time in which boys "become" men based also on their ability to procreate since there is no specific event for males.  Menstruation and childbirth=pain and blood so, in some cultures, not surprisingly, they require boys to demonstrate their ability to withstand pain and/or survive an injury involving blood, although this can also coincide with an ability to provide for his family.  The example above does both and also puts the burden of birth control on the male!    Again my friend, what are you referring to?   You have the right to refuse service to anyone as long as it's not based on sex, religion, national origin, race or sexual orientation.  These categories are based on federal laws.  Do you feel you have the religious right to circumvent federal laws.....yes or no?      Not my first memory but when I was six I remember the phone rang one evening and my Mom answered. She then threw the receiver at my Dad saying it was his girlfriend. Two months later he was gone and my mother started working. We were babysat at home and on July 5 I fell and broke my arm looking for fireworks my gran had given us. I spent 2 days in the hospital then went to live with my cousins and never went back home. Fast-forward to 2009 and my gran died on July 4th.  You'd think Independence Day would be a sad time for me but it hasn't.   I hope Christmas wasn't totally ruined for you.   "gay couple discriminating based on religion".....what are you talking about?   Did you type these estimates/statistics with a straight face? LOL   Reminds me of "The Incredible Mr Limpet"!   If you have a public business then yes, you have to give a valid reason to refuse service.   It's not based on a sense of entitlement but a history of discrimination that did not allow blacks to use the same front door or stay at the same hotel where they entertaining whites ect.  If you are going to discriminate based on race, religion, sex, or disability then you have to state this and prove why.   Sorry Sid, at first I thought you meant that all gays were good at flower arrangements and decorating cakes. You still however, haven't answered the soundness of your proposed business plan.    Considering that HC covered 282 laws it would definably be impressive!  The problem with the Big 10 is that six of the "laws" directly conflict with the US Constitution. The remaining four are almost universal and do not need to be tied to a specific religion.      The largest Christian charity is Christian but not Catholic.  Real justice under your oldest, continuously operating institution in the world that condoned murder upon innocents and "heretics" in the past for over 400 years and in real time, (it's denial of their support the Catholic Church gave Hitler.) leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Don't believe me LIU.   Well said.   Does a person starting a business that only targets 10% of the population across all socio-economic status that may or may not get married much less use a florist or baker sound like they have a good business plan?   BTW, your narrow-minded stereotype of gays is almost laughable if it weren't out-dated.       It can if it will get all those Christians to stop insisting on the "big ten" being posted everywhere based on the US being a Christian Nation!   I should clarify that I'm looking for the reasons or arguments to justify any discrimination based on religious beliefs and how far should you be allowed to go and not solutions.  If you believe religious discrimination is okay then is it okay for you to be discriminated against based on another religion. The case of Muslim taxi drivers that won't allow service dogs or bottles of alcohol in in their cabs comes to mind.    "What church do you go to"   You don't have to blow up. Calmly tell them that you disagree and that while you understand and appreciate their concerns you must follow your own conscience. Maybe you can add that sometime in the future you may change your mind just to give them hope and shut them up.   I understand how it hurts to think that family could think this way but you need to understand that they don't wish this upon you. They really believe this to be your fate and only want the best for you however misguided. Life is short. Live your life as true to yourself as you possibly can no matter is it upsets ANYONE. Live in reality always and never live a lie!   You, your parents and brother are all behaving hypocritically. Is your sister the source of tension? Why can't you all hold your own opinions?     If you are an atheist or agnostic and have read the AA material that treats "patients" like some primitive sub-humans that will someday see the light then well, its no wonder its supposed miracle cure doesn't work. Just a little snake oil and a lot of jobs in the rehab business are on the hook if this lie is ever found out.      I could be wrong now, but I don't think so!  At an AA meeting you are depending on others that are emotionally stunted due to their substance dependence to help you through your own problems. Sounds like a bad plan to me.   The expectation though is that you will eventually "mature" or grow to understand that your limited view of a higher power actually is the Christian god.  I guess that if believing a doorknob is your higher power and it helps to stop you from self destruction then go for it.   For me and others like me, this is intellectually dishonest so the program could never provide any help. I never had any legal problems involving alcohol. I just knew I was drinking too much and needed help so I self referred to the Navy's rehab program.  What I didn't do was check my constitutional right to freedom of religion at the door in order to get medical care.      I find your attitude about 12-step programs refreshing.  So many of those that have been helped by AA/NA, which are few compared to the number of people that have tried it, become almost cultish about 12-steps being the only program that works.  I'm an atheistic Buddhist so AA's principles were in conflict with the Buddhist principle that the power to change comes from within yourself and, of course the fact that I hold no belief in Gods.  There are several organizations that you can recommend. I used Rational Recovery but there is also S.O.S., Secular Organization for Sobriety and Women for Sobriety.    WFS is particularly helpful because the challenges female alcoholics face are usually different then mens and some AA/NA groups can be predatory toward women that are in a vulnerable state i.e., the 13th step.    Again thanks for having the insight to realize AA is not a one fits all fix. Best wishes to you!    "I don't think the literature, or the opinion of many recovering addicts, agrees with your notion that AA "is clearly a religious program" and requires a belief in God."  Several federal court opinions have found that compulsory participation in AA/NA is unconstitutional because of its religious nature.  Have you read the condescending chapter in the Big Book addressed to the Agnostic? It clearly says that a higher power is a reference to God.    The moral of the story is don't let anyone define you including yourself.   I agree that actually making love with a woman is preferable to watching and jacking off to a porn video. I like to watch porn and sometimes with my SO *BUT*...... The problem is most porn makes a caricature of what actual sex is like so that people, especially if they are young with no experience, think that this is the norm when it's not.  Young women don't feel they measure up to the women they see  in the videos. Young men often feel inadequate compared to the videos. When this is their bench mark, and you have to include the performances of their favorite entertainers, they have no REAL REFERENCE POINT to gauge their real  sexuality and how to express it.  This has led to to so much sexual dysfunction among Americans that is could be be referred to as an epidemic.  Pat's worse than a moron. He's a charlatan that has bilked millions to pay for his extreme wealthy lifestyle. He's smart and savvy. A moron doesn't know better but Pat is the poster child of why religious entities such as church's like his needs to be audited by the IRS.  He is nothing more than a snake-oil salesmen and HE KNOW THIS! Just can't wait for his except status is pulled.       You didn't listen to Pat, the pictures are the problem because we can never measure up. Maxim did teach me how to hypnotize a live lobster though the purpose of this knowledge was just to impress/seduce a woman.     Okay, I agree but only if you include men that read Maxim. It too offers the same idiotic advise to men as Cosmo gives to women only spelled different.   You obviously should be so proud of your Dad.   Urine is sterile by the way.    Can you explain? I thought any number multiplied by 0=0.    Pissing on yourself or your "friend" will stop the pain from some plants and insects such as bull nettles, mosquitoes, ant bites and some jellyfish stings. Ammonia works well too if ya don't have it in ya.    Nice try!   And was appealed and overturned.   Most menstruating women that have cramps don't go to sickcall unless it's severe or are bleeding heavily or for too long. Believe it or not, women know that Pamperin and Motrin can help and use those.  Most though, just get through it and get on with life.   What exceptional story are you referring to?   What a beautiful calli! We have one that's a stray. She drinks from our Koi pond and catches the mice so we feed her dry food. She got flack from our two cats but doesn't anymore.  Try this; make sure Sasha is there before you feed her. Give Sasha a Tablespoon of what you're feeding the stray (even if it's the same thing you feed your cat everyday, Sasha will go for it for territorial reasons).  It's a distraction and it reinforces a positive element to the visits from the stray.  Worked for us, they now touch noses through the glass door to our sunroom.  As far as the hole......bad idea!  You're inviting squirrels, coons, skunks and possums to make their home there.   Good luck and best wishes!   What happened?   Blame it on their period? JK I know guys get it too.   Chef here, most of us keep super glue in our knife bag for this exact purpose. Also, black pepper is great to stop bleeding on a small cut.   This may surprise you but no.  Some of the best sex talkers out there are guys!   I'm sorry for this but I just imagined Lil Jon saying "What!, what?.   Any deaf people out the that want to enjoy phone sex? Maybe I'll make a million printing the "white" pages.   Keep trying.  Do you have assists other than the VA? You might try the DVR in your state   The military medical corps is advised to try to distinguish between real medical situations vs. those that are suspect. The end result is everyone is considered suspect until otherwise proven because of ppl trying to get out of duty, which, if you are in a medical emergency can be fatal in the wrong command and can't get proper medical evaluation.    Hope your Dad is Okay but still, NOT COOL!   I've heard if you crush up the tablets and heat them with ammonia it makes a very good mesquito remedy.   Sounds like my uncle.  He has prostrate problems that he take meds for fluid retention. He was hospitalized for it and has high blood pressure but he'll drink a 2 liter coke a day and even salts his pizza and smokes. He's homeless and I let him stay here briefly with me and my husband during which he pissed on our guest bed. I made him wear diapers the rest of the time but he became insulted and left. If he doesn't care, why should I?   Exactly    military?   You're so right. I've heard many stories of the Navy blowing off back pain, men and women but women have to go through the ol' is it your period or pregnant part first even if we're post menopausal and it's in our record lol.  VA care isn't much better.   If you cut off a small piece called an "eye" that then can sprout it's possible but doubtful.    Really dude, What kind of outward sign do you need to have your arbitrary pain taken seriously?   After being given Motrin and sent back to the field when I couldn't stand up-right I ended up at the local civilian hospital and after they took the time to look for a cause, found I was suffering from diverticulitis (not rare) and given morphine for pain.  I hope you're not anywhere in the medical field especially the military.   Yeh well maybe she forgot or didn't know that a potato cause those symptoms.    Maybe. It's not legally considered part of the sex industry though child labor laws might come into play. I guess you wouldn't be able to call your service as Googoo, ooo, oooo, ooooo, Gaga, aa, aaa , aaaaa!     My family member hasn't faced murder charges but he told me he killed his best friends' wife because she took/sold all his pain medication until he died of cancer. I have no evidence he did this and someone else was with him. I only have his word.       Phone sex operator. It's legal, you can be any age or in any shape/disability and work your own hours. Put an ad in the paper. Great tax write-offs too!   "woman came in complaining of severe stomach pain. He was expecting to diagnose her with menstrual cramps or something else rudimentary and gave her basic pain meds etc"  This pisses me off. As a female with a 20 yr career in the Navy I can't count how many times some male corpsman blew off my symptoms this way.  If this story was true, which I doubt because a vine growing from a potato would not be able to grow outside the uterus/vagina and make its way to the spine, and she was in severe abdominal pain and the only thing he did was give her Motrin then send her on her way he would have been brought up on charges if it was found she was suffering from a real medical emergency condition.   That said, I think your buddy was just drunkenly jerking your leg. Thanks for letting me vent though!    Barry, can you back any of your statements with facts?  Or are you just being ignorant and ranting because you're well, ignorant.   No, this is soo right!   Sorry bicyclists, but you get what you deserve. Saw this all the time in San Diego. Bike clubs would ride in formation and since there were so many of them they would block stop signs and force the whole group to go through, blocking regular traffic and pedestrian traffic. I guess the spandex and the fact that they are "what?" means they are above the rules.    Why do you think I should have reverence for a book that has negatively influenced the treatment of half of the human population simply because of the sex that they were born into. The bible, and specifically the Genesis story has condemned women into second-class status slightly higher than a child. Woman are held responsible for the downfall of all mankind and because of your "good" book women have paid tremendous injustices over the centuries for just being born female.     The story of A   E is a myth that has been used to subjugate women  by blame and slander. As for the morality of 1,000 years ago when slavery and entire nations drew their moral code from the bible, I just wonder what kind of planet you think live on ???    Let their dog shit all over the complex but especially the area around the mail boxes and not pick it up so we have to smell it when picking up our mail.    You're not too well acquainted with the correctional/justice system. As a law student you should be. Jails don't correct anyone. If anything they create criminals.    My question was how is the law practically applied? Does society only arrest those that say, threaten to jump off a bridge and in doing so tie up traffic?   Haven't heard this in years but it's appropriate, http://youtu.be/3Vl9Uz-rmIU   Pre-law student,  I was not arrested after my suicide attempt and, as far as I know, you can't charge someone who's dead with self murder, how is this law (if there is one) applied?   If you were a burned out ex-meth user, felon, and alcoholic homeless guy with permanent brain damage that has left you with mental health problems along with physical problems brought about by poor lifestyle choices, ie, diet, smoking, no exercise etc. which together makes you unable to hold down any kind of job and you have no friends or family that would be hurt if you died and you also decided to commit suicide in a manner that wouldn't affect any strangers, would it still be considered selfish?   So what? I don't care if Christianity, Judaism. or Islam has solid evidence of interpretation. Which they don't. What does solid evidence of interpretation mean?     If you mean that a religious myth has had a solid tradition of being handed down through generations of interpretations then..Big Deal! Ignorant parents raising ignorant kids. What is your point?   The constitution of the US is infinitively greater than your holy book.      Makes me wonder how they did that. As a parent you would think that it would be impossible not to develop emotional attachments. Did they just turn it on after the first birthday?   Pepper, never ever concede that which you have no proof of. Ever.  You are correct that Perry and his cronies' only objective is to change the foundation of our state government to be based on Christian Biblical rules and laws including the education of our children. I base this on his ties to the Dominionist's organizations he has supported and their specific legislation. I also agree that educator's within my state abuse and flaunt established laws and the state doesn't come down hard enough when violations are discovered.  There are, however, a few diligent rational folks in Texas that have managed, to some degree, to keep them in check.  If you know of a school district that has allowed creationism to be taught as fact you need to let me know where or at least contact the TBE.   BTW: Regarding concessions, I'm not a teacher but thanks anyway.  I'm only a disabled Navy(cook) Veteran that has had an interest in Paleontology for the last 30 years.    That's the mafia's take on it anyway.   Yes I do.  "In July 2011, the Texas Board of Education, which oversees the Texas Education Agency, did not approve anti-evolution instructional materials submitted by International Databases, LLC, while continuing to approve materials from mainstream publishers."  It might be helpful if you thoroughly read the entire contents of the links you provide.  That said, critical analysis of darwinian evolution could include the small debate between punctuated equilibrium vs uniform phyletic gradualism. The TEA does not require the teaching of creationism. Critical analysis is good to teach public school students. It also helps when reading articles on the internet.    Teaching creationism is not required in Texas. JS   Thank God it's working!   From the Bible, we find passages that won't even acknowledge a child until they are a month old. Maybe because of the death rate but at least one would simply acknowledge that they existed but they didn't.   	111
 I am in desperate need of some casual (cost-efficient) socks of varying colors. Suggestions of where to find them online for a quick purchase? And am I looking for design? No design? And what colors?   [Winter to Spring Transition](http://i.imgur.com/gIFkcWR.jpg)  Don't know if it is too late to post my outfit. And noticed that it is dark so it is difficult to see color/detail. This is my first outfit post. Please help with suggestions/comments!   We went through this about a month ago. Fake as fake can be, my friend.   Tack, you are 39 on the leader board of Win % for players playing over 1,000 games. You are beyond great.    I think this is about as accurate as one could get.   Obviously, this is a subjective question. A lot of it depends on degree and many other factors. And there will surely be jokes of "100% winz lol!!1!"    Nonetheless, at what number would you say someone has a **great** Win %?    A drive-thru liquor store.   I guess it still helps waste your night away, just with a different product.    Yeah, I should have addressed that. I know that we are supposed to have separate shoes for each, but I want to be the exception (duh)!   I won't do heavy athletics in them. I would simply wear them while at the gym doing light lifting/running. Likewise, I wouldn't wear them casually much at all, just when I need a dark shoe to compliment a particular outfit.   Here are the qualities I am looking for in the shoe:  * I don't want to spend more than $75. * They need to be a dark color (preferably black).   * Must have decent/good support. * Must strike a perfect balance, allowing me to wear them to the gym for light running/weight lifting AND out on the town with a casual day-to-day outfit.   Ideas? I've found these so far:  [**Adidas Original Dragons**](http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Dragon-Retro-Sneaker/dp/B004JXWUES/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)  [**Puma ZDC82**](http://www.amazon.com/ZDC82-Peacoat-Black-Heritage-Trainers-UK/dp/B00DEENV5K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1394861709 sr=8-2 keywords=puma+zdc)      Dude, you look great!   Awesome job maintaining your fashion in spite of your disabilities! You are one that we can all look up to. None of us have a good enough excuse to just "not care." Thanks for the inspiration!    I am still not sure if we can take these tweets as confirmation that ACV is underway. Don't get me wrong, I do believe that ACV is well underway (if not nearing  completion), but these tweets say absolutely nothing about ACV.  Ashraf Ismail was the game director for ACIV. I highly doubt that he will be the head game director for ACV as well. Although I might be wrong.   Noted. Will stray away from that practice. Thanks for the input everyone.   BTW, I didn't just make up blazer sleeve rolling:  [**Example 1**](http://static.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blazerknit.jpg)  **[Example 2](http://images.asos.com/inv/Y/15/254/884667/Blue/image1xl.jpg)**  **[Example 3](http://i509.photobucket.com/albums/s332/CurtJWild/NavyBlazerChinos00003f.jpg)**   TL;DR - It'd look good if I changed the outfit?   Well, my sleeves are rolled because, obviously, I (mistakenly) thought it looked good. And because it's warmer here.    Fairly simple question. It'd normally go under Outfit Feedback, but those don't occur on Wednesday.  I am conflicted on whether or not this works as a good navy blazer. Thoughts?  Top - http://i.imgur.com/1p8mc3j.jpg Bottom - http://i.imgur.com/1SJinyG.jpg  Any other general comments concerning the outfit as a whole would be beneficial as well. Thank you for your help!   You make great points. And I think the majority of the discussion regarding other people's finances all has to do with percentages. I do understand that some people can buy a mansion like I can buy a Big Mac. I do understand that.   But just because it is difficult to tell when night ends and day begins doesn't mean that we can't know it's midnight.  I think there is an amount of balance and wisdom in the equation. I am not to judge. And I don't really want to. It was just a personal observation and I am fully aware that I might be wrong.  *P.S. Love having the insightful conversation with you /u/BAMF_3.*    See, I think that is the very and only response that can be made. We all make judgments based off of what we see. A nice person won't make constant decisions to do mean things. Just as a selfless person wouldn't make regular decisions to be selfish.   Actions help us determine character.    Great article! This is where I am at:  While the two shirts are uniquely different and, to be fair,  the two MFA uses are uniquely different, I do not see $450 worth of value ever making sense to just "get *exactly* what one wants. I think that is a prideful and abundantly selfish thing. Sure, you could argue that clothing and fashion is a selfish pursuit to begin with. But I think this is excessive 99% of the time.    Absolutely. Coming your way.   Hello friendly mods. I was told that this is where I post to join the Assassin ranks. I currently have 565 comment karma (yes, most of my karma is from our subreddit). Can I be a Milite!?   I feel like everyone on this thread just gathered together for a big group hug...and I'm not going to lie, it felt good.    Calm as a butterfly licking nectar from a common dandelion, my fiery friend.    *As did I. We will show him.*   Remember when you told me to go f*** off and die in another thread? Do you remember who you are mean to and who you are nice to? Or did you forget?   By the way, someone literally went through this entire post and downvoted everyone's comment. Who does that?   I think so too. I saw someone else say it and I have to agree, I am going to keep my hopes up until the 17th. If nothing has been revealed by then, I'll settle back down until E3 (still holding on to some hope it will be at a conference before then).   Make sure we are reporting the facts correctly. I don't think it is Ubisoft that has two big announcements tomorrow, I believe it is IGN per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/IGN/status/442407804939550720).   Newly released video footage of Evan Ebel in a 100 mph chase and shootout with Texas authorities on March 21, 2013.   Things get real at the 6:00 minute mark, although the entire thing is full of tension.      The Genesis account is clear that representatives of all the *kinds* of land and air animals were brought to the ark ([Genesis 6:19-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+6%3A19-20 version=NIV)). This, for example, does not mean that there were two tigers and two lions, but that there were two feline kinds.   If this true, the animals that survived the Flood would have had the genetic makeup to repopulate and create the current species that we have all around the world.  Animals do not have soul, but that does not mean that they are out of God's control. He is, after all, the Divine Creator. He has complete authority over all of creation, including animals. So yes, they are obeying God.  Scripture isn't clear on a localized flood although I think this is most fitting. The Flood would have covered the *known* world at the time, as the human author would have surely meant with his limited knowledge.  **TLDR:** If God is truly a miraculous God of which the Bible purports, He could surely do the miraculous to bring about a chain of events that preserve animals through and after the Flood.   That was significantly more mean than the first.   That was mean.   Don't know who deleted this but find it just silly since that is what all of today has been in this subreddit--an attempt to come up with believable rumors.   Oh well, Darby liked it...   Do you know how to use correct punctuation?   Anyways...your comments are what's making this worth it!   It's called time travel. Are you really that dense?   Nah. Actually, that is the pic I was in. Someone must have photoshopped me out. Weird.   http://imgur.com/HsdH9Re  I just met Darby at a creative writing conference. I had no clue that he would even be there. I freaked out when I saw him. We joked about recent Reddit hype. We talked about the future of Assassin's Creed. He let me in on some stuff. Just let me say, we will all be happy by the end of the week.   I live in the Line Islands, which just happen to be the earliest time zone in the world (UTC+14:00). We are literally at the exact same time as Hawaii, but a day ahead. Anyways...  Our island's Best Buy just released the artwork and cinematic trailer here. I don't want to ruin it for you guys. Let's just say...there's a new assassin!!!   Guys, honestly. I was on a cruise ship the other day and we were raided by pirates. No kidding. They swung on board screaming, "WE WANT YOUR BOOTY!" I freaked out. I had no clue what to do. So I did the only logical thing I could think of...  So when I abandoned ship and dove into the water I took a diving bell to get deep and far away from the booty snatchin' pirates. You're not going to believe what happened next...  After I punched the shark in the eye it swam away. I found another barrel, refreshed my oxygen supply, and continued to dive. Guess what happened...  I opened the treasure box that I found at the bottom of the ocean. I didn't even have to fumble with the latch, I just hit the box and it sprung open. Inside...Inside guys...there's no guessing this one so I'll just tell you...  A rolled up parchment. It read: *ACVREVEAL3414*  I have no clue what it means, just thought I should share.   Ender's Game is a fantastic book. It shows the brilliant potential of children and takes you into the mind of a genius. The cast of characters are dynamic and compelling. The story is riveting and well-rounded, easily accessible for many ages, backgrounds, and enjoyments.   If you decide to continue the series, stay with the Ender's Saga (Speaker for the Dead) if you enjoy the intellectual/philosophical nature of Ender's Game. Move to the Bean Saga (Ender's Shadow) if you enjoyed the action sequences the most in Ender's Game.   They've commented numerous times that there will be an annual canonical release. [Here](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-director-defends-yearly-releases/1100-6391787/) you go.    No one needs to relax. This is all part of the fun. We love Assassin's Creed. We love conspiracies. And we love hype. So...  Hop on the hype train. It's a lot of fun.  	44

Oops, didn't see that. ;)         ...which is nice.   [Oh yes!]( http://youtu.be/CzYHllLv_IE)   One factor is that the Senate thought Caesar wanted to be king and all powerful, the evidence for this is that 'He was happy to be treated like a God' and that 'From that time on Rumours spread that he wanted to be king'.  Another reason was because the Senate thought he was too popular, the evidence for this is that 'Caesar was liked by all the other Generals and 'He led the Army on expeditions that no other General would even dare to consider'. Also 'He was their leader, their idol, the one they were aspired to please.' This links to the paragraph above because he was so popular that many people wanted him to be king.  One other factor for his murder is that the Senate were afraid of his military power; the evidence for this is that 'He was undefeated in battle and that he was respected by the other entire Generals'. In addition to this, one of the army's brave men came forward and said 'He was the greatest warrior of all time, why would any soldier wish to have him dead? He was the bravest man I knew and I don't think that there's a braver man all over the world.' This links to the paragraph above because the senate were afraid of him due to the fact that most people loved him.  The most important reason why the Senate murdered Julius Caesar was because Caesar ignored the wishes of the senate; the evidence to this is that 'They had never forgiven him for entering Rome against their wishes'. Also, Caesar ignored their wishes because some senators hated him. Furthermore, a young woman aged 27 stated 'I am so glad that he ignored the senate's wishes for him not entering Rome because if it wasn't for him the army would not have enough courage or hope to go any further. I couldn't thank him enough for being an amazing General and he will be sorely missed over all of Rome.'  Just before Caesar went to the Senate his wife warned him and asked him not to go but he refused not to go, she said this 'You mustn't go! I fear that something bad is going to happen, I sense a death will occur tonight! Please don't go, I'm begging you'.   Wow! I found the long lost 4th face expression from Nicolas Cage!   We have clearence, Clarence!    If you are watching naked people in cold weather fart on a regular basis, I assume you would see something.  Just tried to google something like that (video:naked people farting in cold weather). I was not successful. You are wrong as long you are not proofing you're right.   Well, in this case it would be possible to see a "wet" fart. But i never did.   It's a myth. Joints produce that crack when bubbles burst in the fluid surrounding the joint.  Joints are the meeting points of two separatebones, held together and in place by connective tissues and ligaments. All of the joints in our bodies are surrounded by synovial fluid, a thick, clear liquid. When you stretch or bend your finger to pop the knuckle, you're causing the bones of the joint to pull apart. As they do, the connective tissue capsule that surrounds the joint is stretched. By stretching this capsule, you increase its volume. And as we know from chemistry class, with an increase in volume comes a decrease in pressure. So as the pressure of the synovial fluid drops, gases dissolved in the fluid become less soluble, forming bubbles through a process calledcavitation. When the joint is stretched far enough, the pressure in the capsule drops so low that these bubbles burst, producing the pop that we associate with knuckle cracking.  It takes about 25 to 30 minutes for the gas to redissolve into the joint fluid. During this period of time, your knuckles won't crack. Once the gas is redissolved, cavitation is once again possible, and you can start popping your knuckles again.    [ The common claim that cracking one's knuckles causesarthritisappears unsupported.]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints#Effects)     This is a question bothering me a long time. I mean, it's body temperatered air in both cases.          Quote from Wikipedia:  BASIC(anacronymforBeginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family ofgeneral-purpose,high-level programming languageswhose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use.  In 1964,John G. KemenyandThomas E. Kurtzdesigned the original BASIC language atDartmouth Collegein New Hampshire. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something onlyscientistsandmathematicianstended to learn how to use.        http://i.imgur.com/ObESSWP.jpg   After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait.      http://i.imgur.com/xvgpToy.png   [Oh, and there is a famous painting of this scene by Ilya Repin](http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/ilya-repin/the-reply-of-the-zaporozhian-cossacks-to-sultan-mahmoud-iv-1891)                  I followed the discussion here and raise by [Karl Jatho](http://www.karl-jatho.com/html/we_were_the_first.html)   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Jatho      Or he is Rick James.

 Blitzball is hands down the best mini game in a Final Fantasy. Second the entire Gold Saucer from 7. If you ever get a chance to play 9 I do highly recommend it. It's quite different from all the others   I would have to say Final Fantasy 9. I am a big rpg fan and I remember playing it so much when I was younger. I've completed it several times. I would say the others ones from the sort of time (7, 8 and 10) are some of my favourite but for me nothing beats 9. The world, the characters who never seem to take themselves quite seriously and the little glimpse of what's to come when you see Garnets edilons when you first control her!

Ted Kord has only ever shared a single panel with this version of Booster Gold before -- in Futures End: Booster Gold. That issue saw Booster careening out of control through DC's Multiverse, before ending up "home" in the pre-Flashpoint DC Universe. The armored costume -- generally depicted with an A.R.G.U.S. emblem on it, although not here -- first appeared in the Justice League International Annual #1 in the New 52, meaning that Ted Kord was not a superhero and shared no history with Booster Gold when that look debuted.  It's likely that this Booster Gold is the same one who, in a different uniform, lent guidance and occasional surreptitious assitance to his younger self and his son Rip Hunter during Booster Gold Volume 2. That "Older Booster" was last seen just before Flashpoint during the Time Masters: Vanishing Point miniseries tied to the Return of Bruce Wayne event. That version of Booster would have been the one whose younger self worked extensively with Blue Beetle on the JLI and later the Justice League America.  Currently, the pair of old friends and former Justice Leaguers are working together in Justice League 3000...but that doesn't take place in the "regular" DC Universe, but instead in a similar universe where Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis' humor-tinged, nostalgic take on the Justice League International is the standard. That world is a version of the pre-New 52 DC Universe, but one in which (among other things) Ralph Dibny isn't dead and Max Lord never went evil.

I've recorded the first three parts, but in the last part, on the 4th and 5th lines, you have the repeated "the" at the end of the 4th line and the beginning of the 5th line.  So would you like it on the 4th or 5th line, because that affects the rhythm also.  thanks :)   oh, wow; I didn't notice it was two links.  sorry about that :)   Idk if you're still looking for recordings, but if so, where is the text of the poem?

I have always said "you guys"   same, just within America, and with Spanish  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7   Yeah, sometimes accents are clearcut and sometimes they are not so strong and are percieved differently by different groups; I would assume that is based on the comparison with their own accents.  I have a similar situation http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7   I was raised bilingual (English and Spanish).  I learned French in HS, but apparently I speak French with a Spanish accent.     I don't live on a border, but I know exactly what that's like: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7   This is actually a complicated question for me.  I grew up in the American South (North Carolina to be specific), but my parents grew up in New York (and we regularly visited the rest of the family up there).  So I learned to talk around ex New Yorkers.  So, in NC anyways, everyone says I have a neutral accent; after I give speeches, sometimes people tell me they like the sound of my voice.  So yeah.  One time though, my cousin, from Brooklyn, while in Brooklyn, said that I have a "thick southern accent;" and I told her that she has no idea what that is.  There are people in my town that I cannot understand a word they say, but I digress.  So to my relatives in NY, I have some degree of a southern accent. In the actual south, where I am from, I have a neutral accent.   I am currently studying in the UK.  I have a clearly American accent.    Also, to complicate it more, I am hispanic; my parents are fluent, but given ESL, I have been gradually learning that I have been pronouncing some words in a spanish way. (like Acetominophen (Tylenol) is, in English, pronounced Ah See Toe Min Uh Fen, and I had been saying, Ah Ceh Toh Mean Oh Fen, as that was the only way I'd ever head it said, by my parents).  TL; DR:  Raised in NC by ex NY-ers; accent sounds neutral to southerners but sounds southern to northerners, with some spanish elements mixed in   3   I don't read romance novels on principle, but I have a high amount of respect for John Green as a writer.  These are certainly more than just romance stories, tackling lots of complex issues.  Given that, I still have not read TFIOS because I am avoiding the disappointment I felt after reading Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants when it was so popular and I was in middle school.   I had jumped on that bandwagon, and the ending just rubbed me the wrong way so much.  I would have rathered she dated the counselor or never slept with him at all.    I know the gist of TFIOS, and have read the first chapter or so as an excerpt somewhere, but I don't think I want to read it and be disappointed by the inevitable tragedy or "oblivion" within.     I've never seen any of that either...maybe I'm just lucky too.   That some colleges have math course requirements to get in if you're transferring from community college.  So if you took AP's, make sure to follow up that admissions received your AP score report, because it gets delivered to a different record keeping department by default, so if admissions never sees it, you will not be shown as meeting the course requirements to get in, so you will be denied.   And if you go to the school to point out your APs and ask them to fix it, they will say its too late and just tell you to come back next year.  Sorry about the run-on; its past midnight and idc  Source: this happened to me, so I went to a school online (Southern New Hampshire University) and finished in just one more year.  I am now in grad school studying abroad.   here's the thing though; we were told this so much in high school.  BUT, if you're taking AP courses and dual-enrolled in college courses while in high school, and participating in clubs as well, when you do go to college it will be so much easier.   They drilled into us how college is so much harder, and I am in grad school now and have only had one course that was in any way harder than my high school courses, and not really, I just didn't try.    The pressure to succeed and the workload is triple for a high school junior or senior with APs and Extra Curriculars than it is for a college student.  Disclosure: My degrees are in Criminal Justice and Forensic Psychology; and the graduate program I am in is Political Science. (These majors involve more essays than tests).  Second disclosure: I am the kind of person who doesn't study.  But I take extensive notes.  The act of writing something down makes me remember it.    Well I made it to the end of the first semester of Grad school before that happened to me...   some schools have a policy that you cannot check out a book from the library if it is a required textbook for a course you are enrolled in.   I was raised bilingual (english and spanish) , and I just realized this last year   I heard the same story from my French teacher in high school.   well we already know you're against it :)  But in all seriousness, neither Israel nor Palestine would want to give up territory to Hamas and allow them to form a "legitimate" state.  Palestine might be more willing to compromise on that, given that Hamas is already involved in their government, but I don't think Israel would be willing to make that concession.

You hear me? You could spread PB on a turd and I would happily eat it.   I liked having a tall locker. The smaller ones were hard to get into if the dude below you was fucking around in theirs. I once had a small locker (a bottom one), and the person who had the locker above mine left a sandwich in theirs throughout the Christmas break. The smell of rotten salami and mayonnaise made its way into my locker and stayed there for the rest of the year. The few articles of clothing I left behind over the break smelled, my gym shoes smelled (and not like my sweaty feet), and worst of all my text books smelled. I had to throw out everything except the text books, because I couldn't just replace those --they were way too expensive. I used those text books for the rest of the year, even though they stunk up every classroom they entered.      TL;DR - don't rent a small locker.   Take it easy, buuuuuuuuuuuuuud-day.

 And even then nothing changes, because Obama will just veto anything the Dems don't like. And the Repubs don't have majorities to override vetos.   If the GOP win the Senate, nothing changes.  Any bill passed by the House and Senate that Democrats disapprove of will be vetoed by Obama and nothing will change that because the GOP do not have 2/3 majorities in both houses, or even one house.  Gridlock before midterms and gridlock after.   Power is always the last thing to go.   Correct. The Circuit Court made a ruling that the ban was unconstitutional, then the Supreme Court denied the case, and a federal judge just ruled that Alaska must abide by the Circuit Court's ruling, which is what happened in this article. Gay marriage is legal in Alaska today.   The appeal already happened. The Supreme Court denied to take the case. This is it. Gay marriage is legal in Alaska today.   Yes, in this case. Here the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court chose not to take the case. All that had to happen was a federal judge rule that Alaska must abide by the Circuit Court's ruling, which is exactly what happened here. Today, gay people can marry in Alaska.   Are you saying the Tennessee Constitution would have an amendment banning abortion?  Because if it passed, it would make absolutely no difference. Each state answers to the Supreme Court and since they ruled abortion is legal, it is for every state unless a US Constitutional amendment bans it or the Court reverses itself.   OMG, that's what the movie's gonna be about, him finding his sister!   See this is where you call the cops and paramedics who should contact CPS.   Find an Arizona lawyer here: http://www.azbar.org/FindALawyer  Call up as many as you can and see if they'll take the case, but accept payment from any settlement/award you'll get from the landlord at a later date.

It's possible they need to repay you for the excess in electricity you've been paying for.   I'm just curious what GORPS means.   Napalmenator is. I directly asked him if he would subject his child to a situation in which he believed his child was being physically or sexually abused if the court ordered him to do so and he answered he would, by saying he would not violate a custody agreement.  I have made my point clear on what I would do and I stand by it: contact the police immediately and not let her son go over there in the meantime. I don't think any rationale parent in the world would subject their child to physical or sexual abuse just because of a custody agreement.  To pose the same question to you: Would you send your child into an environment you suspect they are being physically or sexually abused in, if there was a court that ordered you to do so?   What a cop out line.  So explain how a parent who purposefully places their child in a situation they suspect subjects that child to physical or sexual abuse is anything other than a bad parent.   That would make you an extremely bad parent. Some things are more important than the law.   As you should note then, I recommended she contact police immediately. In spite of all the things you mentioned, you did not answer the question.   I disagree. Would you send your child into an environment you suspect they are being physically or sexually abused in if there was a court that ordered you to do so?   I'm merely refuting one point of law advice with that of common sense.   I would agree with point 2 if it were not predicated on point 1.   I just somehow really doubt any judge would look at all the facts here and come to that conclusion.   A very good point!   It's not. It's rooted in life experience and common sense.   I respectfully disagree with point 1. If she feels it is likely her son is being sexually or physically abused she would be a bad person, let alone parent, to let her son go over there. If I were her, I would call the police immediately and report everything. They will likely have the son seen by a court ordered psychiatrist who will evaluate him and recommend any further action.   Sorry I can't answer more but I can confirm that it is illegal for them to enter without notice or an emergency. I don't know what the damages are or about moving the camera.   It actually is physically addictive to some people. Usually only serious users.

I mean, if it's so obvious can you answer at least one or two of the questions?   Yea, like an hour ago. What am I missing?   I was thing the same thing about the tapes but it's possible she deleted everything before the last couple days and just insinuate he had the tapes overwrite every few days.   Someone help me here cause I know there's a few hidden things near the end.  How did Amy get pregnant? The sperm bank? When did she get pregnant?  What were Affleck and the sister planning at the end? Not to kill her, but... Also, what was with the several instances of twincest insinuations? Was there actually something going on? Was that why the sister got THAT mad when she found him banging slutbag when she already hated the wife and was jealousy the reason she hated the wife? Did they ever mention why she hated the wife?  Why did he feel so trapped with her at the end? Why not just leave? Why not try to record her? She was obviously getting careless when she said she killed for him and he was fully clothed and could have been wearing a wire.  What was the significance of the dementia dad? There must have been something. Why did Affleck only visit him once in a year he had been in the old people home?  What was the significance of the parents borrowing from her trust?  And last, how in the world did Amy find out that Affleck was banging this girl in the fathers house, in the woodshed, etc.?   Awaiting the eventual comment you're all thinking.   Assuming their striking is equal, I assume the wrestler would go for a TD if he has no advantage on the feet, then the BJJ guy would sub him since the wrestler doesn't know any BJJ, no?   What kind of symptoms do you still have?   I guess the period was the FG in that case?   A touchdown for every letter in RELAX.   I mean four losses is the end for anybody though. How many people with four losses have they kept around for another fight? I can only think of Hardy, and that was b/c one was to GSP.   Dude's got the gift. If MM goes out and they need someone to fill his place ala PSH style, they know who to call.   Am I the only one who enjoys being called on and attempts to participate each class? Granted I'm a 1L so I have no idea if this is gonna fade over the next few years.   NO. Absolutely do not talk to the police anymore without a lawyer under any circumstances.   Ok, so purely from a financial standpoint, this is stupid. HOWEVER, it depends how much this is worth it to you intrinsically.  From a loans standpoint, you're decent. Your $30K in loans at 0% interest is about equal to $21.5K in loans if they were at 7% interest, a pretty standard rate, for the standard 10 year repayment period.  So if I were you, I'd figure out if your total loans after studying abroad, equal to $30K at 0% and $20K at 7%, are going to be in excess of 10% of your salary after graduating and getting a job. I calculated that you'd need to pay about $5700 a year in loans to pay them all back in 10 years, meaning if your expected salary upon graduation is above $57,000 then go for it, and if not don't.   Personally for me that would be close of a margin. Can you tough it out for another year? In general, with more job experience you will have an increase in salary and that might allow you to float by longer if the house goes vacant. Additionally, you can save an extra "vacancy fund" in this year's time.   Oh I completely agree. I just think everyone should be given some sort of due process, even if it is just a hearing. But that is just my opinion and has no effect on what is "right." Like you said, the NFL is a private corporation and can suspend anyone after an arrest.   I think the issue is very clear that AP did commit the abuse. He hasn't denied that in the least. You don't always have to let the justice system play out, if guilt or innocence is excessively obvious.  HOWEVER, I believe that everyone should be given due process. What this does not mean is that their due process must come from the govt directly. But a small hearing with impartial judges deciding AP's fate after hearing all of the evidence available? Yea, I think they'd be fine suspending him after that. Do you agree?   Shamrock had almost zero BJJ experience. My argument was both for someone smaller and with a moderate amount of experience.   I'm making a pretty mild claim here: that someone moderately athletic but with a massive size advantage could take down and punch someone with extremely limited grappling experience.   Oh I completely agree.   I'm talking hypothetically based on the dudes comment that untrained guys cannot beat champions.   Even an athletic 250 pound dude taking on a 125 pound champ?  There's a limit somewhere.   Dude 50's got at least 60 pounds on the dude and could probably get him down to the ground if he just charged at him. I think it'd be at least a semi-interesting fight.   So whichever of the three concurring opinions has the most senior justice is the majority?  Also your link does not work.   I'm not an expert but...  Although my below posted link does not explicitly say the residents did not receive money, it is heavily implied by the fact they were viewed as second class citizens who were wild.  http://history.howstuffworks.com/revolutionary-war/louisiana-purchase3.htm   I agree but you can't say you may want to pursue an action at a later time and at the same time turn down a police report on the matter.   Say there are 3 concurring opinions (with 2 justices each) and a dissent with 3 justices (and say the CJ is in the dissent). Which opinion become majority?   More than that, when he said that the driver offered to call the cops instead so they could make a ruling on the case and he goes "oh no, I don't talk to cops." Really dude? You don't get it both ways.   Ok your options seem to be: 1) drop out 2) go talk to your school's financial aid office and see if by some miracle they have a program that will help you 3) apply for private loans immediately and get your parents on as co-signers if you do not qualify by yourself   I don't think they are requiring that the jurors have no prior knowledge of the case or they would have moved jurisdictions already.   I'm by no means an expert in the subject but I'll try to answer. The number of deaths from 9/11 is massively higher than the vast majority of terrorist attacks. Just to give you a statistic, in 50% of all suicide terrorist attacks, the only person that dies is the suicide terrorist themselves. Not to mention that 9/11 was the mark of an absolute explosion in suicide terrorism across the world. If you were to look at a chart, you would see the number of deaths resulting from suicide attacks drastically increases in the following years. It's also just a marker that life as we knew it was over. Between the PATRIOT Act, increased airport security, and the creation of a new Dept of Homeland Security it just changed so much about our way of life.   I'm honestly not sure. Like I said, I didn't actually CAP, just went to UTSA, looked at what CAP required (I think a 3.2), figured as long as I had at least a 3.5 they wouldn't say no, then filled out another app for UT and got in.  Maybe someone else will know the answer. You can always post again on here, people are pretty nice about the whole thing since we were all in your shoes pretty recently.   Hey just to give you some hope, my SAT score was horrendous, like way below yours. I hadn't studied or taken school seriously at all in highschool, and I wasn't in the top half of my class, rank wise.  I didn't do CAP, but I did a year at UTSA and it was the easiest thing in the world. I made A's in all 10 classes including Fall and Spring then transferred to UT and actually just graduated (finished all my classes in July). And UT isn't exceptionally hard either. I can count on one hand the number of classes I didn't make A's in while there. Granted, I studied my ass off my entire time at both UTSA and UT. I say all this not to brag, and really hope it doesn't come off that way, but just to let you know it's not that bad to spend a year somewhere else and it's totally do-able. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions.   Wait are you the guy in question? I'm on mobile and the 'in context' doesn't go back far enough for me to see.   Ok, I'm not disputing that its taboo to have sex with someone besides a spouse.  The ONLY point I'm making is that a cheater (someone who has sex with someone besides their SO without their SO's permission) is a terrible person, in my opinion.   You don't have to. Nobody has to.  I'm judgmental because cheating destroys lives and is a horrible thing.  Are you judgmental on anything? Murder? Rape? Kidnapping? We all judge things we deem morally deplorable. Nobody is required to live up to another person's morality, but must suffer the consequences of their actions. One of the consequences of cheating is I will find you a terrible person.   It's highly implied that the spouses are not ok with it in the original posts. I think either one of them would have said so if their SO's were aware.  But if their spouses are ok with it, then nothing is wrong and they aren't scumbags. I stated this a couple replies up.   Those are not reasons why cheating on a spouse is legitimate. MANY things are more important than sex in a relationship. But a child growing up in a house where a parent has so little respect for their spouse that they cheat on them does not set a good example for that child. Do you disagree?   I see that and agree. But there's plenty in here that is just consensual stuff going on, whereas this is non-consensual to their SO's. The cheaters should not be encouraged, in my opinion.   There are no legitimate reasons, therefore it makes the person a shitty person no matter what.  What you're saying is tantamount to someone admitting to killing their 5 year old child in a gleeful manner (which is the attitude this guy and girl gave off bragging of their cheating) and you saying you'll "wait to hear all the facts." A reasonable person can conclude that its not necessary to hear much more, and if there was a justification, the people would have said it.   Give me a legitimate reason on why someone cannot/won't leave their SO.  What else would they do? LEAVE THEIR SO. That is the alternative to cheating.  I am commenting on what a reasonable person could take from the post, that they are having sex with other people, without the permission of their SO. It seems a reasonable person would take those to be the substantial facts here.     I'm pointing out that their SO's don't know the cheating is going on. If you're cheating on someone, it makes you a shitty person. Leave the person if you really can't stop yourself from sleeping with someone else.   This makes you and her both pretty terrible people, assuming both if your SO's don't know.   Appreciate the support.   I never said the case was clear. I merely said it was not alleged, it was a matter of fact. The United States court system allows for an allegation to become fact upon conviction by a jury of your peers. That is an indisputable fact.  Edit: Just for fun, I'll comment along with you. You didn't give context and I haven't read the interview, but I'll assume the quotations are from Tyson.  Point 1: Tyson says he did less time b/c the judge did not believe he committed the crime. This is where I introduce the concept that correlation=/=causation. Just b/c he was given less time than others does not equate to the fact that the judge believed he was not guilty. There were several other mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that some of the evidence was not as strong, or the fact that he had no prior felonies. Further, a Court of Appeals certified that the evidence was strong enough that he should not even be granted a retrial. If he really thought people believed he did not commit the crime, then why didn't the Court of Appeals vacate his conviction or at the very least give him a new trial?  Point 2: Tyson says that just b/c she falsely claimed she was raped once, she should never have put herself in that position. What position? The position of having entering a hotel room? The position of hanging out with someone you don't know alone? Any of these contentions are absolutely ridiculous and have no bearing on proof of his guilt or innocence and the very fact that he made these contentions is insulting to all rape victims.   No but it's ruling is taken as fact.   Hey just a note, but it's not an "alleged" rape. He was convicted by a jury of his peers. He is for all intents and purposes guilty of rape and therefore it is treated as a matter of fact, not allegation.  Edit: LOL to all the haters. Feel free to downvote me. It's a matter of fact that upon conviction by a jury of your peers, an allegation is seen by fact for all intents and purposes. If you wanna hate on me for stating a something that is unilaterally true, at least have the decency to comment with a reason.  Edit 2: Goddamn you guys are just a bunch of whiners about this. I point out one factually relevant point about a post and you guys fly off your hinges. I always assumed my fellow /r/MMA-ers were a cool bunch of folks, but I have been proven otherwise. Have fun debating others about how facts don't apply to you bunch.   Contact the police in the meantime and have record of ownership (vet records, if your dog is chipped, adoption records, etc.). You will get your dog back immediately.  In the meantime the guy can sue you for $1000, which I would guess you MIGHT be obligated to pay, but not anything above that as any judge will find that $1000 is a reasonable reward.  If you don't know where the guy lives who has your dog, I would set up a fake meeting, telling him you have the $1500 then call the police once he shows up unwilling to give you the dog, and follow him if he leaves the meeting spot while maintaining contact with police.   As the other guy said, implied consent.  Here's a hypo: Man in car crash. Man loses consciousness and suffers severe lacerations. Emergency medical workers show up and treat the lacerations. Man regains consciousness. Man refuses ambulance ride after stabilized and walks home.  Do you think the man would not be required by a court to pay for his treatment?  Source: law student   Anderson Silva was probably the GOAT at one point between Fedor and Jon Jones.   Should've been a no contest like the Maynard fight where he knocked himself out in the slam.   No judge will count the cost of wood flooring under a carpet and padding as ruined by cat pee. If I were you I would tell her she has no evidence of ruining the wood and it is unreasonable for her to count it in your damages.  In most cases, you are required to give 30 days notice, even after a lease runs out. You will automatically revert to a month to month tenant with no lease and this is one of the requirements. You're saying you gave her 26 days notice? I am not a lawyer, and you should consult one for an answer, but I would think you would only have to reimburse those four days so for example if your rent was $500 then you would have to reimburse 500*(4/30)= $66.67  I would consult a lawyer for advice on these issues if I were you but ultimately take her to small claims court without a lawyer. In many states you can sue for 2-3 times the money that is rightfully yours.   So the carpet wasn't new when you moved in. She is entitled to charge you proportionally for the life expectancy of the carpet for the damage you did. Say life expectancy was 10 years and carpet cost $500. If it was 5 years old, and the cat pee ruined it then you owe $250.  If I were you, I would let her know that you know you are aware that you only owe for the life expectancy you prematurely ended. You ask her to produce a receipt or official record of when the carpet was purchased, what the cost was, and what the life expectancy was. If she refuses and continues to pursue further you take her to small claims court.    I'm not a lawyer, but I am in law school and studied several cases taught by law school professors in undergrad. And something I've learned is that if a reasonable person can imply something then it has at least some consideration. Here, the landlord could reasonably conclude that she had leased the property for a minimum of one year. That is why I came to my conclusion.    she basically said that even if she filled the apartment, she would continue to charge us until December due to inconvenience.  This is generally illegal. I do not specifically know the laws of your state, but in general you can only sue for ACTUAL damages. If she is not losing any money, she will not win any damages.    If she has emails of you implying you know your lease is for a year, then you should be prepared to lose in court. I am not giving you binding legal advice, but absent of any other major factors, this seems like a 50/50 case.  Have you looked into subleasing? You should be able to find someone to sublease your place for a couple months and usually around the same rent you are paying as that is most likely near the market rate. Also, be sure to check your lease on the legalities of it. But even if it is against your lease, your landlord may be willing to make an exception (GET IT IN WRITING IF SHE DOES) because she most likely wants to avoid a big legal headache as much as you do.   Not the same thing.   I guess we just look at the concept differently, which is completely ok. To me, a situation is either just or not whereas it seems you are viewing it on an individual level.  To expand on my main post, I feel that if we condone this behavior in any way, i.e. calling it just for one party, then that is going to encourage others in similar situations, resulting in a VERY slippery slope.   The fact of the matter is, in this case yes the guilt was kind of clear, and many will argue the punishment fit. But if you allow vigilante justice, you screw the whole system.  What about a guy that's "pretty sure" someone else killed his dog? Can he go destroy that guy's car? What about a case like this, but the driver were not drunk, and merely hit a pothole causing the car to swerve and kill these two kids? Would he deserve to die in that case?  At the end of the day, we as a society have agreed that anyone, guilty or innocent, deserve their day in court before they are punished. The driver in this case was deprived of that. For me, that is injustice.   Fair point. But that doesn't matter. Walmart will pay out the ass before this goes to trial and if they don't a jury will still find that the Loss Prevention guys clearly went above what was reasonable in hitting him in the face once he was on the ground.   Classic case of jury nullification. I read another article with more/different details.  Basically the guy was pushing his car (ran out of gas) with his two sons in what was basically the middle of nowhere, but still near this guy's house. Drunk driver plows into sons and kills them. Then drunk driver is shot to death almost immediately. They are 100 yards from guy who just had his son's died house. The ammunition the drunk driver was shot with matches ammunition that was found in guy's house.  Defense's argument was someone else randomly came and shot the drunk driver. Small town jury felt sorry for the man and acquitted in face of obvious beyond a reasonable doubt evidence. Due to double jeopardy the man will never be found guilty. Justice? You decide.    Unfortunately that dude is gonna have a LARGE payout. Walmart employee caught on video battering an unarmed man already on the ground? That's a 6 figure payout.   Why would you ask that? Are you a bloodist?   Dominick Cruz will be champ within the next year.   Thank you! This is what I was looking for! How will I know if I should buy the supplement?

 Bernie a few days ago on NPR (these quotes are taken from an article written on The Hill):   Talking about cultural divides in this country, you know, it is important for people in urban America to understand that families go out together and kids go out with their parents and they hunt and they enjoy the outdoors and that is a lifestyle that should not be condemned...if anyone thinks that gun control itself is going to solve the problem of violence in this country, you're terribly mistaken...so, obviously, we need strong, sensible gun control and I will support it. But some people think it's going to solve all of our problems. It is not."

Teves, 24, and Rebecca Wingo, 31, I'm shocked we haven't seen Open Carry overturned. Here's hoping this little nitwit just wrote that history with his actions; prediction: Open Carry will be overturned in Colorado.             MUSKEGON TOWNSHIP, MI --  The 27-year-old Muskegon Township man who was nearly naked and reportedly high on acid when he allegedly discharged his gun outside a pizza business on Saturday, with three kids in tow, has been arraigned on four misdemeanor charges.  ...   Engle had three children with him  ages 6, 4 and 3  when police said he stood outside the pizza business wearing only a towel and pounding on the glass windows of the business until one shattered. His .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun went off in the process, damaging the casing on the business door.      In Florida all jobs require you have an assault record And weapon.    Someone find it!!   I remember the anti-poverty campaigns of the 70's and early 80's. And it seems our poverty problem is much worse this time around - it's going to take a massive shift in the perception of public opinion. But I'd argue the true public opinion is to help thy neighbor. It's just when people are manipulated into thinking that fixing the poverty problem is somehow giving people a free lotto ticket. It's just a fucked marketing campaign of the Paul Ryan austerity types, sitting pretty and calling out hate speech against the worst-off among us.    Go outside so I can play Deep Purple and enjoy my Rollie.       I don't understand why the cops didn't hang around and patrol around the park if there are "bad guys" living nearby.

Gotta wonder if they took a history class in their short education experience. Did they go to school at all??          I get the sense that Joffrey is also considered inbred and flawed - is that not the case? It seems he's evil because he is genetically jacked.    More death, more death, more death. Wonder no more!            There should be a number similar to 911 that people could forward threatening texts to in the case that they know the aggressor is armed, or potentially armed. Something that could immediately send out an emergency alert like an Amber Alert to the area. (A Red Alert?)            As we saw in the Santa Barbara massacre, the parents tried to warn cops but they needed access to his home. Now, a law is being passed so that concern IS the justifiable cause. This may help.   I always hear that people don't want laws because law abiding citizens follow them and criminals don't. However, if we make selling a handgun without a background check illegal, all that does is put the good guys on notice to run background checks to ensure they aren't selling to a bad guy - which happens! Felons buy guns without background checks right now. One way or another we need that to end. If a GGWAG is selling in a private transaction and runs a background check and the buyer is a felon, the GGWAG has just potentially saved lives. I'll never get why someone who is supposedly a good guy gun owner would be against that.             Background checks aren't required on all gun sales. It's one of the big issues for gun safety advocates right now.    It's come out that the majority of mass shootings have been done by people who have illegally obtained guns. It seems to ME that anyone pro-gun with half a brain would agree that background checks and registration would make their own gun ownership safer and more protected, because it could stop many of these massacres that make so many people afraid of gun owners. What's your take on this? Why not require background checks and registration of every firearm?      This is one of the best pieces I've read on the gun plague, especially interesting about her own personal connection to firearms via her father.

How did it work out?    When I opened my eyes in that cabin and I felt the straps on my arms, legs, and across my torso holding me fast to the bed with a tarp beneath me, you better believe I was praying to God for help. It was a one-room building with paneled walls and a musty smell. I must have been where whoever brought me there was sure no one could hear anything that would happen. In the far upper corners there were ceiling mounted cameras aimed at me, red lights on. Along the far wall there was a table with a green plastic sheet over it. There were the tips of instrument handles visible on the table.   I struggled against the restraints, barely able to move my hands and feet. I screamed and struggled for what had to be at least a minute. I stopped only at the sight of the door opening.  A man stood in the doorway. He was six feet tall at least, fit as an ox, and a little bored. He wore a surgical apron. When I saw that, I began screaming again. He didnt respond as I alternately begged him for mercy and threatened him. He went over to a laptop the cameras were connected to and made some adjustments. He walked over to my side then.  Shut up! he yelled at me, his tone more annoyed and exhausted than angry. I complied.  Okay, checking, checking, audio test, he said. He went back to the laptop and played back what hed just recorded. After a nod of satisfaction, he picked up a piece of paper from next to the laptop. He looked from the paper to me as he read.  Hello from the husband you fucked along with her, he read robotically.   E-Ellen? I said weakly. Is this about Ellen? But she said that- He looked up at me and I stopped speaking again. He shook his head slightly and continued.  Did the bitch even tell you about me? Are you still hoping youre gonna escape? You still thinking the man who strapped you down is just gonna scare you? Ive seen too much of you with her to ever let you live. Youre gonna die really slowly. Were are gonna watch everything. Youre not the first other man to stick his cock in her but you will be the last. He sighed, crumpled up the paper, and tossed it on one of the tables as he made for the instruments hed laid out.  Without so much as another glance at my face, he came over to me with a scalpel. He spread my largest and second toe on my left foot, and began to cut the webbing. I had never experienced anything like that before and showed no strength in the face of it. I shrieked like an animal.  Make him stop, I thought. Please God, make him stop.  He seemed finished with my left foot and made for my right hand. I tried to clench it into a fist but that did nothing to slow him down. He went for the flesh between my ring and pinkie finger and began to cut. I was dimly aware of mucus touching my lips as I tried to scream.  He stopped after an eternity and stepped back, breathing heavily. I faintly heard the sound of him peeling off his gloves. I begged him to not to continue while he got on two replacement pairs of gloves without acknowledging what I had to say.  He came back to me with a surgical retractor in one hand and the scalpel in the other. He grabbed a section of my lip below the nose in the retractor and pulled it. He pressed the blade of the scalpel against my lip and began to cut.  I couldnt take any more. I hoped hed forgive me.  Medulla! I screeched as loud as I could. Immediately he stopped. He went back to the table hed kept his instruments on.  Okay, hang in there, Joe. Itll be over soon! Ive got the tetracaine ready! Almost immediately after he took away the pain, he got out the kit to give me the stitches. While he was doing that, I actually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion.   * * *  So now Im at our home. Hes downstairs doing the laundry, insisting on doing all the chores now. I dont think Ill be able to walk properly for a few days, but we have our story for how I got injured like this for our coworkers. He has all the written and video evidence he would need to show that it was consensual and that he respected the safety word in case I decide to go to the police or anything. Not that I would do that.   He told me he was more than satisfied with what wed done. He really liked the little bit Id come up with about Ellen. Thats left me pretty satisfied too. Anything for him. I love him so much. I should have let him go farther. Next time Im sure I will. It wont be for some time of course.   He's got a partner that will let him live out his fantasies. He didn't dare tell any of his old lovers about this fetish. He didn't hesitate to stop when I said the word. He loves me.  I know this goes far beyond a normal S M relationship, but it doesnt matter. He's never going to do this to anyone else. Not to someone who doesn't know the safety word. He's definitely never going to just keep going until I can't say the word. He loves me.  I haven't just given him a taste. I haven't made him want to go farther so much he won't be able to stop next time. He loves me. Hes not going to cut anyone else. Please God, hes not.  Please, oh please God.

Accomplishments and skills do not make people [inherently happier](http://www.nj.com/parenting/index.ssf/2014/08/post_42.html) so your pie in the sky hopes that all you have to do is get a job with specialized skills or a promotion so you can fuck someone and its all better. That metaphor of how being a "nice person" is useless is obviously Pargin justifying his own and other people's dickishness based on professional desirability. Creating stuff often doesn't "increase your value as a human being" most of the time because many of us don't have the means to make our products do anything or share them with significant numbers of people or have a significant impact on those we can reach.      I think people are overly impressed by this article because he isn't offering easy answers, but he's still offering simple answers that aren't true. Read his article about stuff you don't learn in school and he blatantly admits in there that he lucked into the position at Cracked that compels anyone to pay attention to him.    i.e. "Model wants to pander to nerds, asks which member of a local camera crew if they know someone with a room like this, goes and does shoot there."       I often deflect mockery by saying "In 70 years, what I'm doing will be retro!"    I've had this idea for the past few days and I wanted to know what you guys around here would think of it. I don't know if it would benefit from actually being shot like a silent film.   The premise would be that some modern equivalent to Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character would be in a zombie outbreak, more or less going about his usual business by basically dodging zombie hordes through a series of improvised setups and gymnastic abilities. One day he runs into a female survivalist who is the last of her group. He becomes smitten with her and imagines her as a delicate flower despite her in reality being tough and completely uninterested in him except for he knows how to get where she wants to go safely. As they make their way there, she insists on killing zombies (sometimes gratuitously) but he is completely abhorrent of the idea, arguing that some day they might be cured.   That's all I've got in mind for the story right now. I just wanted to see the reaction around here to it.    I absolutely love going for walks but obviously when I do that I'm not getting any writing done. What would you recommend for something I could take with me for it?       Does this count as anamorphosis?    That drawing of Applejack is so cute that it makes me uncomfortable to look at it.    It was either that or "Annoying Wanker Victim #3."    I prefer the soda can one cause it's prettier.       Explaining it doesn't justify it.    It's what you get for putting up that "No Colts Allowed" sign.    I like how Garfield sort of went from looking like he did in the early 80s to closer to how he looks now. Clearly he moved up a Gen in between those panels.

I didn't want to mess around with it but from what I thought you just undo the bolts on either side, but then you have the chain and all that in the way so I wanted to make sure I don't charge into it and cause expensive damage. So what's the procedure to avoid doing so?        I have no idea whether this will help, but apparently Jan endorsed it on one of his videos. In light of his recent claims that the C   D might have come from a legal firm that represented Hasbro instead of Big H itself, apparently there's a bit of hope this will be sorted out in a positive way for Jan. Maybe not.    Ugh. I think this one managed to be even worse than The Spirit.    Hell no. Even worse, I actually had one of those ridiculously romanticized meetings with someone I had a crush on in a fantasy forest which was supposed to lead to sex that people use to caricature kissless virgins as having with in media like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kSOD6EsEUs   Is it your favorite video?

 Looks like you forgot to list Steam in the pic.         Vendor: Can I help you sir? Me: Yes, I'll take a Big Dick and a Fuck Cunt please. Vendor: That'll be $2 please. Me (thinking in mind): Why haven't I come here before for this stuff?      My brothers and I still play Wrestlemania 2000 over No Mercy.  For some reason that game just stuck with us better.   Looks, good, but I think it would be better if she would have dressed up as Samus!   I was looking for Leo walking in the background.   The Cubs actually win the world series in BTTF.  That's who you need to bet on in 2015.         So um, how did it taste when it was ready?      The best I've ever found that was thrown out was a PS3 controller.  It needed taken apart and cleaned up, but it works just fine!   Good lord it's the loch ness monster!!   I was thinking the same thing in regards to people saying it's a relatives first meme.            Haha, good one!      I always hope for this to happen when I get a friend request out of nowhere.  Never does though.      So apparently black clothes was the choice for the picture.  Looks like Will didn't get the memo.   And that means a lot more coming at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning.   At least the comic doesn't tell them about the arrow to the knee.  That could ruin the entire game for someone!      She could probably get the abortion at Costco.            Doc, I think we've hit 88 mph!   But since this is random just for the sole fact that Ellemeno pointed out that is should be random, does that make this random pic relevant?   That's a start!      I agree on overhand on being the correct way too.  But it can vary per person.      And here all these years I thought you were supposed to bend backwards when playing limbo.   Holy crap, I had to do a double take with the picture.  My parents have a setup almost identicle to this one.  Except, they actually did put up a christmas tree in a different spot.            That selection looks about right.   Why would you stop in the first place if it's only going to make you mad that you have to wait on a person crossing the road?  And it was your own choice.   When I was in college cars would stop on a regular basis and they were the LAST car going by.  Doing this only made things take longer for me walking and the driver.   I lost mine about a year ago.  GGG kept the cash for himself as a reward, but was kind enough to return everything else at least.   Oh, I get it. [Filmsy](http://www.filmsy.com/)   And then goes to the bar!   You could hang out a lot in freshly stacked haystacks with people who need hay...   Although I have never seen or read any of the Harry Potter's, I still find this pretty amusing.   SIMPSONS DID IT....er wait, different episode.   I see what a person is doing when paying a homeless person like this.  But lets say someone paid a homeless person $5 just to do this.  To justify that money you would have to be gone for more than $5 worth of parking in that spot.   A ticket pulls in more money than an extra $.50 in a parking meter is probably the main reason.   Since a little over 10 years have passed already , you actually only have just a hair over 12 years left to wait.  That time will fly by!   Ah, I guess I missed the really small one above the plate before.  I'd say it's small anough it shouldn't count anyhow.   Watching 6 movies with only 5 screens.  Wizardry?   They're going to get neck cramps looking up like that the whole time.   So why is he questioning his answer yes?   Makes me think of Wrestlemania 2000 on the N64. The game came out in 1999, but it lets you input dates for when you win a belt back to something like 1955.     6 months?  So did Easter get moved back, or Christmas moved up?   I believe the blu ray release that is coming out next year for the 30th anniversary is putting the guns back in again.   So no one washes their face with soap?  Because when you do that you're also cleaning your eyebrows in the process.  Unless I've been fooling myself this whole time.   So where do I place my order?   My plan was to buy the book from the store and use it until the last day for full refunds.  Then order the book through the library and use that copy for free the rest of the quarter.   Problem 4 on page 87 has been changed.  Because of that, wecan't use the previous version anymore.   I kind of feel like I have a connection with each of you just because I work at Ohio State!!

 In my country (Poland) where mech keyboards are not popular, Razer is quite easy available. I bought it as it was for ~100$ when buying any other would be around 200$ (120$ + 40-50$ (shipping) + duty charge (20-30$) = around 200$).  So Razer was quite good choice considering situation. I own black widow tournament edition (love tkl), and now I'm considering buying Shine 3 TKL with browns.   http://imgur.com/BQWPIs2      Story:http://www.wykop.pl/wpis/6622222/kupie-pizze-2-za-10-000-doge-mieszkam-w-olawie-mow/  It's polish portal similar to reddit, a guy with nick "noisy" asked somebody to ordered 2 pizzas to [Oawa](https://goo.gl/maps/6JWSz) offering 10k in Dogecoins. A guy "SharpNieSharp" took a challenge and ordered them, a special ask was to write "Dogecoin" on a box. Pierogi (dumplings) was an extra thing - personal choice of SharpNieSharp.    Edit: If you need any translation - just ask (exam tomorrow so I will do anything apart from studying).    Is that setup sponsored by Razer and Pepsi?   I thought it would be cheaper to sell whole keyboard and buy new switches - then I looked at prices per switch...   Why do you want to save pieces (switches as I suppose), is it better to clean it (without desoldering) and sell? And use that money to spend on new one?   "Where do you come from fella?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh64nPT7JWk      Do you also wrap it up and send it to yourself - few days of that feeling "Is today going to be THAT day?"   Let's start with ***"640K ought to be enough for anybody."*** - Bill Gates, not true at all - sorry folks.          If you tried and didn't fall in love, lucky you - that shit is expensive, but in my opinion worth it.   Try mechanical - never go back...   Sorry for not changing system language or trying to make it English-readable. Top is "Birthday are celebrating by:" and buttons are "Send birthday wishes".  As a extra info - Polish is one of hardest to learn language - If you have any questions I will glad to answer them.  //EDIT: Spelling         More Deadpool gifs from Comic-Con:  http://imgur.com/a/CSoAv  http://imgur.com/a/lnwkn?gallery   Painful is to see it reposted X time...

This is just a hoodie that I get as a mobile dev, so it is just a promo, if you expected a viral Nokia clothes commercial - sorry to disappoint you, not that time.      There is nothing in the background.   She laughed, otherwise it wouldn't be here. So don't think of me as that bad person.   I got it as a mobile dev and she really liked it, plus I'm into Android, so I wasn't regretting it.   I recommend to watch that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyTEKhkB8OM#t=86  one of his commercials.      I was as well afraid but I gave it a shot... and it totally worked - she was just angry that I didn't crop out the background, but not such things I have seen on reddit.      http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/0_0.gif  That is awesome collection of ergonomic keyboards!   What are your personal feeling on cherry mx clear? Asking from curiosity as I'm more then happy with blue.   Can you write something more about how they work (comparing to 'normal' keys)?  Is there any 3d model of a universal keyboard key or did you do it by yourself? Awesome idea!        	34

Voa hrvatske Puke stranke dr Josip Smodlaka ovim reima ih je pozdravio:   Brao srcu naem najmilija, neumrli vitezovi srpski! Dobro nam doli nepobjedivi sokolovi nai!

Zasto dalje zivimo u bedi?    Sie haben mich nicht verstanden, Kiew sollte bombardiert werden wie damals Belgrad und der Rest des Landes.  Die Krim anerkannt und der Osten eine weitgehende Autonomie bekommen.    Sta je telepromter?   Bei der ISIS geht es ganz klar um geisteskranke mit denen nicht zu verhandeln ist. Und hier ist es absolut schwer zu sagen wie man vorgehen soll. Das man die Kurden militrisch unterstzt um gegen die ISIS vorzugehen ist schon mal ein guter Schritt. Viel mehr strt mich die Doppelmoral der westlichen Politiker. In der Ukraine ist das Leid, die Anzahl der Toten um ein vielfaches hher als es im Kosovo jemals war. Dort herrscht tatschlich eine humanitre Katastrophe, ber eine halbe Millionen Menchen mussten fliehen. Warum wird hier nicht Kiew und die gesamte Ukraine bombardiert so wie man es mit Serbien getan hat? Wieso wird hier die Krim nicht anerkannt so wie es im Kosovo der Fall war (im Falle der Krim fand zudem noch ein Referendum statt, was im Kosovo nicht der Fall war)? Das ist absolute Heuchelei, weil man die Russen von Grund auf als bse ansieht, so wie damals die Serben. Die Faschisten auf der anderen Seite ignoriert man einfach. Auch im Kosovo sitzt ein Mafiaboss und Kriegsverbrecher an der Staatsspitze und das wird toleriert.

  e made up some bigoted, xenophobic bullshit to feed the mouth breathers. You seem to have bought into the bullshit.   I was just asking for some insight since I didn't feel like studying up on all the figures and didn't see any comments discussing the facts. All I get is your bitchy reply.

 I'm so sorry to hear this, how old were you?    Theres an instrumental by Danny Elfman called 'Finale' used in the film Kingdom, gets me everytime.

 Well I don't disagree. But will South Africa have a food shortage without China?   Nah - I'm a liberal Dem. Just passing the info along. (Plus I'll be out of town.)   I agree (work in the legal field). Perjury is for some reason not taken that seriously.  As testimony is often the only available evidence, perjury _should_ be a primary concern of the judicial system.    If it's economic pressure, you can't really blame the SA government.  Every decision has various pressures. How far are you willing to take this?        My personal experience definitely confirms this. I wore it from 7:45 am until 8:45 pm yesterday and it had ~30% left.  I responded to texts, used navigation, controlled music in the car, received various notifications throughout the day, and checked the time several times. I would consider my usage moderate to heavy.  This is a dramatic increase from the battery before the update. I was going to return the damn thing and now I don't think I will.   Get a flu shot regardless of your age. Protect your tiny and elderly loved ones!   Because they're not humans with our varied motivations.   Did my reply disappear? Weird. But, yeah, no worries. I'm sure everyone gets the same initial letter - I just didn't realize (until /u/tonytaylor85 pointed it out in this thread) that everyone gets the same letter every time.   Why? Seriously? It's literally a Representative's job to be responsive to constituents. This sort of thing could _really_ piss someone off, particularly the type of person who takes the time to contact their Representative twice about the same issue.  And you don't need unique letters for each person, just succeeding letters: 1st inquiry, 2nd inquiry, etc. And probably after the second, a valid response would be "My position hasn't changed since the last letter." Hell, even that would be better than sending the same letter the second time.  It'd be as simple as a spreadsheet. Even small businesses handle more workflow than that...   It's surprising to me that it wasn't updated, yes. I would think they have a simple procedure to avoid exactly this situation.   Ignore the haters - congratulations! You look great!   Internationally respected human rights lawyer is a damn good catch.   Downtown is safe during Westobou, particularly the old Academy. It's kinda odd to claim otherwise, really.  I know I'll be there.   *Katy Perry   Nested cubes rotating in succession.   No, just go back to /u/TheBrokenWorld's suggestion. "Doing nothing" and your awful idea aren't the only two options.   Or between movies.   Realized how great this is last weekend on a road trip.  When in unfamiliar towns on back roads, there are often a lot of turns. I was behind an impromptu caravan and they all went right when I thought I was supposed to go left. I had about 3 seconds to decide and the watch allowed me to verify to go left.  Not much but it was pretty damn nice.   Awareness does have value.   It was yesterday. Allen's camp said a video of it would be on their website by Monday.   I'm not quite there yet but did just walk out of Costco with more cash than I arrived with.   Rick Allen said his supporters wouldn't feel comfortable in a mosque.  He apparently thinks that is a valid reason.   But where? The whole nation has this problem.   Most of downtown doesn't fit the "frat boy" stereotype. It's actually the exception. Go to The Loft for starters.  And I agree that online dating isn't bad. Why expect to randomly run into a compatible partner? That's inefficient as fuck.   Well... it's printed on each panel so yeah.   I think this exists.   But it's vital that we pay attention and participate.   Wait what's her new addiction?   Yup. As a Georgian, it was great knowing my vote mattered.   Good start though. Give them that. For what it's worth, I'm a gay atheist (not in a Muslim majority country).   Oh! _This'll_ show the conservative commentators of my local paper!   I hate ultra orthodox everything.   You know what? Fuck you, man. The same could be done for Christianity. Islam =/= terrorism.  Edit: And based on your short comment history, this is your "thing". People like you make the world a worse place.   Man it was so exciting to watch. Every Tuesday was "Super Tuesday" and you never knew who would be ahead week to week.  It was one of the best elections I've ever witnessed.      [Here's](http://www.wfxg.com/story/26621875/who-called-off-congressional-debate-at-mosque) an article from WFXG about the kerfuffle.         After reading the article that is the only source for the Wikipedia entry, and perusing the restaurant's English site, I don't see any evidence that the same restaurant has been in business for 900 years (regardless of menu changes).   Does it though? I assume this is the source of your claim:  The medieval town is mainly famous for its stone bridge over the Danube, built between 1135 and 1146... To complete the construction of this bridge, Roman workers counted on Bavarian sausages to keep them going.  Sausages were sold there at that time but there isn't any indication that sausages have been sold there continuously since 1146. And even if they have been, it doesn't seem that it's been the same business:  The recent owners of the restaurant purchased it in 1806 from the Regensburg State authority.  It's an impressive building for sure and it may have been used only as a sausage restaurant when actually in use, but there is nothing in the article to really support the claim that there has been the same business there for 900 years (which is what the title claims).   The source for the Wikipedia article states the _building_ is 900 years old, not the business. Or am I reading that wrong?   As a Georgian... do this. Make this happen.   Yeah it's not that hard to do just as quickly. I'm American and chose to switch to 24-hour because it makes more sense and is useful for my work. That was about 5 years ago and 20:15 means the same thing in my head that 8:15 p.m. does. No math needed.   I disable push notifications for this reason. Fuckers are mean.   I unsuccessfully tried switching 360's with my boyfriend (he has the silver model, I have the black) and now I can't choose Facer from the watch face options. :-(  I've tried uninstalling/installing and resetting the watch but nothing seems to work.  Anyone had this happen? Any suggestions?   Yes.    It's possible to refer to people without gendering them.  Not using pronouns in English is very difficult if you have more than a brief interaction with the person. I sit on the board of a statewide LGBT organization and one of our interns is transgendered (F to M). He and I were scheduled to spend an entire day together and I ultimately had to ask our Executive Director for guidance. As for his name, it was completely neutral and provided no additional information.   In my experience, clothing isn't really helpful.   Thank you.       Within the constitutional framework.   Somewhat changes the impression someone may get from your emphasis of "am". It was essentially "I'm not American but I've got a justice boner."   It's a shame your parent comment has now been deleted. And he had gold.   I think I've seen on cable news that analysts think Syria's passive consent would probably be required. Anyone seen that?   I hope the involvement of Arab states changes the equation.  Edit: I responded when the post was just the first sentence (not sure if that's relevant though).   The "OMG, it works!" posts are much more obviously bullshit though.   Deciding to change and then changing is one of the most impressive things anyone can do.   When I was in college and worked at my dad's office over the summers, he introduced me as "Studley Do-Right". Complete dead pan.  I would then have to exist as Studley Do-Right for that person...   Top 5 childhood games. Leveling up spells was so satisfying.   I lost 20 lbs on a vanilla milkshake diet after this surgery.   One I know for a fact is an army base.   Delicate question but this seems like a good place to ask it.  If someone's gender is not apparent to me, how do I clear that up in a non-offensive way so proper pronouns are used, etc.?   Just reading the word "trypophobia" makes my skin crawl. And I didn't know I had this phobia until reddit... (thanks, assholes).   [sniff] I love you, Mom.    I didn't mean to be judgmental and apologize. As our earning capacity increases, we can lose sight of how things used to be and how things are for other people.  I recommend Revenge and Orange is the New Black. Both are very binge-worthy.   I wondered that, too. Was it more of a "not a priority" thing or actually a "cannot afford" thing?   Straight as can be (he runs with his blonde, model-level girlfriend).   Runs around shirtless showing off his ridiculously toned physique. For a gay male couple, it's one part awe and one part seething hatred/jealousy.   I agree. This is a good suggestion.   Old book smell makes me need to poop. Am I alone in this?   Ah. It might be said somewhere English is spoken but it's probably rare.  Do you know what the two different verb tenses are? English seems to hide tenses that are more easily identified in other languages.   I don't think I've ever heard anyone use that contraction verbally in that context. I only encounter it when it's the certain tense, e.g., "they have been" - "they've been"; "they have gone" - "they've gone".   There's simply no option for it on the web version.     They've to  Do you say this?   Yup. We both saw it (we'd be doubting our sanity otherwise).   My boyfriend had a notification card in Keep this evening (the web-version ones that pop up to explain new features and you click "Got it" to close). It said that you can now share Keep notes and specifically mentioned editing among family and friends.  Unfortunately, we didn't think to do a screenshot and now we can't find _anything_ about it. Has anyone received that notification? Any word that this is actually in the pipeline?   I'm not trying to find racism. That's not what this is about. This is about the patently absurd notion that today's GOP - if teleported back in time - would be the ideological party of Lincoln.  And still no sources from you...   Voting patterns changed in part due to how the parties [reacted](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/07/14/331298996/why-did-black-voters-flee-the-republican-party-in-the-1960s) to the Civil Rights movement. Republicans have not changed their position on economic issues, but they have on social issues.  And how about providing sources rather than calling people names?   It's been circulating for years because it is a [historical fact](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=_dkdVKX9LZWsyATU7oKoAw url=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/reversal2.pdf cd=7 ved=0CC0QFjAG usg=AFQjCNHqFzh82rIE-WAnvqlfLHabrruCFg sig2=ohnzV_sPjxYxjvoSJyAZ5A) (PDF) despite people like you trying to change history.         This was fascinating. Thank you!   I'm still going to have to ask for a source. A family farm worth over $5 million may not be liquid rich, but it _is_ rich.  How many farms that qualify as small businesses and family farms are subject to the estate tax?   Inheriting wealth seems quite antithetical to hard work, personal responsibility, and meritocracy. It should at best be viewed as something we put up with for other reasons (e.g., property rights).  In fact, inheritance should be viewed as embarrassing. Those who inherit should have a much higher standard for personal success.      I'm dying here...                                                                                 Hi, /r/charleston! My boyfriend and I are planning a quick one night visit and are looking for a nice bed and breakfast. Suggestions?  We are looking for something secluded and preferably on the water (marsh, coastal seaway, ocean). Relaxation is our goal so being near nightlife is not important. Oh, and gay-friendly is a must.

 I'm literally the only person in my family who isn't an addict of some sort, which has made me an outcast. If I want to spend time with my family, even if it's breakfast, drinking is involved. They drink and drive like it's a normal part of life. I've seen my parents loose everything, a large fortune, homes, 6 vehicles and have to move back in with my grandparents...but they kept drinking. Once at lunch I suggested my sister shouldn't be drinking and driving with my new born (3 weeks old) baby nephew in the car, and she told me to mind my business and she can do whatever the fuck she wants, then got a drink TO GO.  Also, I grew up in a very physically, emotionally and sexually abusive household. I can never forget the things that happened.   TL; DR:  my refusal to condone my family's lifestyle choices, and my mistreatment as a child and a teen.   As scary as potentially losing your ring is, that's pretty awesome!!! Nothing says progress like an item that used to fit comfortably flying off. Congratulations on your progress!!!   That's a good idea, I'll start looking for races in my area! I really thought I could run the whole thing but now I see that's not such a great idea. I live in Southern Louisiana so I'm sure I can run the whole Mardin Grass 5k next year, maybe more!   That's great advice! I can't imagine how nervous I'll be on race day, but I will try to remember to take it all in and document my time. And ill try to remember to take my time and walk if i need to. I really thought if i tried hard enough i could run the whole thing but I admit my expectations were a little unrealistic.  I've always dreamed of being a runner, so hopefully this will be my first of many races! Thank you for the advice!    Thank you for the concern and advice! I'm actually surprised to hear the program takes 9 weeks. For some reason I thought if I trained hard enough I could run the whole thing. Now it seems like that will lead to an injury that would take me out of the race all together. Thanks again!    This past summer I joined a boxing gym and fell in love with working out. I was going 3-5 times a week, started to get in great shape and felt better about myself than I ever had. But then I got injured and took some time off  from the gym. Immediately following that, I went on vacation for a week and did zero work outs. I came home with a terrible sunburn and sun poisoning, which kept me out for another week. I ended up being out for over a month. That was July, and I'm still struggling to get back into a routine, I can hardly manage getting to the gym once a week now. I've also gained weight, and I'm not 10 lbs higher than my original start weight! This is what hurts most. I worked so hard and it's all disappeared. My plan at the beginning of the year was to look better for this holiday season than I did the last. I just got married in February and wore a size 16 dress. My new goal is to be at a size 10 for my 1 year anniversary.  The thing is, it's not even just about looks and dress sizes. Heart disease and diabetes runs on both sides of my family. I want to be healthy enough to live a long, fulfilling life with my husband and raise a family.   To help cure myself of this, I just singed up for my first 5k. It's not much but I've never ran that far before. Given that I paid the entry fee, I'm hoping it will light a fire under me and get me back into a solid training routine. I'm so nervous but at the same time I havnt stopped smiling since I registered.  God, I hope this doesn't blow up in my face. I'm so tired of failing and starting over again.    EDIT: structure and spelling.  EDIT 2: only a few people have commented so far but I just love how supportive this community is! Thank you all for the encouragement and advice!

Don't forget to hold hands and look both ways   Manners   I never even enrolled into college mostly because I wasn't willing to go so far into debt when I know I could learn through autodidacticism. I realized I was into graphic design, so I got a job as a personal assistant to a designer and ended up doing a lot of her work. With that experience I was able to get a great job as a graphic designer and have been there for 2 years. Meanwhile, I take online classes at my leisure. I get certificates of completion if I pass the class, which I can use on my resume.   I do sometimes regret not getting the college experience and wonder what I missed out on learning wise, but overall I have no regrets. Hard lessons learned are not easily forgotten.    For those interested: I use edx.com and courseusa.com to take classes. The ones I take are free by choice, but you can pay for the class to get a validated certificate and credits. I'm currently taking an epidemiology class from professors at Penn State,  and  soon i am starting an advanced astronomy class.    "Start changing your life now. The time will pass regardless."   Do you carry them all the time even when you're not on your period?  Yes, and not just for myself but for any fellow ladies who happen to be without one in a time of need. I would give me greatest enemy a tampon if she needed one. NEVER deny a woman a tampon.  	16

I have a mic my gt is jade sueta   Honestly i only watch bad lip readings. But now i love both! Im on mobile and have no idea how to link, but the bad lip readings for twilight and HG are hilarious!    FTB is awesome! THERES BEES!!!!   There is a minecraft360 subreddit. I just sent you a friend request   WE WANT THE UPDATE NOW-OW-OW GIVE US THE UPDATE (we want it!) GIVE US THE UPDATE (we want it!) WE WANT THE UP-DATE NOW-OW-OW   Server still up? Sorry i'm late, but if you wanna play, my GT is Jade Sueta   Still playing? Sorry im late :P   Server still up?   GT: Jade sueta. If you need any help i got ya and i have a mic but i dont use it often.   Yaaaay i love them!   Jade Sueta. Ill help you out and play with ya.   Now i am since i clicked the link.   Well, Allegiant would be rated R, because of the sex, but the other movies should be okay i think   And they don't mention Marcus at all in the trailer and that worries me.   The trailer makes it look like this is a love story. Sure, she is in love with Tobias, but it looks like they take out the action. That one sneak peak we get with the cheesy music is part of the love story. I hope it more action than love in the real movie   Haha shovelface i l o l ed   I thought the Hunger Games was about what Suzanne Collins thinks of reality tv.... That it is so stupid where people enjoy watching kids kill each other.   I hope its not the next hunger games. I loved the books, and Catching Fire was great, but SOOO many people havent read the book. I want Divergent to be popular to where only people who have read the book see the movie even though that eill never happen :P   Jade sueta is my name. I have a mic   Jade Sueta. Ill be on tomorrow   What does that do?       Relevant username    When Ezra was A.   Why?   Today? Will it be running today?   As you can read from the title it says that i want to go to the End. I currently have a mic but dont use it often. Anyone can join, you dont need a mic but i prefer one. I will be on for multiple hours today if anyone wants to beat the ender dragon with me. GT: Jade Sueta   Ill play. gT: Jade Sueta   Jade sueta is my gamertag   How will you speak too that H-o-o-o-o-rse. WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY   I really hope its not and that ezra just found the lair. But yes, it showed it right there, so i think its Ezra   Have you written anything yet?    I don't know if this is bad or good.....   Stapling water to a tree. Not everything is possible, people!!!   Jade Sueta is the name, im happy to play the game!   I might be on tomorrow. GT: Jade Sueta   I can see why people think that, since that is what they grow up with. A tv show I don't like that is old is Lizzy Mcguier or however you say her name. A tv show I don't like now is Dog with a blog. That is teaching kids that animals can speak because then they will try to talk to their dog like they are a human and annoy the shit out of their parents. But who doesn't like sponge bob????   Please be under the age of sixteen    Yeah what's your user?     	68

 I was a very laid back bride for the most part. I didn't care what anyone did as long as it wasn't drastic. My bridesmaid got a nose piercing before my wedding, but I didn't care because she offered to find a way to conceal it for the wedding (and she did). My sister cut her hair and dyed it a couple weeks before the wedding, and again I didn't care because it wasn't anything that would cause a distraction.  HOWEVER. The day of my wedding, my mother in law showed up with her hair dyed fire red. She flat out admitted she did it the night before the wedding. When we first saw each other that day, I was in my dress, waiting for pre wedding photos to start. She walked up to me and without even acknowledging how I looked in my dress she said "How do you like my hair?!" I was FURIOUS simply because she didn't ask if it was okay and because it was a HUGE change and therefore a huge distraction - EVERYONE was talking about it at the wedding. Whenever I look at the wedding photos that anger returns. She stands out the most in all the photos. Her hair looked absolutely awful with the wedding colors, including her dress color.   The point of this is: don't do anything that will distract from and/or upset the bride. It is, after all, her and her future husband's day. She only gets to be a bride once, so don't let anything upset her. So, if you're sister is not okay with it, wait until after the wedding to make changes to your hair.    I really wish I had some advice for you :( I am  terribly sorry. But thank you for the warning. My husband purchased my engagement ring from Kay's in 2011. I was considering taking it to them sometime soon since the white gold has faded, but I definitely will not do that now.   Also, I've read horror stories in which people take their rings to Kay's to be repaired and upon return they received fake rings or diamonds. If you do get your ring back, I would check to make sure everything is legit.   Again, I'm sorry this happened to you, and I hope you get some sort of compensation. I would love an update in the future.    My husband and I ate dinner at Tony's while on our honeymoon last summer. If you're looking for something romantic yet casual I would recommend it. We got a picture of us almost kissing while eating the same piece of spaghetti like they did in Lady and the Tramp. We're are so cheesy!   I am living in Kentucky, attending a state university, can confirm that they can be god awful...  Despite my parents telling me I should choose an inexpensive Kentucky college, I chose to attend a pretty expensive university in Ohio and found the debt wasn't worth it for what I was studying (English and education).  Even with a large scholarship, it was fucking expensive. Also, all the professors and employees (such as in the financial aid office) and even some of the students were snooty and unfriendly. So, I switched to a school in Kentucky and found their program isn't too terrible. I was skeptical about switching to this KY school because I had heard people had so many issue with it: wayyyyy too many students, financial aid is fucking useless, parking sucks dick since it's a commuter school, there's favoritism, and some other random things (shit gets lost or mixed up by people in the bursar and registrar offices all the time it seems)... But I didn't find any of these issues to be that big of a problem. The professors in my department are AMAZING. It seems most professor through the university (not just in my own department of English) are pretty good. However, there are some, mostly those who are adjuncts teaching lower level courses or core university courses, are god awful and just don't give a shit. Also, a lot of the students are...well...idiots, and I honestly have no clue how they made it to college (one girl in my class thought Australia is in Europe...). But overall I'm happy with my decision to switch from a prestigious out of state school to a not-so-prestigious in state school.   You should base your decision partly on what you plan on doing in the future. If you want a career that won't make a whole ton of money, you obviously don't want a lot of debt... That's one of the reasons why I transferred to my local Kentucky school. The Ohio school cost $30,000 a year (I, fortunately, after scholarships only had to pay $10,000). However, I was originally going to school for teaching which only makes $30k a year!  TL;DR: The Kentucky schools are hit or miss. People either love them or hate them (and it also depends on the school... I know people from every big KY school, so I can tell you what people have said about them). Think about your expected salary after college when picking the college...  Edit: Remember that if you stay in Kentucky, you'll get KEEs money if you're eligible... Free money right off the bat just for staying within the state! That's always a plus.   And one Kentucky college I would recommend looking into is Murray State. My husband absolutely loved it there. It's not shitty like other state colleges.    As someone else has noted, this is nepotism. We had this happen in my university's English club before. The only way we fixed it was when new board members, who recognized that there has been problems with nepotism in the past, came to be in "power." We decided that all future board members have to run a campaign and be elected by other student members - so our club president doesn't appoint board members, as your club seems to do. We also have a professor who oversees everything, and she now has the power to remove people from office and appoint new people if things aren't working out.   Does your club have a professor (or some other university official) who has authority over the club? I don't know if this is possible, but if there are enough complaints, is it possible to "impeach" the club president and have new elections?  It's up to you whether or not you want to do something about it. In my opinion, it's not right when people who don't deserve positions get them. Then again, the world isn't always fair, and you're going to encounter situations like this in the "real world" too, not just in college.  Edit: spelling   I am so terribly sorry you are being dragged through this situation. It sounds like your wife has issues, but has trouble figuring out what they are. All I can say, like many others, is counseling. I truly hope everything works out for the best.    Im sorry, I wasn't trying to speak of it lightly - didn't mean to make kids sound disposable like a puppy or something because kids are serious business. There are some people not meant to have kids, I know that. I'm just asking OP if his wife has ever seriously considered kids and if she has given a legitimate reason for not wanting kids... I mean, it sounds like she would try to take care of a child if she had one by accident so why doesn't she want to have a baby purposely? I'm also curious as to how she hates children since she, as OP claims, has had a limited experience with them (and what is this limited experience, and did the limited experience play a role in her not wanting kids?). I also feel that she's making an excuse when she says she doesn't want kids because she doesn't have maternal instincts since some women, at least as I've seen, can have the instinct kick in once they have a child of their own. I just want to know if there's a hidden reason why she doesn't want kids: saying she hates kids, especially when she doesn't have experience with them, sounds like a sketchy reason to me, but that's just me.   In short, I want to know why the wife won't keep an open mind about kids, why she's so adamant on not wanting them when she hasn't had much experience.   Sorry if I made it sound like she should just have one and pray to god she doesn't hate it because I wasn't trying to say that...   Edit: rearranged things...   Just something I am curious about... You say that your wife has barely been around kids, yet she hates them. How can she absolutely hate kids if she hasn't has much experience with them? What about kids does she hate? Does she hate the idea of having to raise a child? Or does she hate how annoying they can be? Could it be that she hates kids because she's only been around other people's unruly or misbehaved children (meaning she's only seen the negative side of children/raising children)?   Also, I know women who once absolutely hated kids and felt they had no maternal instinct whatsoever, but once they had kids of their own they love them as any parent would love their child. Sometimes maternal instincts doesn't kick in until you have your own child. So, you can hate children, but it seems people have different attitudes toward kids when it's their own child. I loathe other people's children at times - you know, children whose parents allow them to scream nonstop or run around and be all annoying - at times I worry I won't be able to able kids either. I also hate how gross they can be and worry I won't be able to handle diapers and whatnot... but at the same time, I feel my maternal instincts will be stronger when I have a kid of my own, making me a good mom. Plus, I also know my husband will be extremely supportive and will be a wonderful father.    Has your wife ever taking that into consideration? That her maternal instincts will kick in once she has a child, and you'll both be wonderful parents?    Touch...    Two words: pocket pussy...   Wow! I am insanely jealous. I am happy they waived it    I'm terribly sorry you feel the way you do about your body. I would agree that a therapist is your best bet. Are there no services that offer any type of free counseling in your area?  I agree you probably have body dysmorphia - definitely search the internet and read about it. There are online support groups you can join, or you could just read through people's advice on how to overcome this.   I am 5'9" and I weigh 140 and sometimes I feel overweight as well. But let me tell you what I'm beginning to learn: being skinny is overrated. At your height and weight, you're not overweight; you're probably curvy like I am. Some men (and women too!) absolutely love curves - they're quite sexy. You have to learn somehow to embrace your body, love it. Honestly though, if you're curvy, and not just skin and bones, that's a good sign that you're healthy, and that's what's most important.   Also, you've overcome anorexia? Wow! I'm sure that was tough. That's something to be extremely proud of. That shows that you are strong and capable of getting better.   I wish you the best of luck in feeling better with yourself. Be positive. And find some support from people who know what you're going through.   Edit: spelling and whatnot.    As one user has said, colleges tend to care about the money. Often, they don't have souls and don't care about people. My husband took classes over the summer at a local community college a few years back, and he went to the registrar office and asked to have the classes dropped before the deadline. He assumed everything was fine. Then he got a notice saying he owed the school money. Apparently somehow his classes didn't get dropped - his paperwork got lost, so there was no proof he had dropped his classes on time. We were in financial hardship then (and trying to afford a wedding as well). Long story short, regardless of our hardship, he had to pay the school back in full.   Meanwhile, I was attending a very expensive Catholic university. Despite having scholarships and loans, I didn't have enough to cover the cost so my parents paid $5000 out of pocket every semester. My grandmother died suddenly, sending my mom in a deep depression that caused her to stop attending work, which caused my parents to have a lot of money issues. My dad and I filed paperwork to get more loans or some sort of assistance from the university. They denied it.   I'm sorry if this discourages you, but like I said, many universities just don't care.   So here's my advice: try like hell to get the school to understand you are in hardship. Be polite and truthful, and do not accuse the college of being evil or anything. Tears could be beneficial. Maybe you'll get lucky and they will care. Be prepared for the worst though. If you have to pay the money back, try for a loan. Whoever said you should calculate how much those 3.5 hours of class time costs has a good idea, that sounds fair to me, hopefully they could go for that...   Also, take this situation as a life lesson. Be sure you always know what you're getting yourself into, and always know and meet deadlines.  Edit: words   My husband and I went to DQ last summer and most of the games   rides were broke... Would not recommend.   For some crazy reason, my first thought was "Oh, so Daario is Jon's penis?"   The high school I graduated from visits first graders every year and gives them "class of" shirts... No idea why.    Here is my two cents. Do not be afraid to talk to your girlfriend about things like this.  Don't be afraid to ask "What do you think about me getting you a promise ring?" I don't understand why men propose without ever seriously talking to their girlfriend about it first.  I guess men want the girl to be surprised, which is great, but you need to make sure that the girlfriend is on the same page and wants the same things. The girl can drop hints about wanting it, but that's not talking about it.   Also, don't worry if it's "too soon." If you feel the time is right, then the time is right. My husband and I got engaged four months after we had first met and only three months of dating. I was 19, he was 20, we were both sophomores in college. My husband and I talked about getting engaged after only a month of dating. We talked about it, then talked some more, then talked even more. We talked the subject to death, making sure we were always on the same page - and we always were! When we got engaged, we got a lot of shit about it being too soon and everyone said we wouldn't last. We remained engaged for two years before we got married and now we are very happily married.   So, don't let anyone tell you it's too soon. No one can tell if you the time is right except you and your girlfriend. So before you decide to take a step forward in your relationship, have a very serious conversation with your girlfriend, and do it only if you both decide it is the right move.    I got married last summer at Pattison Park in Batavia. They have a gazebo for the ceremony and a lovely lodge for the reception which can seat up to 250 people. The park itself is across the road and has a few picnic shelters and a lake.   	18
 There was a very similar thing with the forestry mod in the old tekkit. long story short the tekkit people were making money through ads on their sight and the forestry dev didnt like that so he made an update for his mod that only came out in tekkit and it erased the critical 32x32 area of chunks around spawn therefore corrupting the world. the mod was then removed from the pack 2 hours after this was found.  	1
 We're going to WWHP in August. I would just like her to get a grasp of the basic story before, because she was too young to know when we went the first time.   Absolutely ABC.   Was Fred Rapier or Rodent?   I know! It was almost two years between GoF and OotP.   School always starts on September first, but it is sometimes a weekend date also.   The older two have already read them all.   I don't either, but Lucius never got the chance to rise to the state of power that Bartemius did.   I wanted to pass on my knowledge, my father's knowledge really; and make some humans, because the entire act is glorious.   Not Bellatrix? Not Rodolphus? Not Rabastan? Not Dolohov, Mulciber, Rookwood or Travers?   This is brilliant, great job.  The only problem I have is that Lucy didn't know that Snape was a good guy, but then Mister Malfoy was not necessarily a bad guy either.     Regardless, I think Barty Jr. was guilty and just thought he could get away because of who his father was. I imagine Barty as the previous generation's Draco.  Barty didn't like it when his father heard about it.   Potions and sweat.   Tasty buds.    [Here's a handful](http://i.imgur.com/Mf6xjaH.jpg)   Hoooold on.    Edit: [Here's a handful](http://i.imgur.com/Mf6xjaH.jpg)   I just re-read it, chapter 30 GoF.   As far as Sr. renouncing as his son, that didn't happen that way either did it? Or was Sr. simply complying to his wife's dying wishes?    She's not having any trouble at all.  Love my little eaglet.   He was still caught with the other three.  I think it was a necessary punishment.    I get that, but it wasn't until he mentioned it in front of Dobby in the staff room that his message got across.   Cheers!    Well, you got the bit in the first book when they serve detention with Hagrid looking for whatever was killing the unicorns.  You got the bit in the second book when Hagrid told Harry and Ron to follow the spiders.  The bit in the third book when Hagrid walked his CoMC class deep into the forest to get to the hippogiriffs.  And I would also like to ad the scene in OotP when Hagrid introduced the trio to Grawp, and also when Hermione led Umbridge, Ron and Harry deep into the forest where Grawp was.  Edit: Ron didn't go with Harry, Hermione and Umbridge.   Not sure he was. Brings to mind the scene with the spider when he was showing the fourth years the unforgivables and he used the cruciatus curse in front of Neville, when he knew in fact that he had tortured Neville's parents to insanity using the same curse. Sure Neville didn't know his true identity at the time, but that was still a shitty thing to do.   Yaxley. He was an extremely powerful wizard with nothing but malice on his mind.   As you could probably read the book in an hour, I would start there. They are making this a trilogy all penned by Ms. Rowling herself, so it will go far and beyond the book I am almost sure.   Probably one of the first three.   They did say Voldemort in the cafe, but because of the fidelius charm on 12GP the DEs knew the general location, but they couldn't see the house.   There is a huge gap between canon and the films my slithery friend.   Chudley Cannons please.   LOL, all good man.   I love the entire arc of the book, but to me it drags on more than DH does sometimes.   The main thing I dislike about it is fuckin' Umbridge. If any character in the history of fiction has ever made my skin crawl as much as Dolores Umbridge.  But she got hers in the end didn't she?  *clop clop*   Its not like the Death Eaters would be smart and keep them in separate evil lairs.  That made me laugh.   I agree completely my fellow lion.   I get the parenting thing, because I am one and I would do anything to get my daughter back, but I would not have resorted to telling my enemies/daughter's captor where the good guy was just to get her back.  I'm just saying that was a shitty thing to do. Why couldn't Xeno have just helped them, and let them leave in peace?  Edit: I'll answer my own question. That was after a bit of a lull in the story, so it brought some excitement.    And he didn't even get Luna back after he said the taboo. The DEs just laughed at him.  *Treacherous little bleeder*    Yea man, but stick to your convictions is what I say.   Xenophilius Lovegood. He was all about helping Harry until the DEs took Luna off the train.   If a person believes what they are saying, veritaserum can be tricked. It's the same reason a lie detector cannot be used in muggle court.   [The Greater Good](https://youtu.be/OGHBwk0quxs) is pretty awesome.   Correct, one is a curse, and the other is a charm.   If it were as simple as sending Voldemort an owl, don't you think the ministry would have thought of that?   If you read the text, chapter 13 of DH Hermione specifically uses the *Gemenio* charm to reproduce the locket. Chapther 26 of DH, Griphook plainly states that they have added the *Gemino* curse in the vault. Two different spells.     If you read the text, chapter 13 of DH Hermione specifically uses the *Gemenio* charm to reproduce the locket. Chapther 26 of DH, Griphook plainly states that they have added the *Gemino* curse in the vault. Two different spells.   I try to forget about Badenhop.   Don't know why you were downvoted, but this is correct.   did moody have the option of having a normal eye and chose to have the mad eye?  It's my headcanon that Moody made the eye himself, that would be the type of thing that would be dead useful for an auror, wouldn't you think?     And the security at Grimmauld place wasn't for Snape  No, Moody set up the tongue tying curse specifically for Snape, so he couldn't tell the other death eaters where it was.   Piertotem Locomortor  I've always wanted to use that spell.   What if d-o-g really spelled cat.   Definitely Helena Ravenclaw.   Yep, don't come here unless you want spoilers.    That's what I thought.   I stand corrected.   Leave him be, the bible is as good a work of fiction as Harry Potter is.   He had seven after he attempted to kill Harry October 31, 1990, but it wasn't a real horcrux.   Correct, right before the start of year 4, so it might have been 93 even.   I don't know man, but if he is one of the best, they're sunk for the season. Chappy has already lost one this year, coaching perhaps?   Gemino curse was what caused the objects in the LeStranges' vault to multiplty. The Geminio charm is what Hermione used to replicate the locket after she took it from Umbridge, IIRC.   Only a knut to join SPEW.   It would have been a charm if anything and not a curse. I just think they sent that many.   He didn't make Nagini until 94 way after the basilisk was dead. Whether he knew that she was dead or not is another question.      What college do you go to?   I'm American, and I thought this was funny. Have my upvote OP.   Okay, I'm going to type slowly..  Kreacher belonged to the *Noble House of Black* and when Sirius told him to "Get out!" Kreacher took that as a command because Sirius was his master and he disappeared over the winter months, remember? Sirius was not very kind to Kreacher and the poor guy was locked up at 'Grim old place' with no one to talk to but Walburga's portrait. Padfoot even said he was crazy in the book.  When Harry inherited 12GP from Sirius he also inherited Kreacher, and that is why Kreacher was silenced when Harry told him to shut up in the chapter you spoke of, *Will and Won't?* One of my favorites.   Kreacher betrayed Sirius because he was abused and Sirius told him to, "Get out!"  Dobby on the other hand did what he thought was right, and punished himself accordingly.    it'd be quite beautiful if his last wand was the one he made for Luna.  I love this!   Ahhh, across the pond. I'll get there someday.   Gorgeous, where is that?   I think he would have been grateful, and would have probably made James, Albus, and Lily's wands for free.  If Harry had not come to Malfoy Manor, Garrick probably would have died there.   Been their many times.   Chum is FUM!   I like these, I watch these, but sometimes it's blatantly obvious that he did not read the books.   The Basilisk was a girl. The male are identifiable from the purple plume on their heads.      Da fuq?    Correct. Hagrid made them walk deep into the forest, remember Ron and Harry thinking they were going to Aragog's lair? Hagrid probably just took down the corral and let them roam.   No, Harry is no where near as whiny as Luke.   Something like [this?](http://i.imgur.com/3woAuBW.jpg)   I don't know, it's hard to come up with an HP related pun for Parmelee.  Edit: Dumbledore's Parmy?    Hippogriffs!  How sweet would it be to have a frickin' horse-eagle in your backyard anytime you wanted to go anywhere?   Dumbledore's Parmelee, FTFY.      How funny was Mel Brooks to work with on Mad About You?   Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition    Way to play it safe. ;o)   I would expect nothing less from a classy lady such as yourself.   Hello Ms. Hunt. Who was your favorite actor to work with?   Sorry, it's a bad habit.   *Ob... viously..*   AHHH! My world has gone fubar for the day! How exciting would that have been?   One looks to the other and says "You know, I've never come this way before." The second replies, "Must be the cobblestones."   He shut the basilisk in the chamber and put it under a magical sleep until his own true heir returned to Hogwarts to awaken it, and that's what Riddle did.   How's Sunnyvale?       That was the true veela at the QWC, and that is just the way they are. They weren't as nice looking when the leprechauns broke up their  chance at distracting the referee, were they?  Was it Mostafa?   Now that you mention it, I think I only know one or two people with real black hair.   Not sure what basis you're going on here, but they're described as beautiful creatures that have an ability to attract men.   If you're on about the film, then that's just the way they chose to cast it.   Knew that Harry had Snape's old book?   I think Ron did in the film, but I'm almost sure Slughorn did when Harry approached him the first time about the horcrux after Albus gave him the task, it could have been another time. Maybe Hagrid's hut?  Edit: I mean the book in the second examples.    that Slughorn called Harry the potions "Prince?"   I like to think that they shared little hints and such, and that was why Lily was so good?   Absolutely. Albus says something to the effect of Horace likes collecting famous and powerful people, and that he would try to collect Harry.  Dumbledore thought that because Lily was Horace's favorite student, and that Harry was her son, that Harry would be able to extract the memory to further the plot.   Thanks, I just know what I read in the books.    I believe it was GoF after the graveyard that Dumbledore says that Harry Potter and Tom Riddle had gone farther to unite themselves than any two wizards in history that he knew of, so (paraphrasing) it was inevitable that there would be no way to completely keep them apart.  Albus was over 100 by then, a brilliant man such as himself would surely know wizarding history by now.   Regardless, Cornelius was literally ignoring the facts from someone that he would take advice from in the past, (Albus Dumbledore), nothing could have been said to assuage him.   Fudge would not have believed it anyway, and memories can be tampered with.   Still love your flair Boog.   There is a great book that starts out, "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four Privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."  I'd start there.  Edit: I would avoid all of the films until you have read each book.   I was never a fan of the Lemon strains. Lemon Kush, Lemon Haze... they taste great but the high never lasts as long, and it's mostly in your head.   Not really as Kingsley was high up in the auror office at the time, I bet he could probably do whatever and wizards wouldn't give it a second thought.      I assume Dumbeldore hooked him up somehow  I've asked this question before, and some have suggested that Kingsley nicked it from the ministry for him.   To add to your post OP, one of my biggest pet peeves is people that actually think that death created the hallows when in fact it was just three powerful wizards.   Right, the leaf doesn't reflect UV like the bud does.   I like that one.   I think it's just UV light.   I would call it albino.    Not sure I'd risk naming my kid after my brother. What if he turned out to be an asshole? I would rather go with some folk that have already established themselves.     	118
 When we play the Seahawks in week 3, we will be underdogs (and rightfully so - predict 4.5 points or so).  That being said, the Broncos have the talent and tools to compete and win that game.  Seattle looked strong, but they did not look immortal by any means.     They have outtakes, but they call them, "Mulligans".   I want to die.  Source:  playing against a buddy who has Harvin, Lynch, and Hauscha.   K, FanBro.  Most people sort by new to follow the game.  People don't up vote very long because they are trying to keep up.  Cool your tits.  Fuck the Raiders.   I would say 80% hate him, 10% tolerate him, and 10% apologize for him.   Well when he tosses their salad and tastes his salty discharge, he'll know.   New Glarus?  Ale Asylum?   Fair statement.    Don't worry, we'll get em week3.   I am also playing against Beast Mode right now.  I am 40 points in the hole because my buddy has 3 seahawks.    I have redemption rye.  Cannonball comin!   All year.  It's what they do.  Remember how long Flacco/Moore was mentioned off hand Last year?   Feels bad, right?  Hug it in bros, I live in Madison now.  Feel many of your pains.   Is it 1991?   Yeah, that was a big win for the Pack.   Wow, you're a great human being.   That was poor.   He does.  He is a mixture of Al Gore ' s boring Ness and Hitler ' s meanness.   Yeah, I think so.  Seems fine.  I'd watch, "Denzel Washington takes names all day".   I know right?   NBC cherry picking plays to meet their narrative of, "Wilson is maturing as a passer by getting rid of it quickly"   Collinsworth is flabbergasted that an NFL player can run all the way down the field . . .   Oh man, I don't know.  I have never seen them out of the Midwest.    I love football.   We have a superior version called cheese curds.    GE, getting weird and awesome on us.   I know right?  Leave willy wonka alone.   We've always been at war with Eastasia   Yeah, that is pretty great.   Richard?  Ya dead?   Oops, I'm racist.   Coooooooooooooooooooooon!   Awkward.  Blocked right into it.   Yes; for statistical purposes, a gain of 0 for the QB is a sack, and the closest defender gets credit if he runs out of bounds.   5 yard penalty; was only 4th and 2.   Back to back errors by the Pack.   Chipped my tooth on my fork tonight.   DM; HF.   Bad news:  Three of the most improved teams are in the Central.   Good news:  At least the Avs are one of them.  Starting to get really stoked for hockey!   Me too, actually.  I love to hate the Raiders more than the Chiefs and Chargers.  I want our rivals back!   Of course you're right.  As a fanbase, the Seattle loss hit us pretty hard.  Many newer fans weren't invested during the 80's blowouts, so Superbowls were fun and games to them.  Seattle taught many of them how horrible "The Big Game" can really be.  Hence, our hatred for Seattle is very fresh in our mind, and I want to destroy them.  That being said - if, by some miracle, Super Bowl 49 features a dominant Seahawks team vs. Derek Carr and the scrappy, surprise Raiders, I will be rooting for the Seahawks to destroy you filthy Raiders *44*-8, leading them to be declared the a new Dynasty, the greatest defense ever, and listening to their fans harp on about how "only the NFC West plays real football" for the next decade.  Any Broncos fan who feels otherwise has simply lost perspective.   I think one side is logos, and the other side is colors, right?  Logos are all the same, but half are orange and half are blue?   I think it is very reasonable to pick up Bubba (I am yelling in my wife's ear to grab him for her last bench slot right now).  Remember last year when Welker was out with his concussion and Bubba was the best player in the Thursday night loss vs. San Diego?  No reason that kind of thing can't happen again.    You'd need a pretty deep league (12+ players, and at least 1 flex, maybe two) to give him a serious start those first four weeks, but in later rounds it is hard to see that much upside.   Your Montee team should be called, "The Montee Ball Problem".     I came here to say this.  I always thought of Mostromart when seeing the Publix slogan.   The herpesvirus family has three groups:  alpha, beta, and gamma.  They are largely classified by the site where they establish a latent infection.   Alphaherpesviruses are HSV1, HSV2,  and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, which causes chickenpox upon initial infection, and shingles upon reactivation later in life).  Site of latency:  neurons.  Betaherpesviruses are things like Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and a few lesser known ones like HHV-6.  They are latent in certain progenitor blood cells.  Gammaherpesviruses are Epstein-Barr Virus, KSHV, and a few others.  They are latent in some immune blood cells.  So: tl; dr --  Related by genetics and similar life cycles, but specific sites of latency and disease states are different.   I think you've got it exactly right - the potential for a latent infection poses a real challenge for vaccination.  In addition, these viruses seem to be very good at modulating the immune system just enough to stay under the radar.  That being said, that a vaccination exists for Chicken Pox is encouraging.   Also, it was just in /r/ science:  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/28vuzr/science_ama_series_iama_virologist_who_studies/   Officially it was a Ph.D. In Biomedical Sciences -- Immunology   Microbiology.  Now I am studying a different herpes virus,  CMV, as a Post-doc.  This virus is also mentioned in the article that is posted, so I am planning on giving it a close read tomorrow.   Hey there!  I studied hsv-1 for my PhD thesis and did an AMA on /r/askscience.  Lots of great questions asked that day - many about distinguishing hsv 1 and 2.   I don't think that's right . . .   I am going with "The Montee Ball Problem".   This.  My worst fantasy season came with Stafford as my QB.  He'd throw three picks and flirt with a negative point total one week, and then go for 30+ the next week (after I benched him, obviously).  Do not go down the Matt Stafford road.  It is folly.   The Montee Ball Problem   Juwanaman!!!   *sigh* I'd watch it.   Man, his cheeks are going to be so warm in December . . .   http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1vdfaa/conference_championship_trash_talk_thr  Comment 6 or so   We're you around for the Taylor Swift parody fight between me and a Pats fan in the Championship Trask talk thread?  Seems like it might be up your alley.   These are definitely the Raiders.    Gotta say, Raiders are looking better than I thought.   Seattle might actually kill Rodgers on opening night if this o line doesn't improve.   Whoo preseason!  I would watch another game too, but the Packers are on local TV so I don't have to hook up a computer.   Oh my god, YES!   Can Phil Simms say more blatantly incorrect things?   [NO SPRINGS!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO-_LJZbG7E)    Eh, forget my lawyer.   Hitler, North Dakota?    I don't think so . . .   You mean at the end?  I think Homer told her over the phone that they were going to try one more place, and she decided to show up, too.   Yeah, Homer kind of white-washed how sexy that stag party was going to be, but that really isn't that big of a problem - he didn't lie to her about anything.  And, her criticism that he is teaching Bart that it is okay to objectify women is really unfair.  He is just dancing with a stripper - who isn't even partially naked!     Keep in mind that sometimes the Broncos can go 5 wide.    Last year it was usually DT, Decker, Orange, Welker, and Caldwell.  Caldwell caught one of the opening day 7 TDs this way.  A similar 5-wide this year could include any from this group of 6:  DT, Orange, Sanders, Welker, Caldwell, Latimer.  So, he will get some snaps, even without injuries.  There's also the distinct possibility of him spelling DT after one of those long screen plays or some other deep-ball.  Of course, if a WR gets nicked up a bit, it will be much easier for him to get in there.   I would like to challenge your interpretation of the ending.  The final scene is Donald Duck, awakening from a nightmare wearing USA-themed pajamas with a *Home, Sweet Home* decoration behind his bed, and a shadow on his wall, seemingly cast by a Nazi heiling (possibly even Hitler).  It is then revealed that the shadow is cast by a novelty Statue of Liberty, upon which Donald hugs and kisses it and says, "Oh boy, am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America "  So, three things here:    First, the immense over-the-top patriotism noted both by the pajamas and the statement could easily be interpreted as approaching caricature - suggesting that such high praise for the USA is questionable, at best.  Second, there is the rather obvious observation that the Statue of Liberty casts a shadow image which is indicative of oppression and fascism.  This can be interpreted as a suggestion that even a system supposedly based on liberty could in fact be something else.  I believe if you check some of the leading intellectuals at the time, the idea that "freedom" was just another kind of control, and "tyranny" just another form of freedom was often discussed.  Finally, I consider it important that Donald's statement was in the form of a question.  If you are going for a happy, exclamatory statement about how great the USA is, it removes nothing to have Donald actually state it.  The fact that he asks the question, "Am I glad. . . ?" is telling.  Surface level, sure, it is very, very anti-Nazi.  But isn't there something going on underneath?  I think it is ultimately a cartoon pondering the danger of becoming the evil that you purport to be fighting against, in this case, due to overuse of propaganda, stereotypes, and stolen symbols.     Oh, gotcha.  I was thinking "plot" all the way.   Yeah, that's the cat.    This is indeed a disturbing universe.   My team's wins don't count, yet.  *YET.*   I would've gone with "Poltergeist".   Respect.  I mean, hatred too, obviously.  But still respect.  PS:  We're catching you in wins this year!   I think he means the weird-looking bespectacled dude with the long straight hair who always gets mustard or soda spilled all over his nice suit, often by J.P. (JG-L's buddy).   Happily upvoted a Raiders fan because he is 100% dead-on correct.   Be reasonable.  He can't be that awful.   Omar had really good coverage on that 3rd down there.  Defense is looking okay so far.   See, I like Carroll the least of them.  Sherman is loud and obnoxious, but backs it up so you tip your cap.  Wilson is scrappy and a leader who earned his spot and the Seahawks are riding the boon of paying him pittance for now (ditto *many* others).  Carroll just some failure Jets coach who cheated his way through a college system which rewards renown and flew the coop back to the pros when the writing was on the wall.  Fuck Pete Carroll.    Strangely, this is often my thought.   I mean, I will still contend that if those teams play 10 games, neither wins 7.  Seahawks won the one they played,  so who cares.  Week three will be horrible and awesome.   I mean, sometimes your shit gets tossed.  Happens to all of us.  All you can do is put on the orange, wear it proud, and go after the next trophy even harder.      Oh!  You mean like a pussy!   New strategy discussion:   Isn't being up 6 better than up 5 or 4?  I mean 5 and 4 are basically no different,  but six means 2 FG ties and even a touchdown forced a make from 33 yards.  Seems like Broncos should go for 2 there.   People hate Seattle because they are the new kids on the block and act like they are the fucking 49ers.  Fans and players and coach alike.  I mean, it's fine if you want to act that way, but shit comes around in this league.    In "Fuck the Raiders" news:  Seattle ' s third string QB started for you last year.  And he looks bad against other third stringers.  And in related, "Fuck the Steelers" news:  you made him look good.   Thompson #40 jersey purchsed.  #notreallybutseriouslyamiright?   Yeah, seems dumb, but NFL wants to try it out.   Allegedly.   Check new rules.  For first 2 preseason games, all PAT will be snapped from 15.  Trial period for possible rule change this offseason.   Oh don't get me wrong; I am pissing and moaning at the tv, too, and getting way too riled up insinuating various phallus - pleasing transactions involving referees.  Thing is - we should relax.   Most starters should be out now (except for the de facto starters like Kayvon), and I was very pleased with both first team O and D.  I don't think anyone can say that the Broncos didn't show up and go toe to toe with, and likely best, the Superbowl champs.  Way pleased.   So here's the deal:  The refs are in their first preseason game too.  It is very fresh in their minds what they need to emphasize and call.  Much of it has been horribly tricky tack and pretty bullshit.   They should tone it down when the games matter, because it just looks stupid when they watch the film and a LB gets called for illegal contact on a 1 second play when the defender MISSES his man.   The wife and I just moved to Madison (first week anniversary, woo!).  Any resident Broncos fans or local hangouts?  Probably wont get too excited for the preseason, but I think once the games mean something we would love to meet up!   First, it is important to recognize that only certain kinds of viruses can do this.  Let's divide all human viruses into three broad categories:  DNA, RNA, and Retro- viruses.  RNA viruses only ever use RNA as their genetic material.  They will not leave DNA in our genome at all.  Flu, Cold, and the newly popular Chikungunya are a few examples.   DNA viruses act pretty much like extra, tiny chromosomes, transcribing and replicating in a very similar fashion.  Some of these may have mechanisms for inserting their DNA into the host, but some of that research is still controversial.  Your DNA viruses are things like the herpesviruses,  HPV, Adenovirus and Poxviruses.  The Kings of integration, though, are Retroviruses (HIV being the most well known).  These viruses use RNA as their genetic material, but reverse - transcribe to DNA as an intermediate!  One part of the process involves an enzyme called integrase - it's job is to put the DNA intermediate into the host genome for subsequent activation (leaving it dormant).  Trouble is, sometimes the integration site isn't specific, and you can imagine how inserting Kilobases into a random gene could cause problems.     I would agree with you.  Having that line would be akin to Harrison Ford's stupid voice-over chiming in right after the "Like tears in rain" line in *Blade Runner*.     Okay, I'll be there next week.   Struggled to come up with Brandon Lloyd, then it clicked with 1:30 left to go!  It was also fortunate that only two receivers who accomplished this feat *before* I was born:  Watson and Taylor.  One is prominently featured in numerous Elway documentaries, and the other is on the ring of fame.  Also, I spelled "Lelie" wrong about four times before I got him.   Good point;  we're on Verizon.   Will I have a pretty good view from behind my desk?   Awesome.  That will be an early visit, as the wife has never had cheese curds.  In fact, I had to explain what they were last week!   Standard deal; I understand.   Hey folk!  I am moving to Madison in about a week with my wife for a new job, and we are getting all of our Ps and Qs in order for the move (it is non-trivial; we are coming from Florida).  Some of the FAQs which interest me most are a bit outdated due to the nature of the questions, so I thought I would throw out another set of questions.  First, we are probably bailing on Bank of America.  They are fine, but it appears that the closest BoA in in Illinois - and while most of the stuff we would need is very do-able via the internet, it is probably best to be able to visit the bank in person just in case.  So, what kinds of banking / credit unions have impressed you?  We are looking at Chase, US Bank, and a couple credit unions.  Of equal importance - ISPs.  The FAQ in the sidebar is from three years ago, so I wanted a bit of an update.  What is the landscape of ISPs in Madison?  We are in western Madison, out by the Beltline Hwy, if that matters at all.  I know I can google up answers to these things, but I want any personal accounts of how things function for you folk.  Thanks a bunch!   Edit:  One day later and I've gotten a bunch of thought-out, awesome responses.  We've started researching some of the specifics, and you fine folk are definitely making the transition easier.  Many thanks!   It is still the same virus, the condition it causes is just called something else (because it has different effects).  	105

 original paper: [Fluoropolymer coatings for improved carbon nanotube transistor device and circuit performance](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/105/12/10.1063/1.4895069)   x-post: /r/EnergyStorage   [Ledbelly - Mr Hitler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQva5wKSfzM)   ?   Not a fix but it's an awesome extension either way: OneTab    Ok, you're backpedaling.  no, not really. again 'it just depends on preexisting conditions'   ...often cut by 50%"  but not always, again, preexisting conditions.  as well, rate of application of char, porosity of char, etc.   Then in this last comment you admit that gross overapplication of water is....  saying that 'this variable *too* comes into play' isn't as much an 'admission' as a statement going along with the 'preexisting conditions' statement above. but, spin it however you need to I suppose.   If water was being overapplied previously, then the biochar cannot be credited with the reduction in water usage.  and why not? why can't it be a reduction in overapplied water *combined* with the increased water holding capacity of the soil relative to the increase *in* water holding capacity of the soil afforded by the application of biochar?  That'd be like shooting someone twice, each time in a vital organ where that single shot would've killed them and then saying 'oh, that second shot to the liver did nothing because it was this shot in the lungs that actually did the killing' ... both are contributing variables. both play a roll in the reduction.  Now, possibly a more appropriate analogy to fit with *your* statement would be two shots, one to the heart, one to the head. both lethal in   of themselves ... but, most likely the shot to the head would lead to the death quicker... (granted, even *that's* relative to where in the head the bullet goes) ... but, even then, to say that the bullet to the heart would still not have an impact is just to completely ignore the presence of it to begin with.  backing out of the asininity of that analogy, the point is: you're essentially completely ignoring *any* effect biochar would have. ...and, by it's mere presence, it'd have at least *some*. ...even if it was a negative one, it's still there, thus, still having an effect.  ...and, again, evidence implies the biochar as well would improve retention.   I'm not disputing that biochar or some other soil amendment is capable of increasing the water holding capacity of a soil.  yes. yes you are actually. not just in the above paragraph but with this quote    not a product any soil amendments.  and your complete dismissal via the comparison of biochar to a Nigerian prince.   so, yeah, actually, you were. feel free to 'backpedal' some more if you need to though.   What i am disputing is the numbers.   and, again, the numbers will be entirely relative to a multitude of variables and, again, preexisting conditions. ...amount of prior water use included.   Even if it increased the soil's water holding capacity by 25%  wow, it almost reads like you're beginning to open your mind to the *possibility* that it *may* have at least *some* effect on the soil! hope you didn't strain yourself too much with that one! I know those rusty doors can be a bitch to open sometimes.   We're not gonna see any significant reduction in water usage from just that.  um... what?? if it increases the soil's water holding capacity by 25%, then by default 25% more water would be capable of being held. If the water is applied, then 25% less water would need to *be* applied to meet similar results.   as such, there'd be the capability for a 25% reduction in water use and, as such, a savings of 25% relative to water-cost.  I don't know what numbers you're holding 25% relative to, but where California (again, the point of focus of the op) has ~5% water use for residential purposes.. and they're putting pressure   restrictions *on* residential use... I'd say that even a *few* % is considered worthy of upsetting their constituents, let alone *twenty-five* percent!  but, 'significant' is a relative word open to subjective interpretation so...    I can't find much data on turfgrass water loss from irrigation  [here's a link](https://extension.umass.edu/turf/fact-sheets/turf-irrigation-and-water-conservation) you may be able to discern some data from  ... if so, you obviously didn't look too hard because that took well less than 2 minutes to find.  at.. well, basically the rest of everything you typed in your next paragraph....  the losses due to evaporation are oftentimes due to the fact that the water simply can't get into the soil to begin with. It literally doesn't have the porosity needed *to* flow down. Work with enough clay soils and you'll quickly realize that soil aeration is the difference between swimming in mud and actually watering a plant.  At that... to go back to the link I just sent... iti gave a nice chart relating to sand, sandy loam, loam, etc.  Since you seem to need links provided for you vs being capable of finding them yourself.... try [this one](http://www.journal-ijeee.com/content/4/1/44)  Note from that  preexisting condition: loamy sand soil  biochar type: yellow pine pyrolyzed at 400C (50C *below* the temperature stated in the [Rice U study](http://news.rice.edu/2012/03/22/cooking-better-biochar-study-improves-recipe-for-soil-additive-2/) I recommended checking out in a previous response...   ala this line: The researchers found charcoal produced at temperatures of 450 Celsius or higher was most likely to improve soil drainage and make more water available to plants, while charcoal produced at lower temperatures could sometimes repel water. - See more at: http://news.rice.edu/2012/03/22/cooking-better-biochar-study-improves-recipe-for-soil-additive-2/#sthash.64FMvdk5.dpuf  )  read: it's a lower quality char produced at sub-optimal levels, lower porosity, and, otherwise *not* the quality of material a company like Cool Planet would provide (if memory serves, their temperatures are in the ~1000-1500F range, but I'm not spending the time to dig that up)  application rate: 9% mixture of biochar  closing line of the abstract: "Results show a doubling in water holding capacity by mass using a 9% mixture of biochar (equivalent to 195 metric ton/ha), which is an agriculturally relevant concentration. High percentage mixtures of biochar increase water holding capacity dramatically. These results suggest the use of biochar has potential to mitigate drought and increase crop yields in loamy sand soil."  ...and that's a sandy loam where the water can even get into it to begin with... take clay soils that're heavily salted and compacted as fuck in such that they essentially act like 'plates' where water just 'rushes off them' ...barely ever getting beneath surface levels?  may be able to increase that even *beyond* the doubling.  throw on the increased porosity of char attained from the 450C+ temperatures recommended by the Rice U study? as well increases in ratio above 9%... possibly and quite-probably even higher than that..  from the conclusion: "Water holding capacity of unamended sandy loam soil, 16%, is doubled by the addition of 9% by mass of biochar. This finding is important because it establishes biochar as an effective medium for increasing irrigation effectiveness, runoff mitigation, and reducing non-point source agricultural pollution."  also: "This study only considered one type of biochar (yellow pine from pyrolysis at 400C) mixed with one type of soil (loamy sand), and thus further research is clearly indicated."  that goes along with the sentiment behind the statement I was making that it's still needing to be researched, but preliminary results are positive ...  and, lastly, the entire closing paragraph of the conclusion   To promote the practice of agricultural biochar soil amendment, the full life cycle costs and benefits to biochar soil amendment must be estimated. The effect of water holding capacity on crop growth due to water holding capacity, nutrient retention, and microbial growth must be understood, in addition to the benefits of the likely reduced need for irrigation and fertilizer and pesticide usage. Inclusion of traditionally externalized costs associated with carbon and environmental degradation, a side effect of current farming techniques, will further improve the cost/benefit analysis of agricultural biochar usage.   the savings aren't *just* from water reduction... ... nutrient retention, fertilizer, pesticide usage... these are expensive amendments (that, according to your logic, do nothing to change the water holding capacity).  that biochar *seems* to only increase SOC and microbial activity within the soil, thus helping to increase the microchannels in the soil provided by these organisms over time... the results down the line may prove to show an even *greater* increase in water retention.    In order to get to 50% water savings from the soil amendment, it would need to increase the soil holding capacity by 250%, which is absurd.  only using your numbers it would.    because, fuck gravity    Ok, fine, i hate to be that guy  then don't be   but for once i'm gonna ask YOU to show me the numbers.  I have. multiple times. again, /r/biochar. I've posted *thousands* of posts there, personally. There's *more* than enough there to support both *your* stance *and* *mine*.  To go through it to pick out a few just for you... only for you to then dismiss them by (probably not taking to time to...) picking out a few more that show *negative* results is, quite simply, a waste of *both* of our time.  There are a lot of different qualities of char produced from difference source materials and processed/'created' in different ways.  ....and each showing their own results.   and, this isn't just relative to the reduction of watering by 50%, but growth, input reduction, etc. it's across the board.   It's a 'new' material that's still in the process of being figured out.   As I've stated up to this point, it's largely relative to 'pre-existing conditions'.   ...if those conditions are last year's compost? it's probably not going to show a lot of improvement. If it's dry desert 'soil' that's about as dead as this 'conversation' is? it'll probably show a lot more improvement vs it *not* being added.  again, i'll let the studies dealing with preexisting conditions of which there are *many* posted in /r/biochar (by me, ..and others)  provide that data.    I imagine if you took a situation where terrible amounts of water were wasted and implemented a comprehensive water saving plan you might be able to save 50%  that *too* has been covered in a few of the studies. but, again, /r/biochar. there are a *lot* of published studies out there relative to biochar, and many of them linked to *via* /r/biochar.    However, that savings would be as a result of gross overapplication of water previously,   this variable *too* comes into play    not a product any soil amendments.  inevitably/of course?  but to say that 'no' soil amendment is capable of helping to increase the holding capacity *of* said soil? is to, again, ignore evidence to the contrary posted elsewhere... be it in /r/agronomy, /r/soil, *or* /r/biochar.  ..and that isn't *just* limited to biochar as being an amendment capable of increasing soil water retention.    Frankly i get tired of sparring with you over issues you post in this sub  apologies, but I don't remember 'sparring with you' before the exchanges on this post.. ...but, then, my memory's not too good. for all i know, we've 'exchange blows' many times before this one.   You basically assert here that i'm an ignorant luddite incapable of understanding useful technology.  in this instance? (again, excuse me if there've been previous ones that escape me right now) ...in a *way*? yeah. unfortunately, you've offered nothing other than 'magical' 'dismissives'. You've not addressed the original (very short!) post other than to say that biochar *doesn't* save water.   There are *many* sites that cover biochar.. I'll give you that a lot of them are 'fluff', but there've been more than enough that're based on peer reviewed published science/journal papers/entries as well.  .... papers that *have* 'researched' it in accordance to (and above   beyond) the standards set forth *for* published papers. There have been plenty of papers showing a *lack* of positive results as well as papers showing where it increased yields, met or exceeded initial theories   hypotheses. It's still early in the science of this 'material'. Even the IBI and biochar communities have pushed back much of the 'path-forward' goals to 2020   beyond. Papers like the one Rice U put out in March 2013 have done much to help 'raise the bar' on the standards needed to produce a 'quality' material, but even then, it's still a more-generic term for activated carbon... whereby the carbon is sourced from a biological material.   Is there a 'snake oil' element to it? absolutely. but is there science behind it? absolutely, as well. but that you'd dismiss it as being the 'agronomic equivalent of a Nigerian prince'? well, that clearly implies that you have little to back up your perception of it ...beyond just rattling off your (equally b.s.) perception of it.   I've suggested /r/biochar in the comments on this post *more* than enough times at this point to imply that maybe it's a sub people might be interested in checking out. $17.5k (plus s h, time   energy, etc) isn't a small chunk of change (in market value) that, though Cool Planet's intentions may be as much PR-focused as anything else... but, well, let's see how it does. Chicago's incorporation of it into their city parks has shown positive results, as have other cities. City of Thousand Oaks may *also* show positive results... ...or, hell, it may show *negative* ones as well. ...only future postings relating to it will provide evidence to either.   but, your 'tone' is... bah. finger-vomit as far as I'm concerned. be it the first post we've exchanged according to it or the up-teenth. 'Frankly', it's still useless fodder filled with nothing of relevance or note.   it'd be nice if the press would cover this aspect of it more as well.  sad about the almonds. those things take a while to grow!  cotton in California just seems like a horrible waste of resources to begin with. best to keep that shit in the southeast where it belongs!   ...or, at least in environments better *naturally* suited for its growing demands.  no tears shed over that one.  but the almond trees... and other orchards... that one sucks!   maybe they can team up with nestle to get some of their water   technically the heating of wood in an oxygen free environment.   the 'burning' comes as part of the next step... ie, once the gases separating from the carbon ignite and, thus, burn.  so, more correctly worded would be: biochar is created by the pyrolysis of wood.     but, essentially, yeah :)   explain this 'magic'  who claims? what do they claim? I've read where char made from bullshit doesn't work as well as char made from denser woody materials. though, maybe you could provide a link?  what's that Clark quote? "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic' so, basically, the ignorant are incapable of understanding the science and, thus, conclude it must be magic.  Does the fact that you're so dismissive of it mean that you're incapable of understanding the science behind it? or just ignorant *of* it?   did *any*thing that I wrote above even remotely mention what you responded with?  What I said was pretty clear. if you check out /r/biochar or just google: 'biochar' in general and look at many of the results, you'll see that the addition to biochar to soils, combined with biochar's porosity's ability to hold onto water that water use is often cut by 50%... if not more as a result of biochar's application/addition to the soil.  ...granted, the preexisting conditions of the soil will determine how much of an improved holding capacity it will bring, it still seems to bring *some* regardless.   x-post: /r/organicgardening   /r/composting    jatropha  found [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/08/22/159391553/how-a-biofuel-dream-called-jatropha-came-crashing-down) while searching for it. haven't had a chance to read it yet though   edit: I read it... and a few more.  honestly, I'm not convinced of it. for a short-chain hydrocarbon switchgrass and miscanthus make more sense.  and, imo, switchgrass makes more than miscanthus. I just like it better, despite it not having as high of a hydrogen density, it makes biochar, provides more pulp (for paper, particle wood, etc), is hardier than miscanthus, and grows as far north as southern canada... as well, its the native grass to that these other biofuel crop-types replaced.  but, jatropha wasn't for short chain hydrocarbons... it was the oil in the seeds.  and its drought resistance (switchgrass is a major soil builder, absorbs tons of water, is is very drought resistant itself... again, it's the native grass of the midwest).  but, well, ... i'll give it that it's prob better than soy in many ways? (no clue on the energy density per acre... vs soy... and i don't like soy. period. let alone for an energy crop). .... but, i like algenol's process better. and it makes both short *and* long-chain hydrocarbons.  9000+ gallons per acre of ethanol *and* ~1'500 gallons of longer-chain hydrocarbons, from gasoline to diesel. as well 'pure hydrogen' as a processing byproduct of it.   maybe it's time we start using the grass *as* the biofuel crop?  /r/switchgrass   /r/CaliforniaDrought  /r/drought  /r/biochar   actually, the addition of biochar has shown to save *more* than 50%... it just depends on the pre-existing conditions.  but, 'whatever this stuff is' is biochar.... you should check it out /r/biochar   wouldn't've thought that England would've had water problems. ...given that the reputation there is constant rain   fog.     x-post: /r/soil   x-post: /r/BioChar   x-post: /r/BioChar   x-post: /r/BioChar   x-post: /r/BioChar    x-post: /r/BioChar    It would definitely seem to've made more sense to put something in effect towards the agricultural industry; restrictions, caps, penalties/fines, programs to increase water retention, recycling, decreased water use, equipment implementation, changes in agricultural practices, etc ... ...vs 'punishing' the residential sector which pales in comparison for water use vs the ag industry.  Golf courses I can understand, but they're some sort of 'hybrid' between ag   residential use.....

It's intention is, imo, to make the masses 'think'... which only undermines the political base's constituents while at the same time lining their pockets with ag   industry funds before they're voted out of office    Lawns and golf courses take biggest hit in the state's first-ever mandatory statewide water reductions.

Get some cinder blocks. build something like [this](http://cdnpix.com/show/imgs/b44d4b854621cd417ce62f77a23f2c09.jpg)... no need to do it two-blocks-tall. one should suffice (half the price).  Then just increase the length as you can afford to.   You'll need to cover it with insulation to keep the worms   moisture in and to keep the rodents out.  you'll need to line it on the bottom with metal screen... again, to keep the worms in, moisture can drain (if need be) and the rodents   burrowers out.  You should be able to get into it for $100. worms included. Prob half that if you do it right.  If no money for *that*, you have bigger problems than composting you should be worrying about.  ...but, to not point out the obvious and offer advice instead... get some pallets. check craigslist or put up a post for some.  take 'em apart, build a box out of 'em, and just start piling the waste up until you *can* spare the $100 to build a vermiculture bed.

I got into a [similar discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Soil/comments/30j39w/remineralize_soil_to_grow_nutrient_dense_crops/cptw0k0?context=10000) Friday   yesterday over at /r/soil.  If the nutrients aren't there, they can't be mined. At the same time, if you're putting down a cover crop to help 'keep things there', other than [fixing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) [nitrogen](http://www.sumagrow.com), there's not a whole lot else they're going to do... *possibly* feed [PSBs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_solubilizing_bacteria) and a few other organisms to help 'free up' and 'make more bioavailable' other nutrients already in the soil.  Gotta add 'em back in.  Be it via compost ... or, better, compost mixed with trace minerals.   As stated in the /r/soil discussion, I'm a personal fan of Azomite   Sea Agri, Inc's mineral 'blends'.   Azomite, *itself*, is 'mined'.... so there's of course some degree of limit to the quantity of nutrients that that process will be able to provide. ....albeit, a pretty far-out one from my understanding. It's a pretty big deposit of trace minerals.  SeaAgri, Inc, on the other hand, uses 'waste' minerals 'filtered' as a byproduct from desal plants in the Carolinas.  ... clearly there's no limitation to nutrients in the oceans ... and with desalination only likely to become [more](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/feb/17/graphene-oxide-makes-perfect-sieve) [advanced](/r/graphene), cheaper, and more widespread in the future.... this certainly should provide *more* than enough nutrients for adding to the soil.  Get into better [waste](/r/waste) management practices... from storm water run off to sanitation waste, etc ... filtering then recycling nutrients for reapplication to the soils from wherest they came... ...well, all the more.  The thing that 'bugs' me about the 'we're running out of x,y,z' (water, nutrients, fertilizers, etc) is the idea that these things are, for the most part, elemental.  None of them 'go away', they just become less-easily accessible.  But, in the case of the 'kind of elements', Nitrogen, we're adding *more* of this to the atmosphere than existed in it before... ....fossil fuel mining, drilling, whatever moves fossilized N from inaccessible stores into the atmosphere. Diatotrophicly loaded biological fertilizers can go a long way towards fixing much of this nitrogen back into the soil, and in the N2 form that's readily bioavailable to the plants ... and, along with it, the anaerobic forms of the strains fix the C from the CO2 they pull into the soil as well.  SumaGrow had a conference-video a few years back whereby they reported something like a 60:40 ration of C:N fixed by their diatotrophs. ... whereby in lab conditions (kind of a key phrase there), the C   N they were fed, they fixed 2 parts carbon to every 1 part of Nitrogen they pulled in from the readily available atmosphere they were provided.  ...thus, not just bringing nitrogen into the soil, not just doing so in the readily available N2-form, but also fixing even *more* carbon into the soil...  not only changing the pH very little, but building   providing SOC to the medium.... plants, fungi, microbes, 'other soil biota', etc.  Water is just a matter of holding onto it better. Of course there are larger variables at play... directions of jetstreams (El Nino/La Nina), aquifer availability, etc ... but, other than freshwater running off into the oceans, it hasn't necessarily 'gone anywhere', it just needs to be brought back into freshwater form and made available again ... ala SeaAgri's desal plants.   Phosphorus is the one that'll prove to be the biggest problem moving forward as the trace quantities of this available as desal byproduct is much too low to produce what farms are currently used to, and with mines running lower every year... it will most likely present the [largest problem](http://www.one-tab.com/page/jzkrdGNXRx-no0O-vk2giA), but, again, with proper waste management   reintegration... as well moving to crop-types and growing environments that either require less phosphorus to begin with, or recapture it more efficiently for cycling back into the system... this should be less of a problem than feared (hopefully?) ... as well, many even say it's a myth to begin with.  Point is, I suppose, proper management combined with a progressive mindset that's embracing progressive approaches *should* make much of the resources scarcity feared as much of a non-issue as it needs to be. ...but, that won't stop the panicists from finding something to fear-pander about to justify their writing salaries.

I mean, if the structure of the soil doesn't allow for (easier) access to the nutrients within it then those nutrients may as well not be there.   ...within limits of course.  then again, to say that life is pretty well evolved at getting to the things it needs may be an understatement.  but, the nutrients still need to be there to begin with if they're *to* be accessed to begin with.    sometimes it takes structural changes in the soil to enable the plant roots and associated microbiota to mine the deeper layers for water and nutrients.  and a *need* to mine the deeper layers. if the nutrients are all at the top, there's not a whole lot of incentive for the plants *to* root deeper.   That's kind of what I was saying before, one of the problems with making nutrients so readily accessible in the top soil is that plants simply don't need to go deeper to get to them.  I've both read *and* experienced this myself.   but, working nutrients into the top soil ...and then letting them naturally work their way down into deeper layers through 'more natural forces'... is a lot easier than working the nutrients into the deeper layers by hand/machine.

Been around for something like 100 million years and are estimated to be geologically stable for another 250 million.  salt 'heals' itself when put under pressure.  the more pressure (ie, the more heat), the more it heals itself.

I like [Azomite](http://www.azomite.com) personally. [SeaAgri](http://www.seaagri.com) too.   ... though I have some soils that are a good mix of both and they seem to perform the best as well.  but you're exactly right on the 'rocks to suckers', 'sound like snake oil salesmen' and shipping costs! that stuff certainly isn't cheap!   I've actually talked to the ceo of SeaAgri for a few hours ... a few times actually. He's a really cool guy. In the case of him, there was nothing 'snake oily' about 'im.  I've talked with Azomite too, for bulk ordering larger quantities directly... they're a little 'colder' on the phone, but their approach is more.... ....'corporate-structured' I think than Sea Agri.  There are NDAs involved with both so there's a little bit of discretion needed in how I word this but...  well... 'most products' tend to be a *lot* cheaper when you buy in bulk directly from the source vs going through 'countless'-party (3rd party) retailers.   but, yeah, the mix of the two seems to be the best from both 'the numbers' as well actual performance.  Actually, and this makes perfect sense if I felt like typing it all out (which I don't and you probably already know) .. but, the plants actually tend to grow *smaller* in nutrient/mineral-rich soils... as well the individual crop *from* the plant (fruit, veggie, etc).... ....*but*, the turn around seems a lot faster and the overall *yield* is usually a lot larger...  obviously there's a varying reason for this (crop-type, soil conditions, etc) ... but, take tomatoes for example: the size of each tomato *isn't* usually this gigantic 'softball' but more like tennis balls, maybe even a bit *smaller* in fact... but, they're heavier and the plants tend to grow a *lot of 'em*!  pick a few and the next round seem to blow up really quickly!  I'm assuming that as the stuff gets rained down into deeper   deeper layers of the soil, the plants will need to grow deeper   wider roots to extract the less-dense nutrients/minerals and, as such, that should 'alter' things a bit.   but, one way or another, minerals are great but it's the biota that *really* breaks 'em down and make 'em bioavailable.  ... but, well, again, can't break down something *to* make it bioavailable if it isn't there in the first place   [If Jewelry Commercials Were Honest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giu23Ii3PAA)     but it only stops shockwaves (one of the few things Star Trek and other science fiction shields don't seem to stop)  awesome! so this is tech that's even *more* advanced than Star Trek!    the link didn't work but I agree with you ... that's why I'd like to see it based on an acreage level.  meaning: not how the 'quantity of registered farms' adds up, but how the farmed acreage of the country does....  of *course* there's going to be more-*smaller* farms than bigger ones...   but I'd imagine that if it was looked at the other way, though the acreage would likely be divided up amongst multiple individual businesses ... that the vast majority of the farmed land in the US *wouldn't* be family owned farms.    'meaningless' is really just the tip of the iceberg on a study like this.    Nutrients can only be made bioavailable my soil microbes if the nutrients are in the soil to begin with.  It's really a multi-pronged approach that's needed: 1) add minerals 2) add microbes to make those minerals bioavailable  but, soil can have all the microbes in the world added to it left   right but w/out the minerals being there to begin with, there won't *be* anything *to* make 'bioavailable'.

'large home *any*things' are probably not the best way to provide industrial scales of 'things'.   but, I've set fire to HUGE piles of 'waste' biomass .... and, with the help of the local fire department, we were able to control the fire to produce a huge quantity of biochar from it.  It certainly isn't the most efficient process for converting waste materials to biochar but... the fire department was *more* than glad to offer their services. When I called to notify them our intentions about a week before... to make sure everything we were planning met code and to ensure that what we were about to spend a half day setting up (moving around biomass) was within county codes (it was) ... the fire marshall all *but* 'begged' to be there for it.   when I explained the intention was to not *just* reduce the waste biomass (as is often done in that county... open fires) but also to attempt to maximize the production of biochar (and sending him a few articles on what biochar was) he was pumped! said his 'men' would benefit from practicing a controlled burn like that.  that it was even *more* challenging to *control* a burn than it was to simply put a fire out... *esp* where the intention was to make a specific product... and maximize it at that.  The entire department came out and participated and had firehoses coming in from *multiple* directions.  The pile itself was ~50ft across and at *least* 25ft tall (in a cone/pyramid shape).  I'd guess we got about 30% biochar by volume from that.   Haven't gotten around to make more from it, though the pile of waste biomass building up should *easily* double that.  the code reads: 100ft of a structure or major treeline.     when I called to make sure, saying we were wanting to do about 10 ~10ftx10ftx~8ft piles around an acre or so, but more than a few hundred feet away from anything of note... the fire marshall said (and I repeat verbatim): 'you could cover an entire *acre* under 10ft of bursh and light it on fire... as *long* as it's a minimum of 100ft from a major treeline or structure.'  again, by no means the most efficient way to do it, but considering we were just going to burn the waste anyway?  (we'd been given the heads up that we needed to do something with the pile of barely-composting material... as our 'composting excuse' wasn't holding up any more...)   long story short: we had a LOT of biochar and covered a pretty substantial-sized field with it ... that's also the low point of the area and where the *majority* of the fields drained to.  the field? it went from potentially the *least* productive and *most* hassle-filled one to the *most* productive and *least* problematic one.  ...albeit, it took a bit for the char to 'age'.   there's more than one way to skin a cat :)   biochar certainly isn't *free*! have you checked prices lately??   x-post: /r/soil   original paper: [Experimental proof of nonlocal wavefunction collapse for a single particle using homodyne measurements](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150324/ncomms7665/full/ncomms7665.html)   x-post: /r/soil   x-post: /r/materials    the supply of nitrogen fertilizer would be limited by what is fixed by legumes and a few other finite sources  or [diazotrophs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph)   HA!!! the fucking look on the interviewer's face when he asks if he wants to drink some!!!

This is definitely an example of trite, petty disrespect... by *both* countries.  The US, under Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Carter, Ford, even Nixon or LBJ before them should have come public about this *much* sooner. *Clearly* the Likud party and US presidential relations have a long history with one another...  and, one another not necessarily seeing eye-to-eye as to how each of their leaders should address the other's (relative) 'congressional bodies'.   It's most unfortunate the circumstances by which this information came to be declassified... but it should have been declassified *much* earlier. Possibly even *before* the '87 date *this* specific report was put together.   and he had his feelings hurt by Bibi  possibly. Obama's feelings aren't something I've ever cared to pay too much attention to, nor been all that concerned about either way.  But, 'Bibi' should have been more respectful and should have gone through more traditional and 'politically acceptable' paths. Just as Obama should if he chooses to speak directly to Israel's parliament.  ...as well, just like he should have before 'playing his part' in the declassification of this report.  Hopefully both parties can be more respectful during future 'revelations'   'declassifications'. ...but, I, personally, would prefer to see continued declassifications *regardless* of 'who's feelings are hurt' by it.   and the Jews must pay  this is just a stupid statement. and I'm only acknowledging it *to* disregard it *as* stupidity, bigotry, and unnecessary.    Fucks sake, the Admin said there would be consequences if Bibi accepted...  yes, they did. and note should have been taken. Regardless, this report, and the many others like it that I'd imagine exist, are *long* overdue coming public.  Again, the circumstances are petty, but at least the information is *finally* becoming public after *decades* since its creation.   They tried to sway the election in Israel  I'd imagine that *most* countries attempt to influence the elections of foreign governments in which they're heavily invested. the US to Israel, US to UK, ...US to Venezuela, Japan to China, even Israel to the US.  Assuming they *don't* is naive at best.   and now they are releasing State secrets.  State secrets that are *decades* overdue being released.  again, only the timing   form of it is unfortunate.   That's what I like in a leader... Petty, butthurt, reactionary decisions  to each their own.  I would have much prefered that *both* countries took a proactive approach towards making this information public a *long* time ago.  like Gandhi said: 'Non-violence, which is the quality of the hear, cannot come by an appeal to the brain.'  or, in this case, 'Obama's butthurt   pettiness'.   But, again, however it came about, this information is decades overdue entering the public's eye.   I'll add to that even...  Though I'm commending the US for *finally.* ***beginning*** to become more public about this, I'm also *condemning* ***them*** for having taken so long to do so. as well... for doing so under current political situations.  The US, itself, has been *long* overdue in becoming public about its *own* involvement in the situation.  *Clearly* the US has *over* a half-century history of deploying *its* nuclear armaments *all* over the world. ..and signing agreements with those countries in which it's done so.  For strategic purposes, many of these have been understandably kept secret... but, as such, it has *not* been kept secret that 1) the US does so nor 2) the obvious fact that the US is a nuclear armed state.  I'm not condoning *or* condemning Israel's nuclear weapons programs, nor am I saying that Israel *shouldn't* have nuclear weapons (nor that Israel *should* either) ... I'm maintaining the posture that the global community has a 'right' to know which countries do possess them.   ...or, at least, that a country possessing them has an obligation, a duty, a sense of 'personal' obligation in making the global community aware that they do.  ....after a 'given' period of time of course. ...but, 30 years is *more* than enough time for that, let alone 50+.  There are 'things'... 'subjects' if you will where 'ambiguity' and 'omission' is understood, but *not* in the case of WMDs, and *certainly* not after a period of decades.  Israel sits at the table of the global community, and holds the global community to the rules of that table, it's only 'fair' that they hold themselves up to those standards as well.  ....again, *esp* where it concerns WMDs, and ***especially*** where those WMDs are nuclear weapons.    Are you seriously commending them for having signed a treaty that they are breaking.  I'm commending them for having signed a treaty. I'm *not*, however commending them for breaking it. ....*but*, at *least* they've signed it and, thus, there's a point of reference to hold them accountable for their actions, and to hold them accountable for in relation *to* what they've agreed with.  Separately.....   while condemning Israel for staying honest, but not completely forthcoming?  Yes. I am condemning Israel for not being completely forthcoming.  It would be one thing if this were still, say, 1965 when the Eshkol-Corner memorandum was signed by the US   Israel. That was 50 years ago. An entire half-century.  Kind of a lot has happened in regional   global politics since then. Regardless, it's *still* **more** than enough time for Israel to have taken steps on its *own* to go public about it. It (clearly) hasn't. Regardless, there are three sides to that coin, with only *one* of them being Israel. The other (largest) side being the US. and the flat edge in between them being an unspoken obligation to the global community.   As such, Israel hasn't come public, but, the US (finally) has. Now, for whatever reasons... be it the '80's and under the [Republican-Reagan administration](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2015/0303/Echoes-of-Obama-Netanyahu-tussle-in-Reagan-Begin-showdown-of-1981) or 2015 under the Democrat-Obama administration... or the 'medley' of dual-party administrations in between them, (as stated in OP, the 386-page declassified report was 'published' in 1987, like Obama, in the second-to-last year of the dual-term Reagan administration.   That was nearly 30 years ago.   At this point, I think it's been *more* than enough time... since even *that* report was first published, let *alone* since nearly 25 years prior... that not *just* the US   Israeli people's be made aware of US-Israeli nuclear cooperation, but the global community at large .... *esp* with what's going on with Iran.  Israel's *not* having been forthcoming, after 3-5 *decades* is, at this point, a bit beyond 'staying honest' to their policy of 'nuclear ambiguity'.  *Esp* when Iran *has* come public about *its* nuclear programs. ...and, not just public, but has signed the NPT *over* a decade ago.   ....regardless of whether they're abiding to it or not, that is a separate issue... one to which they can be held accountable *by* their having signed the treaty.  Do you really think that 'not forthcoming' and 'ambiguity' are respectful   responsible policies when it concerns nuclear weapons in ai hot bed part of the world riddled not just with multiple wars (during that time) but also attacks specific *to* nuclear facilities within said region?     More so, what I am *absolutely* condemning is the *hypocrisy* Israel has shown, and, I'll really let the mass-bulk of Israel off the hook and more specifically single out the Likud party ...and, even more so, Netanyahu specifically... for having been so loudly vocal   public about their/his push towards Iran's possible 'shadiness' over its nuclear program.... while maintaining a position of complete ambiguity over the nuclear weapons that he, himself, has the capability of deploying.  It's ridiculous. ...and, instead of maintaining a posture and running drills over invading a foreign country, bombing its facilities, and doing so in a non-globally respectful fashion... that's as 'rogue' (if no more so) than Iran advancing its nuclear technologies, sciences, and capabilities. ...*esp* when there's very clearly   very publicly already a global effort in effect *towards* coming to a solution to this ...'situation'.  as best I can say it, Israel should put its grievances forth in a more respectful and traditional fashion than stepping out of line... ....or else find themselves under the *same* scrutiny that they are way-to-vocally advocating that Iran be put through.   If they were *equally* as vocal about N.Korea? India? Pakistan?  all who have developed, tested, and most likely *deployed* nuclear weapons, that'd be one thing... but, no. and, as such, the very selfishness that has been shown towards their singling out of Iran is no different than the myopic idiocy that Iran has shown towards singling out Israel.   As a member of the 'global community', I'm of the opinion that Israel's *lack* of objectivity, combined with their methods   approaches up to this point, should mean that, at this point (five *decades* after purportedly having attained/developed nuclear weapons), they be held up to, or '*subjected' to* the same standards that they feel *other* members of the global community have been.. ..esp where those members have at *least* been public about the existence of a program ...and, as such, have not only agreed to, but *have* signed a treaty showing their acknowledgement of this... over a decade ago.    Must be a coincidence  no, probably not *just* one, but the information being declassified was *still* long overdue. as is a lot more information I'm sure.  regardless of whether or not it was in response to this, there are still multiple parties involved, not *just* the president.     This was long overdue.  This was also released back in Feb...*before* Netanyahu spoke to congress.  The declassification process involves a few more people than *just*the president    Those are "only" nuclear capable aircraft.  Oh, it's clearly 'for show' ... but, what's that line from that movie: 'you don't put on a condom unless you're ready to use it'  - 'Gary Busey' character, I *think*  (Under Seige??)   If I were flying around nuclear-capable aircraft, I'd prob throw on a nuke or two just in *case* someone got the wrong idea and decided to start a war over it... ....but, then, the entire thing is a spectacle. Who really knows how 'real' any of this is.    I would argue Obama's habit of blowing people up with unmanned drones also makes the Nobel prize a pretty big joke  yeah, dude's definitely drone-happy. ...or was. but, then, if I had an army of drones at my disposal, I'd fly the hell out of 'em too.  ...though, I'd probably back off on the 'blowing people up' bit. not really my idea of a great way to spend a Thursday afternoon. to each their own though, I suppose?   Just got behind on the news/emails  I'm working my way towards catching up with the more soil-focused stuff :)   /r/nanomedicine   x-post: /r/biochar  x-post: /r/soil    Iran can sign whatever the fuck it wants  but they signed it, right?   it doesn't change the fact that Iran is still a religious dictatorship  technically it's theocratic republic.  and, in my opinion, religion and government should be as separate as possible. that goes for secular democracies as well. Religious symbols shouldn't be on 'state' flags. period. but, again, just an opinion.   who have repeatedly called for Israel's destruction  yeah, their idiots. I'm not defending them. I'm simply stating that they've at least signed the NPT while also holding the position that they *don't* have nuclear weapons. *You* are saying that Israel has been a nuclear armed state for 40+ years... isn't that plenty of time for them to step up voluntarily and sign the NPT?    and make threats almost on a weekly basis  India   Pakistan do their cute little ceremonial [border closing ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC9NeJh1NhI) every night ... ...without fail apparently. (quoting the opening line of the link).  India   Pakistan are also two of the four not recognized as nuclear weapons states according to the NPT. N.Korea   Israel being the other two. And all *three* of them have publicly recognized their nuclear weapons programs ... if by no other means than having (publicly) tested their nuclear.  Sure nuclear testing is a detestable practice, and one that Israel *hasn't* (publicly) done, but, well, as you state, they have nukes, and have had them for 4+ decades. I'd imagine somewhere during that time there was some testing done?  at that, congrats, Israel is on a list with Pakistan, India, and N.Korea when it comes to their nuclear programs. Iran? again, public about their program. ... at least purportedly while also under investigation.  the point of the 'threats' is that a hostile and defensive posture is maintained by *various* states around the world. idiotically so too, imo.  I'm not condoning Iranian actions towards spewing   spreading hate. The US has various people of power, from even our own former VP calling for bombing Iran, as well a former presidential candidate well known for his 'bomb bomb bomb Iran' dity.   There's a difference between 'preparedness' and hate spewing.  but, just because some idiots are spewing hate doesn't change the fact that Israel shouldn't sign the NPT and become more public about its nuclear programs.   It has always been an open secret(Obligatory dumbspeak: EVERYONE KNOWS)  what? that Israel has maintained an irresponsible posture and civil disservice of *not* being public about their nuclear weapons? as a citizen, I would certainly want to know if my government has weapons of mass destruction. It drastically alters the response-type that hostiles may take.   it seems you don't actually understand the implications of the US publicly admitting this and how it affects their foreign policy?  first, *who's* foreign policy? Israel? The US? Both?   No, I have a pretty good understanding of it actually. I've thought and read about it for a few decades now. ... hence why I'm glad that the US has finally taken the responsible step of declassifying the documents and making them public.   but, at that, just incase I'm missing something, why don't you fill me on on what *you* think the implications of this are... again, just in case the feebleness of my mind in which you imply is, again, missing something or incapable of pondering the possibilities.   Iran's Ayatollah also said 'Death to America' a mere two weeks ago.  ha! yeah! that was funny! he's been doing that for a while now. so have his predecessors. Always brings a nice kneeslap when I hear/read them doing that.  I'd like to see Iran attack the US openly. Their defense systems and potential nuclear/weapons capabilities *pale* in comparison to much larger countries that the US has gone eye-to-eye with in the past, present, and probably the future.  Saber rattling is what it is. but, again, this changes absolutely *nothing* in terms of Israel not being public about its nuclear programs.   Oh, and let's not forget Iran's longstanding history of denying access to inspectors in their facilities(BUT HEY, peaceful purposes!).  and they've been sanctioned over this and the necessary steps have been taken by *various* governments in accordance with this.  'peaceful purposes' or not, again, Iran's nuclear programs have *nothing* to do with Israel *not* having been public about theirs. Still not getting it.   People like you make me doubt just how sane people are in other countries  I've traveled the world. many times, many countries. spanning decades. and having returned to many of the countries I've traveled to and seen development   growth (in both directions... good *and* 'bad') in the average sentiment of their peoples. There are both sane and 'crazy' people all over.    you're essentially giving a loaded gun to a sociopath and expecting him to use it to herd cattle.  no, that'd most likely've been the US officials in the mid-'60's that gave that 'loaded gun' to someone... in the case of LBJ's admin purportedly giving Israel a nuke , or at least the US gov't helping Israel develop one of its own.  as far as 'giving a loaded gun to a sociopath'... if it was Iran you were referring to as the sociopath, and the US giving them a nuke? no. no. they seem to be developing that tech on their own quite well.  albeit, Ike did help them along.   but, at that, what is this 'loaded gun'? Iran and a nuke? or the US declassifying this document? Is this document the 'loaded gun'?  If it is, I *hope* it spurs things along towards a nuclear-free world.   You mean the Osirak attack which has been universally praised by the western world   yes, the Osirak attack was what I was referring to. granted, I didn't condone *or* condemn it, I just stated 'that israel attacked iraq' .... and positioned itself to attack Iran in much the same way.   again, I didn't condone *or* condemn it. I was just stating that they had. preemptive strikes aren't exactly acts of peace, are they?  granted, you're right, they showed the self control to not nuke them... but, then, that'd mean going public about their nuclear programs, wouldn't it?   they've been flying (purportedly) nuclear armed aircraft all over the place of late...   for example, [just yesterday](http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/swedish-military-reports-russian-aircraft-baltic-sea-29864492) it was announced activity over the Baltic. they buzzed N.America off the coast of Alaska a month or so ago... Britain last month? two?  the Crimea, etc.  meaning: sure there may've been *some* disarmament ... but the arsenals are still very well stocked and, as of late anyway, been actively deployed.   it's by no means limited the threat of nuclear war, and was almost entirely a 'cover' for Obama's embarrassing act of prematurely accepting the Nobel *before* having even done it.  The 'classier' and 'more respectful' thing to've done would've been, if nothing else, to have politely put acceptance on hold until at *least* the deal with Russia was made ... and, even then I highly doubt it was what the Nobel community was thinking when they first offered it (way too over-enthusiastically and prematurely at that).  The Nobel community was as much at fault as Obama, more so even imo. But, that Obama accepted it more than clearly showed his ego's inflatedness.... again, imo.    ...after the fact, and I seriously don't think it was on the scale the Nobel was originally intended  Also, Russia's nuclear activity of late would imply that it did very little towards the way of a more-complete disarmament   I didn't say it had.   What I *did* say was that at least Iran has signed the NPT... while *also* maintaining the position that it *doesn't* have nuclear weapons.  By your statement, you imply that Israel not only *does* have nuclear weapons, but has had them for *40 plus years*.  You don't think that a government that has nuclear weapons has an obligation to let both its peoples *and* the world know that it has them? ...and not just 'has them' but has *had* them? ... for 40+ years?  on your sentiments of my going to /r/worldnews... why not both?   This is big news, in my opinion. and hopefully news that spurs a change in not just Israeli nuclear policy, but nuclear policy all over the world. *Clearly* the world is long overdue coming together to reorganize the way it approaches nuclear armaments. I, for one, am of the opinion that nuclear weapons need not exist  in the control of individual countries... if at all.   The serve as an excellent deterrent, yes. but so do lots of other weapons systems. They've only (publicly) actively been used in warfare twice, with catastrophic effects ...and, despite [#8's](http://www.cracked.com/photoplasty_507_20-mind-blowing-then-vs.-now-comparisons_p2) exemplification of the resiliance of humanity, no one should have to endure such acts again.   Iran at least states that its refinement of nuclear materials are for the peaceful purposes they   Ike had agreed they would be used for... but, if this report is true (and I have no reason to think that it isn't), Israel has been refining nuclear material for both energy *and* weapons purposes.   That Israel has attacked Iraq, done test runs and attempts to attack Iran, as well maintained a very public policy of holding Iran up to standards that Israel's government itself doesn't feel that it should have to is hypocrisy of the *most* dangerous nature.    About. Damn. Time.  Israel's hypocrisy on its nuclear programs is decades overdue in revalation.  Israel's political establishment has attacked Iran for not holding up to its requirements as set out by Iran's signing of the NPT while Israel *itself* hasn't even signed it despite 'countless' speculation over the past decades of Israel having nuclear weapons of its own...   What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  Now if only this can lead to ALL countries condemning and dismantling their nuclear armaments....like that which Obama won (*and* *accepted*) a Nobel for nearly a decade ago and has *yet* to do anything about.  No Nukes! Atoms For Peace!    I'm going out on a limb by assuming that you *didn't* watch the video?   highly doubt this will go anywhere anytime soon given the fact that oil prices are set to stay low until the next war   I'm sure the sails can be retracted and the masts lowered.   The problem I've read about going back to sails *isn't* the ports, it's the room taken up on the deck. Personally I see this as being something relatively negligible but apparently it isn't relative to the energy savings.  Those [kite powered cargo ship companies](http://www.gizmag.com/cargill-ship-will-be-largest-ever-to-utilize-kite-power/18005/) put out a lot of cost for this back in their pr marketing days.  Still don't really understand what happened with that... it seemed like a good idea and integratable into current ship designs via a retrofit ... vs requiring a redesign of ships altogether.    by weight  biochar is better measured volumetrically vs weight. different chars have different densities/porosities... thus, different weights. it's more a 'volume thing' than a 'weight thing'.    and results only popped up at the 2 and 4% rates, vs the 0 rate.  again, the weight/volume dynamic is more '[where it's at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPfmNxKLDG4)'  ...and, again, at *that* it just depends on what your application is.   if it's, say, a potted plant or relatively shallow garden or raised bed, upwards of 10% by volume makes more sense. if it's a large acreage field... better to let it build up in the soil over multiple seasons/years than at once.  just relative to what you're growing, what your intentions are, cost, size, area. lots of variables to take into consideration.   the pelletized BC sounds pretty cool  I'm torn on it personally. though it addresses your sentiments towards managing application (w/out it blowing away, for example), I personally am not a 'fan' of pelletized biochar. I think it's an unnecessary step and I, personally, prefer biochar that's a good mix of size   shape. The pelletized stuff ends up just granularizing or powdering ... granted, ultimately all of it will break down into a powder... but, I think a good mix (from, say, 'hockey puck size' at the *extreme* largest to 'sugar cube size' on down is better.   and *all* of it aged, of course ... unless you're going for more of an activated carbon use for the char... ie, remediation approach... then you'd *want* it 'raw' to pull in the 'things' you *don't* want active in the soil .... adding other amendments over time. but, again, this all brings it over more to a specific application and, thus, a 'consulting' type approach towards project-intentions.   do you have a link  here's [*one*](http://blueskybiochar.com/DISCOVER_BIOCHAR.html) ...   there's another buried in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iW-68fKVU0 feature=share) somewhere. Cool Planet is more or less 'just getting started' on a commercial scale. but, though 'biochar is now', biochar is *really* more 2020+ as far as an industry. the IBI, IBI members/community, and just the industry in general... from US to others are more pushing for a 2020-and-beyond deployment of biochar. it's 'still working out the understanding' ... and, will continue to do so. sure there are products now, and people selling it now, but... again, infancy. *may*be 'toddler' but... personally? I think it's still in the crawling phase. standing up a little but not really walking. *most* definitely still picking at its butthole   belly button and trying to discern the differences between the two, either way.    It's pretty piss poor on its own  ...unless you're going for the specific application of remediation... then you *want* it on its own. but, otherwise, 'on its own' it's a 'momentary thief' that can take *years* to balance out. until then, throwing the soil into havoc   disarray.    microbes and nitrifying bacteria  even loading biochar with a product like SumaGrow has its limits. I mean, sure it loads the char with diazatrophs   PSBs which can help but... with nothing for them to 'eat' (nutrient-wise) in the char... it's more an exercise in futility. The char *really* needs to be pre-loaded before application.  at *least* with nutrients if not microbes as well. again, composting it is the best. though, there are other ways, composting is the best.   preloading (chemical) fertilizers seems to help... initially, but, the plant has to go in and get it... (which it will) or the stuff just... it needs minerals (rockdust, azomite, SeaAgri, etc... or just compost) and microbes. otherwise, again, negative results and a long time waiting.   The problem is there hasn't been any 10-20 year studies  again, the industry's picking its butt with it's spoon still. a lot of that will just take a while. i mean, you can't do a '25 year study' until 25 years have passed. ~2006? was when it was 'discovered' .. or at least was 'first publicly announced'?  we're not even a decade in, and the first few years were fetal, imo.    Age the char in compost for ~3 months, load it with nutrients, minerals, compost teas (even on an industrial scale) and create as homogenous a mixture as you get with, say, composted manure or just compost in general... .... then apply. the results will still take 'a season' to readjust. for the fungi, bacteria, etc to intermix with the soil the right way. for the whole area to become 'homogenous' in   of itself.... but, from there it's like hardened soil. i mean, sure you can kill off everything with chemical pesticides, fertilizers, etc but... the char isn't going anywhere.   I posted a link to a study done a few years back (to /r/biochar) that dealt with hydrochloric acid   biochar in super agitated speed trial... with a pH *well* below anything you'd find (naturally) in the soil... and under 'agitation' that you'd unlikely find even under aggressive tilling... and the biochar broke down very little.  same was tested with ridiculously high pHs ... once it's in there it's in there. and, once it's in there it creates a 'bounce back point' such that once the b.s. is stopped, the 'growth' of the soil returns.     It's kinda like those geological surveys that show a layer of ash all around the world from where vesuvius erupted, or some other volcano or super volcano.  get the biochar in the ground and the geological layering of it will remain there. burn back the soil that's built from it.... even atop it... and, still, underneath will be this layer of biochar from which things can return.   it's terraforming   geoengineering -capable on a mega scale. planet changing really if we wanted to take it *that* far.   but, go with the atmospheric carbon levels. say carbon is brought down from 400ppm to 250ppm (ie ~1850/pre-industrial rev). and, it's done with biochar... there wouldn't be enough biochar to turn the world's current agricultural lands into a 10% by volume (in the top soil) level. (yes, the math has been done... somewhere way back when I ran across it, and it was pretty accurate seeming).  Could theoretically imagine going to the point of literally mining coal, n.gas, etc just to *release* carbon into the atmosphere to pull it out via biomass to make biochar with...  it'd take a *lot* of char to make a real dent. but, at the same time, it doesn't take that much to start it out. then it starts building on itself.   I just don't think it's very good as a quick amendment, or on its own  it isn't... not on its own anyway. it *can* be a 'quick amendment' that's beneficial once it's blended, treated, and aged though.  then it's great. so are a lot of other things.... but, those other 'things' mixed with biochar (compost, compost tea, fertilizers, rock dusts   such, specific microbial strains, etc) makes for a potentially 'quick amendment' ... it's a part of a process, not some 'throw this on' and watch your ladybugs return or your bees sing   dance in flight like in A Bug's Life or something.  A farmer isn't going to buy   throw on biochar and expect to immediately get an ROI on it. nor would they a tractor, per se.  at least where they already owned a tractor that worked the same fields/area. It's a long term investment. but, so are the shrubs, trees, and other landscapings in my yard... i planted them when the house was built. they're still growing nicely. i fuck with them very little.  ...and, I *have* to fuck with them very little specifically because biochar is intermixed in the soil and, as such, they can tolerate stress well. I really have no desire to go out there and have to nurse my yard on a regular basis. nor do farmers. they have other operations they'd like to run. biochar saves them time, energy, labor costs, inputs, etc.  Farmers aren't generally the fastest changing people. some are, obviously, others not. but, most of the farms I know have been around for much longer than I have been. most of the land I know that's farmed has *been* farmed for, again, longer than I've been around .. and, presumably, will be so long after I'm gone (or developed into real estate... or blown up by Iranian   N.Korean nukes of the propaganda is to be believed).   One thing I dislike, though, is the comparison of current BC practices to terra preta  b.c. in its current incarnation *isn't* terra preta. nor do i think going to a terra preta soil-type is necessarily the best. Science has moved forward *quite* a bit since whenever those soils were made. I'd much rather control the char, how its made, what its made from, etc... and then control what it's loaded with...   i don't know. maybe i've just built too many computers or subs (at subway) to want a cookie cutter model like that. Not to knock it, and not to say that, say, Soil Reef's or [Harvest's](http://www.lowes.com/pd_459653-79138-NFCOMP1H_0__?productId=4573226) pre-made product is bad, but I'd prefer to buy raw char (of a higher quality), then treat it with what I want to treat it with... *then* apply it. ... controlling it along the way. then, I'm a bit of a control freak so... to each their own?  The stuff we're capable of making today is capable of *much* stronger C=C bonds than the stuff open pit burning could do in the Amazon 500 years ago. or even now. Not to knock that approach, but 1500F in a highly pressurized steel container that has countless sensors and regulation points.. ... well, I'm gonna imagine that some of the char that's being made today will be around a VERY long time to come... *as* char. not just 'stable carbon'.  but, I'm with you on the 'nit pick'.   afterall, again, I'm a bit of a control freak when it comes to certain things :)  but, overall, think of biochar as a 'newly (re)discovered' 'material'. *like* rock dust, *like* gypsum, *like* compost/manure, etc... it's another 'ingredient' with which to organize the landscape... cultivating it into something we want.      The benefits of char only seem to be present and significant at high rates  I've actually found from both personal and readings that 'less is more' by   large. That negative results are more often recorded than positive ones (vs control) when applied 25% by volume.   but that smaller amounts... added continually over years... is the way to go. 5-10% year after year.   Cool Planets pelletizes some of their products specifically for the fact that the dust blows around.  but once mixed with water and blended into the soil the pellets break up and the char 'spreads around'.  Mixing it with manure before applying with a manure spreader is a pretty common type of application.    I've personally used power seeders to 'inject' it into lawns.   The rate of 10-40t/ha is a really high number, imo. 5 metric tonnes per hectare is a lot more realistic. ...then, adding more every year or few years to build it into the soil layers.   but, again, blending it with manure, compost, etc makes a lot more sense than the ridiculously naive idea of adding raw biochar to the soil and *not* expecting negative results.  the field/industry is still in its near-infancy. barely even a toddler if one yet. and once it does come around as a major industrial product (which is all but inevitable, imo), it will be a few select companies providing it. most that seem to understand this seem to be doing pretty well for themselves. it isn't going anywhere. it's 'new'. there's no real rush.  I see it as like a tractor or something: the first ones sucked. most laughed. it took decades+ to get a good model ... and even more advancements have been made in the *last* decade than the century that came before it. Biochar will really be no different.  ... obvious necessary adjustments being taken into consideration for the analogy as tractors   biochar are clearly totally different things.   but, cost of water, fertilizer, land, etc will all but necessitate it be incorporated in the future (imo). and, at that, [the future starts slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwudqTCkBis).  at that, that's a good thing, imo. I'd rather add 5% a year every year than 25% once every 5 (years). and, at *that*, I'd rather age the 5% in compost or manure and pre-treat it with *other* amendments for a month or three (minimum) before adding it at *that*.  build it up within the soil layers over years to decades.  cheaper, the soil takes less of an initial 'hit', and the layering effect would start to build up over time such that after years-to-decades it starts to look like [this](http://fingerlakesbiochar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/terra-preta-soils.jpg) vs ... vs 'something else'.  edit: don't read into that song any. the title just matched the words. ..and i like the song. but, other than the title, no applicability.     We live in a condo  that's a *lot* of material to take in on a daily basis for a condo! you sure you won't be getting in over your head??   why would you need *that* much material?? you going commercial with the operation??    Your problem is going to be finding a suitable source of brown material to go with the huge amount of green you have.   tree crews. Find   make friends with a tree crew in your area. they'll give you more wood chips   shreds than you'll know what to do with. trust me. you'll have plenty of C to balance out the N   [vermiculture](/r/vermiculture) and/or [black soldier fly](/r/blacksoldierfly).  or just compost them.    Kingsley's and esp Morris Deli   Liquors (across from Applebees on t.ville rd) are both infinitely better.   If you don't subscribe to every. single. thing. the Likud party is pushing on any given day then you're clearly antihuman. ...let alone antisemitic.     x-post: /r/waste  [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/2zwm78/the_city_of_boulder_is_teaming_up_with_a_local/)    I think jumping on the divestment bandwagon is nothing more than a feel-good act.  how're your future on oil holding up? much of trading *is* following trends.  I'm not disagreeing with your general sentiment that this is more PR b.s. than something that will have a real effect on the industry at large.... but, people selling shares of something tends to drop the value of that something who's shares are being sold.  I've done more than my fair share of trading ... some of it based on logic, some of it based purely on watching the herd and timing my investment-moves accordingly: trading *is* herd mentality.   Not that this will really make a dent in share prices but.... raising even greater awareness to it, if nothing else, seems like it could help bolster education elsewhere?  looking at their energy use can decrease their energy requirements... but they can also offset their footprint by building onsite energy facilities or buying offsets from renewable projects.

Find a tree company truck and call them. Ask 'em if they'll let you have some of their chips. They won't protest.  Just try to shoot for 'chips' and not 'shreds'. They tend to use different 'blades' based on the age of what they're 'chipping'. Newer branches get shredded, older parts of the tree get chipped. Both will work, but chips seem to work *better* as mulch    Is there a term for that I can research.  not that *I'm* aware of ... but definitely doesn't mean one doesn't exist   Is there a more specific consensus in the bio-char community?  no. but.... 'those in the know' seem to have a pretty good understanding.. ...and, as such, are building/designing their products around it.. ..either directly manufacturing the 'char that way, or compensating on the backend where their equipment   feedstocks aren't capable of producing it that way   I'd imagine the increased microbiota in the soil are playing their part too?   /r/graphene   Pretty sure it's *already* a thing in Russia... from what I gather (and have seen personally), most Russian households have gardens to some capacity or another. ...and, most that I saw had pretty good sized ones at that.     But how can a farmer be certain it's a high quality product?  the IBI has quality standards? From last I checked they actually have a pretty liberal standard for what's considered biochar. There was actually a lot of fuss amongst biochar manufacturers *when* IBI was creating the standards (if memory serves) relative to the fact that they were setting the bar so *low* for how it was standardized.... ...or for what was necessary to receive an IBI label.   I'm not a farmer  even gardening or houseplants would benefit from a higher quality char.  at that, there're really only a few manufacturers of biochar out there selling retail to begin with.... some are better than others, imo, but of the ones that're out there, they're *all* quality-enough from my research on them to *not* make any of that a problem.  On the heavy metals   PCBs... biochar would bind onto these... be it added from the biochar itself, or to the ones already in the soil.  It's *one* of the many benefits / points-of-adding biochar to *begin* with: it's binding to heavy metals and other 'toxins' in the soil... ...in such that the plants, fungi, etc can 'choose' what they want vs having it more-directly 'forced' onto them.  The *real* issue, imo, *isn't* an IBI labeling, but is more production temperatures.   Check out the Rice U study linked to in the sidebar.  the increased temperatures not only produce a more porous biochar, but also a more 'activated' one. ...as well stronger c-c bonds, in such that the biochar is likely to last *much* longer before breaking down.  The higher activation will make it all the more 'attractive' *to* toxins in the soil... and the higher porosity that (usually) coincides with this means that the 'char will have all the more places to store these unwanteds.    I'm with ya on the IBI certification being a good idea... but anyone producing it at such high temperatures is using pretty complex   expensive machinery to begin with... ...the IBI certification costs would be minimal by comparison.     and you'd have to dig them out anyway!  or pressure wash 'em off with hot water :)   an IBI certification definitely seems to [provide that warm fuzzy feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5dpBpaFiMo) that helps you sleep better at night and pays homage to the IBI ... but I'm not sure it's necessary for a high quality product?   I've always wanted a snowmobile! But, still, when your entire front door (and rest of the city) is buried under multiple *feet* of snow in such that you can't even make it to your mailbox, how beneficial is a snowmobile really gonna be? Let a*lone* an ev? :P  I just had the mental image of an electric snowmobile pulling a trailer filled with either batteries or a generator for extra power :)    I suppose the cheaper cars would only be used for commuting  maybe? then again, I see plenty of Corollas on the interstate. No reason to think that people who invest their money elsewhere don't also like road trips?     I'm just not sure that battery swapping stations like Tesla's building with its charging stations would really be geared towards 'cheaper cars'.  It seems more like a service those willing to pay for it would be willing to use??  ... I mean, Tesla's definitely aren't what I think most would consider 'cheap'. It'd also limit design-types to... ....well, then again, Tesla/Musk *did* open up their patents? Who *knows* who'll start utilizing them or *what* kind of standards will be created in the future?  but, at the same time, just getting charging stations in seems costly enough for the time being, let alone throwing in swappable batteries on top of that.. ...as well, the designs aren't even out there with the current models so... whether or not it'd even be backwards compatible is yet to be seen.  who knows what the future'll bring?   Boston getting slammed  I'm not sure *any*where is really prepared for that level of snow... and letting social norms to continue.  I mean, multiple *feet* of snow seems like it'd shutdown a city like Stockholm or Moscow as much as Boston or NYC. ...obviously if a city like Miami got that much snow, we'd have more to worry about than batteries, either way :)   hope you enjoy 'em :)   the speakers on my M8 have *never* bothered me. in fact, I *prefer* the speaker on the front. would mind there being one on the *back too* ... for that matter.  the extra length it makes my M8 over my G3 has never. not once. ever. bothered me. honestly, didn't even notice it on this level (the extra space/room it takes up) until i read your comment and help them both up to each other.   doesn't it make sense that she sound would be more preferred coming *at* you than away from you??   again, it makes a huge difference while using the device.. ... sure there's the 'awkwardness' of the phone's screen needing to face up when i put it on a table lest the speakers be covered up ... ...vs that nice great feeling of the screen facing down and almost 'suctioned' to the table/desk/whatever ... but, that's just kinda anal and something one gets over pretty quickly??   I mean, sure I'd prefer a back speaker as well.... esp if i put my phone on my nightstand screen/speaker-down and am using it for an alarm clock, but the speakers on the M8 are so much better than the G3 that even when I use *it* as the alarm clock *over* my G3 it actually seems to do a better job waking me up.  I don't know. to each their own? but it's a non-point from my usually overly-anal perspective ... ...a non point having them on the front from a negative. a *major* point *not* having them on the front from a 'looking-for-positives' perspective. the G3's speaker, or lack-of-speaker-quality is a major detraction from it over the M8. almost as bad if not worse than HTC's decision to use the ultrapixel camera over the G3's obviously *far* superior camera.    suppose that last one just depends on where your priority is: speaker/music/videos or photographic purposes. i'm more the prior than the latter. both being awesome would obviously be preferred :)    it seems the world is moving forward faster than I thought  but, not fast enough... and after *way* too many delays and wrong turns... imo.     there's a lot of reading i need to do now  let me know if you find anything interesting. I'm clearly interested in it and obv have no problems chatting about it :)    I guess I'm worrying about it too much haha  yeah. that's my guess. I mean, I can't say it's not an issue... esp for more-northern climates but... batteries are warm, and, hot water is hot... snow, ice, slush, whatever doesn't really stand a chance.   also, who really cares if the random can't swap out their batteries? I mean, none of that stops them from being able to plug in?  and, if the snow's that bad... they prob have bigger issues than a battery swap :)    I feel is forgotten as the vast majority of EV innovation is happening in California where the weather is beautiful  yeah, but, these things are being shipped all over the US, and if you've seen the weather lately, Boston's been slammed,.. and there're Tesla's there.... and other so... besides, I'd imagine a lot of the people that live in Cali and are working on these things have lived elsewhere as well .... I don't know. i'll keep my eyes out for it over at /r/teslamotors but, I've followed that sub for about/over? a year now and have *no* recollection of ever reading anything about it.  other ev's? ie, smaller cheaper ones? well, again, we're talking about a niche-enough thing here. swapping out batteries is really only necessary when in a rush. ...road trips seem to add to that just so peeps can get on their way vs lodging out for x-countless hours at a rest stop or charge station... .....otherwise, people will just be local and, as such, plug-in under their normal conditions.  .... plus there's always the trailer :P   Robots are neat... screw employment. robots replace jobs left   right and will continue to do so.   even in Tesla's promo videos they've made a major point to show people building their cars... *not* robots.  just robots *assisting* people.  but, at that, robots are awesome. if iRobot came around and I could have a personal helper monkey-bot? I'd take it in a heartbeat. maybe even a few of them.  I never agreed with Will Smith's stance on it all.  the whole 'chair story' is retarded. we already build rocking chairs with robots or in factories. what's the difference?  there's still an 'art' to it all... and if robots were as sophisticated as to run, jump, clean my house, and 'other' then hell yeah!  imagine how much shit could get done!   could pull a Surrogates and take a robo-trip around the world.. different spot every day. just put enough cameras on a robot, throw on enough high quality mics and throw on a VR deal.... spend a half hour tele-controlling a robot in Spain only to get bored with that, tell the robot to auto-walk back home as you sign into the travelbot in downtown tokyo.  clean up trash, clear out abandoned sites. .. etc... robots rock. or could/will (most likely will)  I just kinda-sorta wonder the auto-bot battery changing thing. it seems like some redneck idiot would run it over. I know I probably would... by accident.  I still think at least *a* service tech would be there looking after it all.  and ... having an automated plug plug in my car is 'cute' in my house, but at a charge station? lol. it's just... really?? why??? it's a plug! not even a stinky gas pump! you just plug it in and push some freakin' buttons on a screen! I'd imagine my microwave is harder to use. (and it's made for idiots)  car wash cost: no reason it wouldn't be auto-debited to the account but.... .... yeah, there's a difference between a $65k car and a $15-20k one.  I dont' see the snow really being that big of a deal. I mean, of course it would be but there're 50 million people that live in areas of the US that never get snow. so, plenty of market where snow isn't an issue. where it *is* an issue also gets balls-hot in the summer... Chicago   NYC   Boston   Toronto-even are not free from hot-as-fuck summers. so, again, a minimal problem allocated to a smaller portion of the year (in the US... europe's different but... again, indoor swapping mixed with an undercarriage wash with hot water. problem solved?)  The undercarriage rush of a ICE car is because the mechanics are all underneath it.  in an EV it's pretty much just a battery. a sealed battery at that.  other than battery heat, which... with proper controlling isn't really an issue from what I gather... the undercarriage could be hard plastic or a thin sheet of aluminum or something. or just stainless steel.. but that's heavier.   like you said, there're just a lot less parts on an ev, and even most of the parts it *does* have are covered.  i mean, suspension is suspension and such but... it's just a different design/build altogether... and, you're gonna get what you pay for... some cars will, simply, rust faster/more than others.  but, again, just don't see it as a big issue in the grand scheme of things that could become big issues.   ??? shrug      I wasn't aware algae was so powerful  I wan't either!   but, better, it isn't just that it's 'powerful', it's that it has a wide range of hydrocarbon chain lengths.   corn, switchgrass, etc just have the sugars and they're 'eaten' by the microbes that make the ethane/ethanol.  but, algae also has this... ..as well has the long chain hydrocarbon oils that go up to C20 in length... and, of course, anywhere in the middle (well, the middle being H1 or 1H or H2 I suppose, as H1 doesn't really stay H1 for very long before becoming H-something... in the case of a container of pure H... H2 .. but, 1h - C20H42) .   But, yeah, I mean, I knew the 'idea' of algae made sense.. but i always figured it was a land premium thing... like a 'if we ran out of land' or 'got sick of food-vs-fuel debate' or something we could always go to the sea and, thus, algae.    but, in truth, it really works *nothing* like that.  I mean, I suppose you could make giant algae farms (and they do) but, why? when you can use a piece of crap land in California, dehydrated drought ridden soil fucked california... right next to the ocean that's *loaded* with pollutants...  and, pump that water in, feed it through a system like Algenol has, produce tons of fuel, as well the left over residual biomass can be recycled back into the system for feeding... or used to help improve soils (composted basically)  also, forgot to say, every acre of algenol not *only* produces the 9000+~1500 gallons of fuel (ethanol+mixed) ... it also produces something like 130-150 gallons of freshwater from the ocean water.  obv this isn't like a mind blowing amount, I believe I waste more every time I shit   shower but... that its '*makes*' freshwater ... *and* fuel... vs using it... ....it's gotta account for something??  You should check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlSwFaxIyzo) ... it's the intro video of a promo video series that Algenol put out in a 'special marketing'-like interview deal with the CEO. ... the whole thing is like 20 videos long? each one him answering an individual question. each designed to kinda-sorta sit alone as its own thing, or, if you watch all together it creates a consistency of course... but, the intro video above is standalone-standalone.  really recommend the whole series though. apologies I can't find the youtube mix of it all but it's there... it's like an hour long but seriously fascinating.  plus they *just* announced like a month ago that they got approval to make x-gallons of ethanol for fuel consumption.  but, they aren't 'in trials' (really), like, it's ready to go commercial now. $1 a gallon gasoline (from algae).    [Cool Planets announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-2Am2howHk feature=share) their first full scale plant back in the fall ... pretty exciting there too. I really think the two would pair up awesomely together... the Cool Planet model and Algenol's ... esp that Cool Planet's first (commercial) plant is in Louisiana and Algenol's based out of Florida... if they could team up, Algenol utilizing the '[waste](/r/waste)' CO2 from the Cool Planet production process to feed their algae... the whole thing would be carbon negative as fuck and produce a *lot* of fuel.   Exciting stuff either way ... but, regardless of that.. gas powered cars are awesome, don't get me wrong, and H-C chains are about as energy dense as it gets (even *with* [graphene](/r/graphene) supercapacitors coming down the line!) so... but, I see no reason an HC storage system couldn't be used to provide power to an electric car... via an ICE or a fuel cell or something along those lines.... efficiency in supply chain, battery swapping, etc  aside, filling up with HC chains is just too simple and too integrated into the global psyche at this point ... ..and, with the oil supplies of the world ramping up to massive production ... *right* as Cool Planet and Algenol and such are starting to come online... ... I don't see a reason to phase out HC-fueled vehicles... ....but, HC-fueled vehicles... that are powering an electric motor.  EV's also make too much sense. the energy conversion is just too high... with any loss of power in the system being inefficiencies and, thus, increased wear   tear... i mean, something like 98.xx% of energy that gets to an electric motor is converted into mechanical energy ... ICEs are lucky to get 35% ... the diesel VW is like 45%? ... hell, even stationary power plants are like 65%... it's just a lot of loss of energy from the engine to the generator... fuel cells have much higher conversions and... then that power in turn is communicated to the electric motor too efficiently ...  ...but, again, HC-chains are super dense.  I'm not arguing we stay on the current model though... but, at the same time, *if* carbon negative HC-sources are used (ie, Cool Planet and Algenol) then why not??? in some ways, driving around *removes* carbon from the atmosphere!   so, hell, the 7 billion person globe *embracing* automobiles may actually *'solve'* climate change??  But, at the same time, hydrogen is hydrogen... be it in a C20 chain or an H2 molecule in syngas... and, that's the real breakthrough in 'tech' imo... pyrolysis. It's an old weird tech, and innovations are most definitely not glorious or headline grabbing ... but, be it bitumen coal to oil shale to petroleum to n.gas to algae to switchgrass to corn to landfill waste ... HC chains can be broken down into H1 (which quickly becomes H2) and burned in power plants.... the 'other' things in the gas stream separated out. ... coal, mercury, sulfur etc.. ....that electricity from the power plants can go on to charge batteries.  so, the idea with switchgrass or other (and i really like switchgrass, it's really 'woody', it has a high lignocellulosic value) is that it can be grown... it [grows incredibly fast](http://www.ethanolproducer.com/uploads/posts/magazine/resize/1328-1292434727-300x300-noup.jpg?1361327994), again, 10-15ft 2-3x a year... and [roots that grow nearly as deep](http://www.groundtradesxchange.com/forums/attachments/landscaping-design/3495d1238362111-should-all-types-grass-outlawed-landscaping-design-npgp5_rootsys.gif). it builds soil, helps retain water, has a low nutritional requirement (if it needs more nutrients, it'll just grow a larger root zone and deeper... which means, by default, it has to grow taller above ground to support the below ground roots... with photosynthesis).   but, all that carbon, or, 98%+ of it... that's in the plant *and* the roots... is atmospheric carbon.. removed and built. Trees have nothing on this stuff. maybe in density but *certainly* not in rate of growth.  the biochar produced from it [blended back into the soil](http://www.biochar-international.org/files/graphics/terra-preta.jpg) only serves to improve the soil that much more, retain that much more water, filter that many more pollutants, and sequester that much more carbon ... all the while producing energy... be it in the piss poor transport fuel of ethanol, or in the form of H2 for power plants (my preferred choice)... or both if you a.d. it before subjecting what's left to pyrolysis.   that electricity? can, again, charge batteries. screw solar, screw wind, screw geothermal, screw hydroelectric-even. I mean, they're great in their respective places (residential roofs, wind ridges, backyard heat   cooling or Hawaii, Iceland, etc... etc) but, at best they're carbon neutral. at *best*. and as long as the guys driving to the plants are driving Fords, they're carbon positive.... be it for construction *or* maintenance.  Biomass is the only thing that's carbon negative... and it *is* solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, ...nuclear-even.  and it provides the flexibility of longchain hydrocarbons for energy dense fuels, to 'pure' Hydrogen for powerplant generation... and everything in between .... including easily stored materials in containers that dont' degrade all that fast, and integrates (like electricity) with an infrastructure we currently have.  but, with that, ev's *still* make the most sense. ...for *most* applications.   I got off subject   jobs are negatively affected  the way 'jobs' are 'solved' if efficiency took over is the same way communities the world over 'solve' it. I went to Trinidad   Tobago a few years back... no one worked. not really anyway. I mean, ~4 hours a day. or, 6 but in two 3 hour chunks.  Europe isn't all that different. you just create a nanny state of sort. ... if resource scarcity isn't an issue... there really *isn't* much reason to work.  containing or curtailing the subsequent baby boom is just a matter of educating and prevention. the smarter people are, the later they tend to wait to have kids, and the less they seem to have.  Look at Japan, IQ's that're way up there... their 100IQ is like 120IQ in the US. 125 maybe-even. their population is *shrinking*. the educated sections of India? shrinking in population. it's the uneducated masses of the planet that seem to breed like rabbits.  so, education. and... maybe a pro-IUD program? :) I like IUD's ... a lot... so... yeah. just push those out there like none other ... and come up with a male equivalent :) (vasectomies are *not* the same as a copper IUD. not at all!) population'd drop pretty quickly i'd imagine. thus, less jobs needed *for* 'jobs' to be a real political issue.  again, distribution   politics is the main issue, not capability-of.  it'll get there, or we'll fuck things up so bad we'll wish we had   I don't think so. they're usually on sale... possibly cheaper even.   they taste a... well, the Pepsi tastes a lot better too, imo! like, a *lot* better.   again, haven't tried the coke ...yet, but I don't drink that many soft drinks to begin with so...   but, I was just at a gas station and the Coke Life's were in a special fridge deal next to the counter and it had a big sticker implying a sale... i didn't cross with the price of a normal coke... granted, I didn't buy one either. quite simply, I forgot. :)   x-post: /r/Agronomy  x-post: /r/Soil   x-post: /r/BioChar  x-post: /r/Agronomy   x-post: /r/BioChar   x-post: /r/Soil    [Susan B.

I have a ski slope of a driveway when it snows. I shoveled it last month but it was ice underneath. I hooked up my pressure washer to my hot water heater... melt-blasted off the ice. threw down salt.   never underestimate what some hot water can do to some ice/snow :)    the whole thing? took less time than shoveling it.  after shoveling it I realized I should've just blasted it from the get go, melted the snow right along with it.   I don't imagine the undercarriage of a battery would be the coolest place anyway... as well, that *that* much snow and shit would stick to it while the car's going 80mph down an interstate for a few hours.... ....just a hunch though, but most ICE powered cars don't tend to have a lot of snow on their undercarriage ...   but, again, if it comes down to 'plug in over there and wait three hours' or 'run through that car wash which your car needs anyway and I can swap it out in 15' I'd imagine the guy that's driving a $65k+ car is going to say, 'i've got $5' :)   contamination   friction between the 'seams'  seal the seams? I mean, would this not be a problem now? I've never heard or read about it being one.  .. seems like it'd pop up as something someone would mention.  ...then again, how hard is it to 'seal' a case against 'gunk' getting in it?   I'm sure the battery casings would need to be water proof anyway ... a nice 'rubber seal' around the edges and a small bit of force upon closing it seems like it's more than suffice to keep out most things... hell, even air possibly, but esp water.  ...seems to work for my Maglite anyway?  Well, the pallet jack manual system was what he told me they were using on the factory floor at Tesla.  motor-assisted, but still manually moved around.  I think the whole automation thing is a bit silly. I mean, I still get out and put a nozzle in my car to put in gas, why so hard to manually put in a plug?   An iRobot battery deal may make sense when it comes to moving the things around on a charging station lot... i suppose, but, again, 95lb (hell, probably 85lbs, the girl's tiny!) 5ft girl at the grocery store was moving around a 1'000lb pallet of canned goods last night w/out too much trouble... i don't really see where a properly balanced 2'000lb battery stack would be a big deal? esp on flat paved ground designed for moving them around on? maybe a motor assist? I mean, it *is* tesla, throw in an electric motor segway-style that aids in moving it around upon 'directional-suggestions' by the attendant?    i like robots, don't get me wrong... but, again, some of the stuff just seems 'silly' to overly automate. kinda 'teching out just to tech out' if you will.     Politics tends to get in the way of innovation  because politicians don't get voted in by technology but by voters. voters that have their jobs replaced by technology want new politicians to create jobs for them.  Inefficiency creates jobs.  what's that quote, 'reproduction for the sake of reproduction is the ideology of a cancer cell' - someone.   technology for the sake of technology is a joke. I've bought *so* many useless 'tech' items throughout the years ... and never used them.   ... as a piss poor example.  but, at the same time, if you streamline the hell out of something... like, *so* much that you make the process as minimal as possible... ...if you build devices that essentially don't break, 'light bulbs that don't burn out', etc ... you replace/reduce the need for both your labor *and* yourself as a business.  It's not in a business's best interests to denecessitate itself.  ... nor politicians either.   That line from Distinguished Gentleman where the head of Power   Industry tells Eddie's character, Jack Johnson 'the name you know!' that the fact that nothing gets done *is* the point of the system.  ideally there'd be very minimal everything.  it simply wouldn't be needed. government would be tiny, politicians (and their salaries) would be tiny, labor forces would be, etc.  I've unfortunately replaced the jobs of dozens of people throughout 'innovations' ... both in tech *and* approach (sometimes overlapping, sometimes independent of one another).  it's really weird-sad to watch someone's job disappear underneath them... and, to see the company realize just how less   less that individual is needed.  ...until that person either gets laid off (less often the case) or simply quits on their own (red stapler guy from office space notwithstanding).   One guy i 'disinvented the necessity for' literally had a nervous breakdown and ended up in an institution for over a year. ran into him back in the fall after not having seen him in a decade.... guy was still a 'broken man' for all intents   purposes. ...granted, his shell shock/PTSD from 'nam didn't help matters any.  but, yeah... it's a 'sad thing' seeing someone's reality replaced underneath them.  ...and, people don't like it, so they tend to *not* vote for the person it happened under, and to *vote* for the person who most-convincingly promises to bring them back to the delusion of the dream.  that completely unnecessary rant aside... or, tying it back into the topic at hand... Tesla did something like that with Obama back in like '09 or '10... showed Obama how he could completely adjust the auto industry through tech   reapproach. the problem? Obama 'got scared' from how *I* interpreted the various articles... because at first it created jobs... but then it reduced labor force over like 4 years down to 10% of what it was (within the auto industry) and then in another 4 years down to 10% of *that* ... ie, like 1% of the people in the automanufacturing business would be employed .   cars would be better, stronger, lighter, faster, more efficient, last longer, and.... well, again, Obama was 'terrified' by what it meant. Didn't tell Musk *not* to do it, but said that he couldn't incorporate it into gov't policy.   AT T back in the dot.com fiber layout deal was the single largest employer in the US. the fiber optic / internet infrastructure all but replaced their inefficiency. as a result, hundreds of thousands got laid off.  ... and that was directly. hundreds of thousands more of ancillary jobs were lost during the readjustment. (insurance agents, car/health/life/etc, restaurants, service industry shit, etc ... simply because the money wasn't there from the core employees for them to, in turn, afford the secondary businesses).  If AOL *hadn't* bought TW... and a massive gov't 'thing' hadn't stepped in to convolute the entire infrastructural innovation, injecting all sorts of (temporary-yet-still-prevalent) inefficiency into the system, the dot.bomb blowout would've been even *worse* than it was.  in many ways, this most-recent recession is just a continuation of that... Bush's massive borrowing really just being a temporary injection or distraction from it. a 'max out the credit lines' approach towards survival.   ethanol from corn  check out /r/biofuels, /r/biochar, /r/pyrolysis, /r/syngas, /r/gasification, /r/anaerobicdigestion, /r/biomass, /r/... ...well, check out the subs I mod. I post about it a bunch. I see the 'future' of biofuels as being [algae](/r/algae) ... from an efficiency perspective. I see [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) as being a great land-crop vs corn. It has an EROEI of about 10-15:1 that of corn. it provides habitats, and, if gasified via pyrolysis, you get biochar ... so, essentially [carbon negative grassoline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkYVlZ9v_0o).  the initial sugars can be extracted via anaerobic digestion, of course, then the remaining pulp can be used for paper, building material, etc... or gasified via pyrolysis (after gasification via anaerobic digestion) to eek out those last remaining hydrogen atoms from it... and, blend the biochar back into [agricultural](/r/agriculture) lands or use as a building material of feedstock for [graphene](/r/graphene) production.    or just straight gasify the switchgrass via pyrolysis from the get-go and blend the /r/syngas with [n.gas](/r/naturalgas)  like ethanol with [gasoline](/r/petroleum) ... or just straight burn it outright as a n.gas replacement... ...syngas is basically CO/CO2+H2 ... so it's more difficult to store than CH4/methane/n.gas ... but, that leaves n.gas infrastructure *for* stored fuel.... ....honestly, 'screw' diesel, gasoline, ethanol, etc .... .... refueling stations should be n.gas. our cars should've been n.gas decade(s) ago... the 'gas stations' (refueling stations, whatever word or phrase needs to exist to best describe the intended purpose of what these are) already have n.gas lines running to them... ...most do anyway... just have [the grid](/r/thegrid) refuel an underground storage tank with cng and then fill the cars up from there... ...cut out the fuel trucks altogether.   then use electrolysis on the n.gas to break apart the CH4 and you get all the H2 you need for fuel cells... the C? hold onto it. combine it together or mix it with atmospheric O2 via a catalytic converter and make CO2 out of it.... have the 'bladder' in the tank inflate... so, as the methane bladder deflates (because the n.gas is being pumped out to fuel the fuel cell) take the emissions and pump them into a secondary bladder inside a larger tank.... ...puts pressure on the methane bladder to keep output pressure up, as well closes the loop on the CO2 and stores it in the car.  make a plug-type that both 'sucks out' the CO2 at the same time the CH4 is being pumped in.... ... as the tank is being refilled.    the CO2 is 'sucked' into an underground tank... and a truck comes by, fills up with it and takes it to a central facility that in turn uses it for whatever purposes CO2 is used for... carbonation of beverages, greenhouse fertilization, or... Algenol, for example, is actually *buying* CO2 to use as a feedstock for its algae farms....  corn gets something like 150-175 gallons of ethanol per acre per year. Algenol is getting 9000 gallons of ethanol per acre per year... *plus* ~1500 gallons of other hydrocarbon-types (methane, rocket fuel, diesel, butane, pure hydrogen, 'gasoline', etc... that '1500 gallons' is a mixed bag).  ...the algenol? carbon negative to carbon neutral.  Algenol can also be grown on lands you'd never *think* to put a a tractor for even *switchgrass* (which is a broadcast seeded perennial... ie, you throw out the seed and plant once. ever. not yearly, not every few years, once. period0. ... let a*lone* a plow for corn.  you could build an algenol factory on fucking rock... and pump in ocean water. that's it's *main* limitation is the need for ocean water... so it limits, say, ... well, no, not really. it doesn't limit anywhere. maybe central kazakhstan or mongolia or something.. but, even then, not really. you can pump sea water to those places.  obv Iowa or Kansas don't make sense to do this with... too far a pipeline, too fertile of land to need to... but, Utah? it's 'easily accessible enough' ... same with Nevada, Az, New Mexico if done right.  corn is a joke. it's unhealthy, fattening, and not as tasty as alternatives. switchgrass is awesome and i'm partial to it because I'm a fan of biochar. but, i recognize algenol as possibly being a better alternative. more efficient anyway. but, switchgrass is a native grass. wildlife evolved here for tens of thousands of years living within it. it's harvested when nesting patterns aren't really big anyway, and when they are, switchgrass is growing so... it provides habitat for local wildlife. it grows 10-15ft 2-3x a year cut, bailed   harvested using the same equipment as hay... (gotta make sure sharp blades and such... 'heavier duty' hay bailing equipment, but, same stuff).  builds soil, sequesters carbon, retains water, etc. the stuff is basically the 'solution' to carbon induced climate change.  anyway, i digress.  diesels are bigger around the world because the rest of the world doesn't ship shit by truck like the US does. they have trucks, of course, but, not like the semi's   interstates the US has. they use rail a lot more elsewhere. that leaves more diesel left for cars. the US made an unspoken decision to make gasoline for consumers, diesel for industry like 50 years ago, and hasn't looked back.   a few exceptions aside.  yeah, basically OnStar is where I was going with that. but, OnStar-smart because it could tie into the car's cellular connection.  battery tech a decade ago... it wasn't. but, it was at the same time. there could've been a smaller fuel tank and more room for batteries. smaller trunk space, etc. again, politics. also, at-home charging is slow... even over 240v   yeah, I've seen that video... lots of them actually. but, that one almost in particular was what was running through my head when i typed that.  It isn't so much the transport on that level... I feel that part's pretty well down.  like, case-by-case I don't see transport as an issue. It's the scale, and the number of variables that have open opportunities for human or mechanical error to come into play.  Like I said, I'm all for storing the stuff... and, thus, storing it somewhere that's not necessarily immediately accessible to the plant... Louisiana is a long way away from, say, Ny or Oregon or wherever nuke plants are... ...   it's just he entire supply chain. people slack off. get lazy. have bad days. ... ...politics   other pressures intervene. budget cuts, environmental groups.   f'ing gremlins.  whatever the countless myriad of 'things' that happens when 'shit doesn't go right'  look at the services industry.... sure on a day to day scenario, shit works... but, go talk to a computer tech or phone tech person... ... or just a simple car mechanic... or plumber ... constantly 'things' are f'ed up.  for the most part they work, but on a case by case scenario, each 'thing' has its own set of problems.  lots of redundancy, lots of annoying safety protocols, lots of observation, ... tons of observation.   moving around a train filled with nuclear waste isn't something that should be done 'in a rush'.  but, that said, yeah, I think the basic individual variables are in place ... *except* the long term storage site.  for that, Yucca is a joke. always has been, imo.   there are just too many inherent flaws in it... ...over, again, the salt domes.  hell, the salt domes are *why* we use them for the strategic petroleum reserve ... they're 'war hardened' super safe, and designed to get through whatever the latter half of the 20th century was going to throw at it.  I believe they can even take direct hits from nukes and shit.  like, even a drilling bunker buster nuke would only make it so many feet into one, blow up, and, all the salt would just 'fuse together' and 'heal'.  they're on levels of stability that are so for over a hundred million years.   dinosaurs have risen, fallen, re-risen, and been wiped out entirely since those things formed ... and, they're set to last another 250 million years into the future.   *that* Yucca was even considered over those is beyond me.    well, it's also almost impossible to do.  with pretty much every. single. app. on a phone requiring permissions that give it up anyway. with every web service tracking you, location, date, time, etc ... it's all but unavoidable anyway.  I'm totally with you on the defense mechanism part... part of me is definitely like that... i mean, how *does* one really escape it?  and, that's where it transcends that... ... you can't. and, as such, fuck it, why care? how could you?  outside of basic 'common sense' on downloading an app from a link sent to me by my long lost nigerian royal cousin.... how do you avoid it? not download angry birds? not download the local tv station's weather app?  I don't really think 'escaping it' is easy or, for that matter, all that possible ... if 'they' want to find you they'll find you. if 'they' want to find out things about you, they'll find out what they want about you.   escaping 'they' is impossible, for the most part.  most people are more concerned about how their friends   neighbors on facebook view them than their government. ....and, understandably so, honestly.  but, at the same time, 'they' don't make it easy *to* be more discrete.  I mean, look at the fuss 'they' are putting up about google   apple encrypting data by default?  how hard would it really be for google to implement a '2-step verification' plug-in for gmail whereby the email is encrypted on the local computer with a password that's given to the recipient via some other means (than email)?    how hard is it to establish a 'handshake agreement' with someone from a security perspective... I meet someone new, within a few days, one of us sends out an f.book friend request to the other... ... build in a security exchange along with this... whereby all interactions between us are encrypted based upon that.  simple. not super-hard by any means and.. could be implemented into a system pretty easily ... in such a way that it's *not* ridiculous.  if chrome can remember every one of my passwords in such that i only need to remember the password for chrome/google... why not have a gmail/facebook/whatever system to the same with the individual passwords for each friend's encryption?  I think my point is, if i have one... the technological capabilities to lock this stuff down to make it extremely difficult (if not downright impossible in many cases) isn't the issue.  nor is even the situational structural aspect... hell, not event he political 'code' necessary for it... ....but, like with google/apple encrypting data by default, 'they' don't want it.  and 'they' will make anyone/company trying to implement something like that's life hell.  breathing down their neck, intimidation, audits, etc.  oh, the point: care/not-care... people can't really do all that much about it one way or the other. if they do, they cut themselves off from things the rest of the 'herd' is doing. people want to feel like they belong to something.   then hits a drone on their way down   I'm actually not entirely opposed to the burying of nuclear waste... ...as long as it's done safely.  ...once the idea that the 'waste' part is b.s. ... with much of it being unrefined or in-need-of-being re-refined fuel... once that is 'filtered out'  the rest of the stuff that doesn't otherwise burn up easily in a thorium reactor or something .... well, if it's radioactive, it has extractable energy ...  basically that mentality  but, the crap that's too low grade to really be worthwhile? or that has a much lower EROEI?  why *not* bury it?  The idea that people seem to forget that the uranium ore was radioactive *before* it was ever mined seems to be something I never read about.  that the low grade stuff is put back under ground, and in such a way that it's thought about, controlled, monitored, and with some degree of forethought ... makes sense to me.  I've been arguing for salt dome storage for years now.  the salt mines and salt stores in the Louisiana area... or in Germany... have been geologically stable for like 100 million years... ... more so, they will *continue to be* for an estimated 250 million more.   they 'self heal' ... so, if any geological event happens, earthquake, volcano, asteroid whatever.... the salt just heats up and melts together... usually even stronger than before.  leaking is essentially impossible, and again, geological stability thousands to tens of thousands of years longer than the waste would ever be radioactive.  getting it there? that's the tricky part just asking for accidents, spillages, etc ... .... not to mention the idea that once we have a place to 'dump something' we seem to ramp up our rate of production of said shit being dumped ... ... but we do that anyway even when we *don't* so...   but, storing low grade nuclear waste underground (*after* sorting out the high grade, energy rich/energy-dense stuff for reprocessing!) just makes a lot of sense to me. Why *not* do it? ... if conditions are right.   Yucca mountain is, was, always had been always will be a stupid site for storage. an intentional waste of money, imo.   [right](http://projectcasting1.projectcasting.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/zoolander_gas.jpg)? :)    That or a demographic shift  ...or that Brazil has leveled *more* rainforests, diverted *more* water, and planted *more* sugar cane over the past few years than ever before ... ... once all this 'excess oil' is allowed to be exported from the US, once Iran's sanctions are lifted, etc ... the developing nations' demands for oil (and ethanol) are going to go through the roof...  ...and, Brazil's ag economy right along with it. The glut is temporary at best. 'temporary' may mean 2-5 years like they're saying with oil prices... but, temporary nonetheless.    but, they did just release [Coke Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_Life) ... and Pepsi's had the 'real sugar' deal for a while now... thank god! first with the 'throwback' and now with the [Pepsi True](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_True).    I haven't tried the Coke Life yet, just saw it for the first time the other day ... but I've been drinking the Pepsi Throwbacks and Pepsi True since they first brought them out / switched-them-over.  granted, i don't drink a lot of soft drinks, maybe a 12 pack a month, tops... but, the Pepsi throwback/true product has kept me away from coke when given the choice for a while now. glad 'real sugar' is coming back ... even *if* sugar is satan   Rum!   The renting concept is right in line with models that've been around for *decades* so it isn't a deviation or major alteration in mindset.  it's nothing 'ground breaking' by any means.  I suppose there'd be no reason you couldn't rend a *car* for the trip... as *well* as a charger... though, that'd be... silly?  I don't know, maybe not. not my forte either way.  but, basically a lo-jack system built into the trailer to keep up with it. I pay $100 a month for multiple phones on my plan, essentially unlimited data, and more minutes than I've ever thought about using.... to factor something similar (or cheaper on a larger corporate account) with sprint or AT T or whomever, and have it built into the trailer like a tablet has a cellular connection built into it... would be super cheap   easy. and, again, no deviation from 'things' we already have today.  and, that it'd not just be an 'anti-theft' system, tracking, etc... but also a system monitor, connected to the main tesla database (or whichever service) and, in turn, that being connected to your phone, car, app, computer, 'account'...    (I mean some would happen, but probably the same amount as cars get stolen nowadays)  and/or trailers. stealing either comes with a pretty hefty legal sentence. and, dealing with the legalities of these things kinda-sorta *as* 'cars' .. or, well, again, the analogy of a tablet from a cell provider with a cellular connection/chip in it... it's not the primary product/service the business carries (selling cars), but it's certainly not  a major deviation from that...   so, um... yeah, steal one of these, get tracked,get caught, go to prison. I'd imagine they'd have their own license plate... most trailers do. all cars do. not far fetched to think that these would as well. ...and, they are, technically, weight on the road, so to think that there'd be some sort of annual 'road tax' on them isn't too far fetched either.  ... hell, if [motorcycles](http://www.texelent.com/images/backview.jpg) can have [trailers](http://www.coolcustomtrikes.com/ygp49c.jpg), why not an ev??    the longer the trip is, the more you can swap them out every 800km or so  the battery-swap model really makes a lot of sense. just pull up to a dealership/charging station... one you 'checked into' at the last one to 'reserve your trailer' as well 'estimated time of pickup' and... drive to the next one, pull in, attendant pulls off the one, loads on the other... checks it all to make sure it meets insurance specs, you're back on your way.   ....swapping out a trailer is *certainly* easier sounding than the battery swap deal... and, again, the extra weight wouldn't be a major killer for the car as the whole thing would've been pre-designed to work with the car(s) to begin with.    The battery-trailer gets fast-charged and is ready for the next customer.   thing is, I came up with the basic idea for this 6+ years ago? maybe longer? such as to say, it isn't a major deviation from 'common sense' or 'that makes sense' for anyone thinking about it... ...I'm really surprised something like it wasn't just straight built in to ev models 10+ years ago.   granted, I'm also really freakin' surprised the first hybrids weren't plug-in hybrids by default.  then again, at the same time, I'm also blown away that corn is the only feedstock used for ethanol. .... all others (switchgrass, algae, etc) have to be fought for tooth   nail.  why do subsidies for such things have to exist solely on *corn*? why not 'ethanol' in general? regardless of feedstock.   ... I know I'm jumping subjects but I really think that, in the end, it's pretty clear that politics is the real limiting variable here *not* technological capability ... or business model design.     well, the batteries in *that* design were in a 'tray'... so, the bottom of the tray is what'd get 'road slushed' ... the batteries were tucked safely inside.  the 'trays' dropped down   out like an under-the-desk keyboard... ...that's *not* in just a slide-out-drawer design...  and, well, it'd be done on a flat gas station like surface, maybe a pull in garage carport style?  but, I don't see where the winter conditions would *really* change anything too too much.  I mean, last night after I typed that last message I went to the grocery store and a like 95lb 5'4 employee-girl was moving around a pallet of canned goods on a [pallet jack](http://www.handtrucksrus.com/pallet_lifts/272149%20[zoom].jpg) with seemg-ease... so a specialty designed deal and a 'trained   licensed' (and usually 'male'0 employee would doubtfully have a huge problem with it?  but, also/again, this was like 2 years ago... i mean, just-over a year (fall 2013) when I talked to the guy, and he'd owned the car for at least a few months before that, plus the design itself probably at least 6 months before that so... a 2 year old design, and, well, in thelast two years /r/teslamotors will clearly show you that something like that *hasn't* come out (yet) so... ...it may've just been something they were *testing*...  but it made one helluva lot of sense to me.  I suppose if the problem is really bad (mud, snow-slush, etc), they could always run the car through a heated car wash first??  It's not like Tesla owners would be poverty-stricken people whereby a $5 heated car wash would put them out much ... and, if there's that much slush on the car, it's definitely in need of a good bath anyway....   on the 'fresh cells'...   it was more set up (from how it sounded) like you'd just swap out all 4 'super-quads' per fill up.  all the maintenance of each pack and such was done on the back-end/tesla side of things.  what the driver would get during their 'fill up' or 'swap out' (ha! just had an mental image of a buddy telling me: 'yeah, i'll be right over, heading out in 10 then gotta head to the station to get a 'swap out' and I'll be right there... see ya in a 'half hour'! ... ....vs, 'gotta swing by the gas station and fill up then i'll be right over' ...ah, the future :)   anyway... yeah, the idea that i gathered was that all 4 super-quads would be swapped, tesla would do all the charging, checking, maintenancing ... cross referencing the data off of the data in the car / memory chips of the quads/packs ... ...distance, time since last swap, charge/discharge cycles, rates, frequencies, etc.  all of that would, for the most part, be monitored by tesla.   if any of the cells were going bad, the pack would be either done on site or, if 'so far gone', a pick-up   take-to-factory woudl be scheduled. ... ...newer battery tech could be swapped in on the fly as well.   the corporate computer system would have various algorithms that 'figure out how' to most efficiently lay the cells out ... ...all the guy at the station would be doing is... well, they' be a glorified battery swapper following instructions on the screen and maybe barcode scanning things along the way.  I don't imagine the job would be too too higher-paid than a minimum wage deal.  Maybe a small premium but... say, a PF Chang's server vs, say, an Applebees one... a McD's employee may be a bit 'below' the paygrade of one of these guys.  your average geek squad employee would prob be about what the job would look like, or, maybe a Best Buy sales floor guy doing the swapping and basic b.s. and a geek squad employee behind the counter doing the battery swaps and basic 'checking'... Sprint's model works: sales floor person doing the swapping, car wash crap... ...person behind the glass window doing the 'servicing of the phone' ... deciding on whether they can fix it in-store or if it just makes more sense to send it back to the factory .  but, the charge controllers are, from my understanding, all pretty standardized... ....like cell phones. the charge controller for phones is built into the phone itself... the only thing the average user really has a choice in is whether they're going to use a 1amp charger or a 2.1amp deal...  and, again, the phone's controller (or car's in this case) would regulate the flow to the cells to ensure a balanced charge ... ...and store the statistics of it all (as I understand they already *any*way) which would then be stored on the on-battery/on-pack chips, as well within the Tesla's computer ... all to be 'uploaded via wifi' to Tesla.   A subscription model is basically where it's at.  the rest of the maintenance is done on the backend and is included into the cost of the subscription... the larger maintenancing (the 'oil change' type stuff.. once a quarter, once a year type things... brake pads, rotation, alignment, etc..) being done at whatever regular intervals I gather Tesla owners already get notifications for..... I gather that the car has a pretty heft amount of sensors on board and the computer is constantly monitoring the health of the systems. ....  cars basically = computers/phones at this point. the 'cells' of a battery not being much different than the 'cells' of an SSD, the load balancing (of the individual cells) not being much different between a battery   an individual cell on an SSD.  the same basic concept *any*way.  I feel like i'm kicking a dead horse.   Found [this](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_g4-6901.php) on the G4.. and haven't heard *any*thing about a 'mystery higher end series' but it makes perfect sense.  ...imagining what'd be in it though?  maye higher quality speakers? curved screen with something other 'special' about it? maybe something like Samsung's Edge thing? (seems dumb though).  I like the M9, and I *really* like the rumored E9's specs... but, not sure I'm really into the special screen crap (flex/curved, edge stuff, etc).  the speakers could definitely use some upgrading from the G3... compared to the M8, or just in general, the G3's speaker is pretty *weak*, imo. Was really surprised they went with *that* low quality of a sound system   Maybe after Arnold's Mr Freeze saves his wife he can turn good and figure something out.   part II  kinda sorta the same thing as swapping. but, the idea of renting one would be 'to make it to the destination' ... so, say, you live in Chicago but want to drive to, say, NYC... you won't need to *own* a trailer (which you could if you wanted to, but if you're only using it to drive to Aunt Edna's in Manhattan once a year, why own a $15k trailer?)...  you just go rent one from the dealership..  but, again, in this seamless 'app' style prearranged rental agreement deal.  when you leave on Friday after work, you pick up your Chicago-trailer at the dealership/rental place.  drive to NYC, drop it off at the place in NYC... spend your week in manhattan... go back and pick up another one for your drive back... ...be it the same one, a different one, who cares? what's it matter? you're keeping it for a day to drive the 800 mile trip.  at night? you can stay at a hotel with a charge station, or, you can just stay at some $50 a night MicroTel and leave the trailer hooked up to the car... and the trailer will run through the night charging the batteries of the car up.... then just fill the trailer with fuel before you leave whatever-smalltown-Pennsylvania you crashed in for the night in case the 250 mile charge   150 miles in the tank isn't enough to make it because you stopped at 350 miles instead of 400 in 'cause it was friday night and you'd worked all day/week.    trailer filled with gas when you drop it off? costs less than the gas charge the dealership/rental place is going to charge you.. ...just like what happens when you rent a car.  bring it back at the same place it was when you picked it up? $0 fuel charge. bring it back empty, they charge you 150% going rate for fuel + a fill up fee just because they can.  the biggest deal here? it uses an already existing infrastructure (gas stations) and, thus, an already existing fuel-road tax because, afterall, you *are* using road fuel (road gas/diesel) ... vs farm grade fuel.  but, while in your destination? you don't have to fuck with the trailer 'cause you dropped it off.   if it's *your* trailer? again, make them 'parking spot safe' .. so, make it lock up nicely like a car.  thus, someone stealing your trailer or breaking into it would be like stealing or breaking into a parked car... would be even cooler if the system had a built in cellphone type device.. like how the tesla has its own cell connection deal... just so it's 'connected ot the grid' too... ie, your phone/devices. that way if it *is* broken in to, it doesn't just 'beep' or 'honk' (like a car), but it also sends you a message, turns on audio so you can listen, has gps, as well has the ability to call the cops to report the theft in progress... and, of course, track it notifying you/the police where it is until they can arrest the fuckers who tried to jack your shit.  back to oil companies still getting a piece? yeah, absolutely. sure they lose funds for ev's around town... ie, 99% of the time.. people can just fill up at home off solar, wind, geothermal, the grid, whatever ... ....but, they're losing that anyway even now (not really, they own the patents on all the batteries. oil companies aren't losing shit) ... but they get the money for the 'long hauls'.   well, I was thinking about it more (remembering it more) after I wrote that ... this was a 'mock design' they had in the factory. this was also over a year ago so, following the news, it looks like they'd taken a different route.  I forget how the batteries actually are, but this battery engineer designer...  the design they were using in the factory was.... .... let me reword how he described it.  underneath the car were 4 'super packs'.  a front-driver, rear-driver, front-passenger, rear-passenger.  they sat on a 'tray' that would 'drop down' ... down and 'out' pivoting out past the tires as it dropped.  in each of the four 'super packs' were 'rails'   I believe 5 rails each... each rail was a double-wide pack of 4-AA sized batteries in a single pack.  so, the 4 batteries were in serial acting as a single battery (ie, whatever singular voltage the batteries were rated for, they *weren't actually double-A's or they'd be 1.5v.. but they were playing around with the idea of them *being* AA's to reduce cost via volume) .... then the 4-AA packs acted in parallel with the other 4-AA packs in the 'rail' ... to increase the voltage.. ...as well, each parallel design allows independent charging... so, though each individual AA isn't getting charged independently by the whole system, each 4-pack of them is.  This parallelism allowed for much faster charging.  as well, it narrowed down the problems with 'bad cells' to within a 4-battery level of focus... and, at that, they were even working on software that would allow them to 'time' the current being tested to predict which cell within the 4-AA-pack was bad.  at that, you could take out the individual batteries, you coudl take out the 4-AA pack, you coudl take out the rail, or you could take out the 'super-quad'   at *that*, there was something like an angle-mounted dolly... with motors.   whereby, the 'super-quads' would drop from under the car, the 'dolly' would come up, grab the first 'super-quad', and, as it pulled back to grab the second/next 'super-quad', the one it'd already grabbed would get pulled up... kinda like a bullet coming up in the clip of a glock or something.. .. but, the dolly was angled back \  like that... with the car being on the 'right' so, \ -dolly c- car ... \c   ...the previously 'grabbed' super-quad would slide up and back towards the dolly operator, freeing up the loading arm to grab the next super-quad... process would repeat until the first pack was at the top of the 'dolly-clip' ... last-removed super-quad was at the bottom.    dolly operator would then roll the super-quads via the powered/motorized dolly to a charging terminal... would set it in, the bottom pack 'lining up first' and then stand the dolly-arm up vertical in such that the remaining three super-quads would all be stacked vertically... and, the whole thing would 'lock into place' with the charging station.   that 'super quad' would be like 3ft x 4ft or something (so it could sit on a 4x4 pallet for shipping, if need be).   ... and, the dolly-operator would grab another dolly of already charged packs and repeat the process in reverse... loading the already-charged batteries into the Tesla... whole process taking 10-15 minutes tops.    the charging station would then analyze the 'super quads' as well all the cells within them... down to an '*actual-accuracy*' of battery health of each 4-AA sized packs... ...and, an accurately predicted accuracy of even the health of the 4-cells individually within that.   also, each 4-cell pack had a chip on it, each rail had a chip on it, and each super-quad had a chip on it.  each individual AA-cell had a serial number, and each was known where it was loaded in the 4-AA pack.  and, all of those serial numbers, in turn, were uploaded to Tesla... ...as well, the computer in the car could keep track of which cells it was pulling power from... ...so the whole thing, like an SSD hard drive's management software... knew which cells had been used more regularly vs other ones.  that way it could 'even the load' across them to help the batteries age evenly.  each never charing so quickly, or discharging so quickly/consistently as to heat up (minimizing fires) as well maximizing cell-life.  when the cells were in question, the tech, on their off time (or the factory itself... as they'd just be loaded onto pallets and shipped to the factory) would be able to pull apart the quads (really easily... like, remove a cover easily... then slide out a rail)... ...slide out a rail, access the 4-AA pack in question, pop it out, and then pop out the 4 batteries inside it ... but, even this was going to be designed to be automated ... in such that the super-quad in question could be inserted into a diagnosis machine that would be able to 'slide' 'pins' between the individual cells... *all* of them in the super-quad... individually but at once...   and charge-test each of them individually/independently of the other AA-cells in the pack.  the tech, in their 'off time' when not swapping batteries would then swap the individual cells from the packs and replace them with new ones... scanning the 'barcode' or rfid or whatever that each individual AA-cell had on it and marking where in the pack it was.  as well, rearranging the order the cells were in the pack, if need be, as how the computer/system suggested would provide the most balanced load/unload time such as to maximize both cell life and minimize cell charge time.  and, on the super-quad chargers... they were even looking into making the diagnosis constant... like, every time it woudl happen. not just during 'maintenance times' ... and, this would, in turn, allow for each individual cell to be charged at a time, vs 4 at a time but only at '1.5v' ... so, they'd be able to charge *all* the cells at their independent voltage ... vs, say, 4 cells, but at 1.5v ... ie, 6v per 4-AA-pack.  and, then, the 'modularity' of it would be that the 'older designs' (that just charged the packs) would 'trickle down' to new charge stations, as the new 'charge all cells independently at once' *as* ***well*** *as* 'diagnose each individual cell independently of each other cell in each 4-pack' systems move into place. shifting it all around so as to be either evenly distributed, *or* maximized based on peak demand.   obviously 25 teslas pulling in once a day in downtown LA during rush hour would take priority over BF-Ky's charge station where speed and/or peak-demand was a bit less of an issue.    This would not only make 'battery swapping' a 15 minute affair, but would make *charging* an entire super-quad something along those lines as well.  again, this was all 'in the works' stuff.. that, apparently *isn't* what's being deployed... ...yet, as this isn't something Musk announced when he last announced the X/X-supercharger but... definitely something they're working on.  the cells that were bad? would get pulled, sent back to the factory and recycled.  but, again, the whole thing was just fascinating to hear him talk about.  and, being a retired electrical engineer that was also a prof for a while, he not only understood it, but knew how to explain it as *well*.. which was really neat.  the trailer/propane idea... yeah, basically. thouh, maybe better to give an 'up front discount' ... like, anyone that owns the car can rent one... but, if you buy the prepaid annual membership (think costco or something) where whether you use it or not you're still paying $x a year.... but, if you *do* pay that $x a year upfront membership fee (built into the original car loan at time of purchase!) you get a discount when you go to rent one.     I'm a big HTC fan but I think it's still badass how LG is essentially a year ahead of everyone else techwise. ...or has been for the past year anyway.  I mean, a year after the G3 was announced, the M9 comes out with almost the exact same specs ... even lower in some cases; no removable battery, lower mAh on the battery, slower clock speed, smaller screen, lower pixel density / lower ppi, still has a higher quality camera (13mp vs 20mp, sure, but the 13mp is higher quality and has image stabilization) , cheaper and weighs less.  I also got my G3 for free with a 2 year contract... back in early August.   again, I'm a pretty big HTC fan, and the M9 is certainly a really nice phone... but even it's yet-to-be-announced big brother the E9 doesn't look like it'll match some of the G3's nearly-year-old specs    I was imagining a system that you can swap batteries out   I ran into one of the local tesla owners in my area in a parking lot of a grocery store about a year or so ago. Guy's like 75, was with his 95 year old mother... bowtie wearing, was like midnight. was on the phone, waiting for something to happen when all of a sudden 'it' pulled up next to me (back corner of the parking lot... was like ytf is someone parking all the way out here??) ... was the first time I'd seen a tesla in person.   anyway, we got into conversation about he, he showed me the entire car. was a retired electrical engineer-turned-professor-turned-retiree.  we got into convo about the batteries, the electrical system... on down the line. his super cool (again, 95 years old!) mother just sat in the car playing with the super-monitor and chillaxin' while we shot the shit.. ...we must've been there for an hour. maybe longer honestly.  one of the things he pulled up on the screen was a pic he took while he was touring the factory. it was of the battery rails under the car.  one of the engineers there was working on a way to fast-swap modular battery packs.  so, like, you'd go to one side of the car, push the button, the battery bank would lower from underneath the car, you'd 'kick' this little button, and out would slide this 40lb battery pack... ...inside it would in turn be smaller battery packs, each with 4 AA batteries in it.  the 4-pack of AA's acting as a singular battery, then each of these independently connected to the charge controller... so, if any errors were going on, you'd only need to diagnose 4 batteries at a time...    anyway... the idea being that these 'rails' were half the width of the car-long (like 3ft)... two of these 4-AA packs wide, with 4 batteries in them.  and, you'd slide one out, slide in another.  and you had like 10 of these per side of the car... but, that these, in turn, would be inside a 'quad' ... or, 4 or 5 'rails' in a singular larger 'pack' and you'd pull up to a charger station, out would come the attendant, he'd roll out some dolly type thing, slide out a 'quad' and stack it... roll them over to the charger station at the 'gas station' ... roll over a new one that's all charged up, and one by one slide these in.  the entire thing taking like 5-10 min...   the cells you'd 'dropped off' were all individually serial numbered, the packs they were in were 'tested' 'monitored' and kept with the Tesla database... and basically you 'leased energy' .... constantly swapping cells.   the 'dealership/charging station' would monitor the cells, take out the old/bad ones, swap in new ones, and manage the whole thing itself.  but, again, 'swappable batteries' and like a 10 minute battery swap.  you'd pay in accordance to the mileage age wear   tear on the batteries but... kinda like cell phone plan where you got x-minutes a month (miles) and then paid a preset amount if you went over.  the whole thing was a concept, but what the guy was working on from *there* was (this being 'the guy' that worked at the Tesla factory that the electrical engineer that owned the tesla was talking to). ....  the battery tech's job was to try to figure out how to make the 4 pack of individual AA cells (or AA-sized cells, but he was working to make them actual AA's so that the market would be even wider that tesla would be able to work with... ...ie, even more generic than specialty sized cells) ... so that... not so much that each individual battery was wired individually... but that they could have a pretty good idea inside each battery pack *which* of the 4 cells was giving them the most problems.   and/or, how to wire room into the 'backs' so that each cell could be quickly tested independent of the other 3 in the pack...   anyway, i'm rambling and totally off subject.  but, the EE   I were on about this for a while. it was really funny. fun too! I was --| |--- that close to getting him to let me drive the car... if his mom hadn't been there he'd've easily let me.  or at least taken me for a ride but, that'd've pretty quickly turned into letting me drive it.  but, yeah. those things are fantastically simple as well fantastically bad ass. and, the power is insane.  we have a couple of 'rich guys' that live here that ... well, we have a lot actually but, 'toy guys' that get like GT2's and lambos and ferraris, maseratis etc... and they get together like once a month at this one bar.. hang out...  ...in the nicer days its after a day at the track... anyway, they all race and try to one up one another... on car, on style, etc... ... kinda like that jag, one of them would buy that jag and may not have the 'fastest' car but would have the best looking.. or another would have the fastest... etc .... anyway... he said he's 'raced' them off the line a few times... ...and he wins every time.  and, the way he wins is so much 'everyday smooth' vs loudy, gaudy, noisy, obnoxious.  again, grey haired 75 year old bowtie wearing (probably single?) guy that (probably) lives with his 95 year old mother driving a nice classy car that really looks like most others on the road honestly (a Kia or Buick or something is what I often confuse them as at first glance) ... kicking the shit out of these other guys who've dropped hundreds of thousands on their cars over the years. just cracks me up.  anyway, the main thing with the trailer is that it would be designed to be easy to set up, easy to hook up, fast to plug in, and just move on with life.  could even make like a 'range extender' type... maybe not powerful enough to power the car entirely, but gives a boost from, say, 250 miles to 400 or something... then you can just fill it up and get a bit more juice w/out having to wait for a complete charge up to go the last 100 miles you need to go to get to your 500 mile away destination.  but, again, a single cable. power, data, system integrated... and, quite. like, car engine quiet... not like a loud obnoxious construction-site generator obnoxious.   but, i think the 'rentable' aspect of this is just as much the real key to it as the ability to buy one. just use the app the auto-manufacturer has, it auto has city-state-location.. or gives you the option to change them if you want... lets you schedule a rent date, time, length, etc ... it (they, the app/manufacturer) organize all the local places that have the trailers.. be it a dealership, an enterprise, wherever) .. gives you a code... you pull up 24/7, enter the, say, 10 digit code, or use the NFC chip in the phone or something to connect with it...  the trailer unlocks, you get to hook it up... drive away. the TOS license/insurance agreement are all arranged through the app.   when you drop it off, same deal.  no people, no paperwork (outside of the initial sign up at the dealership when you buy the car) ... you're in the program, rent the trailer, move on with life.  you get billed ... on your monthly car payment deal.   ...also all viewable via the app ... so you can get breakdowns of the bill and such.  would make life 10x easier, faster, and.. ....completely relieve range anxiety as... ...you'd be at most a gas station away.   hell, make a trailer-type that's a giant battery bank if you want... vs a gas/diesel/cng -powered engine.  but, it'd take longer to charge and prob wouldn't last as long.  batteries have a lot lower [energy density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials) than hydrocarbons ... you should check out /r/energystorage ... it's a little sub/r I created a year or two ago to 'dump' energy storage related articles and such I run across.  ... just keeping up with what goes on in those fields.   I like ev's. a lot. I don't like range anxiety. I like diesels. a lot. esp vw's diesel efficiencies. for vw to slap an engine-type that's as efficient as their tdi's in a trailer like this that accompanies some ev they make... (it'd be even higher fuel economy than 70mpg that I was getting with the '09 jetta tdi because of the lack of variability in the power demands.. prob like 100mpg? hell, higher than that probably! .. granted some would be lost through the conversion, but how much really esp at those short lengths? ie, trailertocar... 10ft? 15ft of cable? 25ft tops?) .... .... um... best of both worlds. packaged loans and/or rental deals. matching colors (potentially). etc. super convenient and much more environmentally friendly than even a clean diesel. alright, i'm done. i've repeated myself like 50x at this point.  edit: oh, i remember now what I forgot to add! Audi   HTC have Tony Stark/ironman/RDJ ... get them to make a deal such that the app that controls it all is android/HTC friendly.  if it's a 'universal trailer'... like, i can use the vw trailer with a ford of this design.. or, vice versus, you get basic standard features.. ...but, if it's an HTC-Audi/VW trailer with an Audi/VW car? make them super-integrated.    kinda like offering the basic b.s. if you just hook 'em up... but, if they're 'matching', you get extra access to their 'special features' that gives the on screen information a LOT more ... well, info, tweakability, etc.   just for the shits of it. but, an HTC+VW/Audi joint campaign like that? I think would be pretty freakin' bad ass   silly string today, pepper spray tomorrow, tear gas on wednesday, chemical weapons on thursday, and biological weapons on friday.   things are developing quite nicely in the [toy-drone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105629/) end towards their ability to be weaponized   I don't disagree. and, I'm of the opinion that it *should* be used ... ...with a court order signed by a judge, and a lot of accountability to the process in such that it's very well documented who's using it, why, when, how, for what purposes, using which court order signed by which judge for which specific case or investigation.     I would definitely need a gas car to drive to my parents place  still don't understand why pure-electric manufacturers don't make a petro-fueled generator-trailer...  make it look like the car, same color, uses the same key to unlock it, etc.  hook it up to the hitch, plug it into the electrical system (power, data, etc) .... fill it up with fuel... drive.  the engine/generator would be designed to do one thing.... at one single power-rating: provide electricity.    no variability, no 'ups   downs' in power output to match driving-type.  it literally is designed to do one (maybe two) speeds: 1) provide electricity to charge batteries 2) provide a bit more juice to charge batteries *while* adjusting to the average demand of that. specific. trip. up to that point.  if the batteries get above, say, 10-15 miles of juice left. it turns off.  if they dip below 10 miles of juice left, the engine turns on and provides power until the batteries are both fully charged, and the power-demand is met.  not much different than, say, a phone.  ie, like a G3 :) or, even better, my M8.  plugged in, it both powers the phone   charges the battery. once the battery is full, the charge-controller switches to battery until it drops to, say, 95%, then it powers the phone and charges the battery again.  say you get to where you're going (your 500km away destination). you back it up in a back parking spot at your hotel, your parents house, the local dealership for your car, 'rest area', 'charging station' wherever 'deals' have been made to allow for parking generators (maybe for a small fee if an independent ... like a gas station, rest area, commercial/retail-location parking lot, wherever... ... or, if a dealership, hotel, whatever, park for free.  disconnect it, lock it up (just like you would a car), leave it for the duration of your 'local trip'. drive around trailer-less  or, better, make them 'rentable' *from* the local dealership, enterprise, whatever place chooses to rent 'range extender trailer-generators'.  ...hell, if you rent one from, say, Enterprise? get to park it *at* the local Enterprise while you're at your trip's destination... either paying a reduced 'holding fee' for your trip... or, if there long enough or motivatd enough, returning it to them only to pick up another one at a pre-scheduled time a week later after your trip... ..only to drop *that* one off at your local enterprise location once you return home.  just a 'thing' that's 'bugged me' for a few years now about range anxiety and ev's.  but, to (continue to) elaborate on it a bit: the size of the engine-trailer towed would be relative to the size of the car. make all cars you want to have this option be upgraded to handle it.   in such: the trailer is being trailed, not a part of the weight of the car itself... so, no need for suspension of the car to be upgraded to handle the added weight.  the brakes would need to be strong enough to handle it, but if you combine regenerative braking with slightly increased rotors   pads... it'd adjust around this ~1000lbs in added weight.  the generator *can* have a few speeds... an 'idle' of course, thouhg this would be used rarely as the engine would be more designed to just 'turn on/turn off' at predetermined power-demand points communicated from the car *to* the trailer.   then a different speed based on demand.... with a 'full' speed being strong enough to power the car at '100% electrical demand' as *well* have 'excess power' to charge the batteries at a 'realistic rate'.     the entire thing has a data cable designed to hook into the car's onboard computer in such that the indash interface (or phone or other app) can control it   need to get gas? simply pull over and.. fill the generator up with gas/diesel.  The power fluctuations are minimal. no 'stop   go' b.s.  very controlled, very predictable power curves. designed for efficiency, *not* performance (you're pulling a trailer after all, it's *not* like you're taking 90 degree turns at lightening speeds or trying to go 0-60 like none other)  the smaller the car? the smaller the trailer'd need to be... so, it scales up   down with the car size.   again, best if made by the manufacturer for that specific model... ie, model-specific, and even cooler if designed to look like a part of the car (same color, same key, etc... ...if purchased, *not* rented, of course) .. ...  stealing one? would be the same as stealing a car and/or a trailer. thus, fines, potential prison time, etc.    either way, would definitely 'hybridize' things, as well provide a solution to range anxiety ... while *also* reducing the amount of time an electric has to pull over to 'refill' their energy requirements (gas pumps a *lot* faster than even 960v supercharger charging stations, if such high voltage fast-charge stations even exist... I *think* Finland or Norway or somewhere was talking about doing 720v or even 840v stations, but I can't find a link)  I really like ev's though. TONS of power and almost immediately.  I also like the idea (again, being an Audi/quattro fan) of independently powered tires.... Teslas X has dual engines, with a more traditional mechanical system to control power output per tire... per axle....  ...I forget why Musk said he went with a dual-engine (front/back) with the Model X vs 4 independent engines per tire... has something to do with weight/efficiency ... but, the idea that you can power an individual tire with an independent engine and, thus, control on a microsecond level the power output per tire... traction, turning, etc... ...  as *well* the fact that the power from the electric motor *to* the tire is almost immediate... no (significant) build up in power needed... vs a gas engine... ...instant full-power torque *and* the handling to match.  the weight can be centered differently as well such as to balance the car side to side / front to back axises, as well it can have a really low-to-the-ground weight deal... so the car (truck, suv, sav, hybrid design, whatever) *isn't* top-heavy....  fast! fun! efficient!   I'm incredibly excited for the future of the car  me too! esp since much of the tech seemingly overlaps with that of phones.  I'm sure the OP is getting a bit annoyed with our car talk on his G3 self-post. so I'm gonna chime out of this but... that last quote is definitely a shared sentiment :)   From [this article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markpmills/2015/03/12/oil-glut-more-surprises-in-store-after-the-u-s-storage-shortage-plays-out/) it reads like they're likely to *continue* to 'trend lower' ... for a *while*   more 'history' than 'weapons' but...    read my other comments on this. you're associating one thing with another, incorrectly, and lumping them into the same category.  again, there's a difference between having just a database of what would've been publicly available information (at the time) anyway, and tracking your whereabouts without your permission   I think the key word being ['against'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc) you in a court of law...  but, it's still public information. and lots of stats could be pulled from it. from an urban planning perspective, it makes a lot of sense    that 'shake' would probably annoy me too  it's just from how the power is communicated, but, *for* it to be communicated that way... is sloppy design, imo. they could've adjusted the computer to compensate.  hell, prob still can/will with an update.   TDI Jetta  my ex had one. probably still does. great car. had the torque of the diesel on the low end, then had the turbo that'd kick in around 1800rpm... so on both levels (off the line, or passing) you could get power almost instantly.   was great for overtaking cars on the interstate (or slower speeds) because they'd never expect that it could pick up that quickly.  That I drove that thing around for a few years while dating her... and, with *both* of us in the car, *regularly* got 65mpg ... and, not over the trip, but over an entire tank.  on individual trips (even trips that were 15-50 miles) we would quite often get 70+ mpg.  and, that was with*out* low rolling resistance tires and a few other 'tweaks'.    granted, this was on the '08-'10 model. they changed it in '11-and-on .... long story there and it still pisses me off, but, needless to say, the newer tdi's don't get the same fuel economy that that year-range did.  what you were saying about your friends not being in the best condition: that's part of the 'problem' with diesels, the engines often well outlast the rest of the car.... *esp* in the case of Jettas.  the window button or volume knob, or some other stupid thing is more likely to break than the engine.  the door start to pop off the frame or the .... the countless tiny little things that go wrong in cars as they age ... ...and, that *aren't* easily, likely, or inexpensively replaced. ...and, even if they are, they look odd.  ha!  like how you differentiated the DI from the T :)   A3 diesel  I believe [they do actually](http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-audi-a3-tdi-sportback-photos-and-info-news)... but it looks big! I mean, i guess it isn't Q5 big... competes more with a tiguan .. prob the same frame?   but, again, the fuel economy. it's just small... 2.0L 150hp?  I don't even see why they'd build it. I'm glad Audi's going over to diesel... didn't realize until looking at that article that they had so many models with a diesel option (A6, A7, A8, Q5, Q7 ... A3)  .... would *really* like to see them including the fuel efficiency tech VW does.  I highly doubt (obviously I could look this up but i'm being lazy) that the Q5 or Q7 tdi gets the same fuel economy that the tdi touareg does.   it's really freakin' nice not having to fill a car up every week. Getting 700+ miles per tank is just awesome.  kinda brings me back to the Tesla thing... the idea of plugging in and *not* having to go to a gas station... ...is one of the reasons I've often found myself wanting a n.gas powered Honda with the at home [PHIL station](http://www.cngnow.com/vehicles/refueling/Pages/refueling-at-home.aspx) ...   what I'd *really* like to see is a vw fuel economy-style TDI coupled with a plug-in hybrid. to have ~250 miles of fuel + batteries (ie, smaller fuel tank with space shifted to batteries) .... would be awesome, imo.   but, Tesla. As much as I like that touareg, I've got my eyes set on the Model X :)  but, yeah, my neighbor has a barn with like 25 cars in it.  some are much more bad ass than others, ... he kinda goes about it the 'wrong' way imo. I've talked to him about adjusting it but he's not the sharpest tool in the tool box. his money, who am I to judge. but... yeah. I really see multiple cars as pretty much the way to go. I've had 4 at one time, personally, and... once you get the redundancy of b.s. taken care of (keys, garage door openers, random little shit that you have in one car and don't realize you need until you realize you *don't* have it in the other car!) ... it's bad ass.  esp if one has fuel and the other doesn't :)  ....again, going to gas stations to fill up irks the ever living shit out of me for some reason. This entire process seems so... .... 'socially humbling' at this point. Imagine all the 'plug-in' 'snobs' who just drive by gas stations and laugh as they 'remember' :)   that jat's sexy. it's sexy now. it'll be sexy in 50 years (just like [this one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Jaguar-E-Type-1967-jaguar-xke-series-1-roadster-fully-restored-numbers-matching-/251879735425?forcerrptr=true hash=item3aa533c081 item=251879735425 pt=US_Cars_Trucks) .... sexier even, honestly, and obviously a better drive. not to say that that car *isn't* sexy, classy as fuck, and would be a blast to drive... but, the two *hardly* compare in tech-available).... ....and, probably, like that one, a few hundred grand! (*not* adjusting for inflation!)   but, yeah, give it 2-5 years for the price curve to adjust, buy one, park it like Cameron's dad in Ferris Bueler, say '[f' the kids](https://sheofferedthemchrist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bd931-cameronsdadscar.jpg), they'll get over their fucking issues... and I'll pay for the therapy to help them do so with the profits from the sale of the car ... if it ever happens'  ;)  the point with the atom is just to say you can get one helluv an awesome driving car for a lot less (if you go used) ... saving the other for... well... i don't know.  those lotus' are pretty freakin' awesome cars! fun too! from what I hear   and that's what the jews said about the romans relative to *their* databases   record keeping as well.... and I'm sure the same was said about the Egyptians before them.  There isn't anything inherently wrong about keeping databases and making records. That people always jump to nefarious SS-like purposes is ridiculous. There's a big difference between keeping records and abusing those records.  ...and, *not* keeping records has never stopped anyone from being an asshole and abusing their position of power .   ...sure it may make it a bit easier and a bit more systematic, as well allow for a larger scale up to happen on a faster level but...   well, again, it's the intent. not the existence-of. that this society has become so 'Nazi-label-happy' is beyond old... *and* cliche at this point   yeah, actually.  what's the difference between a cop sitting on the corner of main   x street for a few hours watching cars go by and taking note of the same car having gone by a dozen times  and an automated system doing it?  it's a public space. It's not like they're putting an app on your phone with location data and following you around and recording the data w/out your permission.. ....it's a public area.  two old dudes in a rocking chair and a pen   pad could do the same thing   I'm not proposing the data be openly available to the public upon request or some .gov accessible license plate searchable database so that the pissed off guy who got cut off earlier can track the daily habits of the car that cut them off... ....nor am I even saying that officer traffic cop or detective snoop can do it... .... w/out access to a court order *allowing* for the specific search.. be it for a singular license plate, or pattern recognition post a bombing or other terrorist attack.   ....or, hell, in the case of a stalking or restraining order violation, but, again, with a court order from a judge on a monitored database with accurate logs kept of what was searched for, by whom, when, and under which court order signed by which judge for which case number.  again, it's already public information: people driving around on public streets *is* public information. keeping a database of that isn't such an outlandish thing.    x-post: /r/transhumanism   did that actually make any sense?? I know it definitely wasn't something the average 5 year old would understand   bah. There's a big difference between the NSA spying on citizens w/out them knowing and an atm, cop, or other camera source recording what goes on on public roads and keeping a record of random license plates driving by.  it's only when someone starts doing something with the data that it becomes 'police state'-like ... just keeping it on record somewhere to then be pulled up by a warrant isn't really the same thing, imo.  It's probably being done *any*way, why not just make it 'public-enough' knowledge that the records *are* stored... and accessible with a court order for crime solving?    did an edit to that comment to include links to products *I* recommend.   you may try external application of iodine as well... you don't want to take iodine tincture internally, but for topical application it works great.  try [this stuff](http://www.walmart.com/ip/17325269?wmlspartner=wlpa adid=22222222227014441176 wl0= wl1=g wl2=c wl3=40754235632 wl4= wl5=pla wl6=78606870512 veh=sem), it's cheap and it won't stain your toes because its 'white' iodine.  (it still stains a little, so be careful with woodwork and the such but, overall, it doesn't stain like normal iodine... both normal tincture *and* the lugol's linked to in the other comment).  ointments, gels, all of that? won't make it under the nailbed. Hell, even the external iodine application won't... but it'll fight it back one helluva lot... ...and, the Lugol's will come out from inside the skin as it builds up.  taking iodine isn't something you just 'start doing'... ...you need to follow loading protocols, but once you've gotten over the initial 'hump' of loading, you can take as much of it as you want and your body will simply urinate it out  ... ....until your body 'learns' how to handle it though, you need to start low   slow. like, 1 drop a day low. for a month. seriously. like, that low.  but, then increase by about 1dpd per week until you're at whatever dose you feel you need to be.   at that, your body will push the fungus out of the internal parts... so it'll only be what's on the skin surface... and under the nail, unfortunately... but, soak it in the tincture for a while too and it'll eventually make its way under and.. ...from there, kill the fungus back in no time.  if it were somewhere easier, like... say... ringworm on your arm or something? you'd probably kill it back in a week with iodine tincture. but, under the nail sucks ass. I haven't had it personally, but I've friends   family who have, as well read *plenty* about it.  but, in that, i've read enough to know that iodine's the way to go. anything else is just a waste of time, energy, and money.  no, that's not true actually. to save some money, you can take foot baths in hydrogen peroxide.   it isn't as effective as iodine, and you wouldn't want to take a foot bath in iodine (anyway, let alone for the cost of it!) but... with H2O2 you coulud afford to fill the entire bath with it (~$1 for 32oz bottle of H2O2... vs $4 for 2oz iodine bottle) ... and it'll help to kill off the surface shit.  H2O2's a bit of a larger molecule than singular-atom iodine, so it won't penetrate as deeply into the nailbed, but, it's cheaper and... easier probably.   should help to keep it contained and fight it back a bit.. ...while the iodine fights it back more.      I like the A3, a lot actually. I'm not entirely sure that'd be the route I'd go if I were going for a smaller hatchback though.  I'm a big fan of the Audi/VW diesels.  The TDi's get great gas mileage. I'd prob shoot for a tdi jetta wagon over an A3. I know that sounds crazy but the mpg almost makes it worth it.  I mean, at that level, you're not really going for a 'performance vehicle' as much as practicality.  I had a friend that had the A6 Allroad back in the day. was a bad.ass.car! really really fun to drive!  Honestly, what I'm looking hard at are the new diesel touaregs. I have an '04 then an '05 (flipped the '04 driving it in a back road much like the video of the jag... ...really weird circumstances. kinda the single problem with where... well, in the video, how i said an awd would compensate...  ... granted VW used the 4-motion and *not* the quattro design on the '04 touareg but.... when they get two wheels off the ground (like, you're tipping the vehicle) the tires will actually spin to build up momentum... a 'gravity' so to speak in *order* to bring the car back to the ground.  I 'knew' what I was doing around this turn... and, in a 2wd I'd've managed it, or even a less-smart AWD but... I was going around this turn at around 60mph (hairpin turn) and was raising this 6800lb car off its right tires... (seriously.. was really f'in fun though!) ... anyway, the tires built up momentum to bring the car back down... ...but, I was doing that *any*way... again, I knew what i was doing! ;)  anyway, when i was letting off the wheel to start to straighten out, thus, lowering the car back down (ie, where that 'shake' in the wheel of the Jag would drive me apeshit!) .... the chip had *just* shifted power to the outside wheel to do this 'gravity spin' thing.... and, at that exact moment, the torque in them was just starting to build up.   the moment the tires hit the ground the entire right side of the car (ie, the outside tires) hit the ground, grabbed the road as they got traction and totally jerked the wheel really hard left.. went off the road *to* the left, off a sort of 'cliff' that was about 8ft tall through a few trees, down the hill, and slammed into this big fucking tree that knocked the car to the right... thus, flipping it over.     I 'came to' with my head down in the floorboard of the passenger side, my feet at the driverside headrest ... and had to climb out the sunroof.   was fucking hilariously fun! like, really really f'in fun. Lucky as hell I live, let a*lone* walked away... had a mild concussion (probably) but otherwise was fine!  fucking car is a tank. seriously. The touareg, the Q5, Cayenne, etc.  that touareg had the same frame as the cayenne, same air suspension, and same transmission... ....the engine was the 4.2L V8 Audi was using at the time, and the off road controls were, again, VW's 4-Motion.   ....designed more for offroad than performance driving but... I drove the shit out of that car.  luckily my insurance had 1) accident forgiveness and 2) full vehicle replacement.  ended up not only getting a *better* equipped '05, but also pocketed $5k off the deal because the dollar/euro ratio at the time.     granted I totaled the next one too, but that's only because the idiot drunk pulled out in front of me... at 40mph and he did a u-turn right in front of me, across my lane... at about 10ft.  was in a 4-runner. completely ripped his car to shit. like, tore both driver-side wheels off their axel.. literally, snapped the axle on both tires. absolutely tore into the car... it was a crushed can by the time we pulled them apart.  but, the t-reg was.... well, totaled. but, me? i was fine! fucking car is a life saver. literally a fast driving tank  the TDi's of those years was unbelievably powerful. ridiculous torque. not as fun to drive but that wasn't it's m.o.   towing was.  the new tdi's in them get something like 750 miles per ~21gal tank.  and also have a lot of power.  really like those cars. thinking about getting one. the interior isn't 'Audi' but it all but is. they have a really high-quality finish, imo.  not like a standard vw.  not that that's bad, but a vw isn't an audi on the controls (ie, 'sense' :)   but... neither would a TDi wagon be an A3.   I can't remember if they make the A3 in diesel... but even if they do, Audi only *incorporates* some of vw's diesel tech, doesn't straight use it.  ... unfortunately, as VW has the best diesels out there, imo.  I have *no* doubt that jag would be a fucking *blast* to drive! seriously... the v6 in the vid *and* the v8! ... i'm just not sure it'd be where I'd throw $75k.  there're other cars I'd rather have for that much cash... ...hell, maybe even spread it across *two* cars.  I've always wanted an Ariel Atom! :)   obv not anything *near* the same... but, I think the Jag is built as much for sex appeal as it is driving performance.   for what it's worth? It's probably perfect.. ...but, I'd prefer a used one in a few years that to throw down that much for a new one.     Start taking [diatomaceous earth](http://www.amazon.com/Diatomaceous-Earth-Food-Grade-10/dp/B00025H2PY)   [Lugol's iodine](http://www.amazon.com/J-CROWS%C2%AE-Lugols-Solution-Iodine-2oz/dp/B001AEFM9Y/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc ie=UTF8 qid=1426498154 sr=1-2 keywords=j+crow%27s+lugol%27s+iodine+solution+2+oz). $35 for a year supply of both off Amazon and the toes (and a whole lotta other things!) will clear up and not be a problem again.   Like the education you get when your 5lb drone gets destroyed by a milit-ton aircraft :)   sometimes 'common sense' needs to be 'programmed' into the laws, unfortunately. but, I hear ya   I never owned a BB so I really can't say anything one way or another about it.  If I were in the market for a car like that... I'm not sure the Jag'd be the route I'd go.  Not that it isn't an absolutely gorgeous car... they've *clearly* done an excellent job. sexy as fuck. seriously.  but... $65k's... a lot of money.  The guy in the vid says he'd buy it over a porsche 911, even admitting that that's 'a big admission'... I'd have to drive both.  I'd prefer a Tesla. seems faster and doesn't make that raspy 'kerplunk-plunk' sound that was getting on my nerves every time it happened.  Also, notice how around the middle of the video when he's at that point where he's not just going into the steepest part of the turn, but also beginning to come back out of it... it happens twice, maybe 3x... ...the ~2m35s mark (start at 2m28s) ... you can see the vibrations in the steering wheel, him fighting it as the traction of the car adjusts around the turn.  not only would that annoying the everliving shit out of me, you also wouldn't get that in a Porsche or Audi... the awd would adjust around it, compensating the traction to match the angle of the turn.  the Tesla would do this too.     not sure why they'd *not* adjust around this when designing the car. it'd bug the shit out of me.   again, sexy ass car, clearly fast, handles well from best I can tell... but, again, for $65-70k, not the one I'd go for.  edit: [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Jaguar-XK-E-Roadster-1966-jaguar-xke-roadster-matching-s-blue-tan-soft-top-4-2-l-motor-w-tripple-su-/221713020966?forcerrptr=true hash=item339f203826 item=221713020966 pt=US_Cars_Trucks) I'd rather have that :)  (there are others on ebay that I'd prefer even more, but... they're 2-3x the price!  but, old jags are sexy. as. fuck!  but, when it comes to driving performance, they still don't take the cake. it's still too much of an 'image thing' over a 'driving thing' ...and, I like sexy, but it takes a second or third slot to function. she may look great, but if she doesn't 'put out right', fuck 'er, I'll find me another that will :)     I really have nothing to add because I agree with all of it.  my only wonder is: what if they put radar into drones in such that the drone could detect an oncoming 'something' and be auto-programmed to 'take action' (which would basically mean turn off the engines and drop as quickly as possible ... turning engines back on once the 'minimal safe distance' is achieved and/or the ground is right there)  again,with everything else you've written... totally agree. nothing to add.   	199
 How Reaper would have ended  http://cliqueclack.com/tv/2010/02/01/how-reaper-would-have-ended-straight-from-the-creators/   Ratings were marginal, although it was up against American Idol, which was a ratings juggernaut back then.  I really thought it was a good show. Ray Wise was great fun as the devil.    Champion!   You can watch the trailer for "DOOMED! The Untold Story of Roger Corman's THE FANTASTIC FOUR" and see what you think.  http://youtu.be/mNLcjWIzQHM   The movie was made seriously on the cheap and a lot of the people who worked on the film took very little money to work on it in the hopes that the exposure of being in a major, superhero film would pay off for them.  Ooops.   That was...not good.  The parking garage fight was just a lot of guys randomly flailing at each other and once they get into the elevator, they just wave huge knives around in the air until everyone falls down.   I'm actually a big fan of smart, mixed-used development. But, as I noted above, there were a lot of unaddressed issues with The Lighthouse project, especially with respect to transit and infrastructure. Wang though he could just ignore them and push the project through by setting deadlines that he insisted the local authorities had to meet.  Not to mention the fact that the development rights to the area around the Coliseum were and are tremendously valuable. Why should Nassau give them away for free just because Wang happens to own a hockey team?   And, since this is Nassau County, the bribe envelopes were probably just way too light.   Hey, you're young and swingin'  No time to think about tomorrow  But there ain't no way to deny it  Some day, you're gonna buy it.  Plan today,  Go with Ferryman tomorrow!  Ferryman, Ferryman,  he's the man with the plot, the man with the plan!  Ferryman, Ferryman,  He's the mortician man who loves you!  A lot!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG9Xj5cCSZk      Wang wanted to build a huge, mixed use development around the area of the Coliseum, the Lighthouse Project. Problem was, there are a lot of issues with dropping a huge development like that into the heart of one of the most densely-packed counties int he nation. And, from what I remember, all of the serious issues, from traffic to parking to water and sewer, were essentially dismissed with head pats hand waves.  When that fell though, Wang turned around and asked Nassau to foot the bill for a 400 million building, which the people of Nassau wisely rejected.  It's sad that the Islanders are leaving, but these kind of huge development boondoggles can haunt local governments for decades if they go all pear shaped. Ask the Brooklynites how the Atlantic Yards thing is working out for them.      I still consider Dragonslayer one of the best Fantasy movies of all time. It engages seriously with a lot of the classic fantasy elements and slyly comments on them as well.  And, then there's this   No, of course not. They never do tests. Not many real deeds either. Oh, conversation with your grandmother's shade in a darkened room, the odd love potion or two, but comes a doubter, why, then it's the wrong day, the planets are not in line, the entrails are not favorable, "we don't do tests"!   Bah, this could be such a cool show and they morph it into another CBS procedural.  Limitless would be cool as a Fugitive (or Incredible Hulk, if you prefer) "man on the run" show. You could still have the procedural element as the main character solves crimes and helps the downtrodden as he's tries to avoid being caught by the shadowy government agency that wants him dead and looks for the secret to NZT before he runs out.  Actually, sounds a lot like The Hulk. Man, I loved that show.   I'd say that L.A. Story is my favorite Steve Martin movie, but this one is certainly one of my favorites. It's such a rare thing for a romantic comedy to have both good romance and good comedy.  Martin is just so good as a romantic, leading man in this film, it's a little sad that he didn't do it more often in his career. And Daryl Hannah, while not bringing a lot to the table acting-wise, is at her peak hotness.  Plus I love that the nose is just so over-the-top, cartoonish and ridiculous, but everyone just plays it straight.   I asked my wife to marry me in a similar fashion.   No cake, though. Ring rolled in a note tucked inside a piece of 1930's-era art pottery.   Here's what it means.  We're not going to pay you any actual money because we don't have any. Even though one of the biggest reasons for startups to fail is under capitalization, and not being able to pay employees is a huge, red flag, not to mention illegal,  we'd like you to risk everything on this supremely bad bet.    But, in the unlikely event that the company takes off and your equity is actually worth something, rest assured we'll find a way to screw you out of that too.   Not me.   I don't mind a few ads, but because their ad inventory is so limited you see the same fucking ad over and over and over again.  I binge watched The Good Wife on Hulu+ and the only way I stayed sane was by pulling the earbud out of my ear whenever the ads started to roll.   In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.   Did you actually sign a non-compete agreement?  It's pretty unheard of for non-competes to be enforced against low-paid, hourly workers. Generally, you need to be fairly high up in the food chain and the business has to have legitimate business interests to protect, clients, trade secrets, etc. They can't enforce a non-compete just because they don't want you to work somewhere else.  What state do you live in? Non-compete laws vary widely by state and some states don't allow them at all.   Maybe he was dictating.   Generally, mandatory tip out/tip pools are limited to employees who regularly receive tips. A valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips, such as dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors.   http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs15.htm   Here's a more complete account, for those of you reticent to give clicks to WND.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2010610/The-Ghost-Boy-The-uplifting-story-Martin-Pistorius-survived-mystery-paralysis-love.html   You don't have to type up an official letter. You're an intern.  Once you have a solid job offer from campus IT (very important), just meet with your boss as soon as possible and let him know when your last day is going to be.   For something like this, it's always good to thank him for the opportunity and tell him how much you've enjoyed working there. Then ask if there's anything he wants you to finish up or document before you leave.  Then shake his hand and say thanks again.   Have you tried replacing the .htaccess file with a a blank one and then setting the permalink settings again?  I could probably help you with this, but you're probably better asking on /r/WordPress   Yeah, over 20 days you should get 2880 elves max from spawning and a potential 240 from tapping the elf cave, although in practice it would be pretty hard to do that unless you log in every eight hours on the dot.  That's 2920 elves. According to my calculations, the cogwheels to elf ratio is roughly 1.2. Tapped elves drop four cogwheels roughly 30% of the time. So your theoretical cogwheel max is 3504 from elves. Plus another 200 from your daily bonus once a week. That's 3704, which gets you to a level 16 cannon.   You're still over 3000 short from level 20.   I'd like to see some DC animated stuff on the CW in prime time. I'm a little surprised that this hasn't happened already.   I'd say Arrow took about a half a season to really hit its stride. Things started to come together with the Huntress arc and really took off once Slade Wilson and Felicity Smoak became regulars.    Bottom line? The show is just a lot more fun than Arrow.  Don't get me wrong. I like Arrow and I think it's a fine and entertaining show, but we've seen a lot of that stuff before in other places. A lot of the tone is similar to what we got in the Nolan Batman movies.   Flash is a more accessible character. The show has kept the brooding and self-loathing to a minimum and played up the lighter, more entertaining aspects of the story. Barry has a cool power and he enjoys it.  Plus, the CW really caught lightning in a bottle with Grant Gustin. He's got a ton of charisma .   You also might want to consider the possibility that you're being hazed. Blue collar jobs often involve some hazing of newbies. I could see that expecting you to remember the whole schedule could be a joke they're playing on you.   What kind of idiot runs a company based like this based on employee memory? You're talking about over a hundred different bits of data every week. I have a very good memory and there's no way I could handle that.   What is it that your "too slow" about? If it takes you a couple minutes to look up data on a spreadsheet the world grinds to a halt? That's just very odd.   Some interesting responses so far.   I've always been the guy, when random new things come up, I figure out how to make them work. That's kind of how I started doing web pages. I wrote my first CGI program in compiled DOS basic so it would run on an EMWACS web server.   I'm also the guy who often figures out what the solution to a problem is, even if I don't personally have the skill set to implement it. I can usually find the right tool or the odd bit of software or the best person to do a job. Plus I have a knack for listening to people's problem and finding out what the real issue is and how to solve it in principle at least before we even get to the technology part of it.  I have one old client who calls me up when he has these kinds of seemingly intractable problems. But how would you market and monetize that to other people?   Hey, I'm a lot smarter than anyone you have working for you. If you have something nobody you work with can figure out, I probably can.  Sounds pretty dubious and not a little bit douchey.   I believe that it is, in fact, mathematically impossible to get to level 20 cannon without dumping atomic shitloads of donuts into buying cogs.  If I did the math correctly, the total number of possible elves over the course of the event is 2880. That's six elves an hour times 24 hours times 20 days for the event.   To get to level 20 you need over 6000+ cogwheels.     Dude, are you telling me that your bosses don't know the phone number for human resources? I find that hard to believe.  That's who you need to call. Tell them you're being paid the tipped minimum wage even though you receive no tips, in clear violation of the FLSA. Even if you were a tipped employee, you would have to be reporting your tips and Applebee's would have to make up the difference if your tips didn't push your earnings up to the minimum wage.  The odds that these people are just shining you on, telling you how hard they're working to correct your pay while not doing anything are pretty good.    Good luck.   I've been doing part-time, freelance IT work for about two decades. I've done all manner of different and varied IT tasks for small and medium sized business.   These days I mostly do WordPress websites, but I have one client, my oldest client, who calls me up when they have random issues that they have no answer for. For example they had a client whose website was built in some crappy, custom , undocumented PHP CMS and I was able to transfer it over to a new server and keep it running for a couple years while the new website was being built.  So, it occurred to me this week that this might be a way I could market myself. I'm a decent enough coder and I have a raft of general IT skills, but my true talent lies in being able to poke at a problem until I find the soft part where the solution lives.  I do a lot of this kind of random problem solving in my day job doing scientific research support.  So, the questions are are these. One, is there a real need for this sort of thing? And two, is there a way to market this without sounding like a self-important douche bag?    Except that this is not true at all.   The US Attorney's office released some "get tough" press release where they said Aaron was potentially facing thirty or fifty years in prison or whatever. They took all the crimes he was charged with, added up the max sentences and voila, he's spending the rest of his life in prison. You see this kind of thing all the time. Blah blah person is facing SIX HUNDRED YEARS in prison or some nonsense.  Except that Federal sentencing doesn't work that. There are guidelines based on intent, damage caused, the number of offenses, etc. Given the circumstances it was very unlikely that Aaron would have gotten more than a year and even possible that he would have gotten off with probation.  It's a little confusing for some people because the CFAA, like a lot of federal crimes has a hefty max penalty, 20 years in this case, but no minimum.   Why was it wrong? What was wrong about it?  Swartz broke the law. He broke it knowingly and caused a lot of issues for people on the MIT campus.  It's certainly not unreasonable for a US Attorney to want him to spend a few months as a guest of the Federal Government because of that.  It was sad that he killed himself, but that's nobody's fault but his own. We don't even know that killed himself because of the prosecution. He didn't leave a note or other indication.    What's the point of that? If donuts don't give you much of an advantage, people won't buy them.   I'm thinking I might quit the game for a couple weeks. The whole tap the elves thing is boring as hell and there's no way I'm getting the island at this point.   I know, right. Every time I hang out Mike Colter he's all like, "The  Wire is the best show ever on television"   And I have to go, "Dude, you know I love you, but season 5 still stinks"   The other reason to ask for a higher number is to discourage this from happening in the future, at least discourage it from happening routinely.  I assume that, since you quit, you don't want to work there anymore. If they feel they can call you back at your old salary, what's to stop them from doing it all the time?  If they really really need you to come back and train their new hire as a one time thing, double your original rate is very cheap. If they don't really need you to train this new person or if they actually want to see if they can get you to come back in and do more work from time to time, then double your rate is too expensive and they won't pay it. By this method, you determine their true intent.    The correct answer is at least double your regular hourly rate.   Look, you're doing them a big favor here by coming back and training their new hire after giving them more than ample time to find a replacement. The least they can do is pay you for your time and inconvenience.  And tell them you want payment in advance.   The only thing I would say here is not to make a decision out of fear. You've got a year to go before your job might go away. Don't take a demotion and less money because of that.  A year is a long time. Anything can happen between now and then.  Believe in your own value. If it were me, I'd call the recruiter and tell him that you're not interested in a Tier 2 job. You've got the requisite experience and have been working in the Tier 3 role for some time and you can't see any good reason to take a step down in salary and responsibility.  Of course, that's easy for me to say. It's not my job on the line. But with a year to go, a good skill set and the economy on the upswing, I like your chances.   Good luck.    You're being seriously underpaid. How are you getting your work? Is there some middleman or agency that's finding work for you?  What subjects are you writing about?   Why would you consider taking this offer? What's the point of going down in title and responsibility for a $5K bump?   Do they offer something else that you want? Is there more opportunity at the new place? And why would you even think that you're a "self-entitled jerk" because you're unhappy that they pulled a bait and switch on you?    The underlying idea  is very cool.   Scientists devise a way to record experiences and play them back. Not unlike Strange Days (1995). Some guy dies while wearing the recording headset and then the race is on to get that tape.  It's worth watching, if you've never seen it. I believe ut was Natalie Wood's last movie.   Brainstorm (1983)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTYRH3xpt44   Approach it like it's just something they overlooked.   "Hey Boss, I'm sorry to bring this up, but I checked the provincial overtime regulations and blah blah blah. I just wanted to bring this to your attention because we could be in trouble because it seems like we're not following them."  For a small business with few employees, they may not know all the relevant regulations. Even if it's an intentional oversight, playing it like it's an innocent mistake lets them correct the error and save face.   I don't think you have to mention the other job at all. You work there five days a month. What you do the rest of the time is none of their business.  Just tell the Job A boss that you've decided that driving an hour and a half to work four hours just doesn't make sense for you anymore but that you'd be willing to telecommute. Then stop talking and see what he says.  Be prepared with particulars, how they'd verify that you're working, how the work would get done, etc, but wait until asked.  Then just be polite and firm about it.    Wordpress   Except that if you had a magic space drive that could give you constant, limitless 9.8m/s^2 acceleration, you'd reach near light speed in less than a year and make the 4.24 ly trip in something like five years.    You've made an error. The universe is not Newtonian. It is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light.  After about 354 days at 1g acceleration you've reached nearly the speed of light and traveled about half a light year. After that, you travel at close to light speed until you turn around and decelerate.   So you spend a year traveling .5 light years. Coast at .9 C for about four years and then turn around and decelerate for a year.  That's about five years or so for a magical 1g drive to get to Proxima.   Any company that fires people when they give notice doesn't get notice. That's all part of the karma wheel.  Also, all commissions earned must be paid. You can take them to court if they don't.  Congratulations and good luck in your new adventure.   It always is.   You need to be compensated for any time spent on work tasks assigned to you by your employer. If they ask you to come in for a meeting on your off day, they must pay you for that. If they ask you to complete a self-evaluation form, they must pay you for that. If they expect you to study materials they provide to you so you can pass a test they give you, they must pay you for that.  In my job, I have a lot material to read, understand and pass tests on to remain qualified. All of the time I spend doing that is paid.  Frankly, a lot of this stuff sounds cuckoo bananas to me. I'd be looking for the exit door ASAP.   I don't know whether you can do the work or not, but I can tell you that everyone feels like this at one time or another. Google "Imposter Syndrome" and read up on it. It's very common.  Nobody knows everything. Everybody has to look shit up.   Put your head down, work hard, use your brain and if you feel unsure of yourself, just fake it 'til you make it.  Good luck!    I loved this movie. My friends and I used quote it to each other all the time.   "We only have sex twelve times a year"  "Once a month is not too bad"  "No, nothing all year and then twelve times in one night"  I think this ones is the list of movies that could never, ever be made today.    First a plum, then a banana...I think I know what he is trying to say, eh.    That woman was trying to sell you the Kirby Home Maintenance System. I was a Kirby salesman for a couple of months in 1986.   Nice to see that the basic pitch hasn't changed in nearly 30 years.   Just tell him that vacation days are part of your compensation, just like your salary, health insurance, etc. They're not freebies that the company throws in because they like you.  If there's too much work for you to take time off, that's certainly a problem, but it's not your problem to solve. It's not right for your boss to ask you to forgo time off because there's too much work  any more than it would be right to ask you to skip a paycheck because the company had cash flow issues.  You shouldn't be thinking about snappy comebacks. You need to sit down with your boss at the beginning of the year and tell him that the company gives you X number of days a year for paid time off and you intend to use them, so when would be the best time of the year to schedule them.   It seems pretty dead at the moment. There was no I-Con in 2014 and probably no con in 2015.  It's very sad. My first I-Con was VII, I believe. I worked on the con for many years. And now it's gone.   You can look on fiverr.com and see if there are small jobs you can do for a few dollars here and there.    I don't know about that. I bought a cheapo Acer Chromebook and the battery life is pretty ridiculous. I can usually get eight solid hours of work out of it.   MacBook Pro probably sucks a lot more juice, even though it has a bigger battery.   First, because race, as we commonly talk about it, is a social construct. There is no scientific, biological basis for the concept of race and no credible researcher in the field of human genetics talks about race.  Second, intelligence is a pretty mushy concept. How do we determine one person is more or less intelligent than another? The only tools we have are tests, all of which come with their own racial and cultural biases and very few of which have any success teasing out innate intelligence (whatever that means) from education and culture.  Third, the question has very little value, especially compared to the damage this topic has caused.   So, anyone who really wants to talk about race and intelligence in a serious way is almost certainly ignorant, a crank or a stone racist.    A lot of times, breed rescue organizations will go through local shelters and take all the adoptable dogs in their specific breed. Sometimes they'll even take breed mixes. So what ends up happening is the only dogs you find are pits and pit mixes.   I was telling a guy at work about Blazing Saddles. He's from China and has never seen it.   I had to speak about it somewhat indirectly because you can't say half the things in the movie at work without risking your job.   Not my work. My video editing skills are rudimentary at best and my artistic talent sadly sub par.   I just found it on the interwebs and wanted to share it because I thought it was cool and I love the movie. Glad you enjoyed it.   This film pre-dates the PS2 by 16 years or so.   I don't think I was that impressed with the effects when this came out. It was very different than what I was used to.   I don't think anyone had seen anything like this before, so there was a lot of slack given. This was the first movie to use CGI visual effects for almost all of the space battle scenes.    I loved this movie when it came out. Saw it in the theater with my geek bros the summer after I graduated high school.  It's a little shocking that nobody has seriously talked about re-making this. It has all the YA elements those kids today seem to like. Maybe a lot of people just don't remember it or never heard of it. Maybe the rights are all tied up? Who knows.  And, of course,  who could replace the great Robert Preston?      No mayor is that stupid? Rob Ford? Marion Barry? And those were just two that were in the national news.   The value is pretty low, though. I'd guess that for this game you'd be able to pick up tix on StubHub or TicketExchange for pretty cheap.  Still, if I were a young kid and a big fan I could see doing something like this. Spend a day shoveling out the stadium with your fellow fans and then watch the game knowing that it was partially your sweat that made it possible.    There are no credible arguments against man-made global warming. While there's quite a bit of debate about the range of temperature change, the severity of the issue and so forth, the facts that the global climate is warming and human beings are at least somewhat responsible for it are not in dispute by any reputable scientist who actually studies the issue.  It's important also to understand that "scientist" is a pretty broad category and scientific research is broken up into fairly specialized fields. Someone who is a chemist, for example, has no more standing to talk about the scientific research with respect to climate change than any other well-educated lay person. The fact that you can line up a bunch of people who could be called scientists and get them to cast doubt on this subject means less than nothing, other than that they should know better.   How much do you want to bet that the guy did this on purpose to get some traffic on his website/twitter feed. There are multiple stories about this, many of them on some major sites who link back to his Twitter account.  Seems like $1,200 well spent to me.    Here's the trailer fot the movie.   http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrv4n3_the-great-imposter-trailer-tony-curtis_shortfilms  Not a bad film, for what it was.          Dude, you should Google for Autopen.       By the way, this is Percy (Lemon Beagle pup), Charlie (Great Pyrenees) and Samson (Great Pyrenees Mix).   To answer your direct question, no, you're not an asshole. You've been doing this job for a year without title or compensation. It's more than reasonable to ask for both. If this wasn't a family situation, nobody would even bat an eye.  Obviously there's a question about timing, but when would be good timing? Are you really expected to wait around until he passes away and then a respectful interval afterwards? That could be years.  And really, after all that, there's no guarantee that they don't find another relative to take over the production manager job. It's a family business. That's how they roll. My wife went without a raise for years because the family-owned company she worked for was short on funds. Not so short on funds that they would get rid of the owner's husband's job, which was essentially a no-show.  Whatever they decide to give you, accept it graciously. Then get your resume together and start looking for a new job.      That's awesome. Thanks!   My understanding is that the major actors in the film were mislead and not informed of the porn content of the film. The unsimulated sex acts were shot separately from the main action of the film and edited in.   The songwriter royalty from an iTunes purchase is roughly 9 cents. That means that Spotify made him the same amount of money as about 140,000 iTunes song sales. If you assume that the average iTunes purchaser listens to their song about a hundred times, that's about the same number of "spins" for the same amount of money.   	84
 Does anyone have any articles or information on heart rates that run a little on the high side? I've done some googleing but it's always helpful to see what others have found.        Decided I want to step it up and work towards trying out for US U23 in a year or two. Bring on the steady state.   I don't know what your normal workouts are like but basically yes. And then throw in some extra steady state. So maybe those two workouts and then two days of SS and then weights and whatever other stuff you do, but toned down a bit because you're erging so much. Also these workouts will give you an idea of what to shoot for. Make sure you're negative splitting; it's better for your erg times and your body.   Also the hardest part about erging is the mentality, so that's probably what you need to work on the most. Even though you know the mental erg struggle, it's been awhile and a 2k is hell. So remember that, and keep your focus while you're erging, especially through the long pieces and the last couple sprint pieces.   You just have to work on erging endurance and the best way to do that is by erging. I'd do some (at least four) 500m sprints and then maybe some 3x1k at like a 28 and definitely some steady state (maybe start easy like 2 or 3x15'0 just to get back into the muscle memory of erging). Don't 2k again for another two preferably three weeks.   	4
 Looks great! Good to see cities that aren't just grids full of high density low wealth apartment blocks, and then tons of processor/electronics factories (ie. like most of my cities).  As for what you were thinking? Were you hungry for pretzels at the time perchance?   I think that's what's happening to one of my cities - 17k low wealth visiting shoppers, and I only have like 5000 low wealth goods for sale (although the number of unsatisfied sims isn't that high actually)   Okay, I see it. Should be fixed now, thanks!   Most of it was done on a boring Friday afternoon while working (and then a bit after work), and have been slowly adding stuff to it since.  Not too hard if you have Wordpress and access to a good theme.

"Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult" was one of the best reading experiences I've ever had.  As I read, I would listen to the album/band I was reading about on Spotify in real time and I could hear the evolution of metal as I read - I highly recommend it!   "let us pray."

 Much more worth it. Faster, silent, and less power    They are actually two similar cards. Just that the control panel gets weird sometimes  http://i.imgur.com/oIgFWSU.png   Right click on desktop --  NVIDIA control Panel   Around + 50 to 70% performance gain, depending on the game and if NVIDIA has optimised the drivers for the game   Miles better. I barely got 40FPS on Asetto Corsa on FULL settings with the GTX680 SLi. Now I am getting 100++ FPS   Which card? I've use the GTX980 reference card and it had no problem   You can see at the bottom it's set to the 2nd card   PhysX - GTX970(2)   1. It's at the centre  2. Why would you put a 120Hz monitor on an inferior connection? HDMI won't have the sufficient bandwidth compared to a DVI-D         IIRC it's Grand Chelem   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface  I based my explanation on this + forums and google. Usually when a new driver is announced by AMD/Nvidia, you can read in the update notes things like   Optimised (game name here) for SLi/Crossfire  So that's how we can guess the drivers is the one handling the workload.    Usually the multi GPU setup is optimised by the drivers which will tell the GPU how to allocate the workload. even if the game is not optimised for multi GPU, the driver will make it work   The reaso  for red flag was ambulance on track i think      It's called panning. Focus on the subject, use low shutter speed, and burst the trigger while following the car in motion. usually 1 or 2 in 10 of your burst shots would be good enough as with the OP's shot.  These are some of mine  http://i2.wp.com/wakarimasenlol.com/wp-content/gallery/supergt2013/print-9575.jpg  http://i0.wp.com/wakarimasenlol.com/wp-content/gallery/supergt2013/print-9400.jpg   http://i2.wp.com/wakarimasenlol.com/wp-content/gallery/super-gt-2011/supa-gt-07652.jpg  http://i2.wp.com/wakarimasenlol.com/wp-content/gallery/supergt2013/print-9619.jpg   One of the most dangerous thing i've read on this subreddit   Take your nostalgia goggles off. There have been quite a number of good alternatives to GP4 for years now.   Asetto Corsa and rFactor 2 should be sufficient for the next few years      That is one ugly car   None. A dead team should stay dead. And crowdfunding is not a feasible answer             http://gfycat.com/LegalDigitalGiraffe  Based Wenger   http://a.pomf.se/phdqmx.flv 3-0   http://a.pomf.se/hzkvvx.webm First Goal  http://a.pomf.se/rpbzmo.webm 2nd Goal  http://a.pomf.se/qatwwx.webm Cheeky Alonso   Post the Jenson Button video where his helmet came loose and he has to drive the whole German Grand Prix with only one hand. He was in the Honda at the time   http://i.imgur.com/Ac811M4.png  That is the largest gap I've seen ever lol   30 car grid is normal considering the old rfactor had unlimited car grid with some hack. you just need a powerful pc to emulate all the cars   Luck got him into a front running car.  No. His speed does. That's why McLaren gave him that drive in 2007 instead of de la Rosa which was expected by everyone.    their old longer nose would IIRC.    rfactor2 mate   they have a three year cycle. Windows 7 was RTM in 2009 and replaced by Windows 8 RTM in 2012. Windows 10 should be released in 2015   I am sure some are not when they are in McLaren together   the first result for googling kl is?   isn't this what Brundle was saying when they first had the problem?    As the title said "posted on twitter"  http://i.imgur.com/96qbwuM.png   KL apparently      Stick shifter on the left masterrace here. I can easily text with my right hand   Petronas certainly won't agree on that Mercedes livery. They have a strict white font rule, except on certain cases. Also the shape does not make sense.    If i want revenue, i could register as a wiziwig partner and earn loads   If a racing team needs fan money to get into the sport, they are doing it wrong.   Consider if a Bridgestone runner was close to the back of a michelin runner going to that corner, and the michelin runner just slowed down suddenly, it would be really dangerous   Yeah, I am infuriated everytime I hear James Allen in commentary as well   You can buy a ticket for the track bus on the three days that will send you from/to either KLCC or KL Sentral   Orchestra  Juvenile ordeal  Some nigga hip hop song is better  What you smokin' mate      The back straight has a 45% view of the back side of the circuit. I totally recommend sitting here as it's cheaper than the front straight  http://i.imgur.com/vpEhlTx.jpg  Since i live in KL, the track is quite accessible by car, albeit will take a little time to reach there.    Win win situation for both honestly. Honda need a team to enter, and McLaren needs an engine manufacturer to back them up after loosing Mercedes monies   Tyres, and he was using less fuel than anybody else up to that point   Give him any kind of car, and he will drive it. While Alonso can be said to have a similar ability, Hamilton seems to just be able to get in the car, and just drive it, while Alonso might need more time to learn the car.   I was impressed with Hamilton in 2009. He managed to wring that POS McLaren to places and wins that it was not supposed to have. It might be that during that time he used the car to learn how to drive on the edge, but yet save fuel and save his tyres, two thing that he was really bad at in 2008 and 2007  I still rate Alonso higher as he is the most complete package on the grid today, but I really love Hamilton as the pure racing driver   They are busy turning left   I think Crofty and Brundle were talking about what can be considered as taking an advantage, and Brundle explained that the stewards would see the sector times and their own racing experience to judge wether or not a driver gains or loses any advantage.   Since Hamilton lost a lot of time on the first sector, he was deemed to have made a mistake and nothing more was thought of that   His highest was third IIRC in 2009 in the most shittiest McLaren ever. Never had much luck since. Usually incidents, and the most weird was the broken third spring that nobody realised in 2011 or 12      Was out of stock a month ago. Mine came in a box tho and IIRC this batch does not   Limited Edition. I bought the last one from the Real Madrid store   Monza 2013. Hamilton has no idea what to do that he pushed till the end.   Grand Prix 4, and the ISI's F1 Challenge was the shit back then, especially since I don't have a console   Hamilton was generally fine with it last year at Monza   It's always funny when English news always regards the second name as the family name, when it's actually patronymic. Bin Ahmad literally means Son of Ahmad   Forgot to post the whole thing  http://i.imgur.com/pw6AZ9G.jpg      I did say cheap. And honestly what you get in Singapore you can get in JB. except for booze      Tip: Stay in Singapore for the race, but go across the causeway for cheap food and everyday stuffs   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCK7i3-o_bY   Full Race   http://gfycat.com/RegularArtisticHypacrosaurus         I can confirm that Malaysian tickets are cheap. Tickets + accommodations are so cheap that I've met Aussies that skipped the Melbourne race and went to Sepang instead since it meant a cheaper race + holiday package   I got mine for RM180ish (Sunday only) for the back straight. That is like, 60USD?      In anticipation of BF3 beta, bought two HD6850 thinking it would be enough. After 2 hours, sold it back and bought two GTX570, a new motherboard, and a new casing.   They still do. It's just not televised   It's hard not to get coverage without ads. Bernie charges A LOT for F1 broadcasting, and stations usually cover this cost by selling ad slots. Sky basically could run the coverage without ads because they can cover up the losses through other channels, and even then you have ads during free practice and qualy, and this is in a country where the F1 viewers are usually high  For North America, where the F1 viewer numbers are usually less than Europe, they have no choice. They have to have the ads. But if you find them too obtrusive, I suggest emailing them and suggeting them to make a side by side window for the ads. There are a lot of other sporting events where the ads are shown at the same time with the main sport.                                 F1 has long been dominated by European drivers. But once in a while you would see drivers from other continents, like Australia, South America and North America making a name for themselves in the sports. One continent that has the least amount of drivers competing in the sport is Asia. Currently, only Japan's Kamui Kobayashi is representing Asia in the sport.   Let's take a look at up and coming prospects from Asia that might one day end up with a race seat in one of the F1 teams in the future  .............................................................................................................................    **Ma Qinghua** (China) - 26 y/o  **Sponsors:** *Unknown*  **Current Drive** Citron Total WTCC (*WTCC*)  The great hope of China, Ma was the Chinese chosen driver for the ill fated A1 Grand Prix series. He has a lot of European single seater race experience under his belt, and was the test driver for HRT and Caterham. Now driving for Citroen in the WTCC series. Is the first Chinese driver to win a WTCC round when he won in Russia  **Chances:** *Slim*      ................................................................................................................................    **Takuya Izawa** (Japan) - 31 y/o  **Sponsors:** *Honda?*  **Current Drive** ART Grand Prix Team (*GP2*)  A former Formula Nippon driver for Team Aguri, Izawa made a name for himself in the Japanese touring car race series, Super GT. Made a jump to European single seater this year as a driver for the highly rated ART Grand Prix team. Has had a lackluster season, but he had his first podium finish in Hungary after Colletti was penalised.   **Chances:** *Slim (Might end up having a test driver role when Honda joins F1)*      ................................................................................................................................    **Rio Haryanto** (Indonesia) - 21 y/o  **Sponsors:** *Pertamina*  **Current Drive** EQ8 Caterham Racing (*GP2*)  Raced in single seater series in Asia and Australia, Rio made a move to European single seater in 2010 competing in GP3. He was mightily impressive, even winning a race in Turkey, and winning two more races in 2011. Was Max Chilton's partner in GP2. Considered a fast driver, but needs more experience under his belt. He is also the first Indonesian driver to qualify for a Superlicense.   **Chances:** *Moderate (Pertamina might buy him a seat in the future)*      ................................................................................................................................    **Kimiya Sato** (Japan) - 24 y/o  **Sponsors:** *Unknown*  **Current Drive** Campos Racing (*GP2*), Euronova Racing (*AutoGP*)  A young and upcoming driver from the land of the rising sun, Kimiya amazingly started his single seater career in the UK with the Formula BMW racing series before going back to Japan. He was the runner's up in the 2009 All Japan Formula 3 National series, before making the trip back to Europe to join the Formula 3 Euro Series. Runners up in the AutoGP championship last year, and now racing in both GP2 and AutoGP. Currently leading the AutoGP championship, but having a torrid time in GP2.   **Chances:** *High (Honda might find him the best bet to give a racing seat to a Japanese driver)*      ................................................................................................................................    **Sean Gelael** (Indonesia) - 17 y/o  **Sponsors:** *KFC Indonesia*  **Current Drive** Jagonya Ayam with Carlin (*F3*)  This young driver from Indonesia made a fast rise in his career. Only started professional racing in 2011, racing in the Asian Kartin series where he finished third. Wasting no time he moved to Europe just two years later competing in Formula 3. Currently in his second year of F3. Still has yet to show his rumoured potential.    **Chances:** *Moderate/Low (Unless he shows results in the next few years, it's doubtful that he could break into F1, especially since Carlin is one of the best racing team in single seater. Considering that his sponsors is not really a traditional name in motorsports, they are most likely not to pay for his F1 seat)*      ................................................................................................................................    **Jazeman Jaafar** (Malaysia) - 21 y/o  **Sponsors:** *Petronas*  **Current Drive** ISR Racing (*Formula Renault 3.5*), HTP Motorsports (*Blancpain GT Series - One off race*)  Malaysia's hope for the future, Jazeman competed in karting in both Malaysia and Europe. Was one of the few drivers given a special leeway when he wanted to join Formula BMW Asia due to his really young age. Won the championship in hist first year, he then moved to Europe, competing with Raikkonen Robertson Racing. He then moved to Carlin to drive for their Formula 3 team. Had a lackluster two years before finishing second in British F3 in 2012. He then moved to Formula Renault 3.5 for again Carlin, before he moved to ISR Racing this year. Has a couple of podium in Monaco and Spa as well as finishing 5th in the Spa 24 hour race this year with HTP Motorsports.  **Chances:** *Moderate/High (A Petronas Motorsports development talent and might be given the test seat for Mercedes due to the close relationship with Petronas Motorsports and Mercedes)*      ................................................................................................................................    **Other mentions** (*From the comments*)  Marlon Stckinger - *Philippines*  Adderley Fong - *Hong Kong*  Weiron Tan - *Malaysia*  Nabil Jeffri - *Malaysia*        Site: http://streamsp.com  FAQ  **What is this?**  It's a *free* streaming site that I use to stream sports from my home. I actually use it so that I can watch my own TV when I am at the office, as I usually work 10~12 hours a day   **What will you be streaming?**  Sports, mostly football and motorsports. Priorities for Formula 1 and Arsenal, in that order.  **What is the quality of your stream?**  Due to location (I am in Asia, and I am streaming it to a Ustream server in the USA) I limit the stream to 720p, 25fps, 1.5Mbps.   **Why Ustream and not (insert the streaming choice of my liking)**  Because it's easy, and it can be watched by everyone no matter if they are on a PC or on a mobile phone. Also they are a bit lax on DMCA takedown. And if my stream do get taken down, registering another account is really easy. Also it's the fastest non pay RTMP streaming service that I have tested  **What is the channel source?**  Malaysian cable sports channel. So you won't get the same pre/post match thing that you would expect or get from UK channels. Also be prepared for last minute changes and fuck ups.   **Are you making any monies from this?**  I do put some google ads on the site, but I don't actually care, as the monies from the ads can barely pay the monthly fees for internet and cable tv here. Also doing this to help fellow Gooners and F1 fans  If you guys have any questions or request, go on ahead!      Now that the summer break is here, how would you rate the drivers up till now?  Nico Rosberg  Calm, smart, and calculating. Took his chances and took it well. It's not surprising that he is leading the championship. But if there is an achilles heel, it's that he needs all of his engineers input to make his driving faster, and IMO this is what could derail his championship run at the end of the season   Lewis Hamilton  Definately the driver to watch. He is unlucky not to be leading the championship. But honestly the two drivers from the back of the grid to the podium in Germany and Hungary was the drives of the season. For the people who disagree, I would like to remind you that he drove in Germany with brakes that he hates, and in Hungary with a rebuilt car that he have no idea how it feels. He could still pip Nico at the end of the season   Daniel Ricciardo  Revelation of the season. Calm and adapted to life in the Red Bull like duck to water. If it's not for the Mercedes total domination, he could be up there fighting for the championship. Next year he will definately be closer tho. Expect more wins to come this season yet.   Seb Vettel  The loss of the blown diffuser hits him more than any other drivers on the grid. Still not being able to adapt to the new car, nevertheless he has been calm and mature. Other than the "tough luck" moment earlier in the season, he is quite okay with his teammate being faster. Might end up finding his form again after the season resumes   Nando Alonso  Best driver in the grid in not the best car on the grid. Flatters the Ferrari more than it actually should. The second half of the season would see if he stays at Ferrari or find a better team.    Kimi Raikkonen  Struggling. That is the only way to describe him this season. And his bad back is definately not helping. Add to Ferrari's questionable tactics and strategy he finds himself in places he should not be at in the first place. Might be his last season in F1.   Valterri Bottas  Next great Finnish hope. Finished the half season with a lot of good drives. Took his chances and shows that he is faster than his much older teammate. If Williams can find more speed in the car, then he could find himself a win in the second half of the season, especially if the Mercs trips over each other   Felipe Massa  Guy can't seem to find a break. His bad luck, especially at the start of races seems to be much more worse than Hamilton's. Struggling to keep pace with his teammate   Jenson Button  Missing Hamilton's setup input. Does not help the McLaren is shit. With the departure of Whitmarsh, his place in the team is also under threat as Ron is not really his largest fan. Might be his last season with the team, unless he can turn his season around   Kevin Magnussen  Started the season with a podium but slid back. Shows some flashes of speed. But still does not show anything special, yet.                After seeing all of these 60FPS jokes on the console peasants, I was thinking, does it really matters to everyone here personally?                                                                                      http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10158756  Only selected races were recorded by me due to various reasons  - No race 1-3, as I had not acquired a capture card when it aird - No race 10, as my cable provider did not air the Friday's race, and never aired a repeat of it.  All races are in 720p, 50FPS, at around 5mbps bitrate.  Enjoy         I mean honestly, year after year they would always amaze me. No matter what kind of rules that are thrown at them, there will be always someone, somewhere that can find a solution to the problem, and will be then copied down the grid.   After 5 races, I can see the car can potentially be as fast as last year, and considering how much the FIA are restricting the downforce and aero, this is no mean feat.         It's interesting to see that everytime the fuel graphics comes out, it's Lewis Hamilton (and to some extent, the Williams) that is using the least fuel than anyone else during a race weekend.  This combined with the ability to still post competitive time is really quite amazing considering that people says he is an "all out driver". This could play into his hand later in the year if he needs some more power when push comes to shoves            Tuned in to GP3, and found out the track is damp. This might change the race later today as tyre wear will worsen           	139
 It's appreciated all the same, though proper grammar is also incredibly flattering to me!   I believe in the first I was 13, the second I was 15 or so? Most recent, 25.   :)   My really pretty what?   Foggy, clear Converse. That sounds awful!   Aw, thank you :)   Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf.   Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.  He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180.   I thought it would never happen. I still feel like that frumpy little girl who got picked on constantly... Thank you!    Thank you! :)      I did! The fist photo you can kind of see them. Derp.

 They are satan.   Thank you for educating a young fellow like I.   It's in the old one though, by the way. Not the new one that just came out.   I do like the warped vocals of Ocean Man, and some of their songs aren't too appealing. I would suggest [Mutilated Lips] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzIHkFJnLbc) if you haven't heard it   Yeah, it's the outro song as the credits are playing.   Practice wife?   I personally haven't seen much *hate*, more of just people wanting Surf and getting frustrated. No one on this Subreddit could hate Chance really.      2:44 AM, ~4,000 views from 1,000,000.

And yes, I did find them off of the Spongebob Movie.   I'm interpreting the line "Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment are gearing up to drop their debut album, *Surf*, this week featuring Chance the Rapper." as in that they are gearing up this week for the release. Not that they are *releasing* Surf this week, but that they are *preparing* for the drop.   I'm decently sure you can't do that   I'm glad I could turn you on to them. They're one of my favourite brands as of now   I didn't know people resold Greats' shoes lol      I just rock a 3/5 Fade. At least that's what I call it. Nothing fancy   *upvotes furiously*   Can someone please explain this   Considering neither #10Day nor Acid Rap were on vinyl, I would assume that the answer is no (rather sadly, might I add).

 One of my friends had this exact same track (BS in Chemistry, then worked at L'Oreal, and came to materials science). My advice - you have to pay.  As in get an unfunded masters at a decent school (top 20 will still be difficult to get into), work on research there. If your MS GPA is much better (shoot for 3.5+) - you are all set. The con - the whole thing will not be cheap, because the dirty secret in STEM fields is that MS programs are university cash cows - so going unfunded for two years is going to cost you in the ballpark of $100,000.    Sadly, since he is tenure-track he will probably be railroaded. The Hunger Games that departments play during tenure sickens me.   Not wrong - but there is something about academia that allows toxic behaviors to fester much longer than any half-decent HR department would tolerate. Actually, HR supervision in academia almost never happens.   Observation from my own university: The grad student a year ahead of me in my school - are uber competitive, and many are outright toxic to work with. On the other hand, PhD students who joined with me are super nice, and we hang out after hours all the time. Same for the year junior to me. Even though one of our Assistant Professors who did his PhD from this school remarks that his cohort was much friendlier than any of ours. By the way, from this admittedly very small sample space i observed that competitiveness has no correlation with productivity.  Two final remarks - collaboration is a must today in my field. If you want to publish in a top-tier journal you must collaborate. And secondly, being an international student from Asia myself - I find that Asian students are much more competitive, and less collaborative and contribute to the department atmosphere overall in a negative rather than a positive fashion.   I have several Israeli friends, and they hate, hate orthodox jews with a passion.   Nopes, in fact just the opposite - I had Asian parents   Not visiting my sick grandmother back home. Not worth it.   Much, much higher expectations. Failure will be much less tolerated, as people would expect you to be more productive from day 1 - (not for students who enter PhD directly from a BS - those guys catch an yearlong break). Personally, after my MS and in a full time PhD I was surprised how sick and tired I had become of the whole classes-homework-exams grind. I almost had to pay for my negligence in that aspect.   Every department has its share of known assholes. And they will often be tolerated if they bring boatloads of cash. Honestly though in my experience, untenured faculty are much worse. There are several horror stories in my department, but they are for another time, another place.   No, in hindsight that guy had severe anger management issues. As everyone knows grad school can often be stressful, and I have seen that my criticisms are much more harsh when I am more tired or stressed out. But it is not a valid excuse, and I am trying to work on it .   Years before when I was a junior FOB grad student at my previous university for my M.S. I worked with a terrible bully. It was an year which almost destroyed my confidence. Now at my current university, I am now a senior, and actually productive grad student. And I find myself being a jerk often to my junior students. Granted they are making mistakes. But on reflection, those mistakes are made by everyone early on, and were even made by me.  Fellow subredditors, have you ever faced this? And how did you change?   I was on probation - got a C and had my GPA drop down to 2.84 but it is OK now - it is 3.55. In my experience, even a below 3 did not matter much.   1) How highly advisor dependent the whole thing is. Universities matter for resources, but your grad school experience will be massively influenced with the relationship you have with your advisor. Corollary: How terribly unstructured things are.  2) The biggest challenge IMO is to keep yourself motivated when things don't work out, which they often don't. Fear honestly drives me more often.  3) I get by really poorly financially, and do have some debt now.  4) I am still poor in structuring time - even though because I had been really productive the last few months I see light at the end of the tunnel - I will get by working 10 hours a day a few months from now on.  5) In the first year, despite what everyone says do not focus too much on research. Keep that year aside for degree requirements. It will be much less stressful later on that way.  6) OK. I have some very close friends, and I make it a point to attend parties and bars at least once every two weeks to keep myself sane.   1) A great fountain pen. 2) Cool bound lab notebooks with my name on it - like the custom ones from Bookfactory 3) A computer monitor   1) A great fountain pen. 2) Cool bound lab notebooks with my name on it - like the custom ones from Bookfactory 3) A computer monitor  	15
 I did half-GOMAD about a year or so ago and it definitely did work. The biggest problem is trying to adapt to a normal diet afterwards - milk doesn't really stretch your stomach that much and I found that I actually lost weight when I tried to switch back to solid foods as I couldn't eat as many solid calories.   Fun fact, I work in insurance and when you allow your email to be shared with third partys that includes us. We then use this info to help track you down if you flee an accident.   I used to work at Game in the UK. I remember other sales people thinking I was mad for not forcing a pre-order on this nervous little 9 year old kid who clearly didn't want it. I guess I just don't have the killer instinct needed for sales.   Shot from the new paranormal activity movie?   Pssssht I account share anyway, I'll give him my login and we'll use the netflix money to make a statue or something    I forgot I'd subscribed to this sub and thought /r/showerthoughts had gotten really deep!  But you make a fascinating point and I think I agree with you, whether or not I'm happy about it is another thing entirely.   Label your knuckles as in the picture  http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--LADOTqVt--/17mch8wncw9zmpng.png  All raised knuckles have 31 days, all grooves between knuckles have 30 (except for that dastardly February which has 28)   Doing a poop.   I suppose it's just famously used in both a wartime perspective and a peace perspective. Maybe they do mean the same thing, or maybe they're not linked at all, either way nobody I spoke to in person knew so I thought I'd ask historians.   It just occurred to me that the "v" gesture changed from a war-related symbol to the complete opposite! Any insight would be much appreciated.   Although I'm just a beginner I did read a paragraph on this in a gourmet shaving book today, the author said if a brush is still doing this after 1-2 weeks you should contact the seller.   I definitely will, I couldn't believe how generous it was! I want to shave 10 times tonight so I can try it all out!   He wrote a note that said "exceptionally cold" as well haha! Your warning has been heeded!   I just got given a sample of this but I'm totally new to shaving properly, should I be excited??      Goodbye xbox live membership!  	16
