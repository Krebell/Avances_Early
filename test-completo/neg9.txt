 Everyone seems to disagree on the definition of plot holes and cameos. This sub also can't seem to make up their mind on Marvel movies. Any time these are mentioned, hilarious arguments ensue. What else?    I feel like I have to like your username   The Mummy Returns doesn't even have a title.    Maybe OP wants to give an example of what he means? What writing are you referring to? Dialogue, plot, scene structure? I feel like this is a confusing post.    Honestly, I'm humbled by the efforts in this post and really, really wish I could make a contribution. I'm usually that guy who ruins the on-going joke, so best leave it to people like you and u/MarkyMark8 to do the honors. Thank you guys :)   Cracked did an article years ago about mismatched fights in action movies. Commando was mentioned. The writer described Bennett hysterically. Something to the effect of "he looks like the fat kid in the pool who doesn't take his shirt off" and "he's dressed like he's on the receiving end of bondage." Good shit.    John.....I'll be waiting John...   I don't know the best....but I know the worst....Bennett from Commando. Are you fucking kidding me with this name?   wat   This was fantastic! I could seriously hear the laugh track in my head at certain parts. After posting, I thought this may be trickier than Seinfeld as Frasier uses a lot of more.....cultured?....references, but you really tackled them here. I'd def be down to read more if you're inclined :)   You'll have to forgive me, as I don't write for Seinfeld, but my understand is you can give a writing prompt- a situation each character is going through- and then let other redditors fill in the dialogue with what they believe will be said by the characters. Maybe something like  'Frasier accidentally ruins the ending of a movie on his show, prompting major backlash from his listeners and Roz herself.' Just an idea.    Kind of like keeping the show going, but without changing what happened. Like it if you were to pick up somewhere in the middle of the show.   Its the same format used in https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld    I'm sure everyone will appreciate it! Thanks!   I'll be waiting at Duke's.   I love what Reddit does for Seinfeld, and with the amount of love this sub gets, I have to think that one of you could put together a scene. I don't possess that unique talent, but does anyone here want to give it a try? Maybe to help get these started, I'll use a prompt I used in one of the comment below  **After accidentally ruining the ending of a new movie on his radio show, Frasier faces major backlash from Seattle and Roz who really wanted to see it. Meanwhile Niles believes he is getting a dog allergy to Eddie** Maybe something like that?   Daphne's Room is my favorite. So. Damn. Funny.    I could not agree more. Aaron is the man. But that actor is terminally attached to Secret Service and law enforcement roles.    To football!      Maybe I'm not thinking clearly, but who is Gru?   Nah it's cool. Your comment also made me remember that he beat the hell out of that security guard in the beginning and we never find out if he killed him or not.    These are all good points, but I feel like my point may be lost in interpretation. I'm saying he never actually killed anyone that we're aware of.   Yeah, it's a technicality for sure. But he still didn't take the life himself. Might as well have though.    Yeah, solid answer Truly sick.    Really interesting answer lol It has been a while since I've seen Congo, but I thought they did kill some people?   I was watching Nightcrawler with my lady and realized what a complete sociopath Lou is, despite killing anyone. Who else comes to mind?   But you know real cash from play money right? Buy-ins are $50   Yeah I guess I am just seeing it in ridiculous situations. Everyone starts with 1,500 chips. A players loses maybe 600 of theirs in a hand. The next hand, the shove with their 900. It just doesn't make sense. .   	29

 LoL! I don't think my managers and the police would be as forgiving this time of it happened. It would be horrible if it malfunctioned and went off tonight without me touching it. They'd never believe me!   My God! She is an idiot! I don't understand why someone would press it if they had already been warned about what it does!? Ugh. People. Thankful, no one got fined or anything because it hasn't happened before and we already warned them that it was malfunctioning!   Trust me! Had I known what it was, I never would have touched it! I had just never even been told there was one!   Also, who's Carol?   Thank you! I'm working now, and I have no idea if it's working. I'm not testing it though!   Seriously! We're a college town, so the college has its own police force leaving the rest of the town to the others. Not much left in this town if you take the college away   That's what I thought. I didn't think we had one out there because the other jobs I've had showed me the panic buttons during orientation. My manager said he wasn't even sure where it was... It's surprising because they call our city Little Detroit because the drugs and crime.   Thank God it was my favorite manager there. Had it been the other two, I definitely would have at least gotten written up. They couldn't fire me because we're union!   That's what I thought! By the time they got there, I had completely forgot about the box! Yeah, my manager mentioned that it's a good thing that we knew it malfunctioned now. Apparently, it's been there since the place opened and was really outdated!   That would be absolutely terrifying! Thank God there were no guns out because it was clear once they got there that everything was fine!    I work in a growing grocery store that has a gas station attached to it. I was recently asked to work the fuel section while one of the girls went on vacation. I knew nothing about the panic button. Chaos ensued.  I was sitting in my room, and I notice this white box thing with a hole and something that looks like a suction cup in it. Ive never been told about it and never noticed it. I get busy and forget about the box. We die when my co-worker comes in to sit with me. I notice the box again and start looking around it, but there is nothing on this box.  So, me being me, I start playing around with to figure it out. I was messing with the black thingie and accidentally pushed it in some. When nothing happened, I figured it was some old, disconnected button for the pumps or something. About 25 minutes later, I see 4 cop cars fly into the parking lot.  One comes up to my window and asks if Im ok. I give him a confused look and tell him that Im fine and ask why. He told me the emergency button went off, so I asked where it was, and he told me around the register. Then it hit me what I had been playing with. I ask him how to turn it off, and he says to call the manager.  The manager comes out and asked what happened. We both tell him that were not sure. Then he pops the button out and says it should be off. About 10 minutes later, corporate calls to tell us the panic alarm is on, and to let the manager know. So we call him again, and he says hell be out there.  By this time, I tell Matt that I need to go pee. I go explain to the manager what had happened and explained that I just didnt want to say it in front of my co-worker. I didnt get in trouble because I told him before he went to watch the cameras, and he understood my embarrassment. He then walks out there while on the phone with support. It turns out the box had actually malfunctioned and couldnt be turned off. They suspended it and let the cops know. Tomorrow, maintenance is coming to fix the box...   My life has been quite hectic recently. I apologize if this is all over the place. My mind has been quite *different*. I can't explain what is happening, but I'm hoping you can. I'll start from the beginning. I work at a growing chain of grocery stores that have gas stations attached. I'm normally just a stocker, but my department is also responsible for helping run fuel center. Since the main girl out there went on vacation, I was scheduled to close up by myself. We close at 11 every night. Never early. I expected it to be a great week. After 8, the fuel center dies, and we are allowed to play on our phones and entertain ourselves. I decided to bring my DS and play Pokemon to pass the time. I was quite excited to get so lucky.   Man, was I wrong.   My first evening was going fine, until my co-worker left, leaving me alone. The first hour flew by in a flurry of winning battles and catching Pokemon. Soon, it started. I could hear a woman almost  shrieking, so I looked out my windows to see no one at the pumps. I then look at my camera monitor, but it's blurry. I've never seen it blurry, but I put it off as a glitch. I stepped out to see if maybe I was hearing the song from our speakers outside, but there was nothing. I blew it off as my imagination and continued with my night. Soon, I heard what sounded like someone trying to get into my small office, so I look at my monitor again, and it's acting really strange. It will go blurry, glitch, and then go clear. In the moments of clarity, I can see there is no one out there even though I can hear the banging and knob rattling. I call my boyfriend, and he calms me down. Soon, I have to go out to lock down the machines and other merchandise outside, so I get off the phone and hurry about my business outside. I figured since I had been outside for about 20 minutes and nothing happened that I had imagined everything. So, I close the inside and lock up. On my way to drop off the key to the main store, I can hear a whistling, but there is no one around and the radio had been turned off. I dreaded coming back.   The next day I figured that since I worked with someone my whole shift, and it was during the day, that I would be fine since I had worked it a thousand times during the day. Everything is fine, until my co-worker goes on break. The camera started acting strange again, but there were no weird sounds, so I wasn't too worried. I got up to grab a water out of the back fridge, but as I stood, my radio changed stations without anyone touching it. I walked back to it, and it changed back to my original station. I was freaked out, so I just turned the radio off all together and sat in silence. The rest of the shift was fine.   Then, today was the most intense yet. I came into work already terrified of what awaited me, but I wasn't working alone until the end of my shift. Since things only seem to happen when I'm alone, I figured that I would be ok. Once again, nothing happens even an hour after he leaves, so I think that I'm just going crazy from the social isolation and being alone out in a room by myself. That's when I could hear the shrieking again, but no customers seemed bothered. I put it off as my imagination running wild. It was probably about 10 when I could hear something pounding at my door. I even heard the door open and papers fluttering. I got the courage to look in the back section, and nothing was out of place. I sat with only my phone playing music and looking around at the outside to watch for anything out of the ordinary. When it was time to close up the outside area, I kept getting the uneasy feeling of being watched, and I would catch glimpses of what looked like something in my room. That wasn't possible though. It was locked and I had the only key to it around my neck. I thought that it was only my reflection and hurried to get back to my safe haven. I closed down the inside and started my walk to the store. I got the feeling again that I was being watched, so I turned my head. I wish I hadn't I saw her "standing" in the shadows by the recycling dumpsters. I use quotes because I couldn't see legs on her, just the head and torso. She would have been about 5 foot tall. She had wild black hair with what looked like could have been red highlights, her dress looked like a sack and was dirty and ripped, and her eyes, oh her eyes. They were the only facial characteristic I could see. They were almost black holes. I kept my eyes on her as I rushed back into the store. I dropped the key off and rushed to my car. When I got to my car, I could smell what I assumed to be her. It was a mixture of rotting flesh and old urine. I got in my car and pulled out in a frenzy. I kept looking in my rearview mirror because I thought I saw movement in the backseat, yet there was nothing. No one could be back there because there were two boxes that take up all the room. I get to my parking lot, and I smell the same smell as I'm walking through the alley to my apartment. I then hear steps behind me, so I look... There is nothing again. I bust threw the door of my apartment and explain what had happened that night to my boyfriend. I went to open the bedroom door, but before I got it open, I heard the springs of our bed move as if someone jumped out of bed quickly. I think she followed me. I keep seeing movement by my window. I feel strange. Maybe I'll underssssstand. Maybe I could knnnnnow. Please, help me. EDIT:  Formatting  EDIT:  More has happened, last night my window air conditioner turned itself off and on over and over. Then, we woke up this morning to find that my hamster had disappeared. We have 2 hounds, and they would let us know if the hamster was inside the house. There is no way it got out of its cage, and there is no blood or bite marks by the cage. Finally, my job requires a box cutter, and we always put it out of the reach of the animals. We found it across the room behind my tv. Also, when I tried to resubmit this, Reddit had an "emergency maintenance". Just a coincidence?  	11
 http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=puGET8n0g7w   Can confirm, an tutor, people dumb as fuck.    I was in your spot last year, so let Senpai, teach you a little something, something.  First off, fuck you. okay now I got that out of the way- see, I'm experiencing  jet lag, CA - Japan yesterday. ok, no more rant. You're in a great position,  at 18 I too got a part time, and made 6k from last December, working 11 hours a week. I go to a state university so tuition  is cheap. it's obvious that you don't know what you're doing,  considering you're asking for such bland advice. Just read some books, ok?    Cool.

As my work requires me to travel a lot, I need a 10kMaH battery and a nice phone as I wasn't raised with a poverty mindset,  aquire wealth and fucking the little guy is what I taught myself.

Rest in hell!   The internet is something aloof to me, I'm indifferent with the usernames here, no respect to any individual.    Too bad he will never realize his dream and get injured.

 Yup, I was there for the filming for the last scenes of the film you saw last night and I can't quite get my head around people complaining to the BBC about a promo voiceover.  Pretty sure that Clarkson and co wouldn't give the smallest imaginable shit about it either.   Seriously?   Nah, it's just a programme about cars where the three blokes who make it are moving on and some other bloke will start again next year. Stuff changes, and it really isn't worth over dramatising. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a BBC trail for Gardener's World or some such would probably fit well with previous comments made by the (now old) team regarding not over dramatising such matters.  Now if you want a /proper/ ending, try the last episode of Blackadder 4...they certainly didn't talk over that one!   There /was/ dinner and it was absolutely delicious, actually :-)   Woohoo! I was on the telly, albeit in the distance a few times and, depressingly, my thinning hair :-/  Still, was on the last "proper" TG, so pretty chuffed.   Good week for that comment, my friend.   I think I'd have to agree with his own statement:  He /is/ the best karaoke star in the world.  (Actually, that's not true judging by his Ian Brown-esque hitting of the notes)   Err, I have a 1TB SSD in my laptop and have done for well over a year now. Quite cheap now too :-)  Seriously, for general OS use, there is simply no comparison and if you do any "real" work (I'm a DBA) they are 100x quicker than spinning rust.  I get your reliability concerns, but spinning disks fail too and in a laptop are much more sensitive to shocks. Running a regular disk does not mean you don't need to run backups!   When you say "fixed", they've actually forcibly uninstalled it before starting the upgrade....   Fair comment on capital, but Germany has a thriving manufacturing economy producing many of the high value goods in high demand in the rest of Europe.  I'm sat here trying to think of one Greek export, and I'm struggling... :-(   Question: do testing engines "count" against their allocation?   Nah, it was never owned by Lotus.  Lotus did, however, design the TG track layout that has been used since the start of the most recent incarnation.  Wouldn't surprise me if the BBC even had this sewn up tight however...   Well it's not on until next Spring, so he'll pretty much get that year....   Looks like a hand-egg to my eyes...   http://imgur.com/WWJBSh4.jpg   How about Pete Townsend in this awesome performance by The Who: https://youtu.be/SCNeVHv3Mlg   I bloody well hope not!   Interesting view :-)  I would also argue the other way around - that people are made more attractive for breeding by their wealth even though they clearly should be bottom of the pile when it comes to the gene pool!  Refer to about 6 mins into this: https://youtu.be/hKWmFWRVLlU?t=6m0s    There's a huge difference in speed between 2G and 3G. Full strength 2G is still likely to be 10x slower than 1 bar of 3G, but on the whole, if you have fringe 3G coverage you are likely to be booted from the cell and thus drop down to 2G resulting in a large drop in connectivity performance.   Funny sticker, but why do people consider acquisition of wealth to be the ultimate goal of life?  Personally, I consider personal gratification and happiness to be orders of magnitude more important than wealth and I find that children help me in this. If you can do it without, then excellent too :-)   Great write up, ignore the idiots!  One thing that I will add is that 3G networks capacity manage differently to 2G and 4G networks. When a 3G cell manages its capacity, it will tend to kick off devices running at the highest RF output power, on the basis that these are geographically furthest away and therefore most likely to be serviced by another cell.  This works well in a city when there is a lot of overlapping cells, but when you are operating on the edge of a 3G area it actually means that you are more likely to find yourself being bumped to 2G even though your 3G service was acceptably good. 4G does not capacity manage in this way and is a superior network technology, regardless of the speed boost it might bring you.   Your explanation was both informative and well written. Please ignore the ignorant and accept from one that likes to learn: this was an interesting post.   Congratulations, you will never be more than you are now!  Would you like me to print you an "I am all that I will ever be" certificate to show to your friends?   Interesting to see McLaren testing their latest iteration in the background.   Already looks quicker than the current car... ;-)   Glorious!   Last year wasn't too good either...   Hang on. So litigator sues and loses and the defender pays the lawyers...is that actually possible?   Translation: I live in the wrong place for road cycling so the rest of you guys should go to the gym like me instead.   Thoroughly enjoyed both the first album (Megalithic Symphony) and new follow-up (Run) from Awolnation.   Strangely, it's one that the whole family like, so it's become a road trip favourite.   Don't mean to disagree, but while most cars in Europe /are/ manual, many premium marques are predominantly automatic. In fact, when I was shopping last year, finding a manual 5 series was nearly impossible.  (Bought an auto anyway - hey, the residuals are better :-)   Yup. Them's the breaks.   OK, run the sums on what I currently get:  52 x 1 (I assume that they included Saturdays at this time and I don't work Saturdays) 32 (annual holiday allowance) 8 (public holidays)  Total: 92 days At 6 days per week, 15.3 weeks holiday  3 months? Pah - wouldn't even get out of bed for 3 months' holiday ;-)   It /is/ a gif. Accurate too.  	33
 Youtube loads the video up at t either 1440p or 4k. But then the video is downscaled to fit your screen.  Technically it is supposed to look better, but I can't really tell the difference.   I had issues with youtube videos stuttering on my Toshiba CB2.  To fix this issue I would usually force youtube to playback using flash, but now I'm [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog ).  It fixed the stuttering problems I had when using HTML5 to playback 1080p 60fps videos.    EDIT: It also seems to have resolved any stuttering issues I had playing back 1440p and 4k videos on youtube (not that it matters on a 1080p display).   Just a heads up you can run a linux distribution on a chromebook using crouton.  This way you can run a full operating system.  I currently use crouton to run elementaryOS and I'm able to program in Java and C++ for my classes.   You should try and see if you could retake the class at a local public college during the summer and transfer those credits over to your current school.  I would assume that would be more affordable, if it is doable.   Your welcome, I hope it's helpful.   [Here's the FAQ and Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/index) from /r/androiddev    Here is the full list of pokemon: http://pldh.net/gallery/the493  I wish they made these into t-shirts or hoodies. I would definitely buy a few.    Worked for me thanks!   R has its uses in stats.  But like every programming language it has its faults.  If you want an alternative to R, may I suggest Python.  Here is the official tutorial: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/  Here is a link to the IPython documentation, which allows you to better interact with Python: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/index.html   Here are some resources that will introduce you to stats using Python:  http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/html/index.html  http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/  Theres also these resources for bayesian statistics using Python: http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/  http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/    That's fair. But by saying "there's no evidence that they are wired differently" you seem to be implying that there aren't physical differences between male and female brains.   There are observable differences between the brain structures of males and females.  For example women tend to have a higher percentage of grey matter, while men have more white matter.  [Here's the wikipedia page that covers the differences.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_sex_differences) There's even a bit about how men and women are wired differently.   I use the magic actions extension and just fore player type to flash. No stuttering after that.   No I rarely have any problems with RAM.  If I ever do it's when I'm running Linux via crouton and I am programming using R while having a big data set loaded into RAM.  The biggest issue that I see is that when I switch over to Chrome OS, old inactive tabs will auto refresh when I switched back to viewing them.  That's pretty much it.   Try running those 60fps videos using flash.  I used to have issues with stuttering but then used Youtube magic extensions and set all youtube videos for Flash.   [Actually the nfl does admit officiating mistakes.](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1 pws=0 q=nfl+admits+officiating+mistake)   While I do agree the larger sample size of plays/possessions/games allows more room for error by the NBA officials, it doesn't mean they are more competent at their jobs and it doesn't mean that their bad calls don't have an equally significant impact on the game.  The bad calls nba refs make are just less obvious and their impacts are less obvious.  A few bad ticky-tack fouls on a player early on in the game does alter how they play and limit their playing time. A recent example that comes to mind is Lebron James against the Pacers in last years playoffs.    Plus the nba empowers their refs to give technical fouls and kick guys out for "showing up the refs." Which can lead to [Joey Crawford.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SYIrUnf5Y#t=1m25s) The nfl can give out personal foul calls but they rarely kick guys out of games, and if they do it is for throwing a punch not hurting a referee's feelings.  There was also a recent [game fixing scandal in the NBA regarding one of its refs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal).  And the NBA completely absolved Tim Donaghy. Also before the NBA got Sportsvu for the whole league, the Sportsvu cameras actually collected data on the refs.  But afterwards the NBA actually stopped collecting or reporting that information. Check out this [bit for the BS report with Haralabos Voulgaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s1TVQhDYgg#t=47m) that covers the Donaghy scandal and the Sportsvu data.  So all this hoopla over the ref transparency reports is just a bunch of bullshit.  If the NBA really cared about transparency they should not have stopped collecting or reporting the Sportvu referee data.  Here are two lists of controversies involving officiating from both leagues: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_controversies#Controversial_calls https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_criticisms_and_controversies#Conspiracies  In the end officiating is equally terrible in both sports. It could be because it is a hard job, or it's hard to judge good or bad officiating (we seem to notice bad officiating but we rarely compliment or notice good officiating),  maybe the refs are just incompetent, or some combo of each. I would like both leagues to be more transparent when reporting on referee performance and I want both leagues to lessen the impact of bad officiating on the games.  But that is hard to do and probably unlikely when both leagues want to constantly change/add/enforce rules that lead to less/safer physical contact between players for the sake of increased offensive output.  Because we all know more offense means more viewers, which means more revenue for the leagues.   	15
          $250,000 covers a budget of one episode. Maybe two for a really cheap series which Death Parade isn't, judging from its quality.  NTV who owns Madhouse also owns Hulu Japan, so at least Death Parade functions as an original content to their catalog. Original content is becoming more important since Netflix is launching in Japan this fall. So it's not a total loss, but I wouldn't get my hopes up for a 2nd season. Although it would be a very pleasing surprise if it happens.    I don't use it because of the ghosting. The smoothness is cool for a 1-3 minute scene but I wouldn't be able to stand watching a whole series with ghosting.  Also there's not a lot of actual 60 fps content other than sports broadcast and some porn. The Hobbit trilogy was shot at 48 fps. Most movies and TV shows are 24 fps. A traditional animation TV show is basically 12 fps upscaled to 24 fps with repeated frames.       That was an exciting episode of mostly just action scenes. Being able to convey sense of speed and the frenzy of combat was always this show's signature. I also like how the action can seamlessly transition from a wide shot of the battle to an up-close and personal view of it. There might be better choreographed action scenes out there but in terms of the full package that gets the heart racing this show's action might be the best of all the recent anime.  Some nitpicks: there were a few spots when it got choppy, some in slowmo and others during a few camera moves. There were a couple of Transformer-esque angles and super quick cuts that made things momentarily hard to follow.  **Clips**  [Nagate sword fighting](https://streamable.com/gsru)  [Nagate trying to shake off a gauna](https://streamable.com/gwb7)  [Tsumugi vs Benisuzume](https://streamable.com/yc4m)  [Tsumugi vs Benisuzume II](https://streamable.com/flnk)    Don't know who's worse, Stannis or Shou Tucker from Full Metal Alchemist.   I try to keep up with indie anime short films. There's some odd and experimental stuff that are a nice change of pace from the usual.  Most recent one is [The Lost Breakfast](https://youtu.be/rtcH5k2-fLM).  Some are just a simple animation/artistic showcase like [in the Wind](https://youtu.be/GZ39V34qInQ).    This short was made in Japan, by a Japanese director/animator, it's based on a [rakugo tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo) and won an award at Hiroshima International Animation Festival. It's as Japanese an animation can be.         All these wishes, witches and memories are all getting mixed up in my head. Well, it's really not complicated if you reread and think about it but it disrupts the page-turner feel of the manga. It's not bad, just different flow to the story.    Wilson was playing with fire there.         [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXj8N-j7SJE feature=youtu.be)      I love how Rokumon just casually stole stuff...well it's more like getting back what Rinne was owed.   If you're looking for a more active discussion try the show's MAL page forum. Nothing huge, about 30-40 replies per episode.   The recent fat shaming uproar made Hijikata's "pig gag" even funnier.  Gin complaining about the women-turned-men being OP was the funniest part.  Yes! MADAO finally made an appearance...sort of.      [Hibike! Euphonium Episode 11 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/06/hibike-euphonium-episode-11.html)  [Split screen video of Kousaka's and Kaori's performance](https://streamable.com/ks7c) that was discussed in the above blog link.   This is being published by Bandai, which might mean it's only a matter of time until Love Live! VR.   Hak going into rage mode was intense.  [This page](http://www.titaniascans.com/reader/Akatsuki+no+Yona/091%3A+He+Was+a+Very+Precious+Friend/#page=25) really expressed the mixture of anger and sadness. The way Yona calmed him down was moving. The last few pages of that chapter were a fantastic mixture of emotions.  I thought we might see Zeno's ability in this arc. A bit disappointed that wasn't the case.    A cut, in visual mediums, is the abrupt transition from one scene to another.   A cut is a transition from one shot to another. A scene is made up of shots sequenced together with multiple cuts. Although there are scenes that are just one continuous shot (oner/long take).   [He's a count/bishop that got assassinated by a disembodied arm](http://i.imgur.com/fNtMruG.jpg). Bodin blamed the Parsians and wanted 10,000 sacrificed as revenge.  I also quite liked this [exchange between Guiscard and Bodin](http://i.imgur.com/Dn3S3id.jpg), which wasn't in this episode due to the changes.   The guy worked his ass off to get to the pinnacle of his profession, he should be damn proud of that. He shouldn't have to act humble on account of some idiot's fuck up.   I guess the Pedelaus incident got skipped. It's what caused Bodin to asked for 10,000 Parsians to sacrifice.  Is the rest going to be anime original? The sequence of events in this episode is drastically different from the LN/manga.           The smoke and fog effects looked great. The fogginess really made the battle atmospheric. I wish the explosions were of the same quality, just like the one in the Blame! clip.  Did not expect Benisuzume to make an appearance, and it's a 2.0 version. So Gaunas are also attracted to Higgs particles. Time to switch to an alternative fuel source!  **Gifs**  [Benisuzume 2.0](https://streamable.com/jb00)  [Tsugumori Mk.

But since the Cavs lost the popular narrative is LeBron flopped into the camera.   I'm gonna root for this guy to succeed just to see the hive mind trash talkers eat crow.         I love how Kyubei goes into an honest introspection of her gender conflict only to end with this [punchline](http://i.imgur.com/r7zc8fl.png).   While Ribbon-girl could have approached this trumpet solo drama in a more tactful manner, I liked that she questioned authority and was openly confrontational instead of rumor mongering behind Reina's and Taki-sensei's backs. No half measures, no wishy-washy shenanigans, just straight-up going for the truth.   I couldn't get into Expelled from Paradise. Too much storytelling through exposition instead of through character experiences, sequence of events and observable world building. I got nothing against exposition but the movie needed a better balance between telling and showing.      So, does Kevin Love get the [Yamcha pose?](http://i.imgur.com/CRbY6M4.jpg)   The Hawks and Bulls weren't as bad as people made them out to be. This Cavs defense is legit.   I thought the Kashan Castle chapter would be two episodes, still not bad. The anime has pretty much caught up to the translated LN chapters.  I hope the next update to the LN translation would be a big one.         To anyone new to the series, it's available on youtube and Hulu.

Sure, sometimes the studio is part of the committee and invest money into the project but they sure as hell don't finance the whole thing.   A majority of action scenes in Sidonia are animated at 24 fps. That's twice the framerate of traditional anime.   Isn't this what /r/animegifs is for?   Please stay healthy. Please stay healthy. Please stay healthy.      Attack on Hamster   God damn. Hak showing up at the end got me hyped.  It was also nice seeing Yona recover from being overwhelmed by the situation.   This show continues to have unusually high amount of shots of feet. A lot of times they're used as another way to express emotion and personality, and sometimes for more practical reasons. I'm half expecting someone to do a video essay on it, just like [Tony Zhou did one on chairs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfGKNJ4mldE)   There's actually been a character like that, Nanamine Tooru from Bakuman.         Could still be manga territory if they're using unpublished rough drafts.          Yuhata is back in the harem game. I'm fine with the harem hijinks as breather episodes and this episode was amusing but three in a row is pushing it. I want to get back to the scheming, action and tension.  Izana's new abilities to control a Garde looks promising. It seems like there's going to be a conflict between Yure and the Captain.   Maybe it's just me but the animation and overall presentation looked so much better in this episode. Especially the lighting; [construction site](http://imgur.com/a/jPe36#2), [sunset](http://imgur.com/a/5gYxC#0), [morning light](http://imgur.com/a/l4K1u#0) and [Thousand Year Village](http://i.imgur.com/K9mZHBP.jpg).  **Gifs**  [Izana and Yure fashion show](https://streamable.com/zevv)  [Ten-finger control](http://gfycat.com/ElasticPortlyAmazondolphin)  [A face full of Izana](http://gfycat.com/InbornColossalFrilledlizard)  [Tsumugi the troublemaker](http://gfycat.com/InbornColossalFrilledlizard)     She should re-enact [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/S9Q67Ep.gif) (x-post from /r/animegifs).

Don't you know that I heard it through the rapevine  For much longer you would be mine   It's still not true 60 fps interpolated since the 24 fps source has repeated frames due to the anime being animated in 2s. Repeated frames can't be interpolated since there's no motion going on.   I think for a lot of these shows the studio is really just a hired contractor. The sales are financially inconsequential to the studio and the ones that either profit or lose money from sales is the production committee that hired the studio and financed the whole project. Obviously the studio wants the show to sell well since it could make them look good and help them land more and better projects but as long as they keep getting new projects then I don't think sales are a be all and end all. That's why Deen, Satelight and Pierrot are still in business.  Also it's not all about disc sales. Some shows are made as promotional material for manga, LN, video games, merchandise and as part of a multimedia project. Additionally, ratings matter a bit more for non-late-night shows. Some of these reasons are also why recent late-night anime like Garo and Rage of Bahamut are getting 2nd seasons despite not selling well.   Children and daytime shows are also more stable income since they tend to be 2 cours or long running. I'd bet most studios would love to land a long running show.   I bursted out laughing when Gintoki accidentally robbed the bank. Gintoki's trolling was the perfect build-up for that moment.      Yeah it would be such a waste of Allen's skills to put him on someone who massively outsizes and out-weighs him. I'd rather put him on Kyrie.   No worries, my hands take birth control pills.   softenni   That's glass half full. [The glass half empty](http://i.imgur.com/iWdQDli.gifv) (x-post from /r/animegifs).   [The Ballad of Suicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBZyTX22THA)   He got a triple double but he gotta tease us with an almost 30-20.      The number of shows indicates an increased interest in investing in anime. These shows are funded by manga, LN and video game publishers, toy/merchandise companies, TV Networks, marketing/advertising firms and other investors with varying interests. There's more to anime now than disc sales, merchandise sales and boosting manga sales. Using anime to promote LNs and video games is now common practice. We are seeing more multimedia projects that include anime. Then there's the relatively new found wealth known as streaming. Like I said, anime is the most ubiquitous as it has ever been with it being streamed on netflix, hulu, funimation, crunchyroll and other smaller streaming sites. Of course I also said this boom is not sustainable.  Regarding anime... remember how a cour used to be 13 episodes, and most shows were 2 cours? I think it's telling studios can't really afford buying airtime anymore. And the money certainly isn't going to employees.  Two cour late night shows are risky. Production committees have just gotten smarter. If the first cour is a success then they'll make another one. There's still bunch of two cour shows, most of them are daytime because TV networks don't want to reload their time slot every three months. Also studios don't usually pay for the airtime, the investors in the production committee do. Studios for the most part are hired contractors. The exception to that being when a studio wants to make an original anime or invest their own money in exchange for a larger slice of the pie.     [Manga](/s "Kotori Moegi's mini-arc was great, so was Konno's. I think those two were only bested by Noa's. Also, Aiko Chikushi was hilarious")   The anime was doing a good job of condensing the material early on but it's starting to feel rushed now. It was unavoidable, 90 chapters in one cour is tough to adapt no matter how good the writing staff is. Then again, as a manga reader my perspective is probably skewed, it seems like most anime only watchers are fine with the pacing.  [For Otsuka fans](https://streamable.com/ll8u)   Well, he was disappointingly unspecific but then again his doom and gloom assessments has always been like that. Anime is in a boom right now, producing 30-40 shows a season and the most ubiquitous as it has ever been. Saying that's unsustainable is pointing out the obvious and can be said about any industry going through a boom period.  It might have been worthwhile if he pointed out the declining relevance of physical media which will eventually affect the industry and the possibility of a demand for higher wage which will raise production costs.  However, Mr. Anno does not think that this will mean an end to anime as an artistic form of film. He points out the possibility of the centres of anime production moving to other areas of Asia with good conditions.  Certain parts of anime production are already being outsourced to other Asian studios because it's cheaper. Being payed worse than an already underpaid Japanese animator isn't exactly good working condition. I doubt it'll change so drastically in five years that the industry would move outside of Japan.   That moment must have been cathartic for Dwight Howard haters.   Shirou is a walking and talking meatbag of idiocy with his extremely simple minded and comical sense of heroism. I root for his death with every episode. I should stop watching FSN.     Softenni   x-post from /r/animegifs      Thanks for reminding me about One Week Friends. The manga has ended so I'm just going to wait until the rest of the chapters have been scanlated then it's marathon time.   It's more like his harem is reloading. Hoshijiro is out and got replaced by Tsumugi. Yuhata has kind of fallen out of the harem and Samari is picking up the slack.   [Looked like he was chugging some sake.](http://i.imgur.com/GmRiquJ.png)   After an extended break, harem hijinks are in full swing for a second episode in a row.  It's not all feel good stuff though, the Captain is really going all in with her arms race against the Gaunas and the colonists are more screwed than I thought.   [Izana's suit malfunction](https://streamable.com/448z)   lol true but when he has to deal with someone as illogically stubborn as Shirou it's hard to blame him for taking the asshole route to get his point across. Although in the end it was all for naught.   We saw Saber get owned by a mere human with some magical enhancements, this story has some wacky power scale logic. So I kind of expected the Shirou nonsense.   To be fair the Avalon plot armor was built in from the very beginning, so it wasn't a total ass-pull...but yeah still plot armor.      This series feels over but the Rockets-Clippers series is in the back of my mind and I'm hesitant to jump the gun.   /r/animegifs      Oh god, that Rocky montage imitation.

Nothing fancy, the Garo video is just the 24 fps source converted to 60 fps motion interpolated.

I believe this is true for most 60 fps converted anime videos with the exception of CG scenes animated at 24 fps.  I did experiment with getting rid most of the repeated frames and just using the animated frames by cutting the fps to 12. Then motion interpolating up to 60 fps but it looked bad. So much ghosting, even just going from 12 to 24 looked bad. The posted video still have ghosting but nowhere near as bad.  Did another one:  [Death Parade ice skating scene at 60 fps](https://streamable.com/70b3)      The playoffs is goink pretty well for these three point shooting teams.   Oh man, they took out the part during the invasion where Gieve went to a temple to whoop some Lusitanian ass in order to get more loot. Also, I'm pretty sure the Lusitanian King wasn't fat in the light novel. The light novel also took more effort to characterize him as a religious fanatic which even made his desire to marry Tahamine even more surprising.

[Tsumugi and Tanikaze flying together](https://streamable.com/8rxa)   Also that Gauna emitter looks means in the preview, not quite sure what it provides Sidonia when they already have missiles that can blow up planets, but I guess they are kind limited?  The Anti-Planet Missiles can be dodged or intercepted that's why in the last season they had to use the Gardes to get rid of the Gauna first in order to let the missile destroy the dwarf planet.   Show by Rock!   In terms of manpower, time and effort there's a huge difference between 3-5 minute CG scenes per episode and doing an entire series in CG. That's why only the action scenes in Sidonia are fluidly animated.

They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.   Tom was my best friend when I was a kid. Wed bonded over a deep obsession of Jurassic Park and our subsequent passion for Paleontology.   We used to spend every weekend out in the woods excavating the forest floor for dinosaur bones.  But one day our parents wouldnt let us go. We heard the adults whisper about another body being found "after all these years. The whispers scared us and we agreed to play in the backyard instead.  That was the day we finally hit pay dirt. After a year and a half of looking we had finally found our first section of dinosaur skeleton  and in my backyard no less!  We hurried inside to tell our parents but only my father was home. He was excited and agreed to take us to the university the next afternoon to present our findings.  But we never went because Tom never made it home from school the next day. I was devastated and when we moved out of state several months later I forgot entirely about the dinosaur bones in the back yard.   Until today.  This morning my daughter came home from a weekend with grandma and grandpa. She said she hadnt been allowed to go outside because of some missing kids in the area. And for the first time since I was nine I thought about the bones Tom and I found. And I wondered    I think Rich did find Track B.    In two miles take exit 19 for Valley Park Drive South. Siri chirped from my sisters phone.   Charlotte, turn that off. I know where Im going.  You sure about that? I meanit *has* been a couple decades, Mark.  Please, like I could ever forget where Adventure Valley is. Come on, we spent every summer of-  There it is! I swerved briefly into the oncoming lane as Charlotte thrust her arm in front of my face to point excitedly out the window. Theres Adventure Valley! Oh my God, what ride is that? That coaster, it was called Steel something, right? No, no, wait, thats Mayhem Mountain, isnt it?  I gently pushed my sisters arm out of my face and back over to her seat. I couldnt fault her for her excitement while I was trying so hard to control my own giddiness. It felt like we were kids again, yelling and bouncing in the back seat of my parents car as the first shining rails and wooden planks of the parks roller coasters came into view above the treetops.    Thats the Steel Viper. I told her. Mayhem Mountains on the other end of the park. And that wooden coaster over there is the Excalibur.  Oh yeah! I remember those! I was always too much of a wus to ride the viper but I rode the shit out of the Excalibur.  Well, Charlotte, youre an adult, now. I think its time to take on the Viper.   As long as the contractors have tested it and given it the okay, Im in.  That was really the question, wasnt it? We didnt know which rides had been inspected and cleared and which ones hadnt. I sent up a silent prayer that Mayhem Mountain was counted among the rides that had. Id left Brandon several voicemails asking about it since he was the one in charge of everything. But with how fast things had been moving since wed bought the park, I couldn't fault him for being a busy man.  If you'd told 12 year old me that my crazy, hyper, wild-eyed friend Brandon Decker would end up graduating cum laude from Northwestern business school I would have laughed in your face. Brandon? No way. Tyler, maybe, but never Brandon. In fact, half the reason I think he choose a business designation was *because* of Adventure Valley. When the park had closed in 1989 Brandon had gathered us all together in his basement and, with a gravitas and solemnness Ive never seen in him before or since, asked us to make the pact.  At the time the promise had been the most serious vow that five 12 year olds could ever make. High off of an entire summer of Adventure Valley fun, we agreed, with all the ceremony of a meeting of parliament, that we would one day come together and buy Adventure Valley Amusement Park.  Of course, back then wed planned to just buy it and ride the roller coasters into the ground. We decided which friends from school we would let in and which enemies would be barred from the gates. It had always been *our* park, and it was only right that we should have it.  It had taken twenty years but we eventually did fulfill our promise. With a hell of a lot of pushing from Brandon (and a sizeable offer of collateral from Tyler) the bank had agreed to give us the multi million dollar loan to buy, repair, refurbish and reopen the park. The size of the loan that the six of us were responsible for gave me nightmares for several weeks. How would this place ever turn a profit? It had been closed decades ago after operating in the red for several years. The county had experienced a high number of runaways and missing persons in the area in the last years of the 1980s. The entire region was on edge as the cases mounted and people in the area became depressed and suspicious of each other. It had absolutely killed park attendance.  But seeing the first cresting waves of roller coasters rails through the trees made me all but forget about my financial worries. This was *Adventure Valley* for Christs sake. If we opened the gates, people would come.  There! There, there, there  thats our exit! Charlotte squeaked.  I pulled off the interstate and took a left under the bridge. Less than a mile later we came upon the acres of the parks parking lots to our right. We turned in and drove all the way up to the front near the gates where several other cars were parked  a Lexus, a Mini Cooper, an old Chevelle and a Honda Civic  another rental car like ours.   Looks like were the last ones here, Charlotte said.   She was right. As we pulled up next to the Lexus I noticed a group of people standing next to the ticket booth, waving to us excitedly.   Oh my God, is that Tyler? Jesus, hes lost some weight, hes so skinny now! And Brandons losing his hair. Holy shit, is that Koji? Koji got hot!  Calm down, Paris Hilton, these guys are my friends. Theyre off limits to you, same rules as when we were teenagers. Besides half of them are married.  Reallywhich half?  I raised an eyebrow at Charlotte and shook my head in amused bewilderment. My little sister never had outgrown her boy craziness.  Wait, whos that? Charlotte asked as we got out of the car.  What? Thats Scott! You know Scott.  Not Scott, Scott looks exactly the same. The girl *next* to Scott.  Oh. I had put this off so long that Id actually forgotten to tell my sister at all. Thats Dani, Scotts girlfriend.  Dani as in Danielle *Burcher*?  Wellyeah.  My sister gave me such a horrified look that youd think Id betrayed her to her death. But it was fleeting and quickly replaced by a sly smile.  Fine by me. Im sure shes not the same person she was in high school. Were all adults now, right? Now come on, lets go!  A sigh of relief escaped my chest as I slammed the car door and followed Charlotte over to the entrance. Though I saw most of these guys every year, seeing us all here together, standing at the ticket booths of Adventure Valley, brought me a sort of happiness I hadnt experienced in many years.   Mark-fucking-Lantice. I cant believe it. Tyler had an edgy, commanding voice that probably made his many employees shudder and scatter. But I knew him like a brother so his bravado just made me laugh.   Can you believe it? I asked as I gave him a hug and a slap on the back. Back at front gates. $15 a day doesnt seem so ridiculous now.  Pfft, $15 a day, my ass. Brandon said as he shook my hand. By my math, it looks like well be charging about $65 a day.  Ill pay it! Charlotte smiled as she gave Koji a hug.  Are people really going to pay $65 a day? Koji asked. Even Disneyland only charges $85 and there you get  access to two parks.  How could I forget, Brandon shook his head. One of our investors works for the mouse. Pity they wont let you design any artwork for this place.  Come on, man, Im not an artist, Im an engineer.  Dont you mean *imagineer?* Charlotte winked at him.  Koji sighed and shook his head. Yeah, I fuckin do.   As Brandon and Charlotte teased Koji I made my way over to the side of the ticket booth where Scott and his girlfriend were conversing. I didnt know why Scott was being so standoffish but I thought it might have something to do with the investment. Scott, the least well off of us six, worked at his dads collision shop and hadnt had a whole lot of money to invest. I thought maybe he was embarrassed about the money but now, watching him lean against the booth with slowly shifting eyes, I realized it wasnt that at all - Scott was just stoned. Same old Scott.  Whats up, Burnout? My brother. I havent seen you in like 15 years, how about a bro hug?  Scott smiled and pushed off the wall to come give me a quick hug. Hey, hows it going, man? Fuck, look at you. What your diet, man, rabbit food and lettuce? Youre not gonna get any ladies with that skinny body.  Your mom doesnt seem to mind.  Hey, Mark. Im Dani. Do you remember me? Dani Burcher? Scotts girlfriend gave me a shy smile and stuck out her hand so we could engage in a stiff handshake.   Yeah, I think so. You were in my sisters class, right? Charlotte Lantice?  Dani had the decency to look embarrassed. Yeah, but we werent really friends.  *Thats putting it lightly,* I thought.  We were freshmen when you guys were seniors. She added.  Yep, I do remember that.  Maybe I should just get it over with. I called Charlotte over and the re-introduction of the two girls, while awkward, was over pretty quickly to everyones relief. We were all eager to get into the park. It was odd not stopping at the window for tickets and even odder to walk *around* the rusting turn-styles of the front gates. I delighted in reminding myself that we owned this place now.  Brandon gave us a tour of the park. Now so much of the geography  we all knew that inside and out  but of the hypothetical layout and reorganization of the park as he saw it.   The Excalibur is going to need the most amount of work, according to Rich. (Brandons head contractor). A roller coaster made of wood exposed to the elements for all these yearswell keep as much of the original structure as is safe but we might have to rebuild most of it.  Do we have the money for that? Scott asked loudly from where he walked behind us with Dani.  Yeah, Tyler said. We have the money for that.  Ah, Mr. Moneybags. That Mini dealership treating you good? I nudged him hard with my shoulder. Tyler stumbled but kept enough composure to push me back into a passing churro stall.  Those *six* BMW dealerships are treating me very well.  Well enough to serve as the sizable collateral we needed. Brandon added.  So, Charlotte ran up behind us and threw her arms around Tyler and Koji. Can weride some rides?  Are you kidding? Why do you think were here! Tyler laughed.  Im just here for Mayhem Mountain. I said clapping my hands and rubbing them together eagerly.  Brandon threw up his hands. Alright, fine! I thought you guys would be interested in how your investment is coming along.  Koji snorted. All were interested in is the projected ROI and, more importantly, which rides have passed safety inspection!  Oh, Brandon stopped walking and tried to look annoyed, and, failing that, he smiled. A little over half of them are rideable.  Suddenly everybody was talking at once.  Is Steel Viper open?  Yep, that ones on.   What about Snapdragon?  That one is good to go, too.  Renegade Falls?   The waters not on.  High Roller?  Yes.  Space Spin?  Oh yeah.  Power Tower?  Theyre doing the inspection this week.  There was only one ride I really cared about  mine and Brandons favorite.   What about Mayhem Mountain?  Fuck. Yes. He answered to collective groans from the rest.   Mayhem Mountain had always been our thing. The others had always been happy to ride High Roller and Snapdragon into exhaustion, Brandon and I always split off toward the end of the day to ride Mayhem Mountain into the twilight hours.   Ugh, Charlotte shuddered. I hate that ride.  Its boring as hell, Koji agreed. I helped design something similar for Disneyland Hong Kong. We put it in *Fantasy Land*, for fucks sake.  Hey, that ride is awesome. Its long and it goes upside down, I argued. Charlotte is even too scared to ride it!  Im not *scared* of that ride, it just gives me the creeps. Something about it, just, I dont know, seems off.  Alright, look. Well start at this end of the park and work our way towards the back. That way we can ride every ride thats passed inspection - including Mayhem Mountain. Brandon said.  And Snapdragon, Tyler added and the others nodded excitedly.  Yes, *every* ride. And of course we can ride them, you know, as many times as we want.   Hell yes, brother. Koji high-fived Brandon and we headed down the street toward Space Spin.  Our progress through the park was blissfully slow.  Everyone wanted to ride every ride multiple times and one person always had to stay in the loading area to operate the ride.  It only took an hour or two to forget that I was a fully grown 35 year old man. Being back here, running through the line-ways with my friends, arguing who got the first row of the first car, it was like being 12 years old again.  Still, my eye was constantly drawn up over the buildings into the distance, to the back of the park where the high, gleaming rails of Mayhem Mountain shined in the unobscured sun. There would be no arguing who got front row on that coaster - it was me and Brandon. It was *always* me and Brandon.  Charlotte, Tyler and Koji were the most like children, constantly running ahead and arguing over which ride to get on next, yelling back to ask Brandon if this one or that one had been cleared by the contractors.   Brandon and I held back from the group a bit, discussing ideas and possible improvements for the park. Scott and Dani took up the rear of the group, quietly talking and lighting joints.   When we arrived at the Enterprise, a simple ride that consisted on spinning cars on a circular track, I offered to flip the switch while the rest of the group rode to excess. The Enterprise always made me sick when we were kids. Brandon offered to stay on the platform with me to chat while everyone else rode the ride.   I flipped the switch to turn the ride on and as the cars spun away from the loading area, the Enterprises signage came into view. I sighed. All day I had been trying to ignore the bright graffiti sprayed all over the park but the words painted over the signage for the Enterprise were impossible to ignore.  *Where did the missing kids go?*  And the rest of the graffiti in the park was much the same. Most said things like: Where are they?, Runaway Row, Find Ryan Kinskey, and The Missing are now Dead. Similar sayings could be found in town sprayed across a few dilapidated buildings in the industrial district.    Brandons eyes avoided the sign but I could tell he was thinking about it, too.   Do you think the reason they shut this park down, I mean, do you see that being an issue for park attendance? I asked as casually as I could.  Brandon was quiet for a few moments as he waited for the ride to slow to a stop so he could flip the switch again.   Nah, I dont think so. Low attendance issues arent actually what shut the park down.  They arent? This surprised me.  Nope. When we were negotiating the sale of the park, I was given access to the parks financials in the 80s.  So they werent operating at a loss?  Oh they were. But this park has operated in the red since opening day in the 70s. Half of their revenue was being fed back into something called county services, whatever that is. The bank couldnt tell me and believe me, I tried to find out.  County services I mused.  Yep. Bizarre. And according to the paperwork the park was closed because the owner didnt want to live here anymore. And he couldnt be bothered to wait for a decent offer on the property so he just sold it to the bank for next to nothing.  So he was a rich guy. I leaned back against the railing to stretch my back. And an idiot.  Yes  to an extreme in both cases. The owner of the park was Abel Bissette.  Abel Bisette? Related to that French billionaire, Im guessing?  Brandon nodded. Michael Bisette. He built this park for his son in the 70s. Abel was never really what we would call business inclined. Ive always heard him described as simple.  I cant believe the son of a billionaire lives in this area.  Well, not anymore. He moved on decades ago.  I shook my head in disbelief. Who would ever have thought that our simple little park was owned by a famous billionaires son? Hell, I may have even sat next to him on rides and had no idea!  You guys want to go again? Brandon yelled to the others as the ride again came to a stop.  Im ready to move on, Koji yelled back. Anybody want to ride again?  Nope! a chorus of voices replied.  It was near 5 oclock when we finally arrived at Mayhem Mountain. As the sun began to set a familiar panic and urgency welled in the pit of my stomach. It took a moment for me to realize that we didnt have to leave when the park closed this time  because the park didnt close. We could stay until sun-up if we wanted to!  As I eagerly approached the turn-style for Mayhem Mountain Tyler spoke up behind me. Listen, can we run into town and grab something to eat before we ride Mayhem?  You really want to ride Mayhem *after* we eat? Asked Koji.  Good point.  Theres only *one* loop, Dani rolled her eyes.  Two, I said. Dont forget the inline roll.  Yep, two. Scott answered. Plus its a two minute ride. If your food isnt sitting well, youve got a long wait til its over.  Look, I said, Lets ride it a couple times and then go eat. When we come back well see how we feel.  Everyone nodded and we started walking through the line-ways up to the platform. When we reached the loading dock, I was excited to see our favorite green car sitting on the track.  Front seat! Brandon and I yelled simultaneously as the train cars came into view and everyone behind us groaned.   Im staying here, Charlotte said. Ill just work the launchpad thingy.  Still scared after all these years, Char? Scott teased her.   Shut up, Burnout.  Scott laughed and tousled her hair before running and jumping into the first car behind Brandon and I. Dani got in next to him and then Tyler and Koji took the second car. We pulled the shoulder restraints down and they locked in place.  Ready? Charlotte asked.  Yep! Brandon yelled back, Send the car through!  Charlotte pulled the lever and the brakes disengaged. As the car moved forward I turned to Brandon.  Did we get the green car on purpose? I yelled to him as the coaster clacked around the load platform and began the clattery climb up the first lift hill.  Yep! We sent cars through here all morning but I made sure Rich knew to leave the Green Machine in the loading bay.  Awesome.  As the train climbed up the lift hill I made no attempt to hide my utter glee. I looked out over the expansive park and couldnt believe it was mine. Every track, every car, every turn-style, every *screw*, from the front gate to the overflow parking lot in the back, it was all ours. How I wished I could go back in time and tell a young me waiting in the two hour line for Mayhem Mountain  one day, you will OWN this place.   And as we crested the hill and the train fell into the first drop, I realized I essentially *had* gone back in time. At least, I was screaming like a 12 year old, as was everyone else behind me.   We dipped into the first tester hill and then banked hard and up, to the second lift hill. We dropped from there, down into the vertical loop, banked around a set of gift ships, up briefly and then down a small hill into the inline roll. When we arrived back at the loading bay we were all screaming and whooping. Charlotte didnt even have to ask, just smiled at us and sent us through again.   We went twice more before we finally got off the ride. Koji walked over to check out the control panel while the rest of us taunted my sister.   You sure you dont want to go, Char? Its awesome.  Nah, Im good. I have no problem being the carny for this ride. She laughed.  Come on, Charlotte, just one time. One time and well leave you alone. Tyler urged.  No, no, no, no, no. No way. Not interested. Ill ride anything else, though!  Hey, do you guys know what Track B is? Koji asked.  Track B? What do you mean? Brandon walked over to Koji at the control board and raised an eyebrow. Thats weird.  Its probably just the track they use to get the cars into the storage bay, Scott said with a shrug.    No, Koji said. Thats called a transfer track. Track B has to be something else.  Yeah, well Ive been on this ride enough times to know that there is no other track.  Yep, Tyler agreed with me. He has.   Soshould we try it? Brandon tested.   Fuck no. Said Charlotte. If you dont know what Track B is that means the contractors dont know about it either. Which means it hasnt been inspected in at least 20 years. Thats suicide.  Look, Koji said, if Track B exists than even the most incompetent of engineers would have found it during an inspection.  And Rich cleared this entire ride, Brandon nodded. Its probably just the ride in reverse. Were good.  Well, were in, announced Scott from the other side of the track, though Dani didnt look quite on board with the idea.   Mark? Tyler asked.  Yeah, I guess Im in. What the worst that could happen: we get funneled into a repair bay?  Alright, then Im in too. Tyler said hesitantly.   Koji shrugged. Here goes nothing.   He flipped the switch over to Track B and a moment later a loud metallic scraping some distance away filled the park. The sound lasted almost a minute.  I studied the familiar silver roller coaster under the pink sky of the setting sun but I saw no physical changes to the track. I looked over at Brandon and a shrug of his shoulders told me he didnt either.  Shall we? Scott asked gesturing to the train cars wed just disembarked. I gave Charlotte a questioning look but she shook her head emphatically no. So it was just the six of us again.  Its only right you two take the bow of the ship. Tyler gave a mock salute. Oh Captains, my captains.  I laughed and hopped into the right side of the front row. Brandon crawled into the seat next to me. Tyler and Koji got in behind us and Scott and Dani took the back. We pulled the shoulder bars down and they locked into place.   Are you sure about this? Charlotte asked when everyone was settled.  Dani said something from her place a few rows back but all I heard was Brandon yelling Pull it!  The brakes released and the train rolled away from the platform and into the twilight of dusk. The lights had lit up on the track while wed been arguing and the roller coaster looked absolutely beautiful. I was filled with awe and reverence at what this place truly meant to mean and my friends. It was a symbol of our youth and innocence and blissful ignorance of the world. It was our own little bubble of happiness.  The coaster again climbed the lift hill and from the top Brandon and I studied the track but in those few seconds I saw no difference. Brandon looked over and I shook my head at him disappointedly.  By the time we reached the vertical loop halfway through the ride it was clear that there was no Track B. But it was hard to be upset because I was still on Mayhem Mountain and still found it an impossible challenge not to smile.  We banked around the now brightly lit gift shops, up the small tester hill and then back down to the inline roll. Exceptthe inline roll was suddenly above us. Wed missed it. Instead the track now descended into a large, square hole in the ground behind the gift shops  and we were headed directly into it.  I was in too much shock to scream or even move. The black hole swallowed us in an instant and we descended into complete darkness. I felt a comfortable pressure leave my shoulders and realized that the shoulder bars had released. I gripped the front lip of the ledge of my seat and heard the terrified screams of my friends behind me as the coaster suddenly spun into what felt like an inline roll. I was too scared to do anything but hold on for dear life though some part of my brain registered that the g-forces of the roll probably would have been enough to keep me in my seat if I had let go. Probably.   We came out of the inline roll and dropped again - hard. As the roller coaster dropped the room suddenly lit up around us and I saw the track below arcing up into a light tester hill. As we hit the bottom of the hill the shoulder bars lowered mechanically. The car went over the small tester hill and then braked to start up another tall lift hill. I took my first breath since dropping through the ground and looked around, tuning out the screams of Dani and Tyler behind me.   We were in what can be described as a cavernous room and I only assume it stretched to the farthest reaches of the park above. There were lots of vertical loops, high drops and sharp curves that put the track perpendicular to the ground. Throughout the entire sublevel building lamps dotted the wall every 30 feet. They put out a dreary, yellowed glow for as far as the eye could see. But many were burnt out and in parts the track disappeared into darkness.  But in the dull, yellow edges of the light I saw something that registered in me a horror beyond death. Far away from us, in a section of shadowy track, I saw the high crest of a peak hill which reached almost the ceiling of the giant room. And then the track justended.   Suddenly feel the horrible reality of the world outside my mind began to bleed in. Dani was screaming uncontrollably, Tyler was crying, bawling even, Koji was yelling at Brandon who was looking straight at me, hitting my leg hard and repeating my name. As the cars continued to climb I finally gave him my attention. I didnt want to be alone in the fear anymore.  What is this? was all I could think of to say.  We have to get off this ride. We have to get off this ride, Mark.  I fucking know, man.  Were going to die.  I fucking know, man! I yelled as we reached the top of the lift hill and dropped over the other side. I squeezed my eyes shut until I felt the shoulder bars once again release and I bit my lip to keep from crying. I opened my eyes and choked as I watched the track ahead up us bend up into a vertical loop. I reached up and tried to pull the shoulder bar down but it was locked in place.  Hang on! Hang onto the seats! I yelled as loud as I could.  As we approached the loop I felt the brakes engaging, slowing the car, and a tow cable catch beneath my feet. We were being pulled up through the loop, but too slowly for gravity to keep us in our seats.   As the train began to invert I felt my feet rise from the floor of the car. My hair fell over my face and my butt left the seat. I closed my eyes and tried to block out the screams of terror from behind me. I concentrated on my death grip of the ledge of my seat as we rounded the track. We remained upside down for what felt like eternity. Finally the pressure began to ease, my butt dropped to my seat and my feet to the floor. The white noise subsided from my ears and I heard Kojis screaming.  Tyler! Fuck, fuck, he fell out. Fuck, he fell, hes dead, man, hes dead.  He hit the track down there. Brandon yelled at me, wide-eyed and crazy looking. I was finally seeing the Brandon from my youth. The shoulder bars descended again, this time locking in tighter.  We came out of loop and sped up and down several tester hills. I tried to study the track ahead of us as we went through the safer parts. I thought I saw water reflecting off the metal rails somewhere in the distance. Brandon sobbed in his seat.   Mark, what are we gonna do? I dont wanna die, man. I dont wanna fucking die.  I dont know. I dont know what to do. Im sorry, Im fucking scared, too. I answered him.   We banked around a corner of the room and the shoulder bars released again. This time we dove into a curve that put the left side of the train parallel to the ground  and it was a long drop. I gripped the edge of the seat tightly as before but this time I kept my eyes open and was able to catch Brandon as he began to slip out of his seat.   By the time the train righted itself, I couldnt tell whod been lost. Most of the screaming behind me had turned to loud sobbing or silence. The shoulder bar didnt reengage and I felt the cars brakes slow the train down again. I didnt have to loop to know what was coming next.   It was another inverted loop - this one was tall and large and I could tell wed be upside down for longer. Someone behind me began screaming again, Dani I think, as I tried to take measured breaths and position my hurting hands back under the lip of the seat. Brandon did the same and looked over at me as the car started up the loop with tears streaming down his face.   I dont wanna die in here, man.  I shook my head back at him because I could think of nothing to say.   I felt tears leave my own eyes as we reached the tipping point of the loop and my feet again left the floor. Before we were even completely upside down I felt my back begin to slip down the seat. I thought if I lost my grip, I could try to grab for the shoulder bars when I fell out of the car.   The car suddenly stopped and I opened my eyes to see we were completely inverted. I grunted loudly at the pain and immense effort it was taking to keep my grip on the seat. The car started to move again slowly and I heard Brandon say something to me. I looked over at him just before he slid out of the car. One second he was there, next to me, and the next he was falling, falling away from the car.  I saw Brandon try to grab the shoulder bar on the way out but we couldnt keep his grip on it. I watched him fall and I saw him break his back on the track below and he stopped moving. I stared down at him as the car continued to move slowly around the loop and he stared back up at me, dead, or dying. By the time the car hit him on the way out of the loop, he was completely gone.  The shoulder bars re-engaged and we went through a dreadfully long period where nothing happened. We were secured in our seats by the restraints as the coaster spent what felt like several minutes racing over hills, banks, curves, even an inline roll.   Without the adrenaline pumping through my veins, I felt the shock begin to wear off. It was replaced by a panic and fear unlike Id ever experienced. And I decided that was the point of this section of track: to build and facilitate an unbearable fear.   I felt the brakes engage finally and I looked ahead to find the loop we were surely entering but there was none. We were high, almost to the top of the ceiling and we slowed to a stop on a straightaway. Directly ahead was a drop and at the bottom of the hill, a series of four different tracks, with a transfer stack just before they split off. Each track had five or so feet of color  red, orange, green and blue  before racing off in different directions.   I felt an urgent shaking of my shoulder and turned around to hear what Koji was saying.  Which track are we connected to?   I looked at the transfer stack.  Green.  Where does green go? It was hard to hear him over the sound of Danis sobbing from the second car. I tried to trace the green track through the building, constantly losing it and finding it again. I wasnt sure, but it seemed to end at the lift hill Id seen earlier. The hill with no track at the top.  It ends at that hill, I yelled back at him and pointed. Dani cried louder.   Fuck.  While we were stopped I rubbed my hurting hands together. As I looked down at them I noticed something new in the car. At some point a small, blinking panel had flipped over in the wall at the front of the car. It had four colored buttons and an old analog timer. The timer was so old and damaged that though the numbers were clearly changing I couldnt see how long we had.   We get to choose, I said and explained what I was looking at.  Can you see which track ends where? Koji asked.  I followed all the track as best I could but the rails circled and slid in between each other. It was hard to tell which track went where.  I think the blue track ends in that big pool in the corner. The red track ends in a wall and the orange one just drops into a hole in the floor like the one we came down here through. I think.  Theres no way out, dude, said Scott from the second car. His voice was unsettlingly calm. Theyre just telling us how were going to die.  We can still find a way out of this. I answered quietly, more to myself than to him.  Choose the pool, Scott said, and I could hear the tears in his voice. Ive heard drowning isnt an awful death. Ive heard its calming at the end.  No! Choose the hole in the floor, said Koji. Its possible it drops down into another cavern like this. There might be more track which means more time to figure out how to live.  You dont think wed be the first to choose that option, do you? Scott asked him. And no one that went missing ever came back. Theres just more death in that hole.  I dont want to die like this, Koji begged. And at least its a chance.  Dani was still whimpering in the back and offered no suggestion. It seemed the decision was up to me and I had to make it fast.   I knew I didnt want to die by dropping off the track. I didnt want to drown. Perhaps the quickest death was the wall. More than likely we would all be killed instantly. Less suffering, less time to think about our fates. But the truth was, I wasnt enough entirely positive which track ended where. It was all educated guesswork and my time was up.   The orange. Lets go down to the second floor, if there is one.  Scott and Dani said nothing and Koji choked out the last words Id ever hear him say.   Push it before it chooses for us.  Before I could think about it any longer I pushed the orange button and committed us to whatever death it led to. We heard the metallic scraping of the track transferring below. Once the orange track was securely connected, the brakes on the car released and the train rolled slowly toward the drop. Dani started screaming again.   As we dropped down the hill I got a better view of the orange track. There was a vertical loop ahead that didnt look as high as the others wed been through. If fact, it looked like there was a chance the fall wouldnt kill us. *If* it wasnt an optical illusion and *if* the shoulder bars disengaged for that loop we might have a shot at living through this. I yelled back to everyone behind me.  Let yourself fall out of the loop, the one up there!  No one responded to me, which didnt matter because I didnt think Id have the courage to let go of the seat anyway.  We raced along the track in and out of banks and curves. And one point we passed along the pool and I looked down. Below the waters surface the track ended above an even deeper pool. I could see the shadows of several coaster cars at the very bottom.   I suddenly felt the brakes engage and I realized we were coming to the loop. I tested the shoulder bar by pushing up on it but it stayed locked. I was somewhat relieved in that moment to know I wouldnt have to make the decision to fall out now or gamble on the orange track.  But suddenly  the restraints released.  As we started up the loop I gripped the lip of the seat tightly and turned my head back to look down. It looked like we were very high and I only hoped the ground was the loosely packed dirt that it looked like. I had to choose now  the fall or the hole. I choose the fall.   As I began to slide up the seat I yelled at the others to let go and fall out of the car. And then I closed my eyes  and let go. I felt my head crack the shoulder bar on the way out.   It wasnt like a slow motion fall - it was over before I realized that Id actually let go. One moment I felt an intense pain as my head hit the bar and in the same moment I realized I was on the ground. I hadnt even had the time to realize the possibility of hitting the track below or get run over by the cars. I opened my eyes in time to watch the cars speed over the track above me.   The pain didnt hit me all at once. I had one long, blissful second before I felt it. And then I was in agony.  Id hoped my body was so in shock that I wouldnt feel much of the pain but I felt it all. I concentrated on keeping my eyes open and trying to catalog the damage. There was blood on my clothes but I didnt know what part of my body it was coming from. I heard screaming as well but I didnt know if it was in my head or coming from my friends as they approached the end.   I didnt want to move, didnt think it was safe to move, but I knew I had to, if only to pull out my phone. With trembling fingers I pulled the thing from my pocket and brought it to my face, trying to focus on the screen. But it was shattered and refused to even turn on. I threw it away from me and then I realized the silence.  Their ride had ended.   With a great amount of effort I rolled over onto my stomach and dragged my broken body across the ground toward where I thought I remembered seeing the hole. I crawled for what seemed like hours and maybe it was. Sometimes I tried to stand or even kneel but the pain in my back and ribs was too great. I passed out several times from shock and pain but eventually I made it to where the track disappeared into the ground. I pulled myself to the edge and looked down inside the hole.   The track ended just below the surface.   It was a natural shaft with walls made of rock. I didnt know how deep it went and I didnt want to. It was a fate Id only narrowly escaped. But then I thought my friends were down there and maybe someone survived.   Koji? My voice echoed loudly down the shaft. No answer.   Scott? Nothing.   I reached for a nearby screw and dropped it down the hole. It took half a minute to land and when it did it was with a *tink* as it hit something metal. The small sound echoed up the shaft and out into the cavernous room and I realized this place was built with acoustics in mind. I rolled over onto my back and studied everything I could see from where I was, staving off my bodies desire to pass out again. I felt nothing but numbness when I finally saw what I was looking for - a long, panoramic window in the far wall. I knew what Track B was for and I finally let myself slip away into the darkness.  I remember very little of my rescue. There were lots of people in uniform and my sister yelling and pain - lots of pain. I was in and out on the way to the hospital but I remember I passed through the room behind the window at some point. And from my stretcher, through the chaos, I saw in that room a single chair facing the window. It was covered in a deep layer of dust.   I was never visited by anyone official, let alone asked to give a statement. Charlotte stayed by my side at the hospital for months while I recovered. She wouldnt say much about that day although she finally did tell me something. She that that they wouldnt let her ride with me to the hospital and that someone offered her a ride. On that drive shed been spoken to by two people that had convinced her to never speak of what had happened and to convince me of the same. Whatever they threatened her with had her begging me to agree. And I did  at the time.  I am still to this day learning to walk without aid. I never saw Mayhem Mountain again. The loan defaulted and Adventure Valley was bought up by an unknown LLC which bulldozed it and built a block of apartments over the top. Theyre still empty to this day.  I dont like the dark anymore. It reminds me of the horror my friends experienced as they looked down and saw the track end before they disappeared into that hole. I try not to think of what they must have felt as they fell down the shaft in complete darkness, strapped to a roller coaster, waiting for the terrible end. I wish Id chosen the pool, if only to save them from that fate.  As for the billionaires son, he was only simple in the fact that he was a man of simple tastes. And he still is.  I looked him up once, only a few years ago. He owns several amusement parks now, all sizable but small enough to be popular only in their specific regions. In fact, one is not very far from where I live now.   Ive thought about going many times, just to check, just to see. But then I realized that I probably didnt need to search all the rides in the park to know.   Because I know that somewhere in that park, some ride in some cornerhas a Track B.

See and people have been telling me there were no rooms 733/734 and I distinctly remember them.    I'm in!    It's May 20th all over again.    About a day    I am. I will PM you!    Here! I'm here. You are free to use that story!    If you want to just wait for May 1, that's fine with me.    Thanks!   I thought it was too long for Nosleep, honestly.    Have met a Gennipher.    Oh man.    Try and see this as blue black and then go back to the original image. http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg   I only saw gold/white and thought everyone was trolling me. I came back to the image 15 minutes later and it had switched to blue/black. It's bizarre.   http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg   Look at this image: http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg   I saw it as white/gold only until someone posted this picture: http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg  Now the original image has switched to black/blue.   I only saw the white gold until someone posted this picture: http://i.imgur.com/1N29HcQ.jpg  I stared at it so long that the original picture has switched to black/blue and not I can't figure out how I saw gold/white.   The bottom picture you linked is the first time I've been able to see the black and blue so THANK YOU.    I agree. I cannot figure out how to see blue and black. Especially the lace trim, like how is anyone getting black. So I asked my kid and she saw blue and black and I know she's not trolling me.  Such an interesting phenomenon.    I try so hard and for the life of me I cannot see the black. It looks gold and darker gold.

It's just one of those things you have to read. It's brilliant.    I like the way you think, sir.    No, you're good. If you're asking which came first, it was undoubtedly the script of this movie. Regardless, both stories borrowed the concept from Flatliners.    I'll admit I was unpleasantly surprised when I saw the trailer for this but honestly, as you said, so far the only similarity I can see is using a serum to bring someone back from the dead.

"Because nothing happened."  "Someone died that day, didn't they?"  "I've already told you, there was no murder. No one died."  The one named Shaw braced his arms on the table in front of me and hung his head between his shoulders, mumbling to himself in obvious frustration.  "Alright," said the other one, called McNulty, from a darkened corner of the small room."Why don't you tell us what you do remember?"  "Am I being arrested?"   "No, you're being questioned." From McNulty.  "I've been here for 7 hours now, I want to go home."  "You can't go home, Mr. Lancer."  "Then I want my lawyer. Have you called the number I gave you? Christian Bennett's office."  "We can't reach him."  "Give me my phone and I will call him."  "We don't have your phone."   "I want to see my wife then."  The one named Shaw slammed his fist into the table and then dragged his chair to the other corner of the room. He dropped down into it and kicked his legs up to rest his ankles on the doorknob and then pulled out a pack of smokes. "You know that's not an option, David."  "Why is it not an option?"  "Do you really not remember?" From McNulty.   "I've told you, I don't know what you're talking about. What I do remember is you guys showing up to arrest me out of the blue."  "You aren't under arrest, David." Shaw said through the cigarette between his lips.  "Tell me about the party." From McNulty.   "What party?"  "The one we've been talking about all night, Mr. Lancer."   "I don't know what else you want to hear. Jen and I showed up on time at the restaurant, we met my son's fiance's parents, we celebrated Andrew's engagement for a few hours, we went home."  "Someone died."  "No one died! We ate, we drank, we paid the bill and Jen and I left!"  "How much was the bill?" Asked McNulty.  "I don't remember. A little over $11,000."  "That's an awful lot of money for a dinner." From Shaw.  "It was my son's engagement party."  "Your daughter-in-law's parents didn't chip in then?"  "No. My wife and I are well off and they are not. We offered to pay."  "And your son didn't contribute either?"  "Why would they? Andrew and his girlfriend have only just graduated from college. They don't have a lot of money."  "Has your son seemed interested in your finances lately?" From Shaw.  "No! What has my son got to do with this?"  "Why don't you tell me what happened after that." From McNulty.  "We went home and we went to bed."  "Tell us about the murder, David." From Shaw.  "I don't know how many other ways to tell you people this - THERE WAS NO MURDER."  "Mr. Lancer," McNulty stepped from his dark corner  but didn't unfold his arms. He seemed to regard me with distant amusement while Shaw stared intently through rings of smoke. If this was a game of Good Cop/Bad Cop, it was obvious who was who. "Did you see your son again that night?"  "No, I did not." I said through clenched teeth. "Why are you suddenly bringing up Andrew?"  "Are you sure?" From Shaw.  "Yes, I'm sure I did not see him again that night. Did something happen to my son? Is that what you've been trying to say to me? Is Andrew-"  "Your son is perfectly fine, Mr. Lancer. Perfectly alive, anyway." From McNulty.  "What is that supposed to mean?"  "Are you sure you don't remember seeing your son again that night?"  "I did not see Andrew again that night!" But then, right at that moment, it became untrue. Andrew's face appeared in my mind's eye, and from a scene I couldn't remember happening. He had emerged from the dark, pale and frightened, holding something that wasn't quite in the frame.  "Do you recall the murder, David?"  And then sound bled into the scene, too. A ragged breath from him, like tearing paper. A surprised utterance of his name from me. A burdened grunt, an unexpected crack in the darkness, and footsteps running up the stairs. And then I remembered it all suddenly falling away from me.  "Do you remember who died that night?" McNulty asked leaning against the wall next to the window. He was looking out of it into the darkness, into a world that I had failed to notice in my long hours there, or, perhaps, had tried not to. A world made only of sharp, gray angles and raw, white corners, a world without colors or curves.   "Yes, I think I do remember." I said, staring out the same window, waiting for a sun that should have risen hours ago.  "It was me."                     Yes.    As soon as the door to the cabin closed behind us, I ripped off my mud caked jacket and threw it at Ben.   "What the fuck are we doing?!"  "They were there. They were out there."  "There is no 'they', Ben. There's only Ash."  "No, Ash is dead; he was probably dead within minutes of walking out of this cabin."  "Then where's his body, Ben? Why was his grave empty?"  I knew I was starting to snap. The shock, the absurdity of it allmy brain couldnt compartmentalize it anymore.  "I don't know. It was the first grave; it was made to- made to draw us out there."  "By Ash. Theres no other logical-  "No," Ben shook his head, "Mel was right, Ash wouldn't do that."  "Well he did do that."  "You're wrong."  "Because there's no other alternative-"  "Those things we're seeing aren't Ash!"  "-and I refuse to believe that stick figure people-"  " You have to accept the fact-"  "-are running around the woods killing our friends-"  "-that we're being hunted out here-"  "- and field-stripping their dead bodies!"  "-by something fucked up and inhuman!  "-when it's clearly Ashley suffering from some sort of PTSD!"  "It's not Ash, Ingrid.  "He murdered Lloyd!"  "Listen to me-  "Ashley fucking murdered Lloyd!"  No-  Theres no-  "I DID IT! Okay? I killed Lloyd!"  I shook my head, disoriented and took a step backward.  "It was me, Ingrid! I killed Lloyd."  "Why are you saying that..." I choked.  "Because it's true. Out by the jeep-"  "Stop."  "And I'm pretty sure that Lloyd ki-"  "Stop!"  "Ingrid, you have to listen to me if you want to survive. Those things, they have this power - when they're near you - to make you so angry. Fuck, I mean, fuck, I just, I couldnt stop beating Lloyd's head in with a-"  "STOP!" I gasped, trying desperately to draw air into my lungs. I clutched the back of the couch for support. I could feel a blind, foreign rage building in me and I turned my knuckles white trying to quell it.  "Are you on Ash's side? I whispered, finally. Did he tell you to hurt Lloyd?"   No, I just...I just killed him."  "And who peeled the flesh from his bones and buried him in the ground then, Benjamin?" I said and was unsettled by the flat, impassive tone of my voice.  "They did."  "Why would they do that?"  Ben nodded to Lloyd's computer, which was sitting open on the coffee table where he'd left after he went to bed at the end of his watch.   "Read what Lloyd has been writing, Ingrid."  Keeping a wary eye on Ben I rounded the couch and picked up the computer, waking up the monitor with a swipe of my finger.  There were only 15 pages - which didn't seem like much for the days he'd spent locked away writing - and while it started out like any other story, the text quickly descended into nonsense and random strings of alphanumeric until the last three pages on which he'd simply typed *It Eats Us* over and over again.   I slammed the laptop shut and threw it on the loveseat. Then I walked over to fridge, pulled out the last beer in it - one of Ben's- and dropped down into the nearest chair.   Ben hadn't moved.   "I'm so sorry, Ingrid. I'm so sorry. I loved Lloyd like a brother and I just snapped. I was just holding the crowbar and thinking about-"  "Stop talking, Ben."  He stopped but choked on a pent-up sob. Ben was right. Mel was right. It wasn't Ash, it couldnt be. It was something else all along, something that lived out in the wood.  "Ingrid, I have to-"  "Ben, the only reason you're telling me this is because they want you to, I'd guess. I don't have a reason to hate you and so they're allowing you to give me one."  *CREAK*  Ben and I looked at each other and then at the door to the basement. It was coming up the stairs.  I knew it was over, we were totally fucked. There was nothing left to do but die. I raised my beer to Ben, gave him a solemn nod, took a long gulp and then hurled the bottle at the basement door where is shattered into tiny pieces.  "Fuck you."   "Ingrid," Ben brought my attention back to him and he looked at me pleadingly, through the veil of a thousand different emotions. "Run."  Before I could respond, Ben dove for the basement door and threw himself down the stairs. I shot up out of the chair in horror as his body made the most tortured and sickening screams I had ever heard.   I stood there for long seconds listening to his flesh ripping apart to the soundtrack of a low, satisfied growl.   I was frozen. I was alone. And as I looked desperately around the room for something to fight it with, I found the thing that I couldn't see before, the thing that had bothered me about the room since Moss disappeared.   And it wasn't unexpected or unsettling; it was just...out of place.  There had appeared sometime overnight a long, very thin black line that ran vertically against the wall from floor to almost ceiling. It was hard to see and at first glance it appeared to be a crack in the wood but when I really looked at it, it somehow wasn't actually on the wall at all.   And then, as I was studying it, it moved and expanded to become the tall, black stick man from Ash's drawing. No, it hadn't expanded...it had turned toward me. And the thing was as thin as a piece of construction paper.  I can tell you that when you're presented with something so impossible and something so innately wrong, you don't scream. You don't gasp. You just stand there frozen with confusion and, in my case, crippling fear.  It took another creak from the basement stairs to snap me out of my catatonia. The creature that had been quietly standing in front of me suddenly sprang to life and ran at me with all the fluidity of an animated drawing.   Since it was between me and front door I turned and fled out onto the deck through the sliding glass door which Mel had left blessedly open. I ran to the end of the patio, and without taking half a second to think, climbed over the wooden railing and jumped off.  I heard the bones break underneath me when I landed but adrenaline kept the pain from crippling me entirely. I ran as best I could across the clearing toward the treeline. The fog thinned suddenly in the direction I was running and I saw the third stick man waiting for me in the trees.  I quickly tried to change course and fell on my broken ankles. When I looked up to see if it was coming toward me, I saw that it wasn't actually a stick man at all, it was something almost worse. It was Melanie.  She was hanging by the neck from a tree branch, facing the cabin and, consequently, me. I was on my feet and running toward her in under a second. When I got to her I could tell immediately that I was far too late and too short to reach the branch she was hanging from. All I could do was watch her dead body swing in the wind and cry. The rope she hung from looked like it couldnt hold her wait, but it did. Where did she even get it?   I looked back at the house then, to see if the stick men were close, but it wasn't them that I noticed. It was what Melanie had seen out at the graves, the thing that made her run.  Ash was on the roof, lying there, splayed out for us all to see. His head was untouched and his face held a look of intense pain and horror. His hands and shoes were pristine, too. But the rest of his body; from his neck, to his wrists, to his ankles were picked clean of flesh. He was simply a brittle skeleton with a face.   So, they had done this. They had done this to Ash and they were doing the same to Mel, giving her the tools she needed to die. And soon she would look just like Ash did. I couldnt bear the thought.  I tried everything I could think of to get her down from the tree until the physical pain ebbed in and, just as it did, I saw the shape of a stick man walking toward me through the fog. I told Melanie I was sorry and then I ran, falling only once as I sprinted away from the horrors of the mountain.   The Stick Man never caught me because it didn't want to. After hours of walking, when I thought the agony of my broken bones and soul was going to kill me, I could still see them in the wood. And Ash was right, there were three. They would appear as a silhouette and then disappear as they turned to walk and reappear...well, anywhere. But they would always end up closer to me than they were before.   And then, long after night had fallen, I tripped on a dirt road and didn't get back up. I stared up at an empty, starless sky and waited for a passerby or a Stick Man to claim me. It ended up being the former.   No one ever believed me about the Stick Men.   They told me all of our phones were found in our rooms. They said there was nothing wrong with the cars. That may be true now, but it wasn't then. I know they'll never believe me about what really happened out in the woods, but I'll always know. The Stick Men stripped our souls away. And then the Stick Men ate what was left.    Yeah somewhere on the 5th floor. One of the dorms is super haunted they say and yeah, I think it might have been Morton.    Howdy, author of posted story here. I also lived in Reilly but I think on the 5th floor if I remember right. I based everything in the story around NAU but, as you can tell, took a lot of liberties. For those interested, there was a suicide room on our floor that was turned into a broom closest. Not sure if true or urban legend though.   Yeah, Reddit did that. It's universal from what I hear.

We appreciate your work.   Just keep adding Atlas 5's, problem solved!   Any idea how long it took to slow Cassini down enough to be captured?   We put things in the orbit of Mars, so that's possible.    Jupiter is so massive that they probably have to make sure to avoid probes getting dragged into it's orbit.    I believe there is a probe hanging around Saturn.  Uranus and Neptune were fly-bys?  (I'm asking, I can't recall.)   I wonder how far off from possible an orbital probe out there is.    I suspect the real reason is money, there just isn't much that having something in orbit of Pluto would accomplish vs a fly-by and the cost is probably a lot higher.   Is it even reasonable to put something in to orbit around Pluto, or is it just to small to get a probe out there in a reasonable time, and stop it?

It's a strong surfactant, and some people are sensitive to it, although most people don't notice.   It will "dry out" your skin, which in this instance is a touch misleading becuase it's not removing water, it's removing the stearic acid (which is similar to wax) from your skin.  Without the oily layer in your skin, moisture escapes, and your skin gets flaky.   In order for SLS to do this, it has to get into your skin, the micelle formed by SLS is quite smaller, and it can slip into the pores, for some people this is worse than others.  Another surfactant, SLES, sodium laureth sulfate, is similar in structure, but it has a few ethylene oxide units between the carbon chain and the sulfate group.  It turns out this is hugely important to the irritation profile.  Those groups make the micelle of the SLES much bigger, and they don't enter the skin nearly as much, hence they are far less irritating.  Now, SLES doesn't foam as well, adn people like foam, even though it has nothing to do with cleaning.  So to increase foam in SLES shampoos, some companies add SLS or Cocoamidylpropyl betaine, which is a foaming agent (it's glorified coconut oil, all of these things are.)  As it turns out, the SLES and betaine conbine to make the shampoo even less irritating, depending on the "sulfate-free" shampoo, it may be significantly less irritating that the sulfate-free (this is the case if the shampoo uses an alpha-olefin sulfonate surfactant.)  So there is not problem with SLES, but it's a "sulfate" so now people think it's terrible...even though they don't know why. It's fine, unless you're a statistically trivial group that has unusual sensitivity, then you should not care.

Please add a comment with a direct link to the original research, then message the moderators for reapproval    *If you feel this was done in error, or would like further clarification, please don't hesitate to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FScience message=My%20Post:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3cjem7/weve_been_wrong_about_where_the_brain_processes/).*   I was wondering that, I suspect there is a reason they can't, Deimorz is pretty sharp, I would be surprised if he didn't think of that.  Also:  Can we expect to see you around a bit more? We saw you were added as a mod to /r/defaultmods...   It's the suppression of freedom that adds the zest!   Things have improved because /u/Deimorz and /u/krispykrackers are now tasked with listening to us and making things happen. Deimorz is explaining to moderators what is technically possible, and what is not.  He's going to work on making things happen, and I personally believe him.  (krispykrackers too.) Deimorz wrote Automoderator, he gets it.  Both are the most trusted admins left, and  if either of them get sacked for no reason, reddit will burn to the ground.   I think I may mention to Kn0thing that removing Deimorz would be a really bad idea...I think that might be taken seriously now!   That must have been done when subreddits were rolled out, right?  /u/spez has some 'splaining to do!   Please disclose where you work, your role there, the projects you have worked on, and a summary of your personal investments to continue this conversation.   Dude, shampoo is fascinating stuff when you get into the details.  Just look at the ingredients, I can tell you what each one does, how much they added (approximately) and how they added it, largely off the top of my head.    Shampoo is also so much better than it was in the 70's, but ignore all the sulfate-free stuff, it's just marketing trying to sell you something.  Also, laundry detergent way more interesting than you are guessing, it's not just soap and water, there are about 50 different stains that are tested for and small changes can have huge effects on cleaning.        But your company was paid to conduct a study   No, my company wasn't paid to do the study.  I'm an industrial chemist, I'm basically an on-staff expert, marketing wanted to look at it.  That's how business is done, sometimes things don't pan out.  Also, I no longer work for that company, and that company doesn't need protection anyway, it was Dow Chemical.  Now, I hope everyone of you will kindly disclose where you work, what you have worked on, and for good measure, a summary of your investments.  We all want to know what hypothetical conflicts of interest (as defined by people who have no idea what makes a conflict of interest) people have.  Just so we're on a level playing field.  If you're not willing to do this, I suggest we drop the matter.    You clearly have no idea what a conflict of interest is.   He edited his comment, he said I profited **directly* from climate change, this isn't true, I have never received direct payment for anything climate change related.    Funny, because that's not what the GMO-Truthers say, fact is you don't know anything about my political beliefs, so please don't make definitive statements.   It's still ridiculous, you may one day in the future work on climate change related something, who knows!  Does the truck driver who delivers things to a plant that makes amines for carbon capture "work on climate change"  or does he just drive a damn truck?  I just did an assessment of the technological needs of the industry to determine if there was a market there, the conclusion was that there wasn't.  I actually worked on additives for diesel fuel twice as long, does this make me a shill for the petroleum lobby?  That's what so silly about the statement, editing it is kind of bullshit, because it was plain wrong, he should just admit that he was mistaken and move on.   Give us a "Promote to top post for 30 minutes" button so that we can give a special post visibility.  Not all content is the same, and the default frontpage structure makes defaults really dependent on the top post, if we have an mod message to the subreddit or a special event it would be nice for us to have  away for a large initial number of subscribers to see it, as it is now, we just have to pray it doesn't get buried for whatever reason.   This would also let us counter downvote brigades you sit on the new list to kill posts.   Split out moderator permissions more specifically, this will help us run our big team of comment mods more effectively.  Specifically, I want Posts broken up into comments and submissions, and approve and remove.  We would like to give out permissions that allow simply for the removal of comments and nothing else.     I post all of the AMAs by hand every damn morning because of this issue, it's pretty big to my quality of life I'd say!  For two days a week, Tuesday and Wednesday, we have dedicated accounts, and they will have enough karma that it isn't a problem, it's really the accounts we set up for people who are doing one-off AMAs that the issue pops up.  Could you make it that approved submitters don't get a captcha?   I was hired to work on something completely different, this was just something they tossed on me, that's how industry works, I don't generally choose what I work on, I'm ok with that.   We've kicked a similar idea around, but we can't get readers to read the sidebar, this would be lost on people.  AMA now means it's a q a, it's a generic term now.   Sure, I'm a researcher in industry, that's what we do.  You could make the same case (a better one actually), about laundry detergent.  So picking this out from the list of 100 things I've worked on over the years is misleading to the point of being a lie.   None of that, it was  a project to look at existing products for use in post-combustion carbon capture.  It was a "can we sell more of our stuff in this" thing.  I'm an R D scientist, it was the company's direction to look at it, and I do my job.   Your claims are stretched far beyond what any reasonable person would call "profiting" the projects I worked on were assessments of uses of our products, and we lost money by doing the work since it didn't go anywhere.  It was one of 5 projects I worked on at the time, I'm a scientist, it's what we do.  Maybe consider making logical arguments based on facts instead of libel and character assassination?   Not really true either, since it was an application of one of our products, I was paid for being an R D scientist and I did an assessment of the area, your argument is bullshit, give it up.   Yup, I don't expect there are any barriers to getting them to do AMAs!   [I posted a response to his claim, which is wrong.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/3bzhq2/rscience_shuts_down_after_reddit_fires_an_ama_mod/csv1vq2)    This isn't remotely true, I've worked in home and personal care for the past 4 years, making additives for shampoos and laundry detergents.  I have worked on carbon-capture projects in the past, but they didn't go anywhere (which should shock exactly no one, right?)   I edited the text to include NGOs, I'm biased by being a chemist, and there aren't many NGOs that operate in chemistry, my apologizes!  I don't think we will have any issues with NGOs, so I haven't called it out as an area of emphasis.   It's small, but there are a several very experienced people there.   Yes, they are relevant, although, tanning it mostly a local event found in the skin, the hormone pathway is more related to base skin tones.   You can post this question in /r/skincarescience for more details, but tingling has nothing to do with the tanning process, and their mechanism is laughable because blood flow doesn't have anything to do with tanning, it's caused by a [specific biological process, called Melanogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte#Melanogenesis)  They are talking pseudoscience gibberish, it's typical of the marketing drivel.

They do, and every one knows this, we have to get past it.   we have talked about alternative plans, it would take a long time to get back to where we are.   reddit was actually bigger than Digg at that point.   I am talking to them, and they are listening, I can't comment on follow through, but we have to give them a chance.  I do trust the people doing the work.   Because we can't do any of these things any where else, if reddit dies, so do all these plans.   We at least have the names of the people handling the AMA address.  Change takes time, I see no reason to pile on, our point has been made.   I am at a conference dinner at the moment, Alexis has been humble and receptive in our conversations.  I behave like a dick some times too, I can't hold that against him.  We want reddit to work, changes can't happen over night, we have to be reasonable.   Not hardly.  There was stern talking, but in the opposite direction from what you are speculating.   AMAs are more required to be scientists, less a peer-reviewed journal summary thing.   We will not be, we discussed it, and we do not see added value that would be worth the disruption to our readers.  We believe the admins are listening now, and we are willing to be patient.   We would like to talk about what our values are, what we are currently doing, and where we are going in the years to come, and why we support reddit.   **Our Core Values**  Our overarching goal is to bring science education to the public. We have set up outreach programs that help to get more people involved in science and to bring science to a level that can be understood and appreciated by people from every educational background.  To this end, we have invested enormous amounts of time working with scientists, working with science advocates, talking with public policy groups and so on; all with the intent of setting up a platform where people can come, discuss and learn about science. We are trying to break down the 'ivory towers' of science, so that those that are practicing science aren't living outside of the public. While this is no easy task, we are fortunate to be enabled by reddit as a platform. We are not here, spending this much time day-in and day-out just because we love science or because we care about reddit alone, but more because it is an incredibly powerful tool that we have that allows us to really make a difference. How often can you say that you are able to just go in and ask a question of Monsanto scientists? Or read about the newest, hottest research and see people from every walk of life discussing it, and explaining its scientific intricacies and real-world applications? Nowhere else on the internet offers that, and it's something we worked very hard to achieve - hence why we care so much and why we strongly support reddit.  *We believe in the scientific method.* As such, we support the peer-review process which provides the most basic test of validity through testing of ideas and speaking through data. We are not the arbiter of science, simply a venue for the presentation of peer-reviewed research.  *We believe in authenticity.* In this day of information availability, the truth always comes out, its best to speak honestly about what you know and make your case from that.  *We believe in civil discussion.*  The issues brought up by scientific findings arent always what people would like them to be, and controversial topics abound.  We believe that civil conversation is the best way to understand others point of view. One can disagree without being disagreeable, in the end we all agree far more than we disagree, and it isnt always a win-lose situation.  **How We Promote Outreach**    *Links*   We allow our users to post links to summaries of peer-reviewed scientific journal article from the last 6 months. Science journalists are professional communicators of scientific information, and they are able to put the research findings into context for the reader who would otherwise struggle to follow the jargon and other technical language found in the primary literature. Our users are then able to engage in conversations about the research findings in the comment section, asking questions and answering them so that we can all better understand the significance of the research (or insignificance as the case may be.)  *Science Discussions*   Active posters in /r/science who have formal training or conduct research in some scientific disciplines have the opportunity to confirm their expertise with the forum moderators. We 'flair' these users so that you can identify (a) their academic degree and (b) their self-proclaimed research discipline and expertise. In exchange for acknowledging these users, we expect them to contribute constructively to the community.  We allow our flaired users to post their own summaries of a particular subject they believe to be worthy of discussion.  The flaired user/scientist can then directly interact with other users and answer questions they may have in order to put research into better context.  This is useful if a particular field of science is generating important findings, but they are not easily encapsulated by one particular publication.  This also allows for the non-scientist users to actually engage with a scientist working in that field, something they might never get the chance to do in their normal life.  *Ask Me Anything*   AMAs are well known on reddit, but in /r/science we seek to bring scientists from many different fields who perhaps have no exposure to reddit. This gives our scientist users a chance to ask complicated technical questions of people who are making news in their field, and for non-scientist users to ask questions they have always wondered about, as well as reading about how scientists approach a problem and what science actually is (the continual testing of ideas.)   **Where We Are Going**  *Industrial Scientist AMAs*  Professional scientists typically work in three sectors:  Academia, Government, Non-profit organizations and Industry.    We have had the good fortune to have access to many people from academia, non-profits and government labs, but the public discourse with industrial scientists has been virtually non-existent.  Many in society discount the views of industrial scientist because of the bias caused by having a financial stake in the research, and many in industry are concerned about public disclosures for legal reasons, be that the threat of being sued or being fired for saying the wrong thing.  Evidence can be presented for both of these sides, and that is why we find ourselves where we are now:  *a huge portion of the scientists in our society being closed out of conversations.*  We would like to change this, and bring more industrial AMAs, however it will take bravery and understanding on the part of everyone, but we think that the benefit of having an open discussion about the science of the products and services we interact with the most in life is worth it.    You saw this beginning with our hosting of an [AMA with Fred Perlak from Monsanto]( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/), who came answer your questions in as forthright manner as possible.  We know that a large number of people mistrust a Monsanto employee, and assign nefarious motivations to him.  We were pleased to read a civil discussion between concerned people, which did not concentrate on the bombastic extremes that are so often found in these interactions.  In the coming months we hope to bring you more scientists from companies that make the things you use, so that you, our readers, can better understand what it is they do and how they do science; we hope that people will reserve their judgment and listen.  Likewise, we hope that businesses will realize that cutting off communication with the public has not been good for our culture, and a different way forward is not to be feared due to hypothetical legal concerns.   *Current and Future Employment*  Many of our readers are students, and a big concern for students in science is finding their place in the world. For employers, having new graduates with the skills that are needed is critical. Properly identifying the current and future needs for skills in the sciences and related fields (like engineering and math) is important for everyone.  Having skilled people who cant find a job doesnt help anyone.  We will seek to bring AMAs and other related content to our readers, that way they can help figure out exactly what they should do.  Sometimes it helps to just ask someone!  While some students have the opportunity to ask people around them, and the large majority dont. (I know I didnt!)  We would like to do something about this.   **/r/science Supports reddit**  I mention all of these things because we can't do any of it without the platform that reddit provides.  This is a unique place that has allowed us to connect people interested in science, scientists and even random people who just show up. Without the reddit platform, it would not be possible to fulfill our goals of scientific outreach and we would not be able to communicate science to the broader internet community effectively.   We welcome your civil input on this, and we are listening to you.    Could I ask you to give the mods updates on a reasonable basis?   While there may be a trust issue with others, I think all of us trust you.   We have a nature preserve right behind our house in Northern Illinois, we hear the coyotes every night, and I'm sure there is a lot back there.  What are the best ways to learn what's going on without causing disruption to the wildlife? I'm thinking web cams?  How do we place a camera where we can catch the action?  Maybe leave tacos out for the wild life?   There is no Santa Claus.   oh fun, this is why conference presentations aren't allowed, you can push whatever nonsense you'd like!

I'm the mod in the green text, I've made a longer comment here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c4x6h/leaked_conversation_from_kn0thing_and_the/csskpbs  But the short version is things seemed to have changed at least in the short term.   Too many hypotheticals, I work in concrete reality as much as possible, and the fact of the matter, as people are realizing, is there isn't a real alternative to reddit currently, making it a moot point.    For me reddit is a means to an end, I'm  not doing this for personal glory, I'm motivated by science outreach, and dispelling myths about science.    Every time I read something about antivaxxers or other clearly false things, it motivates me to do something about it, this is my doing something.    As such, I need a wide audience of non-scientists to have a chance to read the content I arrange for, which means having non-science content intermixed, which is reddit.  See the issue?      Hey, I'm the mod in green here, I did the screen capture,of course, and shared it with some groups to explain the situation better.  This was the exchange that pretty much precipitated /r/science going private, as you can read, it's not about Victoria being fired, although we completely disagree with that action.  The issue here is one of communication and respect.  We don't treat our users like this when they message /r/science with questions, even when they start off by calling us traitors, or any of a lovely grab bag of insults.  When went public to break the stonewalling we were getting because we needed to finish setting up an important AMA and we had one day before the holiday to do so, time was critical.  We as mods really need to have prompt communication with the admins when we have issues, generally speaking we work independently and can handle almost everything, if it's gone past that, it's important.  As for the Science AMAs, I have always run them basically independently of the admins, I worked with Victoria to handle follow requests from our guests who wanted analytics on how many people viewed this AMA (totally reasonable requests.)  We don't have access to that information (I would love to have it!)  Given the frustration of the mods contacting the admins with questions, and our miserable success rate (it's not just science mods), I can't ethically refer our guests to an anonymous email address that I don't have any reason to believe will respond, and I don't have the bandwidth to put the requests in myself, so it puts me in a really bad position going forward, and that upset me.  As many of you noticed, /r/science was brought back public before any of the other defaults, this was because we had accomplished our goal of forcing a change in the communication behavior of the admins.  This being our only goal, we did not see a benefit to further disrupting the lives of our readers, a vast majority of whom do not care about reddit politics.  I take the admins at their word that they will be making an attempt to change (kn0thing seems to have come around as well), we have put a lot of work into making reddit a great source of science information, we want it to succeed.     As for the Hawking AMA, I found the contact information independently, and arranged for the AMA to go forward.  It will be posted on Tuesday morning, we are quite excited.

This will be resolved by the morning, we are finishing up conversations.   As a mod of /r/science, and arguably one of the instigators of all of this, I'm ok with AskScience staying up, it's the tradition of AskScience not to get involved in the politics of reddit.   Yeah, this is just the last straw, honestly.  It's a series of broken promises and ignored requests that has lead up to this.   Good point, edited for clarity.   I'm willing to be patient, but it's gong to be really hard to keep AMAs  going in /r/science, I do most of the AMA set up by myself (sometimes while holding a sleeping baby) and I don't have the wiggle room to absorb this. I've been working to transition to a team but it just hasn't happened, because reddit...   I've spoken to her on the phone several times, in addition to working with her for quite sometime, I concour, if anything shady happened it would be totally out of character.   I have, but she's professional, so I don't have any more information.   I fully support this decision to shut down /r/IAmA, letting Victoria go is a slap.  To back this up, I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs, Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins.  If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be "Sorry, I can't help."    Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit.   I personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well, that's how much of a bad taste this leaves.

 From OP's article:  In 2014, some 370 cases of sexual assault on men or boys were reported across Sweden, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, although experts believe that the actual figure is much higher.  Lumping men and boys together does this topic a great disservice because pedophiles raping and molesting children is a very different thing an adult raping another adult.  "The general perception is that men cannot be raped," Lotti Helstrm, a senior physician at the hospital told Sveriges Radio, adding that male victims can suffer even more than women.   "In studies, the health effects are shown to be greater for men, both in terms of physical health and mental health. There is a greater risk of a raped man getting post-traumatic stress disorder," she said, adding that the subject of male rape remained "extremely taboo".   Helstrm explained that men were much more likely to be raped by other men than by women and said that the experience could lead to "sexual identity" problems in future.  So for everybody who's upvoting stories about women raping men, yeah, it happens, but most rapes of men (and women) are by men.   I just started doing Duolingo this week and this is such a good tip! Translating from other languages to English is just too easy. I'm going to do both courses concurrently, though so that they feed off each other.   Try /r/nutrition and/or /r/loseit.    but impossible when you have a partner who likes chips and candy a lot.  Then you need to have a talk with your partner. It took years for my friend to understand that if she wants her husband to lose weight she has to help him but not having junk food in the house, but eventually she got it. If you want to lose weight, your partner needs to be, well, a partner in it and support you.    Not sugar. As soon as you add sugar it's not a healthy food anymore. The problem though is that sugar tends to come in big bags so it's hard to say "only buy it when you need it."   A couple of thoughts:   It could be that you're working so hard at listening that you're not really listening, if you get what I mean. Maybe if you relax a little and don't worry so much about whether you're looking her in the eye every minute and feel like you're participating in the conversation, you might be more likely to remember it.  Another possibility is that when you're talking, you thinking you're just talking, it's not like she's sharing anything specific that you need to know, even though she is. Maybe a good thing for you two to try is this 36-question test. They're meant to be personal questions where you open up about yourself. Maybe if you know specifically "this is what my GF is thinking and feeling," you'll be more likely to remember it. Quiz: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html?_r=0    Ask her every detail about what makes her feel this way  That's the most important thing. I'm guessing that GF thinks OP is not really listening and remembering the things she tells him about herself, but I could be mistaken.   Regarding the conversation thing, I get what she's saying. If you're just sitting there quietly, it makes her feel like you're not listening and/or like she's delivering a monologue, not having a dialogue. Even if you truly have nothing to contribute you can always make sure to make little comments to show that you're listening ("uh huh," "got it," "interesting," "I see," etc.) or if you make a little more effort, you can ask her follow-up questions on what she's saying.  As for the eating/ansomia, have you explained it to her the way you've explained it to us? If not, explain it again. If necessary, make a list of the places that you eat at and the foods that you eat and simply go to the next place/thing on the list whenever she asks you what or where you want to eat. Or roll a die (mentally) and pick the one that comes up.   The dog that's not house-trained, that's disgusting, I don't know what to say about it. Talk to someone who knows about dogs.  Have you talked to her about her messiness? Was she single for a long time like yourself and got used to being a mess? If so, you need to talk to her about adjusting herself to the fact that now you're in her life and she almost literally needs to make room for you.  It could be that she is moving too fast, but remember you both are older. I'm sorry you felt you've missed out on things in life but if you've met someone you really like you'd be stupid to dump her in favor of going clubbing and sleeping around instead.  TLDR: You both need to make a little more effort to make this relationship work but if you really like each other it will (hopefully) be worth it.   Here you can see on the back of the bottle it says "refrigeration not required": http://www.amazon.com/Aunt-Jemima-Lite-Pancake-Syrup/dp/B0005YXZMQ   In my apartment everything is relatively new -- my laptop is one of the oldest things and it's about six years old, while my parents have lamps in their bedroom that are about 40 years old.   Real maple syrup. I feel like most people buy the cheap fake stuff and keep it in the pantry.   They're casual and they're ugly. I don't know what you're asking. If you wear Crocs to the beach, it's fine. If you wear them to the office, it's not the fine.   Yes and no.  The term "suffragette" was first used as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the London Daily Mail for activists in the movement for women's suffrage, in particular members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).[7] But the objects of the intended ridicule gladly embraced the term saying "suffraGETtes" (hardening the g) implied not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to get it as well.[8]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette   True, so when you consider Chareidi birthrates, it means that Yiddish is going strong. It doesn't matter if they're only one group of people. Native Hebrew speakers are also one group of people -- Israelis. Everybody else who knows it learns it in school and plenty of Jews don't speak it at all.   According to Wikipedia, one estimate puts Yiddish speakers at 2 million. That's nowhere close to being "nearly a dead language."    say, 1% per year  Just FYI, aside from last year(?) in the past 10+ years, the increase has never been less than 2% and it's been as high as 4.5%.   It's Google's rule that they'll blur your house, car or self if you request it.   http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/privacy/   /r/writing   If your book succeeds that's success for yourself. Wanting your book to succeed is not the same as wanting personal fame for yourself. Usually when an author is famous they're famous for something other than their writing. To take a nice case, John Green is known for his vlog. To take a not nice case, Bret Easton Ellis is known for being a jerk.    But if I was hoping to gain recognition from something  Obviously there are some authors who are fame-whores, but by and large people do not write books because they're hoping for recognition on a personal level.    I'm not sure such a thing is possible. Even WorldCat can't tell you what branch a book is in. But try asking in /r/libraries, maybe they'll have some ideas.   Going Postal.    I found the source of the pictures. So yeah, I see that's a breed and not a random mutation or anything, but apparently they are very expensive, so I'm still curious how it's worth it to kill them for their meat.  http://www.viralforest.com/cemani-chickens/   They killed it. :(  I eat chicken, but come on, if an all-black chicken is rare, doesn't it make more sense to put it in a petting zoo so people can see it in real life?   Did you? This is literally the second paragraph.   The rapid spread of Hasidism in the second half of the 18th century greatly troubled many traditional rabbis; many saw it as a potentially dangerous enemy. They thought that it was another manifestation of the recent messianic movement of Sabbatai Zevi (16261676) that had led many Jews away from mainstream Judaism.   The early Mitnagdim certainly thought so.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnagdim   So many possible reasons. Here are the ones I thought of off the top of my head:  - Because if people are sitting and watching a movie for two hours, they're not shopping.   - Because most people aren't at the airport for two hours.  - Because it's hard to concentrate on a movie with everything that's going on around you, and you should be alert in case your gate changes or something like that.  - Because too many people would forget to return the DVD's and accrue fines but get angry and blame Redbox, turning the whole thing into a PR nightmare.   Gotcha.    Thanks.   Thanks.   3:45AM  I see a bus leaving at 11:40 p.m.? The concert will probably be over by 10 and I don't plan on hanging around after. But after what everyone is saying, it definitely sounds safest to take a car to the station, thanks.   I have tickets to a concert at the Theatre of The Living Arts and I'm trying to figure out how to get back home to NYC afterward without getting mugged.   Interesting question, good thing it's been asked here before.  http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2aujel/eli5_why_are_certain_types_of_cancer_so_much_more/   You might want to try /r/askscience or /r/AskDocs instead.    Thanks.   Pooping isn't just a way of getting rid of things we don't need, it's also a way of keeping your pipes clean. Dirty pipes tend to get corroded and eventually fall apart.   So it's the opposite -- you want to consume more fiber to make sure that you poop.   When you're watching your weight, thinking any food is "the devil" tends to be counterproductive because it makes it even more tempting.   But she is right that soda is bad for you just like any other high-sugar, low-nutrition food is. It not only contributes to weight gain but tooth decay when consumed excessively or as part of a general poor-quality diet.   A can of Coke is 140 calories.   Is downtown Philly near the Greyhound bus station (or the Amtrak train station) safe to walk around at night (around 10 p.m.) alone?   I don't know about this study in particular, but broadly-speaking, yes. The 1970s were the heydey of gender research; many study results were enshrined and have not been challenged or replicated since.    Because their main thing is their "tomatometer" and a movie has to score above a certain percentage to be called "fresh" or "rotten." Emphasizing the percentage emphasizes their gimmick. Otherwise it's just another metascore site.   No. I like variation in my life. If I wanted to look at myself all the time, I'd get a mirror.    That has little to do with it. There are areas in NYC that are becoming gentrified and it is pushing people out despite whatever rent control/stabilized apartments they may have for a number of reasons:  - It changes the character of the neighborhood. If enough of your neighbors are now white transplants from Oklahoma and not the folks you've lived with all your life, you're not going to feel comfortable there anymore and you're going to move out. Just like there's white flight, there's black flight.  - People moving in start opening fancier and more expensive stores that push out whatever cheaper stores that were there before which both reduces the number of "normal" stores in the area and makes them more expensive to shop at because the owners can now charge higher rents.  - Greedy landlords who own a lot of buildings in the neighborhood try to get people to move legally (offering them money to leave) or illegally (harassment of various sorts).    Way to misrepresent what the article said.  One of the reasons why some people believe that women are less suitable to become jockeys is that being a jockey requires tremendous arm and core strength  you need muscle in order to stay in control of your horse. Unfortunately, there are still few women who have the skill and body strength needed to race horses at the professional level.  Of course, there are more complex matters to deal with  women also often have to take a break if they become mothers, and the industry waits for absolutely no one. If a rider leaves, they just hire someone else to ride their horses for them. This creates tough competition, which leaves some trainers and owners more reluctant to hire women because of the off-chance that their rider becomes pregnant and unable to race.   Elevating your feet relieves the pressure that builds up over the course of the day, moreso if you did a lot of walking or standing.   Horse racing is not particularly popular compared to other sports. Every day when I listen to the news on the radio, horse racing results are never mentioned except for the Triple Crown races.  As for why people like horse racing, well, go to a track and see for yourself. It really is very exciting to watch, and it's no different than watching human track and field events. People go nuts over Usain Bolt and he ran 100 meters in 10 seconds. That was the whole race. Ten seconds. By that standard, two minutes is a long time.   I don't know if they're aware they're in a competition but thoroughbreds are bred to be good racers and, just as importantly, to enjoy racing. They don't only run in packs -- when they're training they often train alone and a horse that isn't into it, so to speak, will never be motivated to race.  As for whether they understand that they've won, I doubt that too, but they are rewarded for winning so they're certainly aware that they've done a good job.   The poor neighborhoods tend to lack good public transportation and amenities, and are further away from Manhattan. People with money don't want to live there because of the sheer inconvenience of it.   It has little to do with rent control because there are rent controlled buildings all over the city, including in areas that are very, very expensive.    No, for various reasons, but the simplest one is that it's not in the spirit of the day. The idea is to separate yourself from ordinary activities and make the day spiritual.   You left off the second bit. "organized activity in support of women's rights and interests"    Feminism means women are treated the same to men.  No, it doesn't. It means advancing women's issues, some of which have nothing to do with being treated the same as men.   Thrid Wave Feminism has done a lot of damage to the feminist movement.  Not really true. Second Wave feminism was not any more popular than Third Wave is and they had plenty of their own extremist kooks. Feminism has always been a dirty word.   You're welcome!   Today I learned that New World rats and mice are *imposters*! XD   Why was this downvoted? It's 100% correct.

Subfamily: Murinae  Genus: Mus  (Wikipedia)   I saw the movie. I felt like if I hadn't read the book I might not have entirely understood what was going on, and I didn't think the ending had nearly as much power. Though it did leave out some of the more boring bits from the book.   Is it worth reading just for the last page? That's a tough question. A number of rock stars consider it their favorite book. If saying that makes you curious to find out why, then yes, it's worth reading. But if you couldn't care less what rock stars think, then possibly not worth it -- though, it's short and fairly easy reading so if you've got nothing better to read, you could do worse.   I don't think you're thinking of the right book considering it's only 200 pages long.   - Perfume by Patrick Suskind. Redeemed by literally the last page.  - Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. I wouldn't say the ending redeemed it but I was genuinely shocked by the events of the last 50-100 pages or so, so it gained back some stars. I ended up rating it 3/5 stars instead of 2 or even 1.    I haven't heard anything. If I do, I'll update.   I'm on a mailing list that sent out a request to say tehillim for Moshe  Shlomo Ben Sara Tova who was hit by a van in New York. They say he's in critical condition. If you can, please add him to your prayers.  This is an article about the incident: http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-59-hurt-hit-van-manhattan-article-1.2243247   I thought the commentary was actually better than the movie.   For the guys, the opposite question here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/38583n/men_of_reddit_whats_the_most_feminine_thing_that/   I wouldn't, for basically the same reason. Private gives satisfaction an even more internal feel. Sometimes you're satisfied with something and then you tell someone about your experience but your private satisfaction is something for you alone.  I've worked as an editor and I'll definitely nitpick something to death, but I think in this case you're being overly literal. In the example below some of the deletions work but some of them take the flavor out of the sentence, leaving it dull and dry. Unless you're writing a textbook, you're not just trying to convey information -- a distinctive and interesting style makes a story better.   In Germany, only 30% of students go to college; more than twice as many American students do.    I have no idea what you're referring to, but the two groups of people who are most opposed to snitching are children and criminals, neither of whom should be anybody's role model. As an adult naturally you should first try to handle situations on your own, but if that's not possible there's nothing wrong with elevating the issue to someone with more authority than you.    Close should(!) be removed since it's redundant with intimacy, but I wouldn't remove the own. "My own" something is a colloquial phrase that may seem redundant but isn't because it adds an additional layer of ownership. Take "my apartment" versus "my own apartment." The first is merely information, the second is personal.   The question is, how would your sister and brother-in-law react to other forms of discipline from you aside from yelling? Would they accept your saying to their daughter, "No, we don't hit people" or putting her in a time out? If they would be okay with that, try it. It takes time, but I believe even small amounts of discipline from other relatives can somewhat counteract a lack of discipline at home.   But if they won't let you discipline their kid, you need to keep your daughter safe and if that means keeping her away from her cousin entirely, that's the way it has to be.    You're not supposed to eat over your plate, but otherwise, I don't think you're being overly strict at all.    Yeah, it's usually a nautical look, which is always popular.   Because the "opposite" of lady is gentleman, not lord, both of which came into general use in the late 19th century.   Losing your temper is by definition irrational.   https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/32waet/ask_history_how_common_was_carrying_a_sword/  And, as the last person in that thread suggested, a good place to ask is /r/askhistorians. You're asking for information, not an explanation of a concept, which is what ELI5 is actually for.      I marked this NSFW but it doesn't have to be a sexual fantasy, maybe you fantasize about going BASE jumping but you know you're really too chicken to do it.   Sexism, mostly. For the longest time women were treated like commodities so they've internalized the idea that in order to get money, it's an "acceptable" idea to sell oneself. While men have not been socialized to think that, so for a man to become a prostitute he generally needs to have fallen about as far as possible in society so that no other options are available to him (you see this a lot in books and movies about heroin addicts).  But there's also the reverse sense that women's sexuality has been suppressed for so long that it's still largely considered unacceptable and/or comfortable for a woman to do things like go to a strip club or a hire a prostitute.   Just read it instead of pre-judging based on what you think you know about 14-year-old girls who are trying to avoid getting murdered by Nazis.   I haven't read the book, but after reading articles about it, I'm very much on board with the concept.   It's nothing to do with scary movies -- a lot of movies do this now. It's just a popular way of making commercials nowadays and has no particular meaning, though it's an easy way of keeping the information in front of you the whole time.   This is a yes or no question, though people may argue about it based on their accent or their perception of how the words should be pronounced. Better to ask in /r/askreddit.   This article is three years old.   You can also tell them that they can leave it at your door without needing a signature.    Obesity can cause knock-kneed-ness (word?) but it's also possible you're just noticing it more often because the fat makes it harder to hide. There's a tiny woman at my work who's knock-kneed. It also develops as a result of how they developed in the womb or some diseases/conditions.  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001263.htm   mugenhunt is right, this is all about expectations and nothing about sensitivity to pain. There's women's wrestling and boxing and, as women were "created" for (/s), childbirth, all of which women tolerate just fine.   Bishop Coughlin was notorious for having an anti-Semitic radio show in the 1930s.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin   As the song says, "I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all." One type of depression involves numbness rather than any specific negative feelings. And when you're that numb, you don't even feel like you exist. The pain tells you that you are, in fact, still alive.   I guess I can give it another shot, but if it's really 100 pages that you have to push through -- I'm not sure I have the patience for that.   How many buildings are there with micro-apartments in NYC? Two? Three? I don't see any evidence that they're growing in popularity.   According to Wikipedia, the Panchatantra was the most frequently translated work from India... in 1924. I'm not so sure it's true anymore; I never even heard of it. I would think the most commonly translated works from India would be the Kama Sutra, the vedas or the Mahabharata.   I think it's because the writing style is very annoying. I couldn't get past the first chapter.   There was also Manon Rhaume who played in the hocky minor leagues.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manon_Rh%C3%A9aume   Chain of stores that sells fitness-related equipment and clothing. Americans need to get in shape and who better than the vice president to encourage that?    I'm not sure how you're defining "corporation," so:   Boeing and Modell's.   Sounds interesting. Post pics when it's finished!    That's the nicest thing anybody's said to me all week. Thank you.    It happens in China too, particularly with their suppression of Falun Gong.       (Not a film of the play being performed on stage.)   I just came across an interview with him that was posted two weeks ago, but I hadn't read. Here's what jumped out at me:  And it is a book that requires, like a television series, an audience. This cannot be sustained by grants  which, I've never gotten one. This cannot be sustained by the publisher alone. If the readers don't turn out for it, if the ratings aren't high enough, this will not see a conclusion.  Welp. This certain strengthens my resolve not to keep reading.  I have 10 volumes. But in writing the tenth, I ... understood intimately how to re-write the first. So now I'm going back and  it was literally a page one re-write for Volume 1, and Volume 2 was the same.   So yeah, this is why you're supposed to finish your first draft then go back and edit. I'd be willing to read an edited version of volume 1.  http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/35pgdg/mark_z_danielewskis_new_book_the_familiar_volume/   You don't need a prologue -- you're supposed to just jump right into the story and all these bits of information are supposed to come out as the story progresses. Instead, MZD did the opposite -- gave us a lot of information and no story and no character development either. I didn't feel that I knew Xanther and her family (or any other characters) any better at the end of the book than I did after each of their first appearances.   I don't know what's going to happen, but the orb chapters in particular made me think of Lost, which was such a let-down in the end that I regretted watching it. I don't want to go through that again. I'm perfectly willing to wait 10 years until it's finished to read it if it ends up being worth it.   If you have recycling in your area, recycle it.    This first book largely should not have existed. It was just a prologue and much of it was repetitive or even useless. Even if the second book is better, I got a very strong whiff of Lost; I will not invest 50+ hours of my life to a series that will ultimately disappoint.    For the exact same variety of reasons that non-Orthodox and non-Jewish women do.     But you do want to live in New York City?  other people do, too  That's why rent is expensive here;   Earlier in the thread you were against the suggestion that people should be required to live in the apartments they've bought and here you're claiming that they do, and that's why rent is so high. You're contradicting yourself.  Rent is not high because so many people want to live here. Rent is high because rich people want to invest their money in apartments that they will never (or hardly ever) live in, which increases the number of luxury buildings built and luxury conversions created, thereby decreasing the number of apartments that would otherwise be available for people who actually want to live here.   Plenty of co-ops in Manhattan have a rule that you're not allowed to buy an apartment as a pied-a-terre.    A lot of co-ops in Manhattan have a rule that you're not allowed to buy an apartment as a pied-a-terre. But most of these are condos and they're not as strict because the ownership structure is different.   It's not so much not true as outdated. Nowadays SJW's have supplanted Jews in being the conscience of the world and, if possible, people hate them even more than Jews.  During the early- and middle-20th century when Jews were at the forefront of science, culture, civil rights, animal rights, and environmentalism. This didn't endear us to people who were largely against these things (aside from science).   Broken Monsters by Lauren Beukes has a fake Reddit threads in it.  Recommended for anybody who liked True Detective. It's very similar in some ways.   Helen Mirren would beg to differ.   Anyway, what you're saying isn't true. It's about what people are used to and the inability to accept that just because something is what's currently done, doesn't mean that's the way it *has* to be done.  Before Bridesmaids nobody thought a female-centric comedy would fly. But ever since, they've been making more like it. Not because they're SJW's and they give a damn about women, but because they'll make whatever sells. And surprise, it sells.   If they made more movies with actresses that were older, nobody would think twice about it and it would make just as much money as it would otherwise. Somebody just has to have the guts to make that movie and prove it.      Oh man, I was right down the block from this museum and I didn't know it. Somehow I'd gotten the impression that it was in the suburbs, not downtown.    essentially created many of the repeat cliches that we see now such as love triangles.  Whoever told you that was sorely mistaken.    Pizza and orange juice.      This has all three: https://books.google.ie/books?id=V8fTAAAAMAAJ hl=en  Print versions available on Amazon.    You can take a walk so long as another family member is home and can lock and unlock the door for you.   As has been said, you can read other books besides for the parsha.   And there's always napping.   http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10862-015-9485-y   How is this a guy thing? Girls like to play catch too.  It's a physical activity that's not complex and not competitive. So overall it's a nice way to hang out with your friends, get outside and move around a little.   Though once I was walking through a park and I saw some guys playing catch. They literally did not budge from their spots and didn't talk, didn't laugh, didn't seem to be enjoying themselves at all. That was definitely a WTF moment.    Ditto. I can remember exactly when I read the books the books that influenced my life and I remember my life before then too.   Most people ITT are just ignoring that part of the question.   	117
 Could I get some mice noodles and kung-bow-wow chicken?      Interesting.   I'm not that talented. Most of my tracks suck compared to what other people have done for their games. The feedback is appreciated. Now go suck your own dick to feel better from being way too butthurt about my explanations.   Not to mention he wrote "down" where "door" should be.   This is actually an old creepypasta that was probably posted here for people to find. I doubt OP wrote it.   I wonder if it's in any part because it's just an open beta. Otherwise, seriously M2K? Some new changes come out and you want to bag on them instead of try to embrace them and adjust? How is he even still playing Smash 4 if that's the case?   Oh god, after hearing all of this criticism, I need to make my own announcer so there's an alternative.   "Do lesbians like butt-sex like gay guys? Because I'm totally into that if you know what I mean."   They should process refunds now. They look like they're begging for *once more chance* from that ex-girlfriend who only used you for free meals and was seeing Joe Shmoe on the side.   I have the entire To The Moon soundtrack. I know what song you're talking about. This is just a soundtrack-oriented release. Only certain parts of the song are used, and the in-game version will be mixed differently with slightly higher BPM. The parts I do use loop nicely without fading out and/or starting back up again after ending.  All things considered, I understand the redundant criticisms I've gotten so far. And if you would play the game and hear it within its context, it would make more sense. But, soundcloud, for me anyway, is only meant for the soundtrack-oriented releases of the music.  This is why I really wish Reddit wasn't either a Link or Text agenda. I really wish I could leave a link and still have text without having it put it into a comment that is likely to be buried underneath the dribble.   "is your refrigerator running?"  "As you can clearly see, I don't have a cartoon fridge so it would not be, SHUT UP LISA I'M ON THE PHONE. JUST CHANGE INTO YOUR SEXY CLOTHES AND I'LL BE THERE... Sorry about that. You know how daughters are."   "We are Hollywood Undead here to record our new holiday album for ya bitches."   It feels much better in game, since not the entire song is used. It's just a soundtrack version.       It's its own entity,  FTFY   I wouldn't want Apple doing anything like this until all of their base models include GPUs. I don't see anybody spending 2k on a mac just to make sure it has a proper GPU in it. Unless they just took off with a new series of machines dedicated to the necessities of gaming where pixels need to be pushed out quickly. Right now, the GPUs Apple puts in are better for accurate pictures, but not fast pictures. And that's the big reason Apple still has this crude separation from gaming.  But, it's not impossible, and probably not even far-fetched in any means. Swift is now open source and is good for developing apps on a lot of platforms. So maybe this will bring a huge streamline to cross-platform development when it comes to which platform is getting all the games. People have developed for Windows purely because it was popular and re-developing for Mac required having a mac + some special software. With Swift going open source, this could be the huge gateway to get one language to code for everything so devs only spend a little more time making a new version to reach millions of more potential customers.  It's a dream.   I'm sorry, but who else was 'competing' for this patent?   Well, as if I didn't already have a good enough reason to not play Destiny.   Yeah, cause we want melee at Apex... and PM too.   Awe well. I just hope when I finally get a Mac of my own for my design work, it will be worth it.   I hate that you used to be able to open up most of their computers and upgrade the Ram and Hard Drive yourself. A simple tutorial away. But now it seems like everything is soddered in to make sure you don't and for Apple to preserve the unibody look.   You mean they're now doing what dozens of smaller game stores have been doing forever? Good job Gamestop. Still not shopping there.   "You're doing that too much. Please wait 23 hours before posting again.  "Don't want to wait? Download our $1.99 plug in to skip this wait up to three times a day. Or our $5.99 to skip this wait forever."   "Have a good first day at school..."   "Oh, God. How come nobody here can beat the meat before putting it on a damn grill?"   GameCube FTW.   If you can get it, I'd say get it. There will be games exclusive to new 3DS but not the standard 3DS. Improved battery life, improved 3D, auto brightness, comfy in your hands, improved button layout.  The 3DS is not going to be obsolete for a few more years. Nintendo isn't stupid enough to just release a new console while their current gen offerings are still young.   You say that like they have plenty of left over staff to port large portions of old libraries to a virtual environment with no real guarantee that the efforts will pay the staff and then some.   In Nintendo's Defense, anything before the Wii wasn't a gimmick with controls. DS seemed like pure gimmick, but it something that definitely works when executed correctly. So I wouldn't can that just another Gimmick. And let's be glad the 3DS isn't just a DSi with a 3D screen, but a very competent handheld with extremely fun games to play. Yeah, yeah, low res, whatever, still way too much fun on one handheld.   I'm not a big fan of achievements. Games should be replayed because of replay value. Not for gamer points.   Name: Ultra Nintendo Entertainment System.  Rest assured, it will be comparable to any current system with lower power consumption.  Compatible with GameCube to USB adapters and there will be developer APIs so every game can use it from launch.  This built upon what OP said should put Nintendo back on #1 slot.   Ness will suck a little less. Just a little.   Wow. You're equating Amiibo to a store-specific preorder costume? Apples to oranges dude. Anyone can get an Amiibo, not everyone can get a pre-order. Not only that, but you're paying once for a figure that can unlock content in multiple games or claim daily rewards for some games. Not the same as other companies doing on-disc DLC.  And people are very right when they say the content is NEVER significant to say you're not enjoying a full game. If Amiibo was used to lock content such as extra levels or important items that could help you complete the game, then it would be a problem. But, even without the game, you have a decorative and collectable figure on your shelves. Other DLC does not give you anything like that. If a new game comes out with on-disc DLC, you gotta buy it. And if that DLC stops being supported, then you're fucked. If a new game comes out with Amiibo support, and you already have the Amiibo, then you're already bought that content. And it will never stopped being supported since you don't have to download it.  Amiibo-specific content being on the disc makes sense for this reason. If the game had to download content or checked a server every time an Amiibo was tapped, it would get very annoying very fast.  Nintendo did it much differently. The concept may be similar, but at least they did it in a fun and enjoyable way. And not buying Amiibo does not stop you from enjoying any game's main content.  Some people see it that way. But let me make it clear that **Nintendo is not getting a free pass for anything.** we still hate how hard to get they are. The price is pretty steep if you only want 1 Amiibo to use in 1 game for 1 time. Some of the content isn't worth an Amiibo you don't already have. And yes, it does suck that there isn't a way to access to content without one. But asking for that would be like saying developers should make all DLC unlock able so we can all play it for free. And those who paid simply didn't want to work to unlock it. It'd be a bad business model if nobody had to buy an Amiibo.  Nintendo had to sell some, and they weren't just going to let everyone have everything for free. So everyone can take their hate for Amiibo and shove it up their ass. If you're complaining about them not being abundant or available, I understand. But just hating on it because you see it as insignificant in-disc DLC enablers, then just stfu. We get it.      "I'm sorry sir, but you're above 115 lbs. We're gonna have to execute you in two weeks if you can't drop those pounds."   "Here is Star Fox. Other great games too.   Sorry to say, no Zelda Wii U.   You say we should have talked about it too?   We said that we wouldn't so you can eat poo.    If you still expected some art or game play,   you came with the wrong expectations today.   We don't have to please you, quit begging you pup.   If you're disappointed, it's 'cause you set yourself up."   "The name's Bond... James Rutherford Issac Taylor Mimi Marco Elizabeth Bond Bond."   "Oh boy. Can't wait to see if the GSpot is real."   "...  "...  "...  "...LET'S HAVE SEX!!!"   "I sit at a desk and my previous employee who say below the desk as as my secret assistant has quit. I need a young spirit, at least 18, to fill this position."   Star Fox footage. No more expectations. Just want to see the damn conference without 500 people trying to predict or be the first to post videos about what they just saw. Would also like my friends to stop telling me about it even though they know I'm watching.   Hey, Brad, you're the winner. No no, I'm just kidding it's Wayne.   Oh shit, that's right. I finally have a reason to put something other than Mario Kart 8 or Super Smash Bros in my Wii U.  Thanks!   "Did you see that poster, Reiden Lightman? He's so hot."   "oh shit, what jokes are they making about us in this thread?"   Grandmother, what big titties you have.   Is good to see another fan of skyward sword. It was my favorite Zelda game before Majora's Mask 3D came out. I'm very sad that I do not play it more often. I have to share a screen with a family, so my  3DS has been filing the roll of main Console.  Feel free to hit me up if you'd ever like to discuss the game. And, I think there is a position to increase your overall stamina. There are a few ocarina cheat codes that I deal make the game more enjoyable with actually cheating at anything.   That's a strange predicament. I did dig up my old DS. The big brick from 07. I can use that for something. I think I can get what I want soon enough.   Wouldn't I need a Japanese DS?   I tried. Everything leads to the Masuda method.   I personally think both of them are awful is many places. iOS loves to rely on this transparency that adds nothing to the function and only takes away from usability even if by a little bit. Android seems to be way too flashed up and decorated for its own good depending on the version.   I don't have a GEN 6 game, and I honestly don't give a fuck what's easier on Gen 6. I'm doing Gen 5 right now.   ??? How does this help me bread a shiny?   Not trying to be competitive. Just having fun working for bragging rights. Lol.   I don't have a Gen 6 game.  Even if I got one tomorrow, I wouldn't put this down just to play the other one just yet. Trying to finish this one and do whatever fun stuff I can on it before I jump to Gen 6.   I take this with a grain of salt. This in no way proved Ryu will be part of the game. #BrawlVault.   ...Let's see, how could we have easily faked this...  Brawl + file replacement codes + Ryu hack + greninja hack + capturing the right stuff + putting music over the video.   I'm in the IE, looking to trade for a non-English Audino to help me breed a shiny. If anyone is interested, PM me. Don't comment.   Thanks for the information.   I'm playing Black on a New3DS actually. Been playing Majora's Mask on 3DS for a while now. Just recently got back into pokemon thanks to a friend lending me his copy of Black.  I probably should have mentioned all that.   I only ask because I'm trying to breed a shiny Audino and read that using a foreign pokemon with a non-foreign pokemon to breed yields the biggest chance for breeding one. Believe me, I don't want to hatch 8,000 eggs before I hatch a shiny.  But I'm only on Pokemon Black. As far as I'm concerned, /r/pokemontrades is meant for generation VI.  How could I possibly get my hands on a foreign Audino when nobody I know has a foreign version of the game/foreign DS? I can't, right? I'm in Southern California, and it flourishes with pokemon players, but not people on Gen V who play non-English copies.  Am I pretty much screwed?   "NO, NO NOT THE KEESE, NAAAAOOOOO!!!"

I've never coded before, but now I want to learn Swift.   Yeah, I had to educate my girlfriend's parents about scams like this. It's impossible for some random company to see a virus on your computer. If they do see it, then they're looking at your computer's files and information without your knowledge and permission witch is a cyber crime. If anyone calls saying they see a virus on your computer, then it's fake. And they actually had paid around $80 to install some **fix** which was just spying software. I had to remove it and tell them they were scammed and to cancel their current credit cards just to be safe.   PK Thunder.   "Hier stehe ich , und hier bleibe ich .

Okay now it makes more sense.   I don't understand    You should have tried windows 7 instead of Windows 8. And this is coming from a mac user. Anybody could have told you that 7 is an almost infinitely better experience than 8.   Mostly, the operating system and is ecosystem. They are very tight knit. Instead of having some stuff picked out and made by one company and another company making changes and/or addons that are hot and miss, Apple is very strict about how they go about getting the product to you. They make the operating system and design it for the hardware that they themselves have handpicked. It's like putting two and two together to make for by one person who knows the math. The other side is like someone making  a two and then buying a fraction he thinks is equal to two.  I really like the feel of the operating system. And the parts in the computer are not just fast but stable. I would sacrifice 20% of speed for maximum stability any day.  And many people claim it is entirely out of the lack of popularity, but I disagree. Unix and Linux are simply built with security deeper in mind than Windows ever was. The fact that Mac was built off of a core that had networking and specurity as priority is a big peace of mind. Apple on paper and in practice had proven to be less vulnerable.   What if what you love will get you a job?  By the way, NEVER consider college unless you already have a career in mind for after college.   "I'm only 16, mom. Slow down."

Also, he's giving the poor lots of money and encouraging them to take advantage of the USA Welfare system. I'm Bill O'Reily. More at 11."   So, some people are starting to maybe come to there senses. Seriously, this mass surveillance is a waste of money, a waste of time, and an overload of useless data that buries anything that could actually be used.  They can't give us that bullshit about how stopping this means we're stopping the spying on known terrorists and criminals. If they were *known* terrorists and criminals, then wouldn't we have a warrant for their arrest and their asses in jail?   Summoning of Chimeratech Fortress Dragon cannot be done during the battle phase as it is a fusion summon that can only happen during your own Main Phase. If it was something that can be done at any time, then it would be broken against Machine decks or even with DNA surgery. With DNA surgery, you would change everything to Machine-type monsters and simply tribute every monster on the field for Chimeratech Fortress dragon whenever you wanted (assuming there is a Cyber Dragon in play).  If Chimeratech's text said you can do it during the Battle Phase, or if it required the effect of a quick-play spell card, then it would have been alright.   "It won't kill us. It doesn't exist. Just like Global Warming doesn't exist. It's a scare tactic by the democratic left wing lead by communist Obama-care."      "Just remember. There's a good word to live by. And it is 'yolo'".  ^(*Actually fucking said at a high school graduation my girlfriend attended*)   Wait, isn't the Patriot act partially responsible for the NSA's mass surveillance?   "Hi, I'm King Henry VIII."   This is a warning. You've posted more than one within a 7 day period multiple times. If it happens again, you will receive a temporary ban.   This person has never done business with the OP and his feedback is invalid.   Please put each section on a different line    http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs  Here's an album full of everything I have. The deck core is the first few images. But, maybe there's also some other things you might want. Just pick out a list of anything that jumps out at ya. Just keep in mind some things are missing.  Happy looking.   "Who puts a beehive inside a piata?"    "Did you hear? Coke is paying off Obama to make drinking water illegal."   I have a good bulk of what you're looking to buy. I had a Cyber Dragon deck I used to play. I took out some of the more common cards to use in another deck, so I can sell you what I have at a price that's more than reasonable. Finances are forcing me to take a hiatus, so let's make a deal. PM me if you're interested and I'll get you a list and pics of what I have.   "Next time on a brand new *Choking The Chicken, Stephen tries to scarf the biggest bone he's ever seen."   "To be or not to be? That is the question... Or, so I've been told."   You can be a real dick by deselecting others' floors. Many elevators have a button you can hold while selecting your floor to go straight there.   "Boating school? I thought this was spanish class. See ya later bitch."   /r/imgoingtohellforthis because you're a dick good sit. Well played.   There are two sides to this. One, it's her first birthday. She won't remember. A small gathering is all that's needed. A party for that just seems obnoxious. Maybe that and/or a noise factor was bothering your neighbor. So maybe you were both being douchebags.   "Dude, if what you're gettin' tonight is anything like what she gave me last night, thank your lucky stars."   ... "Anybody have any ideas?"  *everyone else*, "no not really."  "Come on, 50 Shades can't be the only one.   Tricking people. Manipulating users. Trying to make money every sneaky way they can by selling data. ITS ALWAYS FUCKING FACEBOOK. Why is it always ducking Facebook? Facebook seriously needs to be given a fucking kick in the ass.   I want to be able to start text message or iMessage without going to the app. I want to be able to do this without replying to someone. Seriously, a button in the notification center. That's all it takes.   *Raises hand* "How can we get Drew Carey to go back to making Whose Line episodes?"   Please don't post videos of "Best of the month" when that month is not even over.   That feature's a bitch. Especially when you record, run out of room, transfer it, then delete it off your phone, and wonder what's taking up so much room for the next 4 weeks.     	128
 Sometimes quitting illustrator and reopening it fixes stuff like that. That's a weird one though.    You can enable NPC dialogue in the chat window, which is basically subtitles.   This [entire series](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19605733/atomic?) is pretty rad.   Yes. He was incredible.      With the way Apple's app discovery process currently works, that is actually good design. The app title and keywords are the best way to rank. It may be ugly but that doesn't make it poorly designed.      Yeah my laptop is great for work but it isn't the best for video games :D         What is your daughter interested in right now? What lessons did you or do you plan to teach your daughter? What sort of things would you like to read about to your daughter?          It showed up in the youtube sidebar as a suggested video based on [the video in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/380bul/patient_with_antisocial_personality_disorder/). I didn't search for anything.   It really saddened me when she started to talk about having kids.      Like how he said he had respect for women and would never hurt a woman but then went on to talk about how he hit a woman for getting up in his face and threw another women out of a window and broke her ribs.   I thought I was crazy for being so bothered by this on an otherwise very well done bit of motion design. Guess I'm not alone :)   These are all great points and incredibly helpful, thank you!      Maybe they actually created it all in yarn and staged and photographed it.   You can download the brush kit from a Russian guy on deviant art.            Do you think it has helped during times when you are depressed?   You say you have practiced for the past two years, I'm curious how it has helped you.    Some subreddits allow for nsfw stuff as long as you tag it as such.   This.  The level design and quest text is pretty amazing.      Try blinking the stars at different times instead of one group that gets brighter and dimmer.   Thanks! I like your hover effect :D   Toggl is amazing.   Empathy is a pretty good tool to work on for most designers.   Being a designer is pretty awesome. In the last three years, my professional activities as characterized by type of design are:   * Content Design (content strategy, content marketing, etc)  * Game Design  * Graphic Design  * Illustration  * Industrial Design  * Information Design (content audits, site maps, mock-ups, etc)  * Media Design  * Motion Design  * Packaging Design  * Product Design  * Software Design (wireframing, user-centered design, etc)  * Usability Design  * User-Centered Design  * User Experience Design (rapid prototyping, user flows, user scenarios, etc)  * User Interface Design (user interaction, user-centric, etc)  * Web Design (responsive web, typography, etc)  One of my favorite things about being a designer is the amount of new things there are to learn and old things there are to get better at. The best advice I can give is probably the same advice you can get for almost any career path, that is to never stop learning.   As for getting work for your portfolio just make stuff. Do you have an idea you think would make a good app? Mock up some UI designs or some user flow charts. Interview a dozen people about a problem you think you can design a solution for and create a list of user needs, then go prototype out some solutions. You don't have to do client work to get a portfolio :)  Lastly it helps if you spend some free time honing your craft. Drawing every day really helps with so many aspects of the job for example.  If you ever have any random questions [feel free to contact me](https://twitter.com/ryanallen_com), and good luck :)   It is worth taking this advice just for the experience of learning all about small claims court.   	36

 What are some of the red flags you talked about?   Turn off melee attack assist, promote skill target and autotargetting, they really mess with the gameplay!   I feel mesmers portal will be amazing for quickly moving supply back and spawn some npc's then quickly use the portal again grab some more, I think it'll be interesting seeing how everyone's playstyles will change and adapt to the new game mode and map.   Thieves, engineers and mesmers are the main ones I see roaming in most games.   Who would let such a small child ride such a powerful beast?   I did it once, my girlfriend stills laughs about it because it was so unexpected.   The cool down is tied to the ram not the player if I remember correctly.   Go to your bank and preview some armour find some you like and just Google where to obtain them easiest way to get a look you like.   You have to realise that not everyone is doing it to gain an advantage, some are just playing with their friends, but it can get annoying I agree.   I like to join groups with ele's, guardians and warriors so I can be sure that I'll get some might.   Woah that kid looks like Brad Pitt   () I want gerrrrrmmmss   Ah I see, thank you for the clear explanation!   Can you explain what the VIP system is/ does?   Last rank of what? Is this pvp or wvw or what?   AH, STAYIN' ALIVE!   Reflects   Created a new character after the update and was surprised to see the new lay out for the proffessions came with the update!  http://imgur.com/i6T4h0y    Nice find looks like you could be right; I like the sound of the leaked skills i really hope the bow is a decent weapon.   As a level 52 you're at a major disadvantage, yes you get boosted to 80 but your stats will not be as high as an actual level 80 with full gear, you really have no chance until you're level 80 yourself and have your gear and traits, just run with the zerg try and stay out of the way and toss some grenades in there, also if you're getting chased Rocket Boots, turn around Net shot then run for your life and don't forget to use Caltrops on toolkit to slow them down and your block as you run away (If you think they can still hit you).   Some mini games would be nice, like the ones from that place i can't quite remember right now.  The firing range and shield/sword training, i mean they can help with reaction times, they could even make the trainer for sword training a giant golem that puts up a bubble shield so it wouldn't look silly with a few people doing it at the same time, it's relevant to pvp at least.   Was this kid called spongebob?   	22
 Hey Adam, it is true that you and Jamie don't get along, but stay together for the sake of the show?   Pretty much every Pink Floyd song.   Tortuga: Pirates of the New World (?)   Ok I'm really not sure, but as the graphics are cartoonish and you had to collect carrots I would say Jazz Jackrabbit.   That's the one (: cheers   I am really looking for a homemade christmas music video where four kids, from an nortish european country (something like Norway, Sweden) sang in turns. And it's so ridiculous it's funny...   I remember that in this game the ninja fight demons, and when you kill one of the bosses you recover a missing body part, making the game slightly different.      The buy-in for this tournanent was 1 million dollars. One. Million. Dollars.   Coming to steal ya bitch  	10

 Phone saves the barber.    All he has to do is double jump at the window across of him and press B to hang onto the ledge.   Took a while for my eyes to focus but I yeah I noticed him too.   Walmart clearance sale. There was a post about it yesterday. Theory is since they're bringing in the new 1TB consoles they want to get rid of the stock they have.   Where's Chris Brown when he's needed?   Can't we just do it with Will again and pretend he's not old??   Butt hurt American?? I assume so.   Oh god remember Jenny? What a bitch.   His rhythm is horrible, he loses it by the third poke.   This is also true.   No, no you can't. I'd be charged one count of vagina slaughter with the use of a deadly penis.    I can't go back there woman!!   No shit Sherlock. What I'm saying is I would've liked it to be a VR headset not AR as I do not see many practical uses for it with games. But yea, fuck me for having an opinion right? Assholes.   Perhaps stop putting your name on your accounts??   Mine just shows no videos available constantly for the past few months. I've re-installed countless time to no avail. Fuck the Youtube App.   Sounds gimmicky. I just want to put a headset on and be transported to another world. Not put a headset on and be in my room with a constricted view.   Lego Batman, couldn't pass up that amazing offer.      Witcher 3. Not really like batman but if you like story and side missions you can't go wrong.   Like other people have mentioned, use your signs. Between Quen and Aard you should be able to kill it with no problem (Use Quen before going into battle that way you can use Aard as soon as you start fighting to get him out of the sky). Also don't dodge with being monsters, use roll instead   Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition is **DOPE**   VR **is** the way to go. Honestly I don't see much use for this in gaming apart from minecraft.   50-60?? Dude that bordering on slave labour. In my country the standard is around 35-40 hours (i.e 8 hours a day). That sucks.   These comments have hurt my brain. WTF is going on?   If you were a child I'm betting you would be saying he ruined Christmas. I know personally I would've flipped my pre-pubescent nuts.   Now this would be a good reboot.   Why don't we use "The more you know" Banner for these types of memes? (Family guy's one is possible please and thank you)   I prefer a threat you can see to one you can't any day, except opposite day.   Do you want a new phobia?   nbsp;  Because that's how you get a new phobia   Surely that just confirms they are westerners therefore more valuable??    Nice try /u/cynic_male alternate throw-away account.   *Insert Insanity Wolf Meme Here*   Nature on nature crime, when will they learn!?   I've tried Hershey's once, let's say my taste buds didn't classify it as chocolate.   ....Well, fuck. I've got/do about 80% of those things. Is it something that could get worse or develop with time? Cause these past few years I've just been getting increasingly socially awkward etc. Sorry for asking so many questions but I think I may be onto something here.   #AH DOYYYYYY   Now that the hype is over people are actually realising what a useless piece of technology it really is. It's like a remote for your phone which is probably in your pocket already. Not needed.   What are the traits of aspergers? Curios cause I think I may ahve a mild case of it. Never been tested though out of fear for it being true.   Bitches be trippin.   Oh don't worry, they'll fuck him. They'll fuck him loooong and **hard**.   Should Air drop a million cups sponsored (and blessed) by the Vatican into Pakistan.   He's not really. How many people of died from cancer vs how many people have died in the name of religion? I don't know for sure but I'm guessing religion is winning by a few million people if not more.   Yes we know, we all saw the Boar video yesterday and read the comments too.   I wasn't prepared, I'm all mushy now.   Why the hell would the cut the tree?? That sucks.   That's what created the theory that Garfield is in fact alone and John and Odie are part of his imagination.   Why is Bill Cosby making another round on reddit?? Has there been a development?      Dude, you guys don't have Aero? How do you make Aero mint cakes!?   I just don't understand how a product like this can be produced. How it can go from deign to manufacture with no one along the way pointing it out is beyond me.   I would've been like fuck you too man. I'm here to collect balls, not bugs. If I wanted to collect bugs I would be a bug collector or something. Am I right?   Those teeth! That's what you call Danger Head, better hope she don't sneeze and clench her jaw.   Black Flag is the only game I think they did right apart from the first 2. For me it is the one that looks most different to the other and therefor gives it a different feel.    At the beginning of Assassins Creed I was really excited for the series. Imaging every game would be set in a completely different time period and country (i.e Egypt during the reigns of the Pharaohs, China during the Ming Dynasty, England during the Industrial Revolution, America during the Revolution etc etc) but every game from Assassins creed 1-3 felt the same. They took too long to realise the potential of the series.   Also on another note, wtf is up with Abstergo Entertainment?? I hope it really hasn't come to that, I hop I have to take them down in the end (Haven't finished the game yet).   Ahhh the dreaded K-hole.   I've been lucky enough to try it once, best meat I've ever tasted in my life.   Awesome thanks for the heads up!!   #Smell ma Butt.   Ahhh the olde Reddit [linkaroo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQoA_wjmE9w)   You just reminded me about this, haven't done it in a while! Thanks!   Please don't give your money to Bungie. Buy Halo Instead. Pretty Please??   Your Youtube works!?   Basically... Everything is Awesome!!   EA Access is worth the $20 a year. Should give it a look. Also Risk if you like those sort of games to play with friends. Another one is Dying Light, not an exclusive but a reallyyy fun game.   Fine, but I'm still not happy about it.   Too bad it didn't last. Didn't even get to try it. I'm hoping they had to take it down because CDPR has something in the pipelines but who knows.   Awwww mannnnnnnn, I didn't get a chance to try it out. Why has it been taken down? Did CDPR get in touch? Do they have something in the pipeline??   Damn I just paid 18 in the UK. That around $25....I think we need some freedom over here.   Fantastic? You just beat the system to a pulp, it's more than Fantastic..It's like Super Fantastic, um yeah that's it.   You sir, you are the Real Batman. Muchos thanks!   Ok fine it's not the worst one made, yes I was being a touch dramatic but it was just really infuriating because it felt like a step backwards instead of forward. Now though since it wasn't included in the last game they are more likely to not have the option again in this game. Match customization was a big part of the game for my friends and I so I apologise but I fell quite strongly since the WWE games have been a part of my life since forever.   I keep seeing this everywhere expect my Xbox Store, argh!!! I want it (but not at full price) can someone link it?   Edit: https://store.xbox.com/en-GB/Xbox-One/Bundle/LEGO-Batman-3-Beyond-Gotham-Deluxe-Edition/e1af57f3-d527-4c7c-affc-cb300cbfc7f0    someone was kind enough to provide me with an actual link. Enjoy guys!   I check the Xbox site and Batman is still full price, where are you getting these from?   I just hope they bring back match customisation, wtf were they thinking. WWE 2k15 = worst Wrestling game ever.   #meh   This 2K series has killed the franchise for me. No match customisation in the last game was the last straw.   TIL it's ends meet not ends meat. Make a lot more sense tbh.   That sucks, sorry.   So day off work or does everything continue as normal?   Our thoughts are with you through this unfortunate time in your life. Keep strong and chin up!   Ouch, the knees took a good slamming.   I'm no Marine Biologist but my theory is it's fishing. Let's it's tentacles hang like that and if any fish is stupid enough to swim into them he will have hi way with it. But like I said, it's just my theory.   It's Monday, it's early. I'm sorry.   Thanks!   Since we're on the subject on making the sub better and with less cluster could we please **Insert title of game into Post Title!!** Thanks!   Can't wait for summer to be over!   What's the name of the game please??   Edit: I know, it's in the title. It's Monday morning, give me a break!   [Forgot snowboarders!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-y70ZOSzE0)   IDK about you but I would lose my appetite if I knew I was going to die too.    watching ladies in tight clothing shake it.  That's what push your over the edge isn't it??   #filters..  #Edit: I JUST FOUND OUT WHAT HASHTAG DOES   I was coming to say the same thing. OP's a douche but great Confession bear material. So I guess he's even.   The cost of "freedom".   Saw it saw Jupiter as it approached Jupiter? I don't get it.   What do you think is keeping my water in the bottle? Sneaky sneaky double currency. ;)   So basically you won the house Lottery, and extra room for free. Congrats!    I got gilded once, didn't really see the use of the extra features etc, just used Reddit as normal. I really don't see the point.   And gold wouldn't?? who the fuck would care about gold if shit hits the fan?? You're better carrying around a couple of litres of water.   We should all take to his twitter to call him a "corrupt heathen". Just saying, it would be fun to see his reaction.   Awesome, now can they fix the "downloading latest playlist" thing so I can actually play?   Here's what you do, stop supporting Bungie.   My love grows more intense with every article.      It's just you're trying to defend a game which is blatantly bad. The only thing that game has going for it is the gun control, that's it. The rest of is is a grind with very little content to keep you engaged. I was as excited as the next guy for that game to come out, and as disappointed as the rest when it did.   But where's the challenge??   Can anyone explain what's going on?? I just woke up.   What I don't understand is the fact that they are trying to build a file on this guy. Why is she trying to get his prints? He also claims she asked for his number.   You're welcome! Hope we get to see more soon :)   ....dude. *stands ups and claps*   What the hell is with the guy in the Land Rover?   But that's logic, we don't do logic.    That last comment was a nice conclusion.   "Not smart."   Wasn't it with every copy?? not just pre-ordered??   I was hoping for the AC series to be completely different. i.e what they hinted in the first game in Desmond's room. I though each game would be set in a different time period in different parts of the world, granted it technically was but they all felt the same. I was hoping for one in China during the Ming dynasty, another in Egypt during the time of the Ferros etc etc. Instead we got the crap that they spewed out Abstergo Entertainment **FUCK OFF**   [Gears of War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccWrbGEFgI8).

 Bro. Just go full speedo brief. I know it may seem weird but the difference is astounding. All my teammates wear them and all professionals do. If my suit is exceptionally loose I might wear another brief under it but that's rare. Try it. Forget what other people think and play like a champ.   How do you like college so far? I was thinking about majoring in a similar field but I'm not 100% sure on it. Any advice?  	2
 Don't forget this bit   I liken it to  My aim is to get my friends and family to do something, some people won't even clean cookies from their browser,    I've had the best results getting people to take their privacy a bit more seriously with that same approach.  I liken it to a wheel-lock bar in a car, sure they're disabled by accomplished thieves easily - but why would they try when there's a car beside it that has none.

There are more but that's a good start if you've nothing installed yet.   I don't know for sure.  There's as much concern as to patents, seed ownership, cross-breeding rights, corporate monopolies on essentials etc. as there is to GMOs themselves.  As for the genetic modification side, I'm inclined to think they're safe.  Though then I remember about 15 years ago, a group scientists declared sections of our DNA 'junk' that had built up over the aeons of evolution. This became a widely held viewpoint, but then about 5 years later - the view changed to the 'junk' being part of epigenetic transmission from one generation to the next. So very much not 'junk'.  That all made me think that genetic modification is perhaps still to young a scientific endeavour for anyone to say for sure at this stage.  Plus, I think it's often a solution looking for a problem.  We produce more food than we need, we bin so much of it, we use land inefficiently - all the while there are many techniques for growing plants in hostile environments, soil remediation, the city farm in Japan that's producing huge quantities of food with drastically lower water requirements. All these things without a GMO in sight, and thus none of the legal ownerships concerns.  I think the medical / environmental concerns can take a back-seat to the reality that we really don't need them.  If someone was planning for a colony on Mars, I could see the need but here ...   Tnaiste: Officials in my dept should be complimented for looking to make appropriate arrangements for water grant  One of the many things that really annoys me about Irish politics is this fishing-for-compliments for people doing their jobs, or often demanding praise for it.  They get paid to do their jobs (which isn't done well frequently), it is not the product of volunteers.      How about not making expensive phone calls in the Dil when you're meant to be working?     Shadowbans?  I reckon most legitimate posters would message the mods, and the genuine time-wasters won't notice.         Fairly heavy falls for the last hour here in Navan, roads seem ok though.   This is the kind of rechecking of assumptions the whole world could benefit from.   News to me, and all the best to you.   If things go Canonicals way, Snappy will eventually replace the apt-get repository management tool. But why fix what isnt broken (and apt-get most certainly is not broken)? Because, by isolating apps and frameworks from each other and, as much as possible, from the OS kernel, you can realize unprecedented system stability and flexibility  Replace your "not broken" apt-gets with our internet-dependent breakables, special low-price today prior to the awkward climb-down later.    That was almost as Bracing as it was Quisling   If you're feeling lonely   isolated, and if / or if not schizoid - you can comment and message me anytime - whether it's a lost uncle or an unhappy mind.  Defaulting to a worst outcome in this thread, well, that's not compassion and it does seem willful.    I've had the opposite experience, all schizophrenics I know - realise eventually that their 'lies' are untrue.  Their lies never *feel* untrue though, and that's what rules their precepts / concepts.  But yeah, 'sociopathy' is a big umbrella (like schizophrenia too) - plenty of room for everyone almost.   Schizophrenia thrives on lies: those who lie to the schzoid, and the lies the schizoid tell themselves and others.  Understanding works both ways, and it's better with honesty (buffered by compassion always, but were past that in this thread)   As a non-bi guy, I'm not sure either.  You might have to settle for equal-opportunities combos for the day.  Now, where would you travel to for that?! :)   Hehehe :)  To be fair, no one should go anywhere near curtains.  They're costly to get right, almost nobody cares why you do get it right and the people who do care didn't pay for them most of the time.  Curtains are in that category of things that are only noticed when incorrect.  Sorry about the rant, stay Straight   Fabulous (encouraged, not trademarked)   Losing an uncle to suicide is awful  Though not awful enough for you to stop trolling it, so what's left:  Obvious Troll,  Bereavement-free Know-nothing, or  Bionic-Asshole   Replacing empathy with speculative assertions is not help, but you already know that don't you?   Fair enough, I've looked around and am very happy with the gay way I am.  Can't imagine swapping either, and I've been with a few women so perfectly ok going the rest of my life without being a sad-sack in their bed.  Are the memories bad? Nah, a fair few giggles though :)   Ohhh, new variation - make someone you fancy (pre-pill) take one too with you.    Only one way to know for sure   Curtains, don't cheap on the curtains if you can help it.  They take up more visual space than most furniture, spending money on curtains makes sense if you're sticking around for while.  Man, I want that 'straight' pill.    Do you think you're helping?   Is that a fact? If it is you better tell the Garda, or explain why you can't.   As someone who doesn't need such a pill, if I'd a 'Straight for a Day' pill - I'd take it and go to Florence.   Oh the science was annoying, but unlike Interstellar - Gravity didn't try to explain the bad science so I found it easier to ignore.  The Nitrogen thing in Interstellar, I had my disbelief unsuspended, and then a few times more - it made me forget I was watching a movie.   Ohh, Cake!  Cheers!   expects to get back every euro the Irish taxpayer put into the banks **since it came into office**     If I posted this in /r/movies, I'd be shot.  I enjoyed Gravity more than Interstellar. They're both good movies, and Interstellar is great in places - it's also quite dull in places.  Gravity's just a thrill ride from start to finish, and both play loose with science.   *it's   I think David Quinn is mixing up 'promote' with 'enforce', on purpose.   RAM not being used **is actually used**  so indeed, "RAM not being used is RAM being wasted."

In fairness, didn't she identify a leading cause of unwanted pregnancies?  Ah, [yes she did](http://www.thejournal.ie/td-fornication-most-likely-cause-of-unwanted-pregnancies-422895-Apr2012/)   Super, cheers!   If you've a spare Raspberry_Pi, you could install [RuneAudio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) on that as the music player and then use MPDroid as a remote on your phone to control it.   Awwww!  What's a 'super' subreddit mean?   Have you tried [MotionPie](https://github.com/ccrisan/motionPie#motionpie)  with the 'light detection' setting on?  Should cut down on the checking.  If you're happy to edit the motion.conf settings, you can limit the motion detection to certain sections of the image - reducing the false positives more:  http://lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/ConfigOptionAreaDetect    slide 1 of 12  Well, that was quick visit      Must have been cinema before then I guess.   I wonder what caused them before computer games?   The march is still on at the end of the month, isn't it!?   I pay the TV license, Netflix   Sky - I still download because national TV is largely nonsense and Sky ruin every decent show with adverts.  If Netflix had a decent range of shows   movies it would help, but as it is after ~2 months I'm done with everything on offer. I pay for it as a 'thank you' for shows like House of Cards.  Going to the cinema involves a car journey because we don't have cinemas in towns anymore.  If after all those services I pay for and the content that then entitles me to, someone is going to come after me for downloading, then I'll drop them and just download anyway - may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.   Ah of course, the single-payer potential of it will never see the light of day.    No, just providing reasons for a confidence problem. Have you been in A E recently, ever seen   heard what people on trolleys for hours looks like? It certainly isn't first world.   You read the bit where I questioned the 'confidence problem' of the quote?   There are two US health insurance companies in the country, like they're going to let the government do this - even if it was done right.  Mr Varadkar also insists that Ireland's health service is not "third world". He said such descriptions are because there is a "confidence problem" in the minds of the public.  The highest number of patients on trolleys only just a couple of weeks ago, a nurse's strike - all a confidence problem?   By the way, if you're with Liberty Insurance or Laya - you'll want to make your peace with the US government knowing your medical history and [checking it on entry into the US](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1 uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fcanada%2Ftoronto%2Fcanadian-woman-refused-u-s-entry-because-of-depression-1.2444960)   Great to see the new commissioner enforce the rules like the last commissioner.   Rule #2: Install Linux, make it look like Windows - reap kudos.   Says the poster who provided none for the claim that started this thread.  Troll off child, or have some balls and try living outside Ireland and see how your crap fares.   Though the figures in the first chart are correct, spokesperson Ben Conroy described it as extremely selective in terms of what it choose to compare us with in terms of areas of interest  Ok, so where are their figures coming from? Is there an obvious data-set link I've missed?  edit: Does anyone here have some wget-fu, better than mine, they can use?      I heard about a system in Holland where if you're caught drunk-driving they confiscate the car   you've to buy it at a dutch-auction if you want it back.  We should try that.         You should post that to Sao Paolo, they're having a drought.   Should we leave the law to create two tiers of citizenship so Breda can feel better about her hypotheticals?  Ahhhh, why bother unpicking her nonsense - she's a dose.  "Don't argue with stupid, they'll bring you down to their level and beat you with experience".     When I lived in London, I met a few people who knew him, definitely on the prick side of the scale they reckoned.   I think he's just annoyed he'll have to buy an actual porn mag in a shop for a change.  edit: [And he's removed it](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/fine-gael-councillor-apologises-after-he-weighs-in-on-page-three-removal-by-sanctimonious-feminazis-30922002.html)   Follow Cameron down the E2E encrpytion-ban boys, it's not like this government hasn't followed idiots before.  Can't wait to see them square it with 'security' excuses as they watch every trade secret business go to the airport.  But sure it's the Dil, where else has the damage to this country of the last 10 years come from anyway.  I suppose Charlie has been calmed with 'assuarances' from external parities at this stage.   And the [Keymap Editor](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Keymap_Editor) plugin for any other features of XBMC you want to map to the remote :)   I got off the Ubisoft hype-train at AC3, they're a bargin-bin only publisher for me now.  So whenever their games are 20 or less, I'll consider them, not before.   He applied, but the Gay Union said no - then nope then jesus no.   We should start using them to see how many Garda actually leave their stations during a shift.   Nah ;)  People didn't know if if was East European, Russian etc.   When he was first elected I remember it being part of the whole "and where's that surname from" questions   gossip floating around. There were even some photoshops of him, with his likeness shopped onto a super atheltic body (apparently a bit of a gym addict back then).   I'd like him to be a teacher.   Bit of an open secret wasn't it?   Very viable :)  I use a Pi as my main stereo, hidden away inside an old radio cabinet.  I use [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/) as MPD server, plus it comes with a nice UI for control from phones, tablets, pcs ...  Two things to note though:  The sound from the Pi is not great unless you add a DAC (it's really hissy without it) so I don't consider a DAC optional for this kind of setup. I went with a [Wolfson Audio DAC](http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/wolfson_pi), it's designed for the Pi and Rune Audio has built-in settings for it.  The other thing is large collections. I had a much easier time after splittling my collection into folders of just less than 10,000 songs each. Scanning, and quick playback was much better then.  The sound is glorious   clear. And for the price, I reckon impossible to beat.    User Kicked for Body-Swapping  Ban ~8 hours.   Which would be a great efficiency if secured correctly / legally barred from sharing with 3rd parties   barred from the commercialisation of data - yadda, yadda ...  What galls me is that while government wants more   finer grained data on citizens - the same government wants less   lower quality information known about it.  This is a pity as it would greatly assist citizens with sanctioning under-performers, removing government waste, evaluation and of course making informed decisions when voting.  I'll be happy to give the government more data, when I don't have to pull their teeth to get more information about them.  Until then, I'll give my votes to people less data-grabby.   If this is OS roulette, I'll put 10 down on SteamOS.   The data is:  to be held by the department and shared with other state agencies until the child is 30 years old  Yeah, that's not creepy or concerning at all.  I reckon they should pilot it on the children of Dil members, if the data hasn't leaked / been stolen by the end of this government - only then should they ask everyone else to do it. The Dil should probably check encrpytion standards while they're at it.      "Well love, was there any post?"  "No, but there's news"      He said the then regulator, Pat Neary, should have known Anglo was "bust" at the time of the guarantee.  I wonder what he will have to say for himself when his time comes to appear?    One must ask, why??  Because the Israeli Embassy in Ireland has a long history of inappropriate tweets and facebook posts which antagonise a lot of Irish people, and the embassy routinely has to delete the posts afterwards and apologise.  They've been doing this for years.  So I guess one must ask, why does Israel tolerate having these ambassadors represent them?   Amidst the noise of the storm: the rustling of papers, the click of keyboards and the swish of touchscreens - as thousands of Irish people check when their contract's up ...   Always Look on the Bright Side of Life ...   Yeah, that's fair.  I enjoyed it so much I've overlooked that its shorthand for things might gate it a bit.  You're right that it really shouldn't be the first on the reading list.   And the prohibtion on images of Mohammed is an Islamic prohibiton, if you're not a Muslim - it doesn't apply to you.  Should depictions of gay people   relationships remain hidden because gay relationships offend some religions?      And it's gone ...   I think out of any group, anywhere - there will always be those willing   wanting to go to extremes.  That only ~25 people have left Ireland to fight in Syria, or 0.07% of muslims in Ireland have done so - fits that idea.  It would be great that that tiny group didn't, but I don't think making policies for such outliers / edge cases is ever going to stop something which is part   parcel of human nature. However much we wish it weren't.  Plus, the very good news is that 99.93% do not.       Coward   [2312](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2312_%28novel%29) is worth a look.  And for giggles with a serious point to make nonetheless, there's [Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html) which the author re-released for free.     When I lived in the city centre, two seagulls regularly flew onto the flat roof outside my window.  I called them Jim   Wanda, and fed them sometimes.  Very nice birds, clean unlike the pigeons, and never overstayed their welcome. Plus the pigeons were scared of them.    Charlie Hebdo cartoon that depicted a black French minister as a monkey  I guess you mean [this one](http://media.tumblr.com/22e6aeaf31bf5a075f35b89ea6e5c7bf/tumblr_inline_nhwpvoiCoN1r5ioaz.jpg) and I reckon you missed the point of it.   Sure all your sillys are brilliant, and the Snoos are your thing.  You've only to get permission from yourself.   Absolutely.  The prohibition on images of Muhammad is an Islamic one, this isn't an Islamic board and Ireland isn't an Islamic country.  The prohibition doesn't apply.   Didn't know there were more till your post.  I've played the Ellen Ripley (Last Survivor) DLC, it's good.  The opening will give you chills as it starts right at a really creepy part of the first film.  It is short though, which I guess is why there are no save points in it.  I thought it was worth it, but was expecting a little more.      Don't forget the U.N. they're biased too apparently.  how can a state that never existed be shrinking?  Is this wilful simplification?   Steam will get a big boost, showing off their steam machines and controllers over the year.  Console-only gamers will be very tempted to cross over after a mediocre and limited 2014, seeking the greater variety of games available via Steam, GOG etc.  Ubisoft will learn nothing, as they don't have to, their games sell anyway.  Though 2015 will probably be a bumper year for second-hand sales, as the lemons of 2014 get dumped into the stores by the end of this month.  By the end of 2015, Ubisoft will finally be in trouble for their QA issues after the Division sells next to no DLC. At least one of their divisions will be fully closed.  Nevertheless, 2015 will be much less salty. Adventure games will grow in popularity and books will become more of a primary source than movies.   NFS shares by hand at the command line, won't miss them.   Reporting back, it's like early web-design went to a metal gig, got confused and riffed out html.  Quite thrilling, in a 'sweet-jesus-what' kind of way.      I've been away from Netflix for a while till last week, and I couldn't get over the limited search   browsing.  One view   one search box (PS4 app) - dreadful.  I'll be keeping my Odroid with XBMC a while longer I think.   the speed just drops to 0 for about 60 seconds  This may seem random, but some microwave ovens interfere with Wifi - mine does, wifi is completely gone in its vicinity while it's on.  And 60 seconds must be one of the most common times for things in microwaves.  Is your microwave used a lot and / or near the router?   There's not much I can help you with there, sorry.  Though, just on the simple process side of things:  I had it enabled on both pi's but when adding sources there is nothing under the UPnP option.  There should be nothing at that point, not directory type lists or files.  For the 'just in case' , repeat the step till you get to that same point and then press 'left' on the remote or 'c' if you've a keyboard and if a dialog box appears then press 'enter' / 'ok' / 'select' / 'scan for content' or click your mouse.  I know it sounds simple, but it's how some of the menu actions work.  From a technical standpoint, what you're looking for is the norm for me and most of my friends - it's very doable.  Also, I use the 'quartz' skin - so if you haven't changed them yet, I'd swap over to that for the Pi, it's light   quick.   I reckon without Sky Sports, Sky themselves would have next to no customers. I know two people who only keep Sky for the golf.   The other channels are a wasteland, or a dull echo of their previous selves, and the movies well there's netflix etc.    Well that's going to be a subreddit by the end of the day!  And dried cereals should be allowed to consort as they agree to themselves.   Were you able to connect to 'UPnP (Auto Discover)' using add sources?  It comes up when you choose UPnP at the add sources stage but don't choose anything after - just it, and then it will be listed as a source. Click on that and any UPnP will show up, you should be able to connect from there. Both R-Pi's will need the 'connect via UPnP' and similar options ticked, of course.  Anyway, that's only one method. Plus UPnP won't get you posters, plotlines and other metadata - network shares will.  The better methods would be using SAMBA or NFS network shares. First way to do that is possibly your home router, if it's reasonably new it should have a NAS or 'File Sharing' option. Enable that on the router, plug the hard-drive into it and then back to your Pi. This time you'll be adding sources via the 'Windows Network (Samba)' or 'Network Share (NFS)' option and if the router's done it's job, you'll find all your folders in there and select them as you would in the same way as if it was a connected hard-drive.  If the router can't help you there, then you'd need a home-server. So that's typically an unused PC / laptop, or something like the Pi (though usually not super fast enough) or Odroid U3, it's not a massive piece of work - but a bit longer than a reddit comment. There are loads of guides online, but the quickest solution is with your router if it has such a function. So try that first.   I got Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments with my Christmas vouchers, if you like puzzle games it's a good one - though not a MENSA level challenge.  You can even end up solving the cases wrong if you're not too attentive. It's about 10 - 14 hours, felt like value to me for the price.  It looks great too, though there can be a lot of loading screens.

I live in Snohomish County. Let's start one there ;)   Totally.   Steelers and Stealers, indeed.   I am not buying a new style jersey until they make one with a 5 on it. Fucking Spencer Lanning.   Do you think they would stay on to coach? Starting as an intern on Special Teams and working to create a true culture of veterans, rookies and alumni working together to coach, lead, and play the Browns into a perennial winner? I hate to say anything ever about the Stealers, but Ozzy Newsome is amazing, and he is amazing because of his love not only for the game, but the organization he works for. They win because everyone still works together to make things happen. From the newest guy, to the most seasoned HoF-er, they still work with the team and add their energy to make it strong. I would love for either Joe to become a coach and stay on with us.    I really hope we get people like Ike Taylor retiring from our team. His article on BR about his outlook on moving into the next arena of football (coaching) is inspiring. "I never wanted to be anywhere else. Yes I'm retiring, but that doesn't mean I'm done. My next job for the Steelers can be without cleats. In an office. I can start at the bottom and work my way up. Just being here to help these guys become great is what I live for. Seeing my guys go from 4-5-6 on the depth chart to 1-2-3 is an amazing feeling. Do you need something? I'm the guy. Can I run to Walmart and grab it before the game? I'm   that kind of person"   It's that love for his team, and the desire to be part of what makes it great, that has melted the black and yellow when I see him, and reveals the kind of player I want on the Browns.   Here's hoping that the culture within First Energy has sweetened and tightened up enough that we begin breeding players with this outlook at the end of their careers.   [Hmmmmmmm.....]( http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/meh.ro6390.jpg)   They look a lot like the 1946 jersey numbers.    Have they given designations to the new colors? We used to be Seal Brown, Pumpkin, and White. I know we have a pantone number for the orange that was referenced in an earlier thread, but do we know if they plan on naming them?    Oh my gods and goddeses and all that is holy and unholy and may get you to stop;  Stop. Just stop it. S. T. O. P. For the ever love of shutting the hell up.    I love them all,  so we will go with base 8 on all of them,  with the all white and all brown being 10's love them. The complimentary stitching is so sick, and the carbon fiber brown stripe on the helmet is stylish A.F.    I love them. F$^ #*g love them. The White on White is sick. The drop Shadow is a throwback to the pre-NFL days. Cleveland on the Chest is cool. Browns up the legs is cool. I love the juxtaposition (seems to be the word of the City right now) of old and new is there, and beautiful, and I can get behind my team looking this way. Brutal. And the minimal change to the Helmet was masterfully done. Classy, and Edgy. I'm sold.   Could it be possible that it has more ability to break up the color of the ball, so that it is more in line with the jersey color rule?   I like the Orange numbers on Brown. I really do.   Brown with orange numbers is awesome.    That's a stupid rule.    Beer is more expensive out here in WA.

Off.    786yds, 9 rushTDs/2 receiving TDs. I see him as a goal line guy.  T West will have more yards, but less TD's. Prolly 950yds 4Rush TDs, 1 receiving TD.   All I know is a random Pro Football Focus article says that it happened, and all of the sudden it's everywhere as fact. I just want a link to someone in a front office saying that wither they the Browns, or they the other team offered or was offered this pick for that QB. I cant find it and would love it if someone could confirm or dent the existence of such an article.   Shia LaBeouf    I know it is a standard style,  but I like the pointy ear holes. Reminds me of Brownie.    I like the matte.    I heard this on Sirius last week and had to post it.      I was going to say, seems like he was the original read option QB   Thank you for doing the thing.  It sets us apart from the other subs, for sure.    He is a snarky old shit, but Tony Grossi is right about his rumors more often than not. He's just a snarky old shit, about it.    I agree   This just proves that quality people draw quality people. It all starts with Pettine.   Pics or your lying.    This is my favorite part about having posted this. The subs that you find through comments...lol   https://facingthefireswithin.wordpress.com/2015/03/12/an-amusing-answer-to-georgias-religious-law/comment-page-1/#comment-346      Ha Ha! Only someone who didn't do their homework could come up with an article as far off base as this one is. No research!  #1 Johnny's parents are extremely glad that he was drafted by the Browns. Not only has he gotten the help he needed but the Browns have set up a support system to surround him upon his release. Jimmy   Dee Haslam are oil people   so are Johnny's parents, they are friends that have a lot in common. The Haslam's are looking out for Johnny's best interest   the quote that backs this up is Coach Pet saying that, JM the person is the first thing that needs addressed. Imagine that, an organization that actually cares for the health   welfare of their employees. Not to mention that Coach Pet has taken time to go visit him. Being there for him   not turning his back on him in his time of need   surely the HC   QB are going to become close after this.  #2 Going through rehab myself I know what the things are needed upon his release   first   foremost is a great support system. The Browns have done that in both areas, work   personally. 1.They assemble an offensive coaching staff with the ability to transform these college spread QB's into the NFL. This is proved by each coach's history of developing QB's. Coach Flip called his offensive staff an all-star staff as his phone was ringing off the wall during the period he was doing coaching candidate interviews. Do your research like I have   you will see this, just read negative articles written by others that don't understand what is going on   we get articles like this. Whoever is the Browns QB is going to come to us from college   if you have the ability to transform a college spread QB into the NFL you will have a bigger selection to choose from as most college QB's are spread QB's   this won't change anytime soon so the NFL better learn real quick on how to coach them or they will have a T-shirt with 20 some QB's listed on it as well. This basically is a cutting edge staff put together with a whole lot of thought. Each area in a QB's development has a specialist that will work with him in that area. Plumber's do the plumbing, electricians do the electric, labor's do the grunt work etc etc. They have JM covered in all areas pertaining to football. They even have come up with a 24/7 plan for his week. How he will spend his time off the field as well.  The next part of the support system is a sponsor, someone he can call when he feels like he could relapse. Someone who cares   has his best interest at heart. Someone he can relate to   tell his deepest darkest secrets. The sponser is never a partner in crime, not one of his party buddy's would qualify as they weren't really friends, but friends just wanting something from him. Enter Josh McCown for a 3 fold purpose. He has the ability to be the bridge QB temporarily on the field, the desire to go into coaching when he lays the ball down is a plus for him as he is getting on the job training so to speak that is going help him when he does retire. If you heard Josh's comments about his desire to work with Johnny   when it's time for him to turn the ball over to Johnny or another QB he won't have a problem doing that. His own ego being put to the side for the best of others comes right out of the Bible. He is an example for Manziel on how he needs to feel. The perfect sponsor for Johnny is what Josh is. Not only that, but their home towns are only about 30 miles a part, they can relate in more areas then one   those jet ride homes with party boys will now be filled with the McCown family rather then his bling family. This goes deep sports fans   well thought out by a team that actually does care for not only his well being but others as well. Take note Josh Gordon if you are reading this. Johnny is leading you   providing an example for your good as well. Listen to his play call as once Johnny has gone through it, his next step in rehab is to sponsor others   help them get through it. The whole situation is looking good   the Browns are trying their hardest to be a team that can handle any type player. Whether they be on the wild side or the goody 2 shoes side, they will now be able to not be guided by fear in the draft, but rather could develop players like Dorial Green Beckham. Fear has lowered his draft stock   the Browns could benefit from that like the Bengals did with Vontaze Burfict who fell completely out of the draft because of the fear associated with him. The Bengals had a mentor for him in place that got his attention. That is what separates the AFCN from other divisions, they actually care about their players   don't care what ill informed writers have to say.  As far as surrounding him with receivers, that is not the first thing you do when building a team. When building a team you start with a plan. The Franchise QB has strength's   weaknesses that can become strength's with the right coaching in it's due time. But once a QB or your idea of a QB is established then you can draft according to their strengths. As the QB grows you may have to tweak your style   New England is a perfect example of this as their offense changes pretty regular. The OL is the most important area to support your franchise QB   the Browns have that, may need tweaked but the core is place. Then the running game follows,   the WR's after that, drafted or traded for or a FA, basically they can come from anywhere.  For Pete's sake this is only March   we won't know who is destined to come to the Browns until September, then we won't know how successful they were until the end of the season. Some of us can look at that vacant lot   envision the mansion on the hill. Then again, some can't   that results in articles like this guy wrote!  Meet Johnny's sponsor here! QB, Josh McCown, "My Heart is to Please God" Don't forget, Johnny is in a faith based rehab program.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2osBCXGuy9U      That would be "sir", but I appreciate it none the less.

Change can be made, and if they give us a framework of law that they think is going to give them exclusive religious rights, then what we are going to do is set our beliefs into that framework, and we legally should have the same expansion of our rights.* **[EDIT: Forgot this part and it posted without me getting it put in:]** *Wicca has full government recognition because of the umbrella 501(c)3 that the ATC holds. What the ATC is doing, and does, is inform the legislature and our members of what Wiccan rights will be under their new proposed law changes. It is outside of the scope of the ATC's 501(c)3 to try to create new legislature or endorse or denounce existing legislature"*   Thank you.

Makes sense for them to all know what rights to expect. Thanks again for the suggestion. Took me all day.   The ATC is pointing out where the new rights will expand into Wiccan territory. If the Government passes the bill, then new rights open up. Including rights surrounding marriage, taxes, and worship. Much like what the Christian Right thought would happen with allowing prayer in Louisiana public schools. They didn't realize other religions would have new expanded rights under the law allowing them to host public prayer, as well.   Totally a troll tactic. The link back was correct.

Farmer has been nothing put a draft pick wizard in his one appearance pre season. [Still not convinced the 6th and 22nd pick were his ideas, even though he swears they were]   Farmer would never hook anyone up with a first round pick for someone with an injury track record like Bradford.

We have just had our founder die, and the torch has passed. We were cleaning the church after he passed, and found this framed picture wrapped in a blanket in the back, often locked, closet in the bathroom. After showing it to our archivist, she came to the conclusion that it was real pencil and real watercolor, and the "foxing" on the paper would denote that it would be from around the 40's or 50's. Her next suggestion was to take it to the University of Washington. I brought it here, first.   [Possible Picasso]( http://imgur.com/pWYdrek)     I have found a framed graphite and water color sketch framed in the closet of our new house. I will post a picture in the comments.

I appreciate the info! He looked like his work ethic and his in the locker room personality were above board. He spent the combine working out, and he talked about how important it is to be friends with the team and the coaches. Gratzi, again!      As much as I would like to think he will come back all better, as someone who came off of rehab with a girlfriend still using, it broke us up. If it hadn't, I wouldn't have stayed sober. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life. Since his drugs of choice are alcohol and social media, it would seem like his GF isnt going to do him any favors, unfortunately.    Pantone 2028 C  There we go. So then my next question: Who makes the official named designation of these colors? Such as 'Seal' Brown and 'Burnt' Orange? And do they have the plan to name this new orange, as well?   Huzzah    No.  It's iconic for classic football.    Do you know why that's considered 'a stock helmet picture? Because we made it iconic. The stock photos  are  copying us.    That's awesome.    I don't know if you're correct, but I like it.   Burnt Orange and Seal Brown were the old guard. What is the technical new designation of this vibrant, new, orange?   It should show people how important a decision this is based solely on how much this has encompassed all of football. It's the Yankees changing to polka dots. It's gonna be weird. Does that mean 'bad'? No. 'Change' and 'Pain' exist in the same region of the human brain. It's gonna be different, but that doesn't mean bad.   Thank you!    You are absolutely correct. Even our own solar system is actually moving in a three dimensional spiral, but that is a much more in depth conversation.  Good call, though.    So let me understand this. [The Cavaliers use a 'C']( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/542030215027781632/BrO34cMY.png) and [The Indians us a 'C']( http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/53/57/full/006wvt6wf3g02vqhx7yofazqv.gif) and now The Browns? Fuck copying the Bears, we are copying ourselves copying ourselves with that one. [No sir, I dont like it.]( http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/meh.ro6390.jpg)   It's one of the best things about the medium of online text, in my opinion. Since there is no inflection of tone, and no distinctiveness in ones handwriting on the web, it stands to reason to find the best way to do that within the medium. [For example: On reddit it would have looked like this](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/double-take.gif)    ALSO, it is an imaginary equator that runs through the galaxy, much like there is an imaginary line through the middle of an Astrological Natal Chart. Our sun turns around the center of our galaxy the same as the Earth turns around the sun, and a person could map that two dimensionally on a piece of paper as a circle with 12 pie segments. Our earth moves through 3 segments every season in a circle, eventually coming back to a starting point. In the western world, we consider this January 1st. The same exists on a macrocosmic level for the galaxy. Only instead of it taking 30 days per segment, it takes 2100-2600 years. And instead of calling it a 'month' we call it an 'age'. [I'm sure there is a leap epoch in there to make up for the math.](http://media.giphy.com/media/10yeJtpwWcFrAA/giphy.gif)   [Our sun moves around the enter of the Milky Way much like our planet moves around our sun. Like in this picture.](http://en.es-static.us/upl/2011/01/Milky_Way_face-on_edge-on-e1342743292482.jpeg) We move through ages (Like the Dawning of the Age of Aquarius) every 2100 years or so. Aquarius is the beginning of spring in the Astrological sense. *Edit: I have changed the article to reflect that I am speaking of the Galaxy, not the Universe.

 The original poll link can be found here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/3conrd/hey_reddit_who_do_you_think_will_most_likely_be/      data science      thanks for the info!   Let's be objective even if you are not a Christian. I am not one either but have great respect for Pope Francis.   Couldn't agree more.   I wish they have it available at the west end of st. george as well.   My personal preference is the east asian library (on the 8th floor of Robarts). I liked books there and also few people use that library. For most people (that are non-east asian, so to say), they find the trinity library has pretty good scenery, so that's a place to check out.   Is it true that if bears attack you, you do the same?   Not my program so I can't offer anything specific (academically).  Use the library system wisely - UofT has a lot of books, and I had a lot of fun, when I was there as  grad student, reading stuff not from my subject. It's great learning and free too!   What do you study here?   Highly sophisticated AIs that can do a lot of things like housework, driving, etc.   I don't know, maybe the stakes matter more than whether you are online or offline. People tend to focus less for online games because those are just entertainment really, but when you play in person you are most likely competing for something and so people play more seriously (and hence harder).   Really? When did del Piero say he is gunna return?   I don't think it's true. Marotta said the transfer season is done already.   Very well said. Not a bad player at all, just not a world class one.               I have a friend who really really like this game, so I guess yeah, they have some loyal fans too.     Wow, thanks so much!   yeah, shut up is the best words to him.   That's good to hear. Will definitely try it out before the end of summer.   But Olympics are slightly different right? FIFA WC is played in a number of cities, and for a country like Germany, they have many high end stadiums for their league games already, so that's not a problem at all. But for Olympics, it's all in one city and there are a lot of different sports (so a lot more stadiums are needed in a more concentrated area). Does that make a difference?   Cities Skyline, is that really good? I heard some good things about it but haven't had a chance to play yet.   Yeah, I don't know many of the games on the list personally either, actually. Basically I only played The Witcher 3 and Pillars of Eternity.    Yeah, Pillars of Eternity is also good, needless to say. But yeah, Witcher 3 is just another level.   I definitely think The Witcher 3 is the best game this year. Anyone agree/disagree?         Thanks, do you know if there are sample code for this? e.g. on R-blogger?   Oh, right. Thanks.      Who is Ron again?   I see, didn't known Trapp is joining.   I think people, in general, tend to underestimate historical players and the underestimation will grow with time. I am not saying that people are underestimating Pele necessarily, I have never seem Pele play so hard for me to comment, but just making the comment as a general observation.   This is not really a surprise because there are so many teams competing for a WC spot.   So if Roma gets Sirigu, who is PSG going to get as their startig keeper?            Wow, that's a lot of names you've listed.   I guess it's all about the branding. They have such a group loyal consumers that would by anything Apple makes, so why not just set the price high?      What's happening to this world ???               ahhh, I must be mixing things up.   But Daryl is so strong and is such a capable survivor, why him?   Anyone think Glen will die next season?      Haha, that's a sad story.   Voat.co   Nobody can tell you meaningful things here mostly (because everyone here is in your shoes basically). Talk with advisors   investors and get some ideas from them. All you need is talk to a few and if they are really impressed, they will introduce you to you.  Try reaching out to advisor to start, these people are more willing to see you than investors. Find them on angel.co   That's not true, headbutting is his trademark move :)   Seedorf also had a great long range goal playing for Real Madrid I think, just like this one.                     Raul will be remembered more for his contributions to Real Madrid, whereas his contributions to the National Team is less. But still, I think in Spain, he will be better remembered (i.e. his overall contribution to club   national team is greater than that of Villa).  Raul is kind of like del Piero in some sense, both achieved great things for their respective clubs, but not as much at the national level.  	67

 http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/2hsdvx/coming_to_vegas_on_wednesday_for_6_days_whats_the/  This is a previous question from subreddit vegas.  It is a full-day round trip to Death Valley going west - and it's a great day trip.  I like Zion too - going east - about 3.5 hr drive but less than the Grand Canyon.  Maybe Mt. Charleston - only about 1/2 hr, but not a lot to do once you get there.   It will only go away if enough people want it to.  You try working for a living at 80.   That is funny.  Thanks for sharing.   I think I would have helped my sister though.   I think I love bridges.   I'm with you.   You sound just like a republican.   I'm grateful that I learned to type in high school.     I say this all the time in Reddit, but the Republican Party is 90% white, and Romney's vote was 96% white.  This ought to tell you all that is needed to know.  Source:  Dog Whistle Politics.            I remember seeing George Soros on tv prior to GW Bush second campaign saying if he wins, something is wrong with us.  He's right, something is wrong with us.        And I believe Nixon negotiated with the Vietnamese prior to his election, also treasonous.  http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/yes-nixon-scuttled-the-vietnam-peace-talks-107623.html#.VCOywXKYbIU   Yum.   I really enjoy Michael Palin's travel shows - he doesn't do a lot of them, but the ones he has done have been really good.  You probably can view some on them on line by googling his name.   One of my favorite life stories:  We had a welfare rights march in our town in the 70's.  There was another group who organized an anti-welfare march.  A year or so later I was at our local legal services office as a volunteer and I recognized the leader of the anti-welfare march at the office.  He had experienced a heart attack, lost his job, then his wife and his home.  He had no health care, and was seeking legal services.  His life had literally fallen apart.  I remember speaking with him and he regretted the role he had played when fighting these "welfare mothers".   A couple of points:  I do not believe it is a ponzi scheme; Ponzi schemes run out of investors eventually.  Social security will not; benefits would be reduced first.  It is NECESSARY unless you want to support your parents late in life when they are not able to work.  Finally, I wished I had taken a video of my republican congressman also who also called it a Ponzi scheme at a town meeting.  Republicans don't really want to get rid of social security - they just want to get their greedy hands on it.   I agree.  It sucks.   It will hurt when you are too old to work and your social security will not cover any of your living expenses,  And yes, it will be there.   Well, tell us more.    They have the majority vote.   The above post is a repost, but thought it would be interesting to LV redditors.      Not really.  I saw them test the spillways one year letting more water through the dam than they ever had.  It was great.  That being said, scientists now say that there is a 50-50 chance that the river will dry up in the next 20 yrs.  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080213-AP-lake-mead.html   I recently went to a conference with a friend (out of LV).  She lost her wallet TWICE before we landed at our destination.  They paged her the first time and she got it back.  We boarded and she left her wallet again(!) on the plane.  This time it when on to another destination! The airlines mailed it to her at our hotel so she did get it back before we left town, but most of the money was gone.  She did her ID back though.   I appreciate the chart.  I am old and still want some type of entrepreneurship project.  I still am working 40 hrs/week, but want to give it one last go.  Just haven't found the project I want to throw myself in to. (I did help create a few great nonprofits when I was younger though).  Also, I want a partner to review things with, share responsibility.  I've been looking for a good partner to conspire with, and everyone seems to be too busy doing their own thing.  I'm not giving up however!   I met a woman at Wal-Mart one day who told me she credited the elllipitcal with her 200 lb weight loss.            I loved that movie.   Thank you.   I don't remember when it happened, but a baby was identified as being the next Dalai Lama, but was kidnapped by the Chinese.      I learned in school that southern California climate was like the Mediteranian.   Thank you.   Isn't it insane?  Unions are not perfect, but they really did help the workers are different times in our history.  We have a lot of trolls on reddit too.         Different people have different needs.  I think it would be more work and more expensive to break it down into different categories.  And in the end, does it matter?      Yeah, free speech.  I just read about another big donor from Nevada who makes his money on student loans.  What sleezeballs.   Teachers are unionized, and probably one of the largest unions in the US.   Unions are probably one of the biggest contributors to democrats also.  Kill the unions, kill the Democratic Party.  It's political. Too add to this, teachers are highly educated and for many years were underpaid.  They learned that they could lift their standard of living by working together, unionizing.  And they have done better that they did before they were unionized.   I'm assuming when the term welfare is used in this discussion, that it includes welfare and food stamps.  Remember that welfare is time limited - maximium 5 years in the US from the welfare reform law passed  during the Clinton administration.  Most welfare recipients are young single mothers, and if not working, are required to attend vocational training or volunteer 20-30 hrs/week.  2-parent households are required to meet a 35 hr/week requirement.  Those unable to work must have a doctor's statements.   Part E - for Everybody.   I would prefer the GNP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_happiness   Soros goals are for an open and democratic society (see his foundation).  What are this guy's goals?   Just look at the denial in these comments!   If they would only stop and think.   I work with TANF clients, and I bet most of the cash money (which isn't much) either goes for diapers or towards rent.      My husband's uncle said the same thing 50 years ago.  My husband is receiving social security today - and we bless FDR.   That's absurd.   I went to the Netroots Convention this year in Detroit, and yes, I think it is a beautiful city.  I was given a short tour of the city, but missed these lobbies.  Unbelievably beautiful.  The city has been threatening to turn off water to 40% of the city's residents however since they have been unable to pay their bills.  Unemployment is high since GM left.  Corporations have no moral values.  They can pick up and leave a mess - and nothing anybody can do about it.   I don't remember any impeachment proceedings against Bush.  i remember Pelosi saying she just wanted to move forward.   Like Bush didn't???   Well, they spent millions trying to get Bill Clinton.  What's new except these guys don't know how to legislate.   I've been wanting to read the book.  A later UW team was also amazing.  My uncle was part of the junior varsity rowing team from UW in 1948.  It is an interesting story too that I only learned about after reading about it online at UW.  The varsity team couldn't go to the Olympics (i don't remember why), and the JV team took their place.  They were not expected to do well, but won the Gold.  My cousins took me to a bar at Northgate shopping center last year to show me a full wall mural of the team!   No, we just need to set priorities.   No, it is not a ponzi scheme.  Ponzi scheme runs out when there are no more investors.  As long as people continue to pay in to the system, there can always be social security.  Also, they can raise the rates or cut benefits a small amount, but people will continue to be paid.  Also, think about supporting your parents when they are old and unable to work.  Isn't it better that they can remain self-sufficient in their old age?  And how will you feel at that age?   Ready to work until you drop?   Tax em 80% for keeping it there.   Right. I mean 96% of Romney's vote came from white people.   I would love to see a reddit map of precincts, and recruit reddit captains for each precinct.  That might be a project worth working on!  Move-on had a great project one year (not sure why they didn't continue it), but I was able to download every voter in my precinct and contact them either by phone or in person.  I am biased and support democrats (at least good ones).  It would be cool to target democrats in republican districts and see if is possible to flip the district.   Also, I noted on a previous comment that I would target medicaid-eligible people also who are unable to sign up for medicaid as their state did not accept medicaid expansion (21 states?).  These people could seriously benefit from voting in their self-interest.   I would recruit all those people who are being denied medicaid because their states refused to expand medicaid under ACA.  (21 states?)  They really have something to gain from voting at the state level.   I'm not so sure.  Vegas was not built with buses in mind.  It might take you two hours to get to work.   No, I bet if you look deeper, there are contracts going to cronys.   They also have all of the income.   Still, 12 of 466 is pretty small.   But those guys were fighting the federal government; these protesters are not.     Eric Holder is going this week, probably sent by Obama.   They just don't play by the rules - at least since the 70's and maybe before then.  Also, they have more money than they need legitimately, so they start looking at other things to fund.   What a Wonderful World.   I have some lamps that do that too, and I was looking for replacements and didn't know what to call them either!   I met someone once with that name also.   I used to wonder about the contradiction, but you now hear them referring to innocent life.     If we had supported states' rights as a nation, we would still have slavery.   That's enough to put a chill down my spine.   Democrats have a lot of libertarian values, more than republicans, I believe.  We support all of the issues you listed.   I think your comment is the first one I've ever saved.  Thank you for sharing.   Local governments target them.  That's one of the arguments about having a strong central government that support minority rights.     Whew!   I would rather live in pain and depression for my entire life than to see the grief and pain suffered by my mother on the loss of her son.   Mine too.   Not 96% which is the white percentage of vote that Romney received.   By design I believe.   9   1/2 Weeks. I loved the movie, so I thought I would read the book. Just awful and there was no resemblance between the movie and the book.   I used their paint for years and was shocked at the sales price last time I was there. I think it was $60 on sale.  I like the paint at Walmart just the same now.   Conspiracies do happen!  I can't address your questions, but I heard a recorded phone call on an old tv show (Investigative Reports I believe) that wowed me - where one mob person told another that the hit was on for JFK.  I was also convinced by Thom Hartmann's book - http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Secrecy-Long-Shadow-Assassination/dp/1582435359 By the way, I think I found the Investigative Report show also that covered it:  http://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reports-Jack-Anderson-JFK/dp/B000FKP0TG A lot of responsible people have said they don't  believe it was a conspiracy, but it would be hard to convince me otherwise.   We can't pay for education, but we want to have an arena??   Most people don't watch what is going on.  I meet people all the time who just don't have a clue.   Try La-Z-Boy swival glider.   I think this was the most recognized of any National Geographic covers.   You're right.  I used to call it black and white channel because of all the World War II shows.  I think Fox bought it, and now we get stuff not even related to history!   They said they wouldn't do it until they did it.   The southern strategy?  Lee Atwater spoke publically about about using the southern strategy in 1981.  I believe that Ken Mehlman also apologized for it.  You can believe what you want, but I think it has been pretty much accepted for fact.  And the idea of a small government.  We fought a war over "states' rights", and the confedercy lost.  The original Articles of Confederation failed also.  Good try, but you can't convince me on either topic.   Or those that make money off the 10%.   He's not.  I've known him for decades.   Good job!    Some, but most tea baggers are older than this.  Most of the Woodstock generation fought against the war in Viet Nam, fought for civil rights  and did some good things.  We are still fighting.   Ferris Bueller's Day Off;  Naked Gun.   Democrats are not perfect, but they are not crazy. I read that on a bumper sticker and it's correct as far as I can tell.   Democrats need to hold their own districts and win on republican districts. It could happen if all those people not covered by Medicaid in republican districts voted!   Democrats need to hold their own districts and win on republican districts.   90% white.   This has probablly been posted on reddit previously, but I still check it out.  Scares me too:  http://www.upworthy.com/a-smartypants-scientist-makes-an-easy-analogy-about-our-planet-and-now-im-scared   Sunset Park has a mile path around it's pond (and I think over 7 miles of paths).  It's at Eastern and Sunset. Road.  People do run there.   It doesn't matter what links I could put forth - we see the world from two different frames.  I know that you know that democrats became republicans after Jim Crow - part of the well-known southern strategy.  And I personally believe that voter ID laws are an attempt to restrict minority voting.  And there are a lot of people who believe this or the republican party would not be 90% white, or that Romney would get more than 4% of the minority vote.   The whole concept of limited government is bizarre to me.  It is my belief that the Articles of Confederation failed because they didn't give the federal government enough power to function.  We also fought a civil war over states rights, and the South lost!  Can't we just let the issue die and get on with it??!!!  Sorry about the 18 day response - I don't check this area of reddit frequently enough...I do appreciate your response though.   Yes, and Republicans said they woudn't shut down the government either.   I have a friend whose in his 60's and has done that his entire life.  His longest job was was doing newspaper delivery as a teenager.  He is fortunate to have a career in which he can do this, but his social security is small and he will never have a stressless retirement.   I didn't watch the video, but read the article.  These guys make false claims, then walk away.  I would go berserk in their presence also.   Less hypocracy.   If the member services will not tell you, call a social worker at the welfare office.  They know which health plans cover which mental health services (and providers).   When they were talking about taxing the rich, I wanted to call it the Walton tax too.   Maybe Matt Tiiabbi.  I love reading him, ah, the irreverence!      My grandparents loved Lawrence Welk too.  I can't believe they stilll play his shows!   No, but continuing resolutions were ongoing for many years.  They should do budgets, but it's always been a difficult process.   Here's a Pew study. http://www.pewforum.org/2011/02/23/tea-party-and-religion/ I could probably write a term paper on women's rights and voting, but I'm lazy.  Just googled and found articles on each: http://www.thenation.com/article/176781/jim-crow-ii (voting rights) http://www.pfaw.org/media-center/publications/gop-takes-its-war-women-states (women)   I've been wondering if we would have another civil war.  Things can get so ugly.   It's pretty clear what drives them.   Several things:  To lose weight, I have to cut way back and exercise.  I lose weight and need to cut my calories again to lose more weight.  I don't think I can cut them any farther!  I also have a history of yo-yo dieting.  I always end up weighing more than before I started!  I think if I would have worked out more when I was young and never dieted, I wouldn't weigh what I do today.  I don't know if that makes sense, but that is how I feel.  It is also a lot of work and takes more time than I want to spend on the topic.  I do know I would feel better though.      I am reading a book called the Zero Maginal Cost Society about how many of the basics - power, education and some other major items will be so cheap to produce, that they will be near free.  It will take major battles to get there, but he convinced me. http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com    I am reading Zero Marginal Cost Society - http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/ about a new collaborative age where basics - including energy, education, etc. will almost be free - because the cost to produce it will be so low.  There will be some battles to get there, but he made his point to me.   Depending upon your area of study, you might be able to get a year or more written off by working in a low-income community.    Marvin Gaye had it right:  Sexual Healing.   They need to be shamed in to doing the right thing, and Cuban seems to be doing that. Good for him! Fortune magazine had a  article recently about the same topic.  http://fortune.com/2014/07/07/taxes-offshore-dodge/ I read some of the comments.  One woman thinks they are moving companies to areas for low labor costs.  No, they are moving their corporate headquarters to counties like Switzerland to specifically avoid American taxes.  They probably have a better standard of living there.   Nice job!   I spent summers there as a kid.  It sure looks different today.   Eve of Distruction.   Why do fiscal conservatives vote republican anyway?  They say they are fiscally sound, but if you look at it historically, they are not.  They spend it different ways - mostly for military, and usually end up with a lot of ripoffs due to deregulation.  Reagan is a prime example. Cut taxes, expand the military, deregulate (which killed Savings and Loans and created a huge ripoff of HUD which cost billions.))  Democrats at least have a plan for pay for what they spend and try to monitor spending.  They also realize that peoples rising boat lifts the whole society.   We may all sink with that view.   I knew someone like that 20 yrs ago who had clients who would pay him - and he was respected in the field! I would hear him on radio shows talking as an expert.  But he was just a fast-talker - just like you are writing about.  I knew his wife.  Not sure if he is around today.  I think the only license you would need is a straight business license (but I'm not an expert).  UNLV offered a class one semester on handicapping and I made my husband go - it caused a stir (not sure I remember why), and they never offered the class again.  That being said, there is probably room for a smart handicapper.  The ones that publish in the paper have always sucked.  The really good handicappers work for the sportsbooks setting odds in the first place.   It's true.  Look back at Republican administrations.  Most broke the bank; then dems have to come in and straighten it out.  They just spend it on different things.   Reid won't bring up issues that can't pass.  He is a vote counter and knows exactly what the vote will be before he brings it to the floor.  And remember, he needs 60 votes on most issues.  There is a difference.  He didn't decide on Obama's inauguration day to fight republicans on every issue.  And quit calling people morons.  Does not lead to a good discussion.   The republicans held a meeting on the day Obama was inaugurated and decided to fight him on every issue.  Just google it to see the sources.  They never gave him a chance.   Reading the responses, I swear there are more millennials who are conservatives or libertarians on reddit.  Drives me crazy.   Ron Paul is not a libertarian or he would believe in choice.   True.   I don't believe Bush won either election.  He was given the first one and I personally think they cheated in Ohio to win the second.   If it is true, good. They need to vote. White youth voted for Romney in the last election, so turnout is critical.   And why 90% of the republican party is white, and 96% of Romney's vote was white.   Except look at the states they are in control.  Hundreds of laws to take away women's rights, prevent people from voting, or an yes, tax breaks for the rich, not everyone else.   Not false.  I read that in the beginning.  They are the same folks that Nixon called the moral majority.   I usually start by cutting out white foods - basically sugar and flour.  Can't live like that forever though.  	143
 Julie's the real MVP   ...thereby demonstrating his value?   LOST reference. Whoever gets it gets it.   Sooooo disappointed in the Sand Snakes honestly I was so hyped up about them. They were hot as shit but I guess you can't expect another Oberyn.   Lemons! Burning candles, weed, some trees after it rains.   Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or The Shining (basically a crazy person), and Christian Slater as a sociopath in Heathers.   TL;DR: Guy goes to a mental institution pretending to be a sociopath to avoid jail, ends up going crazy because of this one nurse.   I was LOLing the whole time because I was imagining a girl who loves dry, barren lands not delicious pastries but in all seriousness: be honest with her, that's what I like people to do with me. I don't think she should have taken advantage of you at the bar when you met, I met a guy at a party the other day and he clearly had beer goggles and although I'm not unattractive I took it as my responsibility to set him straight, as should everyone who meets someone who is clearly drunk. Morals.  	8

Today marks three years of sobriety for me. It's not been an easy journey. I started in AA but never really jumped into the program. I mostly talked to people. That helped me more than I thought it would. At first, I just listened. I didn't really feel like I belonged. ***I*** didn't have a problem with alcohol. ***I*** wasn't like these people here. But as time went on, I kept going to meetings. At one point I was gifted a copy of the big book. I've still got it, but haven't read it all that much. Mostly I just listened. And as time went on, I started to identify with a bit from this person or something from that person. I started to see similarities in me. I remember when it all clicked. On that day, I stood up and said "Hi. I'm Brent, and I'm an alcoholic." On that day, I chose to give up drinking completely. Three years later and I haven't had a drop of alcohol. Oh, I've been tempted so much over that time. I thought time would diminish the urge and desire to drink and it has... to a point. But I have had days where I wanted to do nothing more than drown my sorrows in a bottle. And those days happen more than I would like. To quote the big book:   Remember that we deal with alcohol, cunning, baffling, powerful.  I know I'm tempted nearly every day. But I've made it this far. You can too.   I've removed your post because of that. However, if you can find an alternate source, please feel free to resubmit.   The Mighty Morg!  I do miss being underway.

 You underestimate the numbers of active duty Texans that would obey the chain of command.   You hit the nail on the head. It was the worst tech launch fuckup in history.   You get warnings in the U.S. too, if you're white.   Being that it's Texas, I'm surprised they didn't execute her.   Then I would say great, if that's how you want to remember multiplication tables. Whatever works, as long as you can multiply in your head quickly.   It's helpful to know your tables.  32 = 8 x 4 = 2 x 4 x 4 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 4 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^5  When you have the multiplication tables down you more easily recognize and use these concepts.   See @PhysicsProf's answer! Repetition is absolutely critical to everything in math, even concepts. You just have to do pages and pages of the same types of problems to cement the concept in your mind.   You need repetition in math for certain things like your basic tables. Then you build on that for concepts. Med students have to do the same thing for organic chem and anatomy.   Great answers. Part of the problem is that schools will promote students to the next level despite them obviously not being ready. To me this is even worse than not adequately teaching them.      Yet every corporation in America is based in Delaware.   That worked! Thanks a lot. I am trying to plug in a credit card reader for a web app. The reader acts like a keyboard but doesn't actually have physical keys so I still need to have the on screen keyboard appear when the focus is in form fields.   I tried it on my LG phone and the physical keyboard disabled the on-screen keyboard from appearing. Probably the same thing happens on the Android tablets.   Thinking specifically about the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 but I would guess the behavior is probably the same across all Android devices with OTG ports?   [Version 2.0](http://i.imgur.com/ZwsmdNr.jpg)   Yes, the only thing holding back the Federal Military and their fighters, bombers, and tanks from subjugating us is our handguns.  I think you're a lot more likely to die from somebody else who has legal or stolen handgun than by the police or military.    This is just my experience but the most plastic bottle waste I've ever experienced was in asia and the middle east. Wherever we went we were offered water in plastic bottles. It's nice to be able to fill up my Nalgene from a drinking fountain that you can find anywhere in the U.S.   Dude, I would sue the shit out of Google.   Did zil have to choose? Just curious whether he was born with dual citizenship.   I meant it in a general sense, that it's difficult for any immigrant to obtain German citizenship. Not trying to single out the Turks. Should have clarified.   It seems to me that Germans tend to stay in the Bundesliga. I have absolutely no stats to back up this claim so it's just a fart in the wind but I had to let it out.   If you are going to lump Chinese dialects together then you could lump Romantic languages together, including English even though it's a sick bastard child of Romantic and Germanic lines. In which case, the Romantic "dialects" have 1.3 billion speakers.  Edit:  Oops, *romance*, not romantic.   Is it losing mass at a high enough rate? The gasses are expanding but being converted into denser matter. I thought the mass would stay relatively constant until it blows off the gas and becomes a white dwarf.      The sun is also expanding and one day Earth will be consumed by it so I think standstill isn't one of the bigger worries.   I thought it was pretty hard for Turks to gain German citizenship.   Why would you ever do any work for free? If you do, even for a moment, you set expectations that you will never be able to overcome.   He has a Trkish name. Is he German by birth?      Why the hell are still wasting time and resources looking for any link????      [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/marcela-valladolid/chocoflan-recipe.html)  [Pati's Mexican Table](http://www.patismexicantable.com/2012/11/impossible_chocoflan/)  [Rick Bayless](http://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/impossible-cake-aka-chocoflan/)  And of course, [Betty Crocker](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/chocoflan/907b4e0d-9604-467c-8c3e-d95536b5a51b)    /r/mildlyinteresting but not easier or faster.    the study clearly states that gun ownership is not a risk factor for homicide, merely for method of homicide.  In table 4 the researchers found that gun ownership increased your risk of homicide 2.7X. Also from the article (bolding is mine):   Despite the widely held belief that guns are effective for protection, **our results suggest that they actually pose a substantial threat to members of the household.** People who keep guns in their homes appear to be at greater risk of homicide in the home than people who do not. Most of this risk is due to a substantially greater risk of homicide at the hands of a family member or intimate acquaintance. We did not find evidence of a protective effect of keeping a gun in the home, even in the small subgroup of cases that involved forced entry.   I have to correct your quotation.  The full quote is this:   "Gun ownership was most strongly associated with homicide at the hands of a family member or intimate acquaintance. Guns were not significantly linked to an increased risk of homicide by acquaintances, unidentified intruders, or strangers.  Meaning:  The people who knew that the guns were at home and where they were located were the ones who used the weapons in the homicide.  I am listening and I appreciate the conversation. The title says that gun ownership was one of the "significant factors" but did not say anything about causality. It could be that the same people who tend to have guns at home may also be prone to other risky behavior. The researchers also admitted this may be the case and that it was difficult to ascertain the effect. I think further study is warranted and it was unfortunate that Congress put the kibosh on it and it still has a chill to this day.  Really, thanks for the civil conversation. It's refreshing to be able to discuss a difficult subject in this way.   His position is legally untenable and is basically a revisit to Jim Crow. Marriage laws result in legal privilege that two people can enter. He advocates denying the privilege based on something that even he admits the person has no power to choose. Whether it's sexual preference or skin color, it's can't be a basis to deny legal privilege.       1) The topic of the study was completely outside of the purview of the agency.  I think that one of the missions of the CDC is studying injury and violence. If you go to cdc.gov and click on "More Topics" right at the top, you'll see "Injury, violence   safety." Click on it and you'll see a sub-category, "Violence prevention." Click on "About Us" in that division's page and you'll find this:  *Violence is a significant problem in the United States (U.S.). From infants to the elderly, it affects people in all stages of life. In 2012, 16,688 people died as a result of homicide and 40,600 took their own life.*  Why wouldn't you want a government agency studying the risk factors of homicide/suicide/domestic violence, etc? I think it's an important area of study.   2) The study was performed on data that was artificially limited, in order to produce the pre-ordained result.  The study itself was limited in scope to a statistical study of the effect of gun ownership on the rate of in-home homicide, hence the data was limited to what was within the parameters of the study. The result is the result. 2+2=4; that's not pre-ordained, it just is.   3) The study was ordered for political reasons in order to support a position, rather than to determine accurate results.  Even if this were true, it's mostly irrelevant. If any study were politically ordered, it should signal that you should be extra careful in evaluating the results but it doesn't mean the results are invalid. What matters is whether the study itself was based on bad data or its methodology was flawed (e.g. the results were manipulated). Nobody has been able to show either of these. On the flipside, the criticism of the study is politically motivated. Does that make the criticism any less valid? Of course not, as long as the critiques have a basis in fact and are not merely unsupported opinion.   Even if you assume a political motivation, the results are still valid if the data was good and the methodology was good. There are numerous studies in front of regulatory boards and Congress that were funded by industry or special interests. The reason why firearms are the focus of this CDC study is because they are often purchased for protection and the researchers studied whether the risks statistically outweighed the benefits. Like anything else, decisions should be made with the totality of the body of evidence, not by any single study.   I read the entire reason.com article and didn't find any passage that actually tried to show that the CDC's data or methods were wrong or that it was "biased research." It may be because the article appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine after quite a bit of peer review. Your article did offer a lot of political verbiage (i.e. opinions) and cited other studies, which is fine, but it's hardly a scientific rebuttal.  It also criticized the CDC for not studying accidental deaths when it was outside the stated scope of the research. It's like criticising somebody for not test driving Ferraris when they're out shopping for a family car. That's just a silly criticism.     Then it would not be considered a risk factor. The definition of risk factor is any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or injury.   The study intentionally focused only identifying major risk factors for homocide. For this study, the scientists purposefully did not include events that were identified as suicides and accidental shootings.   "Self-funded" means that the money came from an internal general budget, not commissioned and paid for by an outside source. Senator Arlen Spector sponsored a bill that cut the CDC funding by exactly the amount spent on that study. The message was obviously a punitive one.            TIL something new! I never related sept oct nov dec to 7, 8, 9, 10.   Yes... the link jumps to the 99PI website.      It doesn't piss me off. It makes me question. It doesn't make you question?   No, these aren't man-made. These are time relationships. The point is that the relationship isn't even an integer.   A day is a single rotation of the Earth on its axis.  A year equals 365.25636... days.   Why would God make the ratio so strange? Why isn't it at least an exact integer? Why is it an irrational number?   And all those plays on Spotify earned him $1.27.      I agree, it's embarrassing. I turned on the TV and saw the pitch. WTF?? For an international??   USA back 4 is overdefending Mexico's forward passes but Mexico is not adjusting. They just don't want to play direct. Too bad. USA is defending Mexico's style very well with high pressure on the passer and tight marking, and Mexico doesn't want to change. Mexico's defense is subpar. That step to Bradley leading to the first goal was a poor decision. 82'...Now they are incredibly disorganized. I would be surprised if the back 7 were talking to each other at all right now.   Really just can't emphasize this point enough. Thanks for posting. It might be a generational thing as well. I have a 6 year old and I have to constantly remind the grandparents of this.   Where do you live? Fond du lac?   3rd instant regret is the bro left hanging.   I propose calling this Wisconsin Fondue.   Reposted to meet guidelines.      Thanks!   It's timely because the current web trend is "thin is in." I'm doing a fair amount of that but I am careful with the contrast. A lot of websites are using 70%-ish gray thin sans fonts for body copy and I struggle to read it.   I acknowledge your point though I also believe there are guidelines (or rules, whatever you want to call them) that help readability even when the mediums are different. On the web there aren't as many times when you have large amounts of body text so we can get away with using uniform sans fonts like Helvetica and Arial. The question is why when there are more readable sans fonts like Tahoma or Verdana or Unica?   You're not the only one bugged by use of title case in buttons but we might be the only two.   I agree for print but I agree with @jedrekk that many serif fonts don't look great on standard resolution monitors below 12pt. Agree that Georgia is an exception and it does indeed look good on the screen, much better than Times New Roman. I would love to see Georgia used more widely when there is a lot of body copy.   It can be stressful for many people to not be able to rely on a steady paycheck. I'm self-employed but it's definitely not for everybody. You have to spend a lot of (unpaid) time marketing yourself and looking for projects.      Your job, when you state a claim, is to back it up.   It was designed to be used in small amounts in headlines and advertisements when hot metal typesetting was being used. In small sizes its uniformity makes the text harder to read so it didn't translate well into phototypesetting (and by extension, desktop publishing and web design). Haas, the design house which produced Helvetica, designed a new typeface for phototypesetting called [Haas Unica.](http://www.mengelt-blauen.ch/Typefaces/HaasUnicaPrint.jpg) Unfortunately It was released at a time when phototypesetting was being obsoleted by desktop publishing and thus didn't get the attention it deserved.  Source [Wired.](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/legendary-redesign-helvetica-reborn-30-years/)   Good point.   You mistake stating disbelief for stating an argument. Here's an illustration:  Claimant:  "I am Superman."  Me:  "I don't believe you."  On whom should the burden of proof fall?   I didn't make any argument. I asked for the statistics that the commenter referred to when they wrote "statistically speaking...."   Show your statistics.   And in the days after 9/11 the only non-military airplane that the Bush administration allowed to take off carried Saudi passengers.   After 9/11 the U.S. should have invaded Saudi Arabia. But because the Saudi Royals are close friends of the Bushes, the U.S. invaded Iraq instead.   And she has what proof? This belongs in /r/thathappened   Not so easy for pants. My jeans and some slacks ride low on the hips. I have other pants that ride higher on the waist. They vary by 1-2" in size.   I like to rest my hands on boobs when spooning. Would that be off limits?   There is way more variation between professors at a school than between schools.  University is a very different environment than high school. You will meet fellow students who are driven and motivated and they will sort of pull you along (and you will pull them along). All the students are in the same boat, so to speak. Don't think that your high school friends are the only ones you will have. It's highly unlikely you'll still have close relationships with them by your 4th year, even if you go to UCSD. College is the time you all start going your own way.   PM me. Let's be friends.   I didn't mean that your efforts were meaningless. I thought it was a good exercise. I meant that the underlying data itself was meaningless.     	84

 The worst things is forced update whenever you are whatever you do   I'm sorry, dud - English is not my first language. My longer sentences could have unexpected results. Do you want me to translate this to plain English??  ;-)   to be honest  - don't start to believe in free lunch - Microsoft is  giving  this for free, not because they love us very much but if they not, they would stay by the empty the table with this wonderful software.   It's economy law  - you couldn't expect to take too much for a product above its cost and not loosing  your share of the market. This is how open source had happen.  Back to VSO - it's good but not quite Carling - just old Microsoft habit to be arrogance with making around UI. Tiles interface had it's go with win8 and failed - it's just like to change one day law and ask drivers to drive on the left hand side of the road (or opposite if you in UK). Seams to me new CEO understand why open source happened and this is really good even for open source  ;-)   Is anyone succeed to try this on?         It's perfect evidence for my conception "how is possibly to ride on two wheels" - by using handlebars for keeping balance - not just using gyroscopic effect. Everyone now how to do this but none knows how they do it. Similar situation to learning to walk - baby doesn't have any knowledge how to do a small walk but it have a hint by observing others people that it's possibly than by try and error  method gradually train neurons path to react accordingly  to situation.                    I closed the window when it open already 10th subpage and I don't want to go back there.    malicious website - it's open other windows and downloading many pages - have usage of cpu      Thx dud for your wishes if they are honest  :) I just warn, based on situation I had.  Did you learn about image optimization?   So, how much you got per post??  ;) Enough for entry fee?   how much you payed for it?   You sounds like walking ads for that, dud.  May you show us your nanodegree?                    	25
 So the USA can get the best trade deal possible, so we don't lose, even though this contradicts the claim that trade benefits all.    Basically, trade hopes to relocates the pollution to developing countries that would otherwise be polluted in developed countries, so we have time to "specialize", so we can combat pollution in our country and export methods to other countries to combat pollution. Then, we hope that those countries grow + combat pollution. Afterwards, the pollution that would have been polluted in the developing country moves to another country.   ^ free-market view of trade to promote anti-enviromental laws apparently    On drugs   Wooh there on the artwork geez lol   Yes because the money cards are still worth a lot.   No problem. It is basic economics, but I am still skepticial.    I think I'll keep him for another round, so it is differential from the other teams. Most teams already look very similar.    What are some midfielders that might gain in value over the next couple of rounds?   I am planning to rework my defense of Woodberry, Avila, Mears, and Burling. What are some good budget replacements? Is Avila going to be on the bench, since he hasn't started in the last two games?   More "competition", reduced prices of goods, specialization of sectors of economies, helping developing countries, and more exports for our businesses and more imports for our consumers (however if you export too little compared to amount to import, you run a trade deficit)   Are you a consumer or a blue collar worker? Are you a small business owner or a large corporation? Are you in a one industry town or a diversified economy city? Are you concerned about exporting more goods than importing or Do you want more imported goods than exported goods? Do you want just the USA to have the fruits of economic growth (protectionism) or do you want to grow other developing countries (expand trade)?    Kljestan! wow.... I transferred you out for Jorales. .   Konami might want to promote it, since it is a recent set with more support in Clash of Rebellion.   Ultra Rare Expressroids - This  Jetroid/Decoyroid/Gyroids maybe your best commons to pick up, since they are wind roid monsters, which matches the theme of speedroids.  Also, any generic anti-synchro cards or generic synchro support cards like tuners, synchrons, synchro monsters like Stardust Dragon, Plant synchros, synchro spells. synchro traps, etc because Konami will probably want the card game to coincide with the Arc-V storyline, where the characters are in the synchro dimension.   The set won't be out until October, so you still have over the summer to pick up the stuff.        Maybe {{Discord}} ?   Anti-Special Summoning of Synchros :O   Maybe, but not really, since Anti-Magic Arrows is anti-Supercharge.    To be honest, if you want a deck that might increase in value due to rise in strength, I recommend that you make Zefras, since it is the most recent set. BAs will probably get hit, so ya.   Roids need that training field field spell! But... It isn't released in the ocg   Arc v   When arch reaches fusion dimension, time to get those cards! :D   Basically any synchro related cards because konami might want to shift the meta from lots of xyzing to synchro summoning    Ultra rare expressroids   Woodberry. Why do I transfer him in at the wrong time? .   They pay the excise tax based on tax incidence.    Bernie is within the margin of error and above 30% in the polls, so a far cry from "unknown"   It is still early in the primaries.  The same could be applied to O-Malley and Chafee.    BACON! :D   HA! I like the scared dino in the bottom right.   LOL   It can be strange, funny, odd, stupid, or ridiculous.   So essentially, we want to counter cHina's growth, which was helped by our Permanent Normal Trade Relations with them, with another trade agreement. We are concerned about China's economic and political influence with a growing military power in the Pacific, yet we provided them with capacity to manufacture their might. it might be sound economics, but isn't this a bit strange?   I mean... Most people prefer social issues than economics to talk about.   Firebirds  United    Differentials went wrong lol   But it has to be secret so the U.S. Can get the best trade deal possible! We can't get a bad deal that will benefit the pacific nations like China. the point of TPP is to counter China's growth. :)    Ecomics isn't even fact when there are so many schools of thought on how to deal with deadweight loss on taxes, effects of the minimum wage, externalities, politics, etc   I wouldn't trust NH's polling, since it is an open primary. Republicans could just say that they will vote for Bernie and not actually support him.     It sounds better too   Clash of Rebellions and Dimension of Chaos will probably have the D/D/Ds   Firebirds?   Firebirds? CMON! The next "united" team will be Minnesota . if they come.    So conservative lawmakers in Louisiana want to raise taxes, which is against the values of Grover?  So... How do you balance the budget? Only cut spending by blaming Jindal for increases in spending?   So essentially what you are saying is that outsourcing the entire manufacturing sector overseas is a good idea?   So essentially trade deficits don't matter.  As long as import a lot to satisfy the consumer base and export at a rate less than import growth, then it is "good" for the economy.    We should outsource most or all of our manufacturing overseas. :)   Ya. Maybe he or she or it is in the passenger side?   True. DGW rounds haven't been so great this year :\   Took a -8  transfered out Kljestan due to red card for Jorales  Captained Jorales  Mears, Burling, and Woodberry didn't start.   Jorales - Red Card  Kljestan scores 11 points  I am DONE!   *flips table*   Mears is on the bench. Lol   Klejstan got a red card, so I would lean on Keane with a strong midfield with Zardes also there.   Don't forget that Philly loaned out Zac MacMath to the Colorado Rapids lol   If Trade policy =/=  address Trade Deficits, then what does? Internal demand for importing goals and supplying goods for export?   I am just presenting the other side's view in a sarcastic tone.    Do people really think TAA will pass in the House seperately?   Economics is a dismal science. It isn't always right or wrong or soemtimes unpredictable.    Because Trade Deficits DON'T MATTER! :D  The same people, who claim that Fiscal Deficits do matter, yet there might be link between trade and fiscal deficits.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_deficit_hypothesis  "The twin deficits hypothesis, also called the double deficit hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition that there is a strong link between a national economy's current account balance and its government budget balance"  Of course, the national deficit has been dropping while we continue trade deficits at the moment.    Don't forget. We are helping developing countries and reducing global poverty in an ever globalized economy. With specialization of each country, the USA should fully or mostly outsource its manufacturing industry and then we focus on high-tech/service jobs. As a matter of fact, every country should abolish all protectionist programs like subsidies, tariffs, immigration limits, quotas, etc to ensure an ever peaceful world. :D Even most economists and liberals say that immigrants don't take jobs away. In fact, they create more jobs.    TPP is good because we need to trade with countries with rules written by the EXPERTS, which are 90%+ of economists and big corporations. If 95% of scientists say that climate change is real, then economists must be right. Also, it is secret to ensure that we can get the best trade deal possible and don't lose. You know... Nobody loses in trade remember? (Comparative Advantage!) Also trade deficits don't matter because as long as consumers are happy with lower prices and we are exporting, then it is a win win situation. Cmon... Does anybody really want higher prices on goods and want a short run recession by blocking trade especially with the growing economies in the Pacific, which we already trade with? We will combat their growth with more trade with rules to hinder their growth, which they don't even know :D. Even Budget Deficits don't matter as long you invest in a country. You know... After World War 1, Germany had to export so many goods and consumer can't consumer as many goods with hyperinflation to repay its debt to the winners?   Trade Deficits don't matter! :)   free Trade is good! I got cheaper products! Wahoo! Trade deficits don't matter :)   Are you suggesting that Trade Deficits don't matter?   But Negative Impact on manufacturing, blue collar workers, Mexican Farmers/Big Agriculture, Land Owners in the Southwest with increased illegal immigration, Income Distribution, One Industry Cities, Drug Culture in the USA/Mexico with the easier ability to sell drugs, Trade Deficits.    "Who even plays Yu-Gi-Oh?" - says the guy talking to a person playing yugioh LOL      The stadium must be expandable because...... What if demand rises so much within the next 20 years? Do the Revs another stadium in 30 years?   I know most people are going to use the wildcard this week, but I don't really want to remodel my entire team, since I planned some beforehand. Can I take a -4, -8, or maybe -12 instead of the wildcard?   I bet the fusion will require just 2 monsters cards and be a stable fusion monster.   LA Galaxy not ring a bell?   Back when we had "classical liberals", the conservatives were the tories. LOL  So... Are Conservatives today's Tories? Of course not. The Liberals opposed British Traditionalism.    Would they oppose a society, where most people aren't in prisons?   Yes. Kljestan, who is another assist maker for BWP, is also on a red card.    Upstart Goblin   Shouldn't it be obvious? Mayors tend to be from big cities and cities don't vote Republican. However, it would have been a great opportunity for them to maybe try to get mayoral support for 2016.    I was well aware that this happened. lol   OUSTED gets so many points after I transferred him out during the unlimited transfers week....   And ppl predicted that Toia wouldn't be a good option since he got 1 points on fantasy at times.   Kljestan - red card.  Luke Moore - sub out and took a -4 on....  Avila not staring  :/   To be honest, everybody has weird obsessions. Some people spend so much money on clothes/shoes that they don't really need. Some spend money just attending sports games every week. Some spend on art collections. Etc   Roids   Sure. Bendik hasn't been starting for weeks.    Okay. I think it is time to start taking risks because other teams have over $121 million dollars of value. i am still below it. Thanks!      He could be a pro-trade economist or a person with an interest in exporting goods. Did you know the Liberal Democrat Party of UK supports the EU (free-trade zone) in the similar manner?    True, but it is a good testing ground because countries operate as countries. You could then argue that since "most developing countries have mandated healthcare system in some sort of manner", then the USA shouldn't follow it because x, y, z....  Like how Republicans say each states are "testing grounds" even though each state has a different economy.    We should lobby Congress to oppose any efforts to build modern roofing. :D  Liberals these days want to tax and spend and bankrupt the country with pork barrel spending. They should leave the job for us, the Private Sector!   So basically mostly Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union blocs with a couple of Middle Eastern and South American countries.   I would expect booming economic growth from these countries... Right?       It seems like the flat tax does appear to correlate in the state level with stable economic growth.    Not so much on the national level with with "eastern europe, sporadic nations and a bunch of micronations."    Weirdly, the Interstate Highway system would cost between 1/2 to 1 trillion dollars in today's money value.    Just wondering...What countries have a flat income tax like Rand's proposal?   In the mean time, we should build temporary roofing because it is cheaper and more economically efficient for the years to come. :)   Don't worry. if a recession happens due to a construction stoppage, it will be Obama's fault. :)   Jetroid maybe in the future for bluff lol   So probably in the October/November/December of 2015.    Because it has to be secret to ensure that the negotiations favor US trading interests, since we might get a bad trade deal with all those amendments from politicians from all 16+ countries that will expose the secerts inside, even though we know all trade lifts all boats. :)      I HIGHLY DOUBT that the House GOP will pass TAA separately, after TPP fast track has already been signed into law.   There is literally no incentive for them to do so. lol         Barbaroid with Poly?   SPEEDROIDS!   What is not to say that U.S. Also has currency manipulation and stealing of intellectual property of foreign countries?    How? If the U.S. Wanted to contain China, they should stop normal permanent trade relations with China? We helped China's rise and now we complain about it? Really?   When will politicians address the trade deficit? Each time America has agreed to a freetrade agreements our trade deficit always increases with imports rising faster than exports.   don't forget the growing us trade deficit    So... Trade Deficits don't matter right?    I still want to know whether TPP will reduce our trade deficit or do trade deficits don't matter according to some?   The USA engaged in trade, but was very protectionist until the Great Depression and World Wars throughout our industrial revolution.   Our Free-Trade agreements has increased our trade deficits throughout many decades. Should we continue to have negative trade deficits? According to many, "trade deficits don't matter." supposedly.   China has some protectionist tariffs on US made goods, while we have low tariffs on Chinese goods. I highly doubt any country such as India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, etc have 0% tariffs on our goods.   We subsidize our agriculture industry to the point that made Mexican agriculture nearly uncompetitive and caused many displaced workers to immigrate to America illegally.   Outsourcing and Automation has played a major part in the deindustrialization of one industry cities in the Midwest.   Overspecialization of certain economic sectors can be bad for any country, if something external happens. Remember: Alberta's Recent Oil Troubles, since US stopped buying as much of Canadian oil?   http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2011/06/30/why-us-companies-arent-so-american-anymore  How is it that we are worried about China's economic growth, yet we already engage in Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China? We are concerned about and have been aiding their growth, yet somehow TPP will somehow curb China's power according to John Boehner, Obama, etc?   How is TPP the most "progressive" trade deal for Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans in Congress? If TPP will make trade in level terms, then there isn't as much of a comparative advantage incentive, so..... How does that actually work?     	108

Obviously that didn't return anything, because it's "advertisements"...Sorry!                                              Long form look at a US business group's efforts to sell people cancer.

    "I wish a baby would."   What if it's just a female kitten who identifies as a male kitten? /s   Definitely seen some really good work from this artist.   Thanks for the vote of confidence that it will be an easy process! Where do I go for carpet? Home Depot?   Even then, I'll still just borrow the book from someone in a later session.   Hi guys  I'm used to eating rice, for every meal. Or some form of starch like potatoes.  However, I know that rice is high in calories, esp the amount I'm used to eating. Is there an alternative to rice that's lower in calories, that would fill me up along side my protein? I've started introducing more vegetables to my plate, but it's not the same.  Thanks!     The first is a tip that I got in a question I posed earlier this year.  1. Say "I'll eat it later." As the lovely commenter told me, later often doesn't come. However, in my mind, it's nice to know that I could eat it if I wanted to, but won't.  2. Brush your teeth after your meal. As we learned growing up, brushing your teeth is often equated with not eating for the next few hours.   Hope these little things help you on your journey!

If the prosecutor decides there wasn't enough evidence, what can my mom do to continue to persecute him.   Thanks for your reply. Can you answer this q: What exactly is happening when my mom pressed charges?    Yeah you did.   I read the meme before the title and was sure the title was going to say "My roommate wants to know why I sniff her yoga pants crotches."   *ducking   I shook my head as I closed this link. I guess that's a mark that your post is in the right place.    Wine, beer, fashion...?   Can you tell us how it is to have a duck as a pet?   I work in social media marketing and I've had very different experiences with Facebook ads. Facebook ads have tremendously helped my clients reach audiences they sought out to reach.  What it takes is extremely good targeting. Geo targeting, interests, demographics, etc. Though, I don't deny the claims the presenter makes, I think there is a way to be successful with them.      You rock. THANKS.   I don't think it's the oil because I just checked the status of the oil and I'm getting "OK."   Thank you for your response! If I'm reading it right, the oil says 2100 miles. Does that mean I'm 2100 over or have 2100 left or neither?   No prob Alex. However I realize I only sent one thing that was in my dash. Here are the rest and let me know if this changes anything.   http://imgur.com/a/arF2I http://imgur.com/a/pnnmK   BJ, great work in Saving Mr Banks.  My question is: What's your biggest advice for comedy writers aspiring to make it big? And how did the transition from behind the camera to on the camera happen for you?   So helpful for a noob. Thanks!   Alex, thank you so much! Can you tell me which picture told you that?   Hahaha, my buddy wanted to photo bomb. Thanks for the compliment.      Hi Hank!  What about The Simpsons do you think contributes to its unique longevity?  And how did your vocal talents play a role when you were growing up?   Usually, when I'm out of position with a decent hand like AK or mid-small pair and the flop comes something like J74r or even J44 (or in other words, a flop that I think could have missed us both), then I check.  If the villain makes a smallish bet, I will call. Then on the turn, if it helps me or not, I will bet, and 75% of the time, the villain will fold.   Thanks man!      I wish I had money to give you gold for this comment. Instead, I've screenshot it and sent it to my friends to have a laugh with me. Thanks.    I would just like to say "Fuck you" to imgur's little gallery thing on RES.   	41
             I'd love to work for a marketing company, but unfortunately I'm not.   Maybe. But I'm back anyway.   No.   I only post movie marketing material because I'm into movies, trailers and posters.   In my opinion, this is a stunning poster.   Not an ad, just my opinion.

    Like being weightless and in space isn't awesome enough we try to send them holo lens.    Thats my boy!   This is [him](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i5kdLvxIycU/UB6HsjiZQBI/AAAAAAAAAMg/_Bp9fkarvmg/s1600/dog+tv.gif) when you ask what hes up to.   I have the same sigelei . is that the 150w? I love mine. I use that case to. Feels good in the hands.   I found my Sasquatch hair on a fence. I had top scientists examine it n they said it was baby sas fur. Caught a [pic](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/4uz_sFueG80/0.jpg) of it too. Ether way ill take on your pubes any day. I barely need juice cause theres magic n shit in dat hair.   Don't get me wrong bro, polar bear fur chucks tits but my Sasquatch hair don't require boiling. Just got to pick out dem bugs n shit.   Proof that cats = up-votes. No title, low action, cat, 4010 fucking karma.   That's awesome. Nice job.  Edit: woah, somehow I stumbled upon this website that has the same location as your time laps. Did you take these as well? Also I thought Jupiter was the brighter star on the right side of the moon but thats actually Venus?    I live in Maine and had such a beautiful view. Half the sky was dark with stars the other was a sunset with a bright moon and Jupiter. I really wish I got a pic. Was it Jupiter that was on the right side of the moon? Im pretty sure it was, super bright. Is Venus on the upper left of the moon?    Apparently he has no reply to that. What a fucking dick. So if I spell something wrong that discredits my point? Debunk that fuck face.   Yea pretty much. Way to many questions. If you read it with a Indian accent it is very clear.   Man Im really sorry for your friends. I had to read the email a few times to catch the red flags. My first thought was aw his poor wife but Im glad I took a closer look.

It must be real cause who would make up a story like this!? It also says the word god a lot and I like that I must like and share to claim my prayer.   I saw an interview with one of the actors. They said that the box was originally just a joke but they kept bringing it up and it grew on them. But if their making another movie it will probably revolve around the box so the contents might not have been written yet.   I like your thought process! Those are all really good points. I bet it is a drug of some sort when you put it that way.   Hey thanks a lot. At first I thought it was something that condensed vapor clouds so rooms don't fill with fog. I didn't take much time looking into it and there wasn't much info on that site. Much appreciated!    That looks very time consuming.    Check out PLEX. It lets you stream any videos you have on your computer on your Roku. I use it and it doesn't slow your computer at all. I have an older computer and I would never be able to watch 2 videos at the same time. Also the app automatically adds the cover art of your videos and TV shows. Its really the closest thing I can think of that your looking for.   Finally a real friggin date.    wow. Thats an amazing picture. Thats all I have to say about that...   Curl your tongue so the tip of it is touching under your tongue and pull in to the back of your throat kind of pulse it so it pushing air out and bring it back to where it started. The whole time keep it curled. YOu dont even need breath when you do it this way but its all preference. Some people do one or the other or both together.   Do the lip curl thing for sure. I actually combine the tongue push with the cough to get a little more distants and consistency. Also it helps to kind of push out your lower jaw a bit until you find a sweet spot. Another trick is to look in a mirror and try to make a perfect O with your mouth then its all about the push out. But yeah, keep practicing.   I feel your rage. Personally I try to stay as far away as I can from people like this. You can't fill a cup that's already full...   Instead of balls it comes like a rope. So you just cut a piece off, split it in half and wick. Its so convenient. The package says Organic pharmaceutical cotton but its not as soft as normal organic cotton. I love what it says on the package... "hunted almost to extinction by crazed sub-ohmers, the elusive yeti is sought after for its fine absorbent fur."   I have a Sigelei 150w. Thing blows my mind. YOu can find them for under a 100 online. Thats my 2 cents. Have fun, be safe.   That looks pretty got for hand twisted. Nice job man. Never tried doing it by hand ive always used a drill. What are the pros/cons for hand twisting? IM just guessing more work?      cool man that's good to know. Im not in that band anymore but I still play everyday. alone or not. You still playing?   whos ohmeohmyke?   Dude that's awesome you were there. I had so much fun at that show. We did an awesome job but I remember people where getting antsy for streetlight towards the end of our set and was being dicks. Not cause of our music but cause they couldn't wait for streetlight.    No it was kinda an inside joke. In high school when we first got together we tried out a band name generator and Afghan banana stand was one of the results. We hated it but we would keep referencing it constantly so it stuck. Quick story time! We were writing lyrics one day that said something about pushing the principles car into traffic and got sent to his office. When he asked what our band name was our guitarist said Brazilian bikini tan as a joke and so he didn't know our real name which ended up becoming our album Afghan banana stand presents Brazilian bikini tan.   So if there going to premier it I assume shortly after that it might be coming out. Thank you for the info!   Before anyone asks the banana was our mascot way before the whole Banana for scale thing started.   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/fNHimyw.jpg?1) it is. Everyone loved our album cover haha   Fatty tweeted that its coming soon and there wrapping up production almost a year ago and I cant seem to find any info on it. They keep saying its coming but Ive yet to see any type of announcement or anything. Anyone know anything? I don't know about you but I CANT FUCKING WAIT!!!!      AzcStee saves the day!    That clears things up a bit. Thanks for your response. I have 2 married sets that Ill only use then. I'm deff glad I asked before I did some real damage. Ill keep my odd batteries for other things. Thanks again.      I actully found that [pic](http://i.imgur.com/5kUtlq8.jpg?2)   Im going to go watch season 8 again. Forgot how much I liked that season.   Actually I think this is a good idea. I think if your going to see a band live you should just enjoy the moment and listen to the music. You can fuckin tweet meaningless shit later.    That would be awesome. You mean kinda like people do with beer bottle caps? It wouldn't take a B M long to do this ether.  	46
             This is on the way up to the angel trail head on the south rim.    [Album]( http://imgur.com/a/5DLCr). It was a 24 mile rim to rim hike last week. The weather was actually really nice when I did it. It was my first time seeing the Grand Canyon and it was amazing.       For real doe            Yea exactly. And I had hulu for a while but like netflix more. The newer shows on hulu offset the commercials because it is cheaper than cable and the commercials are shorter. You have some control on commercials.   I get it when people complain about "paying for commercials" but hulu is the lesser evil between cable and itself. Assuming you dont also have cable.    /r/bootypetite   Yea she gives amazing head   Can I join?   Aww you caught me.    Best I can do https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Chew_%27Chewie%27_Chan      Reddit is a link aggregation site. The whole point started out as linking other people's stuff. The truth is that /u/gallowboob posts high quality and relevant content,  so what that he didnt create every single picture himself.    And he contributes a lot of shops on /r/photoshopbattles and /r/birdswitharms. He also posts sources for most gifs.   Yea he occasionally reposts, but for the most part its crossposts and original stuff. And he interacts with reddit and spreads content. I would honestly be less entertained by reddit if he and other linkers werent here.     Yea I havent had cable for years either. Too cheap/poor to buy it when I moved to my apartment at school.  And then after I moved out I was used to no tv. And splitting a netflix account costs me a couple bucks a months.    Chem to EE for me. As hard as the engineering circlejerk goes on reddit, some of the other majors are so much harder.    Two marijuanas!   Yeah, milk that reply trickle karma.     Wut   But dude this guy on chewyChan.org told me stuff and he sounded pretty sure.    So theres a chance?   Im so thankful that I can take so much shit for granted.    Typical kile   When you are to cheap to buy gold but want to show appreciation.    Dat kiss and hug doe   And actually its even more funny about the admin because the answer they gave was the exact instructions to change reddit's language. They just gave them in spanish.  It was the top comment too if I remember correctly.    Cada cuenta en reddit es un bot, excepto usted.   /u/alantha   /r/catslaps   http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2xg7rw/z/cozuctu  Its my second highest comment   I ran a candy business in middle school   Cant find the video that im thinking of, but he got a call from a telemarketer and set them up saying the account holder had to talk to him and it would come to the phone in a sec. He then muted him, and called a scammer. Told the scammer a similar story but gave the other guys name. Then said to both of them "ok here he is" and switched them onto each other.   They introduced each other and then talked about "the account" for a couple minutes before one was like "why are asking me all this" then the other guy was like "you called me." After a couple "nuh uh you"'s they fought and hung up.     I found one. https://youtu.be/021GfNuhrRY   There was a prank caller on youtube that would do this. He would call a scammer or telemarketer and set them up by saying sonething like yea let me get the owner for you. Then transfer them to each other.   I think tom mabe has done it and so has ownagepranks. I'll look up some videos in a sec.    All female orgy, suck 8 lips   HL3 confirmed   The toilet   No   Edward penishands   A Yoshi fucked my mom or something.  You're starting to bore me.     But its more exciting if you do.   Dude, I have never seen the last half of that movie until like a week ago. It is incredibly sad. :/   Is that "small"?   Isnt that the country that doesnt exist?   I always thought it was a a fake screen cap, I never knew there was a video and the troll went deeper.    I appreciate your appreciation   /r/catslaps for more cats being jerks   Bruh   just hire some undergrad English student to proofread.    Yea at the minimum wage of whatever country that kid works in?   And offering free stuff to do it or opening up the doors to anyone to edit it allows the possibility of vandalism. Think of wikipedia and how often it is vandalized. The power of wikipedia is that there are millions of users that quickly correct or revert things, usually within minutes or hours. What you are proposing doesnt have any checks in place.   Imagine if reddit wrote a manual. We would add a bunch of inside jokes and easter eggs and trolls and how would the manufacturers know? They already suck at english as you said, so how would they know to correct vandalism.    The general idea is you bring in something valuable and they hold it for you to let you borrow money.  After some time you can come back and "buy" your thing back for what they borrowed plus some fee. Normally people want their shit back and pay. That is a self supporting business model if everyone came to get their shit back.  But when people dont get their shit back because they can't afford it or dont want it, then the shop will sell it. Usually at enough of a markup to regain the loan money, fees, and price of storage. Yea its not a lot of profit they make, but it is enough that there are so many pawn shops springing up. The other way is that the person will explicitly say they dont want it back, then the shop will buy it for less in an attempt to maximize potential profits.   What you have to realize is that once they have a shop, storing one extra piece isnt all that much more cost. Once they are able to cover rent/mortgage costs, they can store as much as will fit in the shop without extra cost.   Documentation. Yea I know its necessary and sharing your ideas and work is super important and required and all, but its just so boring.    Prolly cuz she hasnt wiped in a month.    Mmm, cheese on hotdogs   And some of them are young... seriously, who likes old coke.   She seems like a jerk   Yea and when the dog finally gets to the bathroom he licks his owner clean.    the one I had in middle school only showed us pics of stds and said we would get that if we played with each other.   You get the cunnilingus briefing in the highschool sex ed talk with megan under the bleachers at a football game.    But for a breif instant, one was capable of placing said cheese on the animal in question. The actions that the animal took did not deter from the act of placing cheese, only the amount of time the cheese remained after being successfully placed. Therefore we must invalidate your answer and it remains that "nothing" is the correct reply.   Srly, cheese is good yo.    But, tits are always good.   Because jb's sensitivities got butthurt.    oh. I wasnt.    Yea thats slightly different too   You'll remember this once in a lifetime experience forever!   It was over the top horrible that it was actually ok. I think the first one was trying to go for that, they just never admitted it.    "Nah but like if you smile more you will eventually be happy. Just fakr it until you make it, ya know?"   Taylor swift?   They transport and provide some basic care of they are capable with the equipment they have.    Nuggers?   Frictionqt   Yumm   Yea, the swiss might be able to do something. But normal people that watch games and support them could do the most by educating themselfes on what is actually happening.    Slightly different   When I got to sea I assumed quay was pronounced qwee and had to go back and re read that block correctly.    Yea we need time for porn too   Except doing something I dont understand immediately so it makes me uncomfortable and well, goddamn this is america and we cant have that.    Some say it made his hole weak, wait..  Wrong joke.    Yea yea, everyone sucks at driving but you, another sentiment reddit shares.    Thanks man, you too :)   Im not taking anything away from you, im just stating what our machine intellegence can reliably do at this point in time.  If you are so insecure you think any ol reddit comment is a personal attack on your driving ability then IDK what to tell you bud.    None. The human aspect messes it up. But being such a human thing, we need to make the best of it and try to change our governments for the good in the best ways we are able.   Every form of government works with the right checks and controls, with the right people,  and in the right time.   There is no "best" government, not because they are all bad, but because they are all good in the right circumstance.   We can find perfect governments on paper that fail in real life and we can find terrible things on paper that work in real life. And of course, we can find anecdotes that support either cause. Socialism can work in real life the same way that capitalistic democracies can fail in real life. Humans are too unpredictable to choose a "best" government and so each instantiation of each form of government should be treated individually as its own case, not with these blanket statements.   Theres a reason this is its own (large) field of study. It wouldnt be if it really could be summed up in a single reddit rant.    Is this ladybugging you?    Im covered in bees!   My motivation is to do better than my parents and make them proud of me. They are both immigrants and struggled to raise my sister and I. I want to take advantage of all the opportunities I have and all the work they have already done for me so that I can be in a position to help them when it comes time for that. I want to finish college and get a good job so that I can get things they never had and share with them. my motivition is to thank them wity more than words.    Just like reddit!   The movie Click   Dude BC ftw   I'm covered in bees!   Well there mr grumpy pants, not with that attitude. Now put on your happy pants and lets tinkle!   Except for the farts      I have dabbled there.   Dat wiggle doe, still made my day.       Oh I see it now,  I'll try that next time.    But who was the first pic?   Not completely,  a lot of driving is predictable paths in good conditions. Rain and snow and unpredictability of other humans is what robots have trouble with, and that isnt all of driving.    Isnt that ben heck? His channel is random gaming stuff right?   /r/onetruegod   Dat asian lady cant make up her mind doe   Oh, I didnt know that.    Your body plays with legos. And it has a set of plans for legos called dna. Well, every now and then it will rebuild a part of you to keep you up to date. But sometimes it accidentally copies something wrong. Scientists call that a mutation. Sometimes that mutation will grow uncontrollably and do some nasty stuff like take resources fron the good cells.   This does really bad things to your body.   Thats the best eli5 I got and disclaimer that I am not a scientist.    Mmm, metroid larva.       What my sister and I did was we made fake notes and they had the other's phone number as the office's number. So when I would get a call, I would oretend to be Dr. Ramos's assistant and go through our records and then confirm that, yes, indeed /u/test_subject2027's sister was here yesterday.

 Amid the celebration and controversy of the release of the long dormant Go Set a Watchman, it seems fitting to pay tribute again to Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man  a masterwork, that with To Kill a Mockingbird, form bookends to a shelf of American literature. Like Harper Lee, Ralph Ellison was a child of the American South, though he observed from the opposite side of our racial chasm. In parallel with Lee, Ellison found a well-deserved critical acclaim with a first published novel, and then turned away from writing fiction  like her, he might have consumed too much of himself in creating a masterpiece. Only with his death did his estate published a version of his second, unfinished novel, to meet with a doubtful reception. I found Invisible Man as pristine, paperback edition, for sale at my local library. Having seen it included on the lists of essential novels, I obtained it for the suggested donation of a dollar. It has proved a revelation. It is personal but universal testament of how petty ambition and cynical, political expediency can corrupt any noble cause. Ellisons well-turned prose spans from lyrical, bucolic scenes to lurid episodes that seem lifted from gothic horror. While I cannot speak for the Black American experience, I found that its sharply drawn characters and plot turns still resonate into these troubled times, more than two generations after its publication. Does anyone wish to share impressions of this great novel?       Saudi Arabia also burns oil for electrical generation. They have drained their aquifers empty for such vanity projects as growing wheat in the desert. Maintaining production in their aging oil fields now requires a massive injection of water, to tease oil from the source rock. Does anyone with a petroleum back ground know the source of this water? Is it saltwater or fresh?     Or, they move only to survive. Some were driven from the farm by Malthusian pressure. Some were coerced outright, by eviction from their smallholdings by landlords, who could put the land to a more profitable use -- the Enclosure movement in Britain, for example. Market forces drove a lot of people to the factories, as mechanization undermined the handcrafts and traditional farming. Consider the steady disappearance of the family farm or union worker in this country, or the fate of the owner of a taxi medallion with the appearance of Uber. While the historical trajectory of capitalism has been to greatly increase the stock of goods in the aggregate, whole sectors of the population have often suffered sharply diminished returns. Of course, that is what civilization has always been -- a constant class struggle bumping along a Malthusian path. A more equitable society may not be possible, but we should not idealize the process.       Yes, a perpetual expansion into space seems to be the only alternative to entropic collapse, whether for human or robot. It is of interest that Ray Kurzweil believes that we must be the only (or at least, the most advanced) intelligence in this galaxy. He reasons that if an equivalent intelligence arose anywhere else in the past few million years, it would have evolved its own Singularity, and this technology would have already filled the galaxy. He does not consider the opposing possibility -- that the appearance of a Singularity always destroys its host, and for this reason, we seem to be alone.   The first problem is defining fascism. It is applied to a spectrum of disorders, from ultra-conservative radicals like Franco to the explicitly revolutionary, of which the Nazis were the prime example. They certainly were not conservatives, in any conception of the term. True, the Fascists rose in response to the failure of capitalism, but while vulgar Marxist analysis consider the Nazis to be the mere handmaidens of capitalists, recent scholarship is placing them in fundamental opposition to it. Under their regime, private ownership of capital was only nominal and retained as an expediency. It is certainly a greater canard to compare the Fascists with the non-communist Left, as a central tenet of those movements is toward a universal equality. My view is that the true political form of capitalism is liberalism -- the rule of law protecting individuals pursuits in a free market -- and this is incompatible with goals of Fascism.   The best formulation of Fascism is as neither Left or Right. The concept of a political party organized on military lines followed the Bolshevik model. As with the Communists, extreme violence was its ultimate political method, but the Fascists tolerated capitalists (and aristocrats) to the extent they were useful to their nationalist aims. The Nazis created an impressive welfare state to win the loyalty of the population, with class conflict rejected in favor of racial theory -- this became the basis for both social equality and exclusion. While National Socialism was in many ways unique, it is important to remember that its goals were not dissimilar from some of its capitalist, liberal contemporaries -- what Belgium did in the Congo, Nazis sought to accomplish in Eastern Europe,  	7
 It went well actually. The doc wasn't a psychiatrist or anything but she referred me to a psychiatrist and a psychologist she recommends. I think the anticipation with that sort of thing is way worse than when your actually with them. However, because it was only a GP, I didn't go into much detail about the anxiety, I just told her about it in general. So I feel more nervous about the psychiatrist and psychologist :O   Oh no :( what happened at yours?    Sitting in waiting room. I'm scared for what to say, how to sum up how I've been feeling for the last few years in a 15 minute appointment :/    "Don't let perfection destroy the good". I sometimes have to tell myself this. I might be on the verge of giving something up because I know it won't or can't be perfect. This is wrong. You can't let the idea of perfection stop you from doing any good just because it isn't perfect. If you always thought like this, you would never get anything done or make any progress.   Yeah I'd like to read The Dark Tower series. I'm put off by how long it is though. I mean it's almost impossible to write a series that long and not have it drop off in quality at some point. Is this true or is the whole series good?   Oh boy was that a good book. Laws yes. A few points I'd like to make:  1. Character development was absolutely phenomenal. I read the uncut edition so I don't actually know how much was added in but I felt the character development, especially in characters like Stu and Larry was fantastic.   2. The bits towards the end with Tom and Stu literally had me tearing up. The Christmas day singing :'(. By that point I realised my heart was just invested in these characters.   3. Once the mystery of the dark man was lost I felt like the story kinda lost something. It's like in Lost, once the mystery of the Island gets figured out, it's no longer that spooky which is why I'd say season 1 is the best. In The Stand, Randall Flagg only really stays spooky until he becomes an actual antagonist. When King starts writing in his perspective, although it does give us a lot more insight and story in the west, I feel like it detracted from the kinda mystery elements of the dark man.   4. Ending was kinda predictable but thats not necessarily a bad thing. However I didn't like how the nuke exploded.   Overall though I loved this book for character development alone. It's so bloody long that when characters die it literally is like "holy shit". That was the first King book I read, where do I go from here? :)   This is really nice thanks for posting :)    Thanks so much for the effort you put in to respond. It's really nice knowing that there's other people dealing with the same shit. I really agree with your point on honesty being key and I've always wanted to tell my family completely honestly what I'm going through. They know about the anxiety part but I've never explained the root of the anxiety as obviously it's a lot more embarrassing. How do you think I could tackle this problem?    So this is a long story and it might be a long post but I need to talk about it.   Okay, so I am a young dude, 19 years old. Last August I was in Amsterdam and on a drunk night out I ended up having protected sex with a prostitute. The next day I literally felt unbearably ashamed and scared for my life. I was terrified I had contracted HIV from a silly mistake I made when drunk. I started fixating on symptoms and around a month later I had a really bad fever, a classic symptom of the disease. After the three month window period for hiv to show up in your blood stream I immediately got tested. Just before Christmas my results came back and I was so relieved.   Soon later at a new year party for 2015, I got blackout drunk and ended up wondering the street. I hardly remember anything except trying to talk to girls and people on the street. The next day I woke up and got the strange feeling that the night before I had made an active decision to infect myself and asked someone to inject me with it or something. Despite it being irrational and completely ridiculous, I just had this feeling of dread like i made an awful decision to infect myself. Another 3 or 4 months passed and I had developed a white tongue with a red patch towards the back, I googled it and it was another symptom of hiv. I got tested and was convinced that I was gonna die.   But before my results arrived through text message I went travelling to Thailand with my friend, the beginning of the trip was absolutely awful as I was completely convinced I had the disease. On another drunken night in Bangkok I decided to visit a massage parlour with the obvious intention of receiving a handjob. The driver of my cab ended up taking me to a brothel and I thought fuck it. I've had a terrible night and all I want is a handjob not sex. So I went into a room with the girl and she told me to use a condom and I told her this was unnecessary because I didn't want sex. She kinda just got naked and rubbed herself on me giving me a kinda body massage and then ending the session with the handjob. The next day I didn't think much of it. I told myself that I only received a handjob and you can't get hiv from that. A few days later I got my text message from my previous std text and it said I was negative for everything. I felt absolutely incredible and started crying. I actually was fine despite convincing myself I was infected. This feeling lasted about 2 days before I started remembering and fixating on the night with the prostitute in Thailand. This girl was high risk and I remembered that at one point in the massage she tried to give me oral sex, I remember quickly grabbing her head and lifted it up but I'm pretty sure her mouth might have touched the head of my penis. I started googling symptoms again and saw rash, fever etc.... About 2 weeks later I started convincing myself I was gonna get a rash, I stared at my arms all the time and convinced myself I had rashes. Then I took off my shirt to change t shirt and funnily enough there was a rash on my chest, this is a common place for people to get rashes after hiv infection. I pretty much accepted that I had it and my life was over. I ran home and lay in bed all night trying to stop a panic attack, the next day I woke up and the rash was gone. I was so happy because hiv rashes usually last longer. So I was kinda feeling okay for a bit but still worrying about it all the time. Two weeks later I got huge glands and a sore throat, more symptoms of hiv. It made me incredibly depressed and it lasted around 5 days. Since then it has been another 2 weeks and I have kept telling myself " at least I never got a fever, that's the most common symptom". And now for about 2 days I've developed large painful glands again and am getting shivery and hot at night. I told myself it's because I've been drinking and partying too often recently but I'm not sure.   I've never felt so bad and ashamed in my life. I don't know why I put myself in situations related to my worst fear but what's happened has happened. I just feel like I will be a tragedy no matter what. I will upset my family and end up terminally ill or something. These are literally my worst fears and I just wanted to write them down, I would be surprised if anyone reads this but if you did, thanks and I hope you have a great day! :)    http://i.imgur.com/aVEeelz.png   You gotta start practicing again. Do small things but most importantly just stop giving a shit what people think of you or whether they will think of you negatively. Say what you want. Be who you wanna be and if thats someone who is brave then do it.   	11
 Did she buy her paper towels in a cardboard box? Where is Barbie living nowadays, Canada?   or a teen girl switches bodies with a gorilla at the zoo   You look like Amy Lee's lost sister. Don't change a thing. You're beautiful just the way you are.    My only criticism is, i would make the 4 parts on the outside come out a little smoother. They seem to stop rather abruptly.   You don't believe which exists? Rape or performance anxiety?   Why are you asking?   Yes. There are other ways men are forced into intercourse, outside of the use of drugs.   Well, that is what I just said. To my knowledge, yes. However, the person ingesting the drugs should be aware of what they are introducing into their body, and the effects it will have.   With the use of drugs, yes. However I am not a doctor, nor do I recommend the use of such drugs against the users will.    You're making a generalization that every man is the same. Which is completely untrue. Most cases of rape where the victim is a male involve drugs, where blood is rushed to the penis, causing it to become erect, regardless of their mental state.  	10

My paraphrasing of his CEFC ideals comes from this:  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-13/pm-defends-decision-to-axe-wind-solar-from-cefc-spending/6615372   Hello darkness, my old friend   This photo is also posted as public domain on DVIDS.  It has been cleared for release by the DoD.      Potentially, but honestly, not in my experience in *recent* years.  Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon can fight quite well for their stream and maintain HD if they have enough room in the channel.  Something as tight as what I was replying to though, would likely not work.  As an example, with my 20m downstream, I dont have to throttle my torrenting if I have a single HD stream going.  YMMV.      How can she flip?!   context dude.  continue reading from right were you stopped your copypasta.   Iit isn't a new concept.  Consider the TOW missile; now think of it in the water.  They have had these (air and water, wired-guided missiles/torpedos) for decades.   Thats not gonna work for OPs desire to stream and download simultaneously.  Unthrottled torrenting will kill an HD stream at that speed.   What he is really referring to is latency.  A wireless connection will almost always have greater latency.  Latency can hurt the quality of streaming services.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtI1pWkHto0   /r/theydidthetrimestermath   Nothing did.  It was never necessary.

You do not have a valid excuse for not paying attention to your speed and braking accordingly.  You have admitted as much.  Sorry.  edit: spelling   I have no substantiated idea.  That said, my belief leans toward food processing and/or pesticides.  "Organic" food definitely gives me less, if no, noticeable/quantifiable reactions.  What has been a recurring indicator for this, in my experience, is nuts, seeds, and seeded fruits.  If I buy cheap stuff I likely will have allergic reaction that turns into acne.  If I buy better (i.e. organic) stuff, its much less likely to happen - if at all.  My food allergy is tied with acne breakouts, so I can see/feel/itch direct correlations between these things when I eat them.  I will itch within hours, and breakouts will follow.  I really cannot say how this compares to others.   Whenever I see these (OP's) posts, I want to respond with the same schpiel, but I dont want to be a Debbie-downer.  But you are absolutely right, and I hope OP knows the drill.   That's not true to the modern definition of the word, which broadens the scope to almost any controlling body/organization that can limit the dissemination of materials to the masses.   I'm referring specifically to childporn, which boggles my mind as to why it repeatedly comes up in censorship-related discussion.   I would agree that diet influences acne.  I first noticed this ~20 years ago when I started to travel for work.  I have observed the following over the years:  1. Food in the US gives me more acne problems than any other country. 2. Food from grocery stores in major cities gives me more acne problems. Smaller rural/self-sufficient farming areas give me less acne problems for the same kinds of foods I would eat in an urban/industrial environment.  I stand by the assertion that its food, and not pollution, because I know (have been tested) my acne is food-allergy driven.   Stain-less.  Not stain-proof.   is it censorship when you block things that are outright illegal?    I get knocked down    the missing audio:  https://soundcloud.com/bamahamma/pink-fluffy-unicorns-dancing    Everybody wants to nuke the world    I drove across it once on the I-8, and I would say that a majority of it (the 8) was spacious.

I mean, lots of cool posts - but they are getting more and more off-topic for this sub.   Jesus is ~~his co-pilot~~ riding bitch   In my experience, CA freeways have larger lanes than other municipalities.  At least it feels that way to me.  Source:  I am a CA resident that has live in 4 other states, and driven across the country multiple times.  To me, California freeways are amazing.  However, I disagree with you that just because it feels better than what you are used to - that makes it safe.   Re-read what you just said, while recalling the contents of the video.  If he was on the shoulder, the cop would have cited him for it.  The rider said that he was in the lane; which in this context of a motorcycle passing cars is called "lane-splitting".  Watching for motorcycles on your right is more dangerous than on your left, as a vehicle passenger-side mirror (typically) makes the image smaller.  A motorcycle is difficult enough to distinguish in heavy traffic.  To answer your question, AFAIK the motorcycle would be at fault.  Lane-splitting isn't technically "legal".  Its just something that CHP turns a blind-eye to.  But they do not declare it as a legal/valid thing for motorcycles to do, and so it does not have any right-of-way privs, etc.   What, a midget can't own a mini-coffee stand?!   it has a beat you can dance to   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2WZrxuwDhs   /r/ImageStabilization    I see your point, *kinda*.

Wikipedia offers this expanded [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincea%C3%B1era):   Quinceaera (pronounced: [knsee]; feminine form of "fifteen-year-old"), also called fiesta de quince aos, fiesta de quinceaera, quince aos or simply quince, is the celebration of a girl's fifteenth birthday in parts of Latin America and elsewhere in communities of people from Latin America. This birthday is celebrated differently from any other as it marks the transition from childhood to young womanhood. Latin myths and tradition tell about how girls were prepared to be married by the age of fifteen; in the years prior to their fifteenth birthdays, girls were taught to cook, weave, and about child rearing by the elder women in their communities in preparation for their lives as married women. Although it is agreed that the traditions of quinceaeras originated in ancient Aztec culture, the celebrations today vary significantly across countries; celebrations in some countries, for example, have taken on more religious overtones than in others.

 I think it's a part of the VIET events thing. I know it's part of HIP, I've gotten it before while playing it, but it must also be a part of Lux Invicta, as that's what OP's playing.   Man, I'm very engrossed in this so far, how long do you think it'll take for the next chapter? Sorry, I just need my fix o_o   thank mr skeltal   I actually like this band, but goddammit if they don't go over-cringe sometimes   Nothing makes any sence here      I honestly think you'd have to TRY to get it these days.   How the fuck did he get Bonzi Buddy? That thing's been extinct since like, the 2000's   Doesn't make sexist jokes  Men are garbage  Huh.   Not sure if Africa, or Detroit.   Because it's "empowering"   Am I the only one who thinks this might not be weird? Probably is going to something they can't declare as part of their expenditures (Area 51).   I've made about 20$ so far and I've been on for 3 days. I believe the most I've made is 7$ on my second day.   Link?   [Here you go](http://np.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/3ab42e/wtf_is_this_shit/?ref=share ref_source=link)   they were making fun of it in the original thread      Because it's an extremely deep RPG with 100's of hours of gameplay. And with the DLC it's even better. Its also got many memorable characters and a very interesting story.   ...With his horrible smell.   Sorry I can't help you, but I'd like to point out this is the first post here in over 5 month. This sub seems kinda dead :\   This pretty much sums up anything I'd try to say. The problems I'm experiencing (and apparently the rest of the community is too) are so ubiquitous that I'd have to open 100's of tickets and most of those wouldn't result in me getting what I was supposed to.   Time for some good old fashioned extermination of natives! :D    Medieval people actually had a pretty good idea of what the world looked like (except for America and the Pacific) so the only new stuff you'd show them is stuff you wouldn't be able to back up. (Many people claimed there were America-like continents west of Europe)   For simplicity's sake let's assume they can understand your modern language and have a basic knowledge of mathematics (elementary school level)      Would you mind explaining to me what the ticker is? I don't get it :\   Interesting. I just checked out instantGC and it seem way more legit. I just cashed out of swag bucks (with a cool 20$) and I think I'm gonna move myself over there.   Do you think it's worth it to just stop doing the offers and only use the more passive feature/surveys?   For some reason, despite the fact I do tons of offers (I'd estimate If I actually got all the Swagbucks they said I would get then I'd have something like 2000 more swag bucks), none of them seem to actually give me swagbucks. For instance, I go to the offers page click on something that says (roughly) "Sign up for X brand gift card!" - 50 SB. I follow the link, signup for the card and provide all my information, and then do a ton of surveys before getting to the end, checking my balance and 90% not seeing it change. Is there a reason? Is anyone else experiencing this? Sorry if this is kinda ranty but it really frustrates me.   They said it should be on the app store as soon as the conference is over (right now). Sadly no Android :(   Yep, sucks for us android users :\   I'm sorry, I understand the pain.   DAMN STRAIGHT   Yep      Maybe an event that fires a hundred or so years after the  initial invasion where the Inca go to war with the Aztec's over in the Americas, this diverts a large amount of European levies to America and allows for European countries to strike back and regain lost ground. (Basically it just nukes their levies for a few years) This could occur repeatedly until the Aztec are knocked all the way out of Europe.   I don't think we'd have to worry about the Canadians. They use paintball guns.   Sadly this isn't illegal as it isn't real people, and only has *drawn* depictions of minors. Should really still be illegal though.   [BANNED]      It's never going to end. Perhaps the fats may have won today. But remember, my fit brothers and sisters, WE'LL AT LEAST LIVE A HELLUVA LONGER THAN THE HAMS.  	41
 Springsteen live is the best thing I've ever seen, and I've seen some amazing shows. I keep talking him up haha.   At least not Bud Black.   He's not as quick as Kemba at all, but Jerian has a chance to be a really nice player   "The data generally suggests the role of clutch hitting is limited if it exists at all" did you read that part? Certainly seems to be at least strongly hinting that clutch isn't a thing.  The one quote that I think says what you're saying it says is the second one. Which I've agreed with this whole time. I'm more than willing to believe in clutch, if the evidence is there. I'd even like to believe in clutch. But thus far, the evidence has suggested that there is no consistent trend of clutchness even within a season, much less over multiple seasons. See the studies that were cited at the beginning of the article.  The reason they are saying there is no such thing as a clutch hitter is because it is nigh upon impossible to definitively prove that something does not exist. They have not proved that there is no such thing as clutch, but they certainly haven't proven that it does exist.  Which doesn't really square with your final point, that "there's no way [I] can't tell [you] guys like Jeter or Arod haven't been consistently clutch throughout their careers". That's exactly what I'm saying. Those guys haven't been consistently clutch throughout their careers. Their performances in high-leverage situations are within the expected variances from their career averages in all situations.   It says what I told you it says haha, that there is no convincing evidence for clutchness. Show me a quote, within the context of the article, that shows evidence for clutch being a thing.   I did, as soon as you replied, because I was flabbergasted. It does not say that.   Where are you getting that from the article? Dude that is some serious selective reading.   I'm being pedantic? You have given literally zero evidence that such a phenomenon exists, other than cherrypicked anecdotes...which I suppose puts you on the cutting edge of clutch apologists, so congrats on that.  If you just haven't read the stuff, by all means, here's a good place to start: http://www.fangraphs.com/library/considering-high-leverage-performance-and-clutch-hitting/  But, I can't convince you of anything if you're not willing to be convinced.   Hitting with RISP in general is a crapshoot. Where is the evidence, other than anecdotal, that those guys come up time and time again, in a statistically relevant sample size?   Okay, well I suppose you believe in clutch then. Show me some evidence of that and I'll be happy to admit I'm wrong. Until then, I'm gonna go with the body of evidence that shows that clutch doesn't exist.   No one is stepping into this pit of vipers.   Aaaaand it's done. https://twitter.com/Alden_Gonzalez/status/616319064818847744   Fuck everything.   Hahaha nailed it   I'm trying to decide right now if La Jolla is Fantasyland or Tomorrowland.   Yeah that's what I mean by don't disbelieve. Just because the info can't be verified on an anonymous internet forum doesn't mean it's not accurate. Like you said, stuff does break on here every so often. Just like my heart right now.   Agreed with everything you said until bulldozed in the playoffs. We lost 2 games in extras, and went 1 for 22 with RISP for the series. That's staggeringly unlucky, and it's confirmation bias at its finest to say we got whooped.   If you want to see the scene with all the drunk pirates from the end of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, just come join us in PB! (I live in SD too)   Technically true, but don't do it while you're driving lol   You should probably be taking the 5 to Disneyland anyway, from which you can't see the Big A.  The price of this advice will be you never starting Sonny Gray against us again.   ELI5 Scioscia and DiPoto disagree with how the team should be run. Scoiscia is old school, DiPoto is new school, and DiPoto can't get any of the coaches to listen to his scouting reports, so he resigned.   I don't believe you, but I don't disbelieve you either if that makes sense. Just foolish to trust the internet. I'm on pins and needles here   It's Chris Sale   Can you provide a source on that?   Orioles   I said almost dammit   I don't think it's nearly the knockout blow you were hoping for haha. Where it screws us is down the road, constructing the roster going forward. This team, as currently constructed, still has a chance to be pretty good.   I think the ideal is that they find a way to keep working together. But if that's what it takes, then yeah, keep JeDi and get rid of Scioscia.   He got traded because Sosh didn't like his defense behind the plate. So he went to Toronto with Juan Rivera for Vernon Wells...yeah that worked out great. And we started Jeff Mathis behind the dish instead.   If Arte can pull this off I will almost forgive him for everything else   Because we liked him and Sosh traded him and ever since then he's killed us every time we play him so yeah.    he'll throw that speedball by ya, make you look like a fool, boy  That made me grin real big   No no no no no no no no no no no   Yes. So Baldoquin better be good.   Seriously, this trade was a steal as soon as it was made. Two young pitchers with upside and years of team control remaining for an outfielder whose career OBP was under .300 at the time of the deal, and has only one plus tool (power). It's only going to look better as time goes on.  For a nice evaluation of Trumbo currently, look at the return the Dbacks got for him from Seattle. He went over with Vidal Nuno (a decently-high-upside long reliever), and back came Welington Castillo (a catcher who had only gotten 25 ABs), Dominic Leone (a relief pitcher who was good last year but had an ERA over 6 for Seattle), and two minor leaguers who project as a maybe-everyday-player and a utility player.  Would you trade Santiago and Skaggs for a backup catcher with no bat, a struggling reliever, and two decent AA guys? I hope not. We killed it in this trade.   Pirates   I don't know, the way we handled Josh's situation made me think about it.   There's people in the college game who we look at as physical monsters, who are able to assert absolute physical dominance at the college level, simply because they are upperclassmen who are grown ass men now. Not very many of these guys make an impact in the NBA; much of their effectiveness in college is in their physicality.  Now take someone who's actually good enough to be in the NBA, and is a contributor, and on top of that is fully mature physically, and works out for a living.  95% of NBA starters would be able to drag an awful team to the tournament. If they land on a team like Seattle or Florida Gulf Coast, as was suggested, they'd be in title contention. I love college hoops, but there's some serious overestimation of the college game in here right now.   No opinion about it, that's a fact. He could absolutely do it, and he'd be likely to.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/07/17/nationals-anthony-rendon-i-dont-watch-baseball-its-too-long-and-boring/   Yeah this isn't discrimination, I thought we were operating from that assumption already...kk enjoy the feel of tin foil on your scalp!   I think you're digging a little hard to find so-called examples of discrimination against males.  We live in a society that systemically favors men over women, dude. A lot of people couch this distinction in terms that makes it seem like you have no struggles because you're male, which is wrong.  But what is true is that there are a set of challenges you will never have to face or even potentially face, because you are a man and not a woman. That's what privilege is.   Angels   Let's go Shoe! Keep the ball down and you'll be golden   Sosh was a catcher as a player, and a very good one defensively. He's always had really high standards for catcher defense, and is unlikely to play a guy who's good offensively but mediocre defensively. Nap was a great offensive catcher, but not a strong defender, so Sosh always hesitated to give him too much playing time. That's why we dealt him, and he's bit us in the ass at every turn since.   It also helps that the bullpen threw 7 innings against us the day before, so he'd absolutely love to get a day of rest for them. But it still shows faith for sure   Bode Miller, skier at the Olympics. Yeah that was so bad, because it was apparent that the reporter was gonna badger him until she got a reaction. That made me feel so so bad for him.  EDIT Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIn3_g6sozM   I mean he was hurt, but yeah you're technically not wrong.   They left because while another year wouldn't have hurt them, it also wasn't going to help them. They wanted to start making money playing basketball, and staying in college wasn't going to improve their draft stock; if anything it was going to hurt it, what with them being another year older. I'm never gonna fault a guy for wanting to get paid to play.    My guess is they worked something out with him beforehand to pay him less than the minimum first round contract, a la Josh Huestis with OKC last year. Lot of teams hate having end of the first round picks, cuz they're guaranteed millions but the quality of player isn't as high, so they try to work around it.  I don't like it, but I'd be surprised if this was anything else.   I don't think enough people understand how much money the military pumps into sports. It's an effective way for them to recruit, because they can tap into the machisimo and team-first attitudes of fandom. But it really is troubling to watch them co-opt it for the purpose of signing people up.   Not to detract from the seriousness of the conversation. But turdburglars. That's amazing.   Reds   Saw him pitch in Lake Elsinore a few weeks back! His stuff is electric, his control is where he needs to improve. He walked way too many people and got bounced early as a result, but man, the potential is tantalizing.   That trade is not even close to realistic.    *De Profundis* really is worth reading, for the entirely different slant on his work that it provides. The careful consideration that takes place in *De Profundis*, the realizations that all come far too late for him, the issues on which he still feels resolute and those on which he feels he was wrong, all combine to make a powerful statement. It's fascinating stuff.   *The Broom of the System* by DFW is largely a failure on a literary level. It was written as a philosophy thesis, though.   In the NL there's a real possibility of it. But in the AL I don't think the Twins will hang around, at the minimum, so that's more of a stretch to me.   All ERA is, is the number of earned runs allowed divided by 9. That's it. You are not quoting different statistics when you bring up ERA and runs allowed.   Yankees   If the NBA could, they would raise the age limit to enter the league. The more years they see someone play, the less risk there is in drafting them (at least in theory). That's the reason the one-and-done rule even exists now, so that the teams don't have to draft players based only on their high school careers. It's too high of a risk for them, there were too many busts, so the one-and-done rule exists.    All three of those were the right call. Relax.   Yes, cuz there have been rematches before    Yeah reading this through the next morning...they salty   Rest of the world is pretty into basketball.   Well that would be towards the low end of what I hope might be possible. The bottom line is, we really don't know. Hopefully, we can give women the opportunity in the next few decades, and we'll start to see what can or can't happen.   3 women on a roster is theoretically as many as 90 women in the majors at once. I'd say that's even more than I'd hope for.   Depends on how you define waves. Hundreds? Unlikely. Tens? Possible. I certainly want the opportunity afforded to women, on equal footing.   Well yes, on a larger scale, but it certainly isn't helping that historically, women have never really been afforded to play baseball at a serious level. The optimists, like me, think that there's a good chance there have been women/will be women capable of playing with the boys at that level, and they have just historically not been afforded that opportunity.   In an ideal world? Increased access to the game and young women playing it growing up, will give them a shot at it. But mostly:   Hopefully     Yes, take it literally and not as a metaphor  EDIT: seriously, it's just meant to illustrate the idea that a milestone that is easier to reach is still a milestone   If we cheer for a man who lands on the Moon, and only the Moon, isn't that symbolic of the fact that nobody believes we'll ever put a human on Mars?   I take the other view. Hopefully, when a woman makes it to the majors and gets her first hit, that's only the start of a wave of women who can play. No downside to be had here.   Mariners. I will never pick Joe Blanton haha.   Johnny Mac! Love that dude.   Who the fuck down voted you for that?   Hell yeah it did! Ltbu!   Can you guys like, throw Sonny against other teams too? I feel like we see him every time we play you guys.   I think I can get on board with could use improvement. I'm personally a big fan of teams that play like that too. I think Sosh is capable of that, but he could do better for sure. He tends to be a hands-off guy, and when the players are fun guys, he lets them be them. I think the team is kinda pressing under expectations right now; we'll see how Sosh responds to that, what buttons he pushes. Here's hoping!    Upvoting an Angels fan... This feels dirty  But but. I like you guys :(    I particularly enjoy *Into the Wild* and *Fear and Loathing* out of those, but don't be afraid to try lots of different stuff!   I think I probably used wording that was a bit too strong when I said "to a T". I also think you make a good point regarding his hesitancy to give young guys at bats; if I had anything to change about his style, it would be that. But I also think he deserves credit for working guys like Kole into the lineup quickly.  Ultimately, I spoke a little too strongly about his team management. I do believe that he does a good job getting out of the way of the team, and promoting an atmosphere that allows them to handle the clubhouse as they see fit. Lately, we've had players on our roster who prefer to go about their business individually, and we've seen that on the roster. But it's been far from a toxic environment.   A good number of the movies you listed are based on books. *Fight Club*, *Into the Wild*, *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*, *American Psycho*, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*. Check out those books, or other works by the authors who wrote them. Can't be a bad place to start, there's some real good ones in there.   *The Devil in the White City* by Erik Larson. Story of a serial killer threaded in with the story of the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Fascinating stuff.   Dude. It's really easy to get people to go outside in San Diego. Especially when they can drink beer.   Source: Am San Diegan.   And that's a major problem   Angels. Homer pick, can't go against em.   Yeah I've seen it, was just referencing the "no desire to improve" bit   You definitely have to really want it. It helps if you've graduated at that point, because you always have that to fall back on.   Fair enough. Upton just had like blaring warning signs. His only batting stat that wasn't getting significantly worse was dingers, and then those left too.      Yeah it's Matt Joyce. As much as I want to like him, he's stressing so hard at the plate  	92
 I'm confused when did she build up his career and wealth? this is the problem with self entitled people, if i'm a billionaire and you're some pop star just be quiet. He made his own path, she just married into it, they need to end alimony, it's a stupid concept, only alimony should exist if she helped directly contribute to his well being either in a wife role with actual duties or in a professional role that helped said person accumulate his wealth. Same goes for a man in the stay at home role.   Yeah thank you. I'm thinking of just buying a iPhone 6 brand new in choosing a carrier.    henry ford was a anti-Semitic piece of crap but I don't idolize him.   also if I jail break does that mean I can't get a plan? i'm trying to avoid a contract in get a unlimited plan with another company   Yeah i saw that too, wasn't planning on taking him out on the field or anything.   I've played paintball before but recently decided to get back into it, my lil bro is 6 turning 7 soon in i saw this thing called splatmaster, designed to introduce the young ones into paintball i was wondering if he is old enough to play, i was going to buy 2 of them in take him out.

" home-cum-interrogation centre" Now i'm interested in seeing his gf's sextape.    No ties sex, they're cheating, they think you're cheating, any kids or relationship is out of the question. It's like a continuous one night stand with no drama plus the added thrill of you know not wanting to get caught.   I'm sorry is this your showerthought? hop the fuck out of my shower. In i do when my laptop is dead.   Super slim probably. In i think i might replace the HDD does not look hard, kind of like the old 360 replacement of hard-drive.    You're incorrect. Number one Germany was never an ethnic designation for a group of people because the concept of a united germany is relatively new, in if you ask germans what is germany they will have a hard time describing it to you because unlike america germans don't have a sense of nationalist or patriotic pride in the sense of a united country outside of who they pay their taxes too. Germany was made up of a whole host of minor principalities from Bavarian to Prussians only recently coalescing into the modern german national identity which went horrible for them so now when it comes to national identities Germans are a paranoid about comparisons to Nazi's nationalism.   Ditto for italy which was made up of a myriad of smaller city states like florence and regions like Tuscany. Their's not a nation called native america but theirs still a united identity among the various tribal groups no matter how recent, in you're referring to south africa as the country, of course they will say afrcan but i'm looking at the ethnic denotation and cultural not nationality.   No columbus actually ws not super lost when he decided to name them as such, he did it purposefully to insult the natives, he knew he was not in india, allot of people like to believe in misconceptions and this is one of them. Europe had a general view of what other nations outside of their realm looked like in random tribals on a island was not one of them plus he would of known going the way he went he would of ran into china or another eastern asian country before india.   Sorry i should of explained further. When i stated niche market i was referring to the fact hellboy is a lesser known comic even by comic book readers, my first knowledge of hell boy came from the movie even though i am a gamer outside of random merch for hellboy or a comic ad in other comics i never read or had much interest in it. He's in the cult comic book niche market which unlike superman,batman, spiderman and iron or even guardians of the galaxy which relied on the brand name of marvel to get people in the door hell boy unless bought by marvel has no mainstream appeal to sell the movie franchise to moviegoers.   People will chance right now on any comic book movie made by marvel because they know they loved iron man, they liked avengers and its' a fun time for the family not so much for hell boy, unknown rough around the edges super hero who does not even want to be the hero of mankind.    Of course not, if i torrent something it's because it's either not available or easy to acquire because trust me torrents are a bitch to download if you have no clue what you're doing, you need like 3 different programs(i won't ay them because of this subreddit probably has some random no torrent list rule) and at-least some basic common sense to figure out non malware torrents which cuts out  a large group of casual consumers who do not even know how to properly upload pics to things outside of fb. The people who torrent are the ones who would never of bought your product anyway, movie and record companies realize this in while it might have effected music industry at one point, it has never effected tv/movies in a really negative way, hbo is a subscription based network with a the most torrented tv show in history and the ceo of the company was like that's dope right? we the shit.   So i just woke up in this is the first thing i see in all i'm thinking is no no no.......... while i'm not familiar with George Coe's other work which i'm sure is exceptional by his woodhouse performance, this is a shocking loss. After the end of futurama, other shows like family guy and south park became unfunny in american dad losing it's edge, archer is my last hope and a part of that had to due with woodhouse, nothing was better then his often forgotten mistreated heroin addicted butler. I'm at a lost for words right now, you will be remembered for the unending laughter you brought into my and every other fan of archer lives.    Thanks for the info. Did you buy a newer ps3 though? sorry my original post was unclear i'm mainly trying to decide on a old grill ps3 or the newer ps3 updated models   Oh stfu. The reality is the movie industry is the worse it's been in 50 years, movie theaters don't even make money off of tickets because the studio's sell the film at such a high price. They make money off of concession stands, the films Hollywood makes are unoriginal cash cows with horrible premises. Add that into the fact streaming is much better then spending nearly 50 or a hundred dollars on a family outing for a crap film in you see while studious lose so much money, that in the fact their advertising is abysmal, they spend millions yet when the movie releases know one has heard of it. Even when the movie makes a profit studios due to some creative accounting do not admit this.   Movie's like hell boy fell because they're a niche market in a even more niche market(comic book/cult comic book smaller fanbase) which cuts off at-least 60% of your revenue stream. Plus when the sequel is just not that great it's not worth it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNQRqAoT-2c Relevant.    About tree fiddy    Tell that to europeans concerning non white people born there. She is a dutch descended whore.    So should i go an buy a original ps3 or a newer one with more GB? like my old one you know the grill? i still have my original but my mom is using it to watch movies, plus it's kind of banged up in well old, but i hear it has some features newer ps3's lost, which mine still has. I'm really just interested in experiencing ps3, i never had a chance to really get into it due to being a Xbox player, plus my controller broke in i kept buying cheap ps3 knockoffs which were crap in broke within a weeks time.    True but the stockmarket is bullshit made up by idiots who base our economic model off of rather or not something goes up or down in stock price. Which we have no control or prediction over.   It's the one poll with those multiple choice answers and it shows you how many people chose what answer, is it dlc related?   Read the bible then lmao   In i said i'm perfectly fine with the fact we conquered this nation of ours on the blood of others. I'm not an idiot. I also realize we took it from another.   I never said it was not?   Best skyrim reference was a skellige i got wounded in the knee inheritance quest one, best game of thrones one was tyrion lannister in his sky cell on a pirate fortress   The united states is a country built up on the conquered land of native americans. In we are those who continue to support, love and admire the country that did this, are you not a proud american? traitor!   No Africa is a geographic term, like europe, European denotes people from europe like african denotes people from Africa. You do not call a arab guy from sweden a European, same goes for africans and asians.  My prejudiced definition? when did i say Berbers are not african? of course they're African and they're indigenous but some white skinned blond chick is not an african, granted we do come in a myriad of skin tones and physical characteristics but nordic is not one of them. Get over your oversimplified concepts of what an African is.    German citizenship is not passed down to people born into germany just for being born there, unlike the us where you can be a foreigner and your kid is naturalized due to the 14th amendment which states all children born on american soil are Americans, in this goes even further where nationality/ethnic background are intertwined, i can't be a german just by being born in germany, just like she is not african just because she was born in a african country, african if you believe in racial classifications is a race, she's caucasian, if you believe in ethnic identity she's a dutch descended boer, only under nationality is she considered not an african but a south african in reference to the name of her country , much like how theirs a country called macedonia but they're not descended from the ancient macedonians.    Sovereignty only establishes land ownership by force, the native americans also had sovereignty they just lost due to our willingness to kill them more then they were willing or able to kill us. In of course they have no more claim to a land, if a native american came up to me in said this is my land i would tell him to get stuffed, but the fact remains 300 years ago this was their land, we took it, i have no problem with that. I'm a zionist for god sakes, granted the jews are the native americans in this situation but even if you saw the arabs are the rightful owners of the land when they declared a war and lost, all land ownership claims became null.  In actuality their were a myriad of confederations and tribes that inhabited the entirety of the united states at one point or another, why do you think we fought wars with them? the idea of native americans not laying claim to land is b.s, some tribes were more open to outsiders sure but in general their view was not that the land could not be owned but their belief that certain things like access to wildlife, water, in land to grow food was open to others of course native tribes differed on this, in many went to war when their territory was encroached upon, native americans were not hippies and many tribes would sooner be singing a patriotic this is the motherland song then this land is my land this land is your land b.s   Being born and raised in a african country does not make you african. Like me being born in germany does not make me german. Does not matter she's still a boer, just because the country is called south africa does not make her an african. I'm a american due to my country name, but i'm not a native american even though due to my great grandfather being blackfoot i can legally claim as such. Damn white people always trying to steal our culture, history and ethnic classifications.    Check comment history, i got a juicier argument brewing on another comment, want to come over in join me while i go on a rant about white people stealing shit once again?   Does not make her african. She's a boer or south african. I was born in  hong kong does not make me chinese or surprisingly british.   Despite the fact that this sounds awesome in theory, i mean 5.4 trillion dollar asteroid?!!!!! but in reality much like diamond planets or planets that rain gold, if we ever found one and were able to access the resources it would literally tank the economic value of such resources. This is why diamonds are kept artificially high, in reality diamonds are the least valuable rare gem on our planet, it's theorized we have enough for a bucket full of them to be given to every single individual on this planet with enough left over for the new born to get 30 carat diamond ear rings, so to stop this debeers and other diamond corporations routinely destroy, or stock up on diamonds in refuse to allow them into the market. That along with the marketing campaign has led diamonds to become one of the most valuable commodities on our planet.  If we intercepted this platinum, we could make cars out of the stuff it would be so cheap, much like the inca's and mayans who saw no value in their gold outside of ornament since it was so abundant. However rare earth metals stuff like zinc and others that i believe china has the market cornered on would be a huge relief even if they tanked it's economic value, they would be hugely useful since we need for our modern electronics, if the us acquired an asteroid like that would be much more valuable then a platinum or ruby encrusted asteroid. Also those helium deposit's on the moon are more valuable.    yeah i know but wanted to start an argument,   Um look at our expansion westward, who ever gets to the land first is the rightful owner. There's two established ways to get land rights throughout history, be there first or have a bigger weapon to kill those who were there first.  Wtf are you on about , look up the mayan,aztec, Inca civilizations across not, south and central america, then look up the first nations before their Armageddon occurred they had earth mounts made up of dirt from across the united states, interconnected trade routes, theirs a township around Georgia or north Carolina i believe with a population at it's height which outnumbered medieval London.  	37
 Had a strong mushroom trip on 5 grams about 6 months ago.  I feel like we are alone in the universe and that "happiness" only exists so that evolution can do it's dirty work. I feel like everything we do will be returned to dust and will decompose. I feel like everyone I will ever know and love will stop existing and perish. I understand that consciousness is also an illusion so that we can keep on reproducing. Even though we already have 7 billion and a climate problem.  I feel terrified and alone. I have been like this for too long and I am lost.  God doesnt exist and life is meaningless.   4-aco-dmt although it's very difficult to weigh unless you have a sensitive scale since as little as 20mg can send you on a hell of a trip   The front of my undewear is now always wet with either idk semen or precum. Esp in the morning its just soaking wet. ALL THE TIME. Like sometimes im just walking and.. SPLOOOOGEEE much like the andy samberg song. I have an erection going on most of the day as well and its rather annoying since i have to try to conceal it.  well thats just a progress statement I guess... just checking in  thoughts? can anyone relate?   back at the rear of the field   like a blanket? doesnt it fold   I guess one could have the entire mouse pad on the side of the desk and use a large desk   bit pricey         How can I.... do this?     2edgy5me      New Setup  500 dpi   1.1 in game  ma = off  ri = on    So it appears that is decreasing. Time to sell i guess.   I know that the price of bitcoin is generally random.  Based on research and statistics; is the consensus to buy or sell your bitoin right now?  Some forecast websites say it is about to fall while others say it will rise to $800USD by the end of the year. I was seriously considering selling about half of my bitcoin because of the potential drop in value and I already lost a lot of money with the other drops in the past.      https://i.imgur.com/ntLKDXt.png   de_nuke2   http://i.imgur.com/knUymtW.gifv      From what i heard agora and bazaar are still the hottest      Worst fucking blue balls  feel like i have prostate cancer,  cant even walk   its consistent      It's a matter of holstering up your guns and creating courage. Since childhood everything was set up for us. We've never actually had many moments where we self overcome.   I trip on small doses and I trip on large doses but whenever I do I tend do lose control of my mind completely and its just too terrifying. I also do things like send messages to girls that don't make sense. I start to panic. Walk in circles and bite my fingers. LSD on the other hand is calmer but way too boring for me.   So I took about 5 Tabs last week apparently it was very pure stuff. During the peak of the trip I saw a vision of dancing elves with hats around a glowing box. They were dancing around in a circle. I felt as if my whole life and the whole existence of the universe was a movie and inside the box was the ending, the plot twist of the movie. The box suddenly opened and everything suddenly changed and felt different. All the pieces to the puzzle fit in and my heart started racing as if the whole universe existed just so that it could build up and produce this one glorious moment. Like an explosion all this information came out of the box in a state of euphoria for about 5 minutes everything became black this is when the trip went bad and I felt like I was losing my mind. Like I had a taste of the fruit of eden and am now being punished. Like curiousity killed the cat. After the trip it was hard to remember it in detail and only now am I piecing it together. Im fine now and im over the bad part of the trip.   The room with the dancing elves was a bit like glowball which is a game on android.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBvaDtshLY8         I am going to trip on 50mg of 4 aco dmt, I have a mg scale but it only does to the 0.01 and its pretty unreliable either way. I am also skeptical about the product wondering how deepweb vendors even know how to make 4 aco dmt. Even with the hesitation I am going to be tripping in 2 hours wish me luck.      I vaporised some cannabis and I had an amazing trip. I took shrooms and acid in the past but this particular light trip was mind blowing. I felt so happy and I felt so deeply connected and grateful to the universe for my life. I feel motivated to find someone special and spend my the best years of my life with them. Talk to that girl. Why? Because when you are together 40 years in the future she will wish more than anything that your relationship has gone this way. None of this bullshit negativity and depression.

And they say hallucinogenic drugs will ruin your life...   Alert 4chan, it begins today!   http://gemmal.global2.vic.edu.au/files/2014/10/karachitsunmai-1ak1myc.jpg  You take the psychedelic and you know the effects will take place in an hour. You sit in the beach and the water starts to recede, you feel the fear and anticipation of what is about to take place. The birds flock away and the wind starts to blow violently. The fear builds and as a result you feel the need to control it so you look around but there are no trees or bars; nothing to hold onto.   You push your hand through the sand to find something; anything to grab onto but it is useless. The sand runs through your fingers and refuses a grip. You come to accept your fate. The massive wave in the background slowly approaches and you know that you have to face it head on.   The gigantic being destroys everything in its path. It is both terryfying but it has its own majesty and beauty. As it moves on everything calms down and you have a new understanding; you feel refreshed and clear headed. Novelty has washed on the beach and a lot of filth was destroyed in the process.      I studied yoga, I wandered around in the East, I was fast shuffled by beady-eyed little men in dotes. I know the whole spiritual supermarket and rigmarole, and I find nothing there to interest me on the level of, you know, five grams of psilocybin mushrooms in silent darkness. Thats where the pedal meets the metal. Thats where the rubbermeets the road. - Terrence Mckenna            As you know the structures are almost identical except for the one hydroxyl group.  DMT:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/DMT.svg  Psilocin:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Psilocin.svg  So would they bind to the same receptors? I know that there is a big difference between mushrooms and LSD as the latter is known for binding to dopamine receptors such as D5 and D2. While mushrooms are focused mainly on the serotonin receptors exclusively.  How do mushrooms play a role with the pineal gland?  Does DMT have the same binding affinities as the Psilocin in mushrooms?  If it does indeed bind to almost all the same receptors; both experiences should be theoretically similar.   After taking mushrooms and acid several times; I feel like the majority of the human race are brainwashed and is on autopilot. I feel like not many people are doing things in an intelligent geniuine way and that most are following any impulse they come across.   I have no interest in hanging out with my current friends, watching tv, or any tv shows, video games, youtube etc. Eating trashy foods. (This is a good thing). Right now I would prefer a relationship with someone I am deeply in love with and a mostly solitary life where I work and get my degree and explore what else life has to offer.  I am not really into conspiracy theories but I think about had a message that was on point. Also talks from speakers such as Terrence Mckenna. The whole idea about primal individual freedom and abandoning systems and culture.  Terrence Mckenna: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIG25NdOWIs   If she had killed him everyone would have said  "It's for the better"  "He would have suffered anyway"  "I know someone my cousin etc etc that has this condition and its horrible RIP"  "Rest in peace, good decision her her behalf"   I think the movie fight club was right I watched it back around when it came out, this lifestyle of working 9-5 or studying perpetually for exams is disastrous for human happiness. Given our origins of hunter gatherer culture and moments that required us to act quick with adrenaline pumping and "life or death" doesn't happen anymore. It's repetitive work for almost everyone whether you are in a job or still studying.  I participated in this lifestyle feeling unsatisfied and I even blamed myself saying that I was too lazy. But every day I sit down and pour hours and effort into studies I feel myself dying down to a sort of conformist lobotomized state. Tragically the day where there was a shooting nearby and police everywhere was the only moment I felt alive and aware because at least it's not the same old boring shit regardless of if it's threatening to my life or not. Something like a mastermind theif or a heist planner seems more exciting and alive.   Or if things erupt into anarchy I wouldn't mind either i'm sick of the top 1% being what they are who aren't even happy or if they look happy are chronically delusional. You might not understand what I am saying but to those who do you can definitely relate. I somewhat believe in the anarchic unabomber manifesto.

 From my understanding, not really.  Every member state of the IWC is allowed to set its own whaling quota (and not just for "research" purposes).  Last year Japan overhauled its whaling program and presented the revised version to an IWC council.  The plan was rejected by the council, but it looks like Japan is going to go through with it anyway.  To me, the IWC seems to be more of a political club than any sort of governing body.   The sound from a fireworks display would probably not have an effect on their echolocation abilities.  Echolocation utilities high-frequency sound waves that are produced in the upper airways, directed through the melon, and received in the hollow lower jaw.  Since this system is primed for high-frequency sounds, the blast of a firework probably would not be picked up by it.  However, toothed cetaceans can also hear using ear bones just like us and there has been some research suggesting auditory hearing is more important in hunting than echolocating.  But as far as I know, there hasn't really been any research on the effects of prolonged exposure to loud noises in captive cetaceans.  Most of the sound waves would probably reflect off the surface of the water but there would still be some that enter the water so they can definitely hear it, but who knows how loud it would be.  So whether or not it hurts them is up for debate at this point.  Hearing is an important part of training for these guys also, so I would guess that these loud noises they experience don't have lasting negative effects.  I imagine it would be bad for business if the trainers couldn't communicate with the whales because they went deaf, so it would be in everyone's best interest if the sounds the animals are exposed to on a daily basis weren't too loud for them.   Looks like a mayfly nymph to me, but freshwater macroinverts aren't really my specialty!         Great, thanks for the help!      Awesome, thanks!!!      Wanted to say thanks for the wonderful music you guys have made over the years!  I have been following you since CTTM first came out and you got me through my teens and early 20s.  Each album is markedly different and you somehow found a way to make each sound great while avoiding being redundant.  My questions are:  Do you guys have different connections to the albums you've made based on the difference in sounds between them?  Is the new album stylistically similar to any of the others?  Thanks!        	12
 The drunkest dankest gril that ever was...   Nah, still lacking the wubdub's and Airhorn symphony.   Hmmm, Are you green with envy?  	3
 When the kids left home, I took the empty nest thing pretty literally. I love animals and Id always wanted a parrot, but really had never had the time.  I dont use euphemisms like no longer with us so Ill just say it: my husband is dead.  Heart attack five years ago.  After working two teenagers through that sort of loss, and myself as well, I cant say I ever had much me time.  When the kids left, I felt a kind of freedom I hadnt had since I was eighteen years old and just on the verge of independence.  I was almost giddy the day I went to buy Henry.   Henry was a beautiful yellow naped amazon.  He loved to talk and picked up words so quickly that at times it was almost scary.  He heard me on the phone once.  Okay, Linda, thanks for calling whats that?...  Oh of course!...  haha!...  Alright, bye Linda!  Bye Linda! Henry called out.  Henry!  Clever boy!  Do I really sound like that?  Henry was just that good, he could pick a phrase up after hearing it only once and he could mimic the oddest noises almost perfectly.  But since he was an old man of thirty, pretty much birdy middle aged when I bought him from a lovely young couple, it could also be confusing trying to determine if some things were from his old life, or from around my own house.    My keyboard, for instance.  Id never played it for him, but there was one specific beat he was always mimicking that I had never heard on any other keyboard.  Mine was so old, the beat was pretty much a relic that had been replaced by something cooler on new models.  I was certain I hadnt played it, but where else would he have picked it up?  There were other noises that made sense, but also could not really be explained.  The sound of footsteps going up my stairs like someone was running.  I know the sound of my stairs and even for non-vocal sounds, Henry was a perfect mimic.  I know the sound of someone running up those stairs from twenty-some years of kids flying up and down.  But I hadnt run up those stairs in years.  Henry kept up with the strange noises.  The attic door being pulled down had a specific thump and creak that was very distinct.  I hadnt been up there in at least a year.  Songs from music boxes I absolutely had not played since getting Henry were some of his favourites.  Whats more, Henry sometimes made voices that I could swear I heard at the market or on the bus, but that he could never have picked up.  Certainly not at my house.    It all came to a head after coming home once to find a cigarette still burning in an ash tray on my coffee table.  I finally pieced together what was going on, and I was terrified.  I felt crazy just thinking it, but I knew: someone was in my house with me.  They had played my keyboard while I was away, they had run up the stairs when they knew I was coming and hid in the attic.  Im not crazy, these things happen.  Ive seen it on the news.  I called the police immediately.  After a thorough inspection of the house, the police verified my suspicion.  There was almost a nest up in my attic where someone had been squatting, for a while from the looks of it.  No person was found, they figured hed been lucky enough to slip out at just the right time.  Change your locks, maybe get a security system installed was cold comfort from the police.  Call us again if you see anything unusual.  Things changed after that.  Especially with Henry.  I couldnt stand him making those noises.  Every time he made the attic door sound, my heart raced.  I was nervous enough as it was and Henry was giving me panic attacks on a regular basis.  I couldnt keep him.  I asked the couple who had sold him to me whether they could take him again.  I didnt need my money back, I just wanted him to go to a good home.  To my relief, they were happy to take him off my hands and we arranged a pick-up date.  Im counting down to when my nest will empty again.  I woke up just a few hours ago to Henrys staircase running noise and attic thump.  Ugh, Henry, go back to sleep!  I called out.  He cant be gone too soon.  But wait, its Saturday, right?  And the pickup was Friday       nice twist!  	2
 Taking 10% from gambling revenue is criminal.  Having a poker game in your home is legal.  Having a poker game in your home and taking 10% of every pot is illegal.  You didn't know this?     Glad she's dealing with her addiction, but wow, what an odd looking couple.  Am I allowed to say that?      How so?  You can leave the building to smoke at any time.   ...but operating a black market gambling operation does    You didn't see through the hyperbole?  The cops actually took the time to find the wife to tell her to go back to the house and unlock the door, so they didn't have to kick the door in.   Failing to declare income is a violation of the tax act.  Operating a near million dollar black market gambling book is illegal.  Calm down.   He's been doing it since the early 90's.  He made choices and now he's facing consequences for those choices.  What is it you dislike?  The police are holding him to account for the choices he made.     So every cop who ever gets in trouble is guilty?  That's your standard?   I read the entire story.  He never once advised he was declaring the income to the IRS.  Even more damning, I now see he tweaked his suggestion, that on top of the winners, he recommended **all participants** gift him 10%.  If you think he was paying tax on his gambling operation, I've some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you.   'That winners, if they were satisfied with the experience of playing in the pool, give him a "gift" amounting to 10 percent of the amount they collected.'  I know a lot of you **hate** cops, but he was operating outside the law.  The cops should have just ignored his tax free nearly million dollar gambling operation?  Edit - note to self, do not question the prevailing opinion or suffer downvotes.  Lol.  Does anybody else hate cops?  They're totally the worst.  Fucking pigs interfering with this guys black market gambling operation.   There I'm one of you now, upvote guyz!   On phone.  If you don't have herbicides, **you must water regularly.**  That's what I meant.   Chip stands in Ottawa serve up the real deal, cheese curds and fresh cut fries.  Even Costco serves real Quebec cheese curds with their poutine.  I sincerely do not believe any reputable food truck or restaurant would serve anything but the real deal in Ottawa.     Did you know you can't grow a weed free lawn without chemical herbicides and regular watering?  So screw it.  Let the weeds grow and my days of toiling over that little patch of grass and spending hundreds of dollars are over.  I have a Japanese lilac tree, columbrian maple tree and a hybrid Apple tree + 3 pyramid cedars + 2 lilac bushes, one of which is a beautiful 10 feet tall.    That's plenty of oxygen.  My kids play at the park.     Without chemical herbicides at my disposal in Ontario for low cost, I now accept that my lawn is going to go to hell and one day, I will simply have to completely landscape my front and back yards, as the lawn is going to turn into a pasture.  Water my lawn?  Ha-ha, no.   To be frank, if you read the news regularly, cops are often convicted, fired and / or punished for their misdeeds.  When  	16
 Ultimate Wolverine had a better 'regenerate from a single cell' healing factor.   It got rid of a lot of beloved characters/history, and allowed patchy writers free reign to rewrite the histories of beloved characters. Batman didn't actually have it too bad, other than the loss of the previous batgirls and said Mr Freeze retcon (although Mr Freeze still has about 20 years of stories with his old origin, so one can argue all that can be said was said) but other characters, like the Teen Titans, got hit pretty hard by the reboot.   It's a similar problem with a lot of batman villains. Because the majority aren't evil, but mentally ill, you can only go so many stories before the audience sympathy goes away or your forced to redeem them in some way, which may be why recent books lean towards either new villains or unrepentant murderers (Talia, Joker)   Just about to say this. My excitement for Kung Fury has somewhat been quenched by Danger 5 season 2.   I feel so bad I beat Ebrietas first time.   [Why not try both!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbq9yt3RxYs)   In the ninety page lore document posted a few weeks back, it's theorized that no only is she a great one, but she's also the maiden in Black from Demon souls, tying the games together.   Keanu Reeves is giving his best Nicholas Cage impression and I'm *Loving it*   They should have really done this with the last episode, since a major theme of it was 'You could've stopped a suicide by being a better friend and taking more phone calls' which is a pretty apalling message to give to kids with depression.   A lot of people speculated it was the leader of a covenant, too.   To be honest, RLM is almost always in line with the majority critical consensus, so it's not surprising you usually agree.   I think the majority of it is overblown because of that one return of kings guy. It's basically a presentation of extreme internet stupidity so journalists and twitter users can state their own opinions, and talk about the artificially manufactured 'controversy'.   Nah, Legend of the guardians:the owls of ga'hool was the safest movies about owl blood sport I've ever seen.   Because adult comedies aimed at girls is such an overused audience! Why are there so few action films aimed at heterosexual men?   And Mad Max was the first risk Hollywood has taken since Cleopatra was such a flop!   This could be the next Dredd guyz! Because a mid Budget Hyperviolent comic book movie totally needs the same amount of support as a $150 million tentpole production with a massive marketing budget!!!   So is Pitch Perfect 2 a low budget Horror movie or a Big Budget Tentpole Blockbuster, expected to destroy everything in its path?   Like two days ago when I watched Babadook... or a week ago when I watched it follows...   If the movie industry worked like that, every movie would be paranormal activity, considering that film was made for 30K but made hundreds of millions at the box office.   I can't believe a tentpole production with a huge marketing budget mad its money back! It's almost as if Mad Max: Fury Road isn't some sort of obscure cult film!   the bikes aren't actually plugged in to anything. It's just another mindless distraction to keep people stimulated.   This is the same Miller who RUINED the Babe 2: Pig in the city and Happy feet 2, and stripped all the hardcore ultraviolence of the originals out, to be replaced with 'family' themes. Some people WANT to see Babe gouge out the eyes of some chump, George!   MMM, Adult heterosexual males sure are a risky market!   Basically, companies force journalists to stick to review embargoes, in return for giving these journalists resources/interviews/free tickets/ flights to sets and the like. This is so they can allow the reviews to coincide with marketing and release of the film. Since the early screenings of Fury Road were a week ago, I'm guessing the embargo is to carry the momentum to the final screening, rather than have it be 'old news'.   Yeah, but I beat Gerhman by parrying every one of his attacks, and, to me, the MP and Gwyn were way more challenging (at least MP has the take you down to 1hp attack, and Gwyn is the only boss you can parry, so few people try)   When he says the upgrade system being unfinished, I'm guessing he's referring to Raw and crystal upgrading being objectively inferior, and regular upgrading rendering Boss weapons/armor irrelevant.   Well, Gwyn was still more powerful than the Taurus demon, and he has a reason for being underpowered, (burning in the first flame) and he can't be killed in three hits, unless you use parries, which are also really effective against Gerhman. I wouldn't know how 'difficult' the moon presence is compared to Gerhman, because I beat them both first time, so, for me at least the point still stands (You also wouldn't be able to beat either of them at level 1 as easily as CB)   But the cleric beast doesn't give you any Ludwig weaponry, has no visual association with Ludwig, and is the weakest boss in the game, despite Ludwig being one of the strongest/most represented characters in the Lore, meaning that Ludwig is less powerful than Vicar Amelia, Gascoigne, etc.   This is for Fury Road. The originals were all filmed in Australia.   It's kind of weird there's so little blood minister speculation. He's vital to the plot, but we never find out who he is. Is he related to the moon presence in some way?   I think Kojima needs the pick me up right now :(      Nintendo games encompass every style and age range available, what 'specific type of game' do they make?   The Dub is pretty much unanimously agreed to be better than the sub, even by the creator of the show, and is regarded as one of the best of all time. The show doesn't have a 'definitive' conclusion (it's likely to have a second season) but has two very satisfying endings, and the fanservice is pretty minimal, at least as far as I remember (aside from an OVA, which has two pretty fanservicey scenes.)   It's great! Watch the dub though, it's a great dub and it makes more sense for the setting than Japanese.   Black Lagoon is pretty good at it.   So, since it's FROM software tradition to put the moonlight sword in every game, and this game continues the other tradition with patches, does anyone know if the sword is being used by a mob/replicated by another weapon?   I don't really think Annalise was attempting to birth a great one, considering she seems to be a relatively neutral party, and got attacked by the executioners. If we're throwing really off the wall theories up, may I suggest that The wet nurse is actually Velka from Dark souls? She's implied to be more omnipotent than the other Gods in that game, has a strong association with crows, and Marvelous Chester is implied to come from a victorian setting, which implies that Yarnham may be Carim from DS, a land that Velka is strongly implied to be associated with.    There's a theory that Bloodborne actually takes place in Carim from Dark souls, and that Marvelous chester actually comes from the future period of the area.   Well, there are Arch trees in the background of the hunters dream...   For example, something like Ash Lake in Dark souls: It initially appears to be a cool secret area, but it actually finishes off a number of plotlines, and introduces the idea that Havel was a traitor. Similarly, the painted world changes the context of the entire game.   Hey, Bloodborne and Pillars of eternity are both pretty great AAA games that have a good range of characters and personalities (barring the Kickstarter backer controversy for POE)   The writing of Life is strange just isn't up to par with something like Wolf among us or Gone Home to me. As a cynical guy of around the age group of life is strange, the dissonance between the fiction of the game and the reality of what I would **Like** to do in certain situations is to much to bear for me, and I find it **Really** difficult to relate to a upper middle class photography student who uses a polaroid camera and can rewind time to potentially solve literally every problem in her life (and chooses not to for plot convenience).   Eh, don't give Dontnod too much credit. They also said Capcom were the only studio that didn't think remember me should have a male protagonist, and I personally don't really buy the idea that they picked Square Enix just because they were the only studio not to make it into a bro-shooter, but hey, I generally dislike Life is Strange, so maybe I'm letting my personal biases affect me.   Ah, fair enough, I don't have the guidebook so I obviously couldn't verify myself.   Yeah, I tried to use the cane effectively, but because the animation is pretty longs, almost every other attack he would parry and instakill me. I was fine if he tried to melee me, but **every** time that gun was fired it either took off 1/3 of health or countered me.   Yeah, Because it's not my tweet I didn't want to claim it as my own, and I screwed up the title. Should I make a new thread?   The Cainhurst Cathedral hunter has killed me more time than any boss, I tried every combo of weapons, every paper, every cheesy tactic.... and I ended up killing eileen because I was trying to hit him with the whip through the door, I tried to quickly reload, but nope, he's back to full health and Eileen is still dead.    So I decided, I was going to **destroy** this guy, I complete the entire rest of the game using Eileen set, I realize I'm easily kicking Gerhmans ass, so I prepare to face this guy one final time, avenging Eileens death...  And he kills me, again and again. Finally, I try to cheese him with the same door technique, but I have to take a phonecall. I get back to the game and... something weird is happening, he seems to be taking damage from his start point. It turns out he has his chikage stuck in 2 hand mode, and the AI didn't know to put it back. I watched him die, both robbed of my revenge, and the Eileen quest.  People say the moon presence is the final boss... Not for me.      You could even point to evidence that she's the only **actual** God in the game, and that everyone else are merely giants who claim godhood.   And that conspiracy is speculated to just be a part of an even bigger conspiracy by a Character who is never even fought in Velka, and in reality EVERY ending simply plays into her hands.   Hate to say I told ya so ;)   I'm really counting down the days until they reveal that Squirrel girl is a reincarnation of the sentry, or the phoenix force or whatever. It's inevitable that a writer will try to explain it in some arbitrary capacity.   Looking forward to seeing Pyrion win yet another game ;)   But the panel goes out of its way to say he ISN'T Bi, despite the fact that this is meant to be a past version of Bobby, and future Bobby has never even really been hinted as gay. Moreover, when Jean outs him against his will, it's a pretty scummy move.   Eh, as a big comics guy, I can't help but feel that there should be a little more justification as to why a 52 year old character that has always been portrayed as heterosexual is now suddenly gay, particularly as the marvel universe is supposedly rebooting to allow for this sort of change to established characters.   Hey, I don't make the rules, and the rules I wrote on my invisible typewriter clearly state that Sjin, despite playing a perfect game, gets a **E-** for complaining.   Despite that, Brettor should really give him an **E-** for complaining.   The hunters are the replacement for the knights. Multiple times I've tried to fight huners only for them to kick my ass due to being too tough, such as Henryk and his pal.   There's *Tonnes* of exploration in Bloodborne. You've been watching the wrong lets plays bud.   30 seconds is still seconds!   Hey, the Pyrion/Sjin team up totally DOMINATED 2v2v2, expect a similar turnaround here.   Wait, you mean to tell me that Christopher Nolan ISN'T the worst director in History? Say it aint so!   It's weird, despite the attempt to keep it family friendly, Zoeys character only reminds me of this scene: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTrJa197dSk)   Eh, sort of. The course is the same as Ninja warrior (although easier) and it keeps the meat grinder format of people of Ninja warrior. It's way better than Total wipeout in any case.   Seriously, it's Generic ITV programming that's been hijacked by Maniacs, Tailors, Freaks and closeted axe murderers.   Birdo from the mario franchise is also supposedly trans, and I believe there are also characters in Danganrompa and guilty gear who are talked up as trans. Dark souls also MIGHT have a trans character, but that's left up to lore interpretation.   /r/nocontext   And TB donates thes second highest amount of money on Jims Patreon....   Hey, you didn't happen to be at a showing of ex machina, did you? A woman there was typing on her phone *with bloody sticky keys on* and she ended up getting shouted down.   Yet another attempt by the SJW media to insert female characters into videogames. Why can't we have a game about Mean BOYS huh?   The swans just seem to 'click' with some people more than others. They're by far the most powerful, it's just translating that power into reality that becomes problematic.   Salt crybabarines   Katie Hopkins makes money from being a professional scumbag. It's people giving her this sort of attention that lets her make tens of thousands from appearances.   Well, that dev also lost tens of thousands by giving the money to a guy who never did any work, and apparently the price of backer rewards was more than the Kickstarter money, meaning the yogscast lost a tonne of money.   I was kind of surprised nobody posted that feud here, considering it was a **massive** drama on the yogscast and cynicalbrit reddits.   Well, it's one thing to have an opinion, it's another to be flat out wrong.   If you're saying that they DON'T look exactly alike, how I am I 'flat out wrong' in saying that Bane doesn't look like comic-Bane in batman and Robin? Why are you going *out of your way* to give Batman and Robin objective credit that it doesn't deserve? It's such a childlike mentality to assume that the other person is   categorically incorrect   for not subscribing to your view of the world.   A subjective statement can't have an objective answer. Pointing out some similarities between Batman and Robin Bane and comic bane does not mean he suddenly starts looking EXACTLY like comic bane. You just wanted to go on a rant about TDKR for some reason, and decided to make a massive post, with tonnes of hyperlinks, despite the fact I just don't care.   Wow, I've never seen someone go through so much effort to express opinions I don't agree with *At all*. Sorry I can't Reciprocate.    Considering his past responses, I'm not sure his computer can even *run* civ.   bane in Batman and Robin doesn't *Really* look like comic book bane though. bane is meant to be a hulking mass of a man, but he's around the same size as Clooney in that film. The Mask/Colouring isn't quite right either.   Indie games also don't need to be Ps4 exclusive, or have advanced graphics and lighting. Acting like 30fps is unmanageable is pretty elitist, and it's extremely unfair to compare bloodborne to mgsV   Because MGSV has a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, has hundreds of team members, and a custom built engine designed to scale to everything. Bloodborne is made by way fewer people, and they likely decided to focus on the graphics, and things like the multiplayer component, rather than the framerate. It's not like 60FPS was actually working properly in that time, it was likely dropping down way too much to be playable.   Don't forget xenoblade Chronicles x and FF XV!   Destructoid is the site I frequent the most. You may also want to check out the Jimquisition. Jim Sterling said he was 'writing his favorite review in ages' a while ago.   They actually did, a characters girlfriend has the aug, but it doesn't really do anything special apart from stop pheromones from working.   He actually doesn't kill anyone in that fight, you can see them visibly squirming on the floor, and nobody ever gets hit on the head by the hammer.   at nintendo you have Miyamoto, Sakurai, Iwata, Sakamoto and Aunoma, and you still have your Mikami's and Inafune.   Helikite's drake's fire doesn't factor fire resistance in, hence why it kills people in full fire res gear. Whilst in a 'story' the drake would easily be beat, because it's a derivative of an actual dragon, in the actual game logic, the drake would have much more of a chance.   I wonder if how this sub would have reacted if the original post was called something more neutral, or even Simon favoring, than 'I'm disappointed Simon.' I'd also like to see how badly the sub got brigaded by /r/cynicalbrit or /r/kotakuinaction.    hey couldn't you go and see a more obscure indie film than just giving up entirely?    But isn't the helikites fire one of the most powerful attacks in the game, period? I know experienced players certainly have more trouble with fighting the drake normally.   Nah, I'm not the Op, and literally took the most recent example. Why does TB feel the need to reply top stuff he's not tagged in? Particularly as he KNOWS that when he replies, his followers will attack and harass that person. (see also, Brianna Wu Matt Lees and those charity streamers, ) he also said [videogames should be apolitical] (https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/578685278342287360) something that is, in my opinion, extremely regressive, and he decided to get annoyed at Jim Sterling for [posting a trans awareness page.](https://archive.today/KTGv3) Simon has a right to criticize TB, particularly as TB's tweet in question called a random artist a 'moron' for daring to make a pop culture reference.   [Here ya go](https://archive.today/4PCU7)   Not 'obviously' wrong. he has every right to call TB out when he calls a random comics artist a moron.You don't have to agree with his conduct or anything, but he certainly wasn't 'obviously in the wrong'      Guys, this isn't what the boss would do! We need to scatter Kojimas ashes to the endless sea!   Well, my dad works at konami and he said he's in the game.   To be honest, I'm more curious as to what this means for Silent hills. TPP is going to release anyway, but I'd hate for SH to be in  Limbo.   If Konami was competently run, they could easily get a bunch of teams together who make great games. A 2d Castlevania game made by the original team would sell gangbusters in this climate.   I look forward to seeing Kojima move to Moby Dick studios!   Yeah. She was introduced in Suicide Squad, then got introduced properly to the family. The only time she was actually Batgirl was a carryover from the 66' TV series, and she wasn't that relevant back then. Which is why it was kinda weird she became the new Batgirl, despite the prestige, she never really WAS that character.   To provide further context, at the time, the story was seen as outside of continuity, as it's heavily implied to be a silver age batman story (Batgirl was only around in the silver age, there hasn't actually been a 'modern' batgirl till nu52) so Moore was given free reign to do whatever he wanted. It would be a few years before Barbara came back as a disable character, in the pages of suicide squad.   To be fair, it's being heavily implied that he'll die in the next batman issue.  	104
 The scene were Matthew Mcconaughey finds out solution and gives clue to Jessica is just too good.   Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman in The Prestige.   Why these two? Their previous scripts aren't good.  	3
 A safari /sfri/ is an overland journey, usually a trip by tourists to Africa.            Rick Perry owns a ranch called Niggerhead, not Mitt Romney.   The "Stars   Bars" wasn't appropriated from some other country   culture like the Swastika was, and if you had a German friend who went home and brought everyone back a Swastika, there would be only one way to interpret that.     An individual who supports the existence of the state is a statist.   This is the same guy who thinks it's unfair to force small businesses to have wheelchair ramps and handicapped restrooms because everybody should "play by the same rules".   He said it was an "accident".    We should have a contest to see who can draw the best picture of Muhammad wiping his ass with the Confederate Flag.   Why go out of your way to deliberately put a symbol of white oppression on a State House funded by black taxpayers?    Burn one that's publically owned like one at a State Capital.         To distract from TPP.   But that really isn't a fifth option, it would still fall under number two, that he did do it, but for some other reason than the one being stated    When you say that it was a False Flag are you saying that:  1) 9 people were shot, but this Dylann Roof didn't do it, that someone else did and he is being framed?   2) Or that he did do it, but for some other reason than the one being stated?   3) Or that those 9 people aren't really dead, but are being hidden away somewhere?   4) Or that these 9 people and the shooter aren't real people, but were just invented and maintained sometime in the past to be used for this scenario?  I would find it easier to believe 1 or 2 than 3 or 4   The Obama Logo doesn't have white letter or stars or whatever they are, in the top of the blue circle like OP's does.      So who do you think should decide which citizens are mentally mature enough to keep and bear arms? The ATF? Your local Sheriff?     Are you arguing for an IQ test to get a gun permit? Because this is how you get that.      http://mashable.com/2015/06/18/charleston-shooting-victim-snapchat/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link   I would suspect that someone who remained a roommate with someone who "was big into segregation and other stuff, for over 6 months, was probably "big into segregation and other stuff,  themselves.    If the Government created his facebook page with the intent of making him look like a white supremacist, why would they then friend a bunch of black people?                     Considering that she once unsuccessfully sued the historically black Howard University and the chairman of its art department for allegedly discriminating against her in order to favor African-American students, I'm pretty sure she didn't receive scholarship money.     Links?   So she pretended to be Black to get in on those Black prliverages?   Afraid you've topped me, but I was once stuck in a mining animation downriver from Ivarstead whilst Faendal was in a battle to the death with a troll   a Saber Cat.   Wait, if Goldstein is Goldstein   Big Brother is Goldstein, who do I hate?   And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?   Titty Sprinkles.   Oh No! Morgan Freeman plays Paarthurnax!      One isn't "on" a film, they are "in" a film or video game. One would be "on" a radio or television program.   For comparison, The United States Secret Service has less than 7000 despite having to protect The Carters, Bushes, Clintons and the Obamas.   Did they raid Jay Leno's Garage?    Broken clock gets it right twice a day.   Disapproving sunset.    Well, that dispels the myth that they don't wash those areas.     The first link states that  The United States forces will use [Al Taqqadum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Taqaddum_Air_Base), an Iraqi base near the town of Habbaniya in eastern Anbar Province, as their training hub, the White House said.  And the second link states that   YOU'VE REACHED A SUBSCRIBER-ONLY ARTICLE. Would you like to become a subscriber for 50% less for the first 12 weeks?* Sign up now and access the full breadth of The Australian's content in minutes.  So you haven't provided proof of a new military base being built in Iraq.   One of the petitioners challenging the law "explained that she is currently forced to store her handgun in a lock box and that if an intruder broke into her home at night, she would need to 'turn on the lights, find [her] glasses, find the key to the lockbox, insert the key in the lock and unlock the box... and then get [her] gun.'   But of course, without the law, she wouldn't need to turn on the lights or find her glasses. She'd just whip her loaded gun out from under her pillow and drop that perp in one shot, in the dark, without he glasses.    Uptown Funk?   Must be some kind of regional thing, I'm from the deep south and I have never heard this.   Why would they not "still hire people for almost the sole purpose of screaming" if films and video games still have screams in them?   But Hitler, for instance, is dead and isn't going to kill anyone, and yet some people still defend him, as well as Stallin.   Followers will automatically take a health potion when their health falls to a certain level, usually right after they go down on one knee. I always keep mine supplied with about five. Potions of minor healing are one of the cheaper potions and wheat can be found all over the place for free and blisterwort doesn't cost that much.          Thinking of settling in? There's a home for sale - Breezehome. You should talk to the steward up in the keep if you're interested.   So what if the American public electeds a Democrat in the next presidential election? Will they just refuse to vote on judicial nominees until 2021? What if that Democrat is reelected? Will they just refuse to vote on judicial nominees until the voters give in and vote the way the GOP wants them to?   The CNN/ORC poll found that about 46 percent of Americans view Clinton favorably while 50 percent view her unfavorably. While 50% maybe more than 46%, it's still only half, not most.      I second this motion, don't underestimate the kid.   But, the fact that they were going to be "coronated" was proof that the system was broken. Does this mean the system isn't broken?    We never had poll questions like this till Nixon. No Pollsters ever asked anyone if they trusted LBJ or Goldwater. Just which one would do the better job or which one shares your beliefs.          http://www.ontheissues.org/international/Bernie_Sanders_Foreign_Policy.htm   Like Duggars and Hastert?   Well she couldn't possibly be qualified to be President if her husband wanted her to look at his penis, could she?    At the end of the day, you're still putting stock in the opinions of a Penthouse centerfold as to the quantifications of a Presidential candidate. Did they ask any other Penthouse centerfolds their opinion of Clinton? Did they ask this Penthouse centerfold her opinion of any other candidates besides Clinton?      In a world where no one cohabitated this would work, but a world in which on one raises children or lives with the elderly or infirmed, isn't a sustainable world.         Has there ever been a problem for which the solution **wasn't** more U.S. troops on the ground as far as McCain is concerned?            At this point Senators Santorum and Graham and Gov. Jindal would be out and Donald Trump and Ben Carson would be in.      Mine did.      If that's a fact, then you shouldn't have any problem providing a little proof?         Could you please name just one action that could be taken by Zimmerman or by anyone else, for or against him, that would increase or decrease the amount of rights you currently enjoy as a citizen?      How is the Zimmerman story political? He'll never hold elected office and nothing he does and nothing that might be done to him will result in a rewrite of the constitution or set a new legal precedent.           I always thought it was sad that OTR died out just before FM broadcasting, transistor radios and multi-track recording came along. I say why tie one hand behind your back. We don't ask Hollywood to make B W silent movies.   Randy  I like this, let's continue doing this.   This is like saying you left your children $300,000 in debt because you left them a mortgaged house with 3 $600 payments left.   when a president of either party asks, you say yes.   If the media treats a candidate like they're relevant, it's because they're a threat, but if the media treats them like they aren't relevant, it's because they are a treat.    I get that, I just don't think that a pedophile is going to stop molesting kids because they have contracted an STD and the penalty has increased. I also don't think child molestation should've ever been just a class 3 felony in the first place.     I'm guessing this works on the assumption that someone who's willing to molest a kid is willing to do 3 years for it, but wouldn't do it if it was 10?   Right now there are [U.S. soldiers in Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Japan) who weren't even born when Pearl Harbor occurred.   And still got mo' money than you.   Well one of them is still going to be elected whether you're impressed or not.         Secretary of State is a lot more important that Vice President, unless the President dies.   I say it time we consider putting something other than  people on our money.                  Does he even have a cat?         A more accurate headline would have been   Court Rules Cellphone Tower Data Belongs to Your Phone Carrier, Not You      Do you believe that anyone fit for jury duty is also fit to be President of the U.S.?   Hell Nixon would be today.   Yeah, they're treated as bad as Gays are in Russia!      Why is politics the one profession that people feel an absolute novice should be able to start at the top of the field?     Did you notice that the story was about Carly Fiorina, who seems to be incapable of either?      First time I heard this song was in the late sixties on a Roger Miller album, can't remember the name of it, cover was of him sitting in a porch swing with an acoustic guitar, for a while I thought he had written it.   How long will every fourth headline in /r/politics have "Carson" in it, even in links like this one, that isn't even really about him?   While details about the gunmen, including their religion or their motive, weren't immediately known,  How do we know that this wasn't just a personal vendetta and has nothing to do with Islam and Free Speech?   A rehearsal where the protesters got what they wanted, the government wasn't able to control the information coming out? Sounds like a bad rehearsal.    No one has identified any of the shooters as Muslims. They know who did it, they shot and killed them. Is it possible that they weren't Muslims?       [Rated Mostly True by Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/19/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-99-percent-new-income-going-to/).   Did he declare marshall law to stop 'em declarin' marshall law?   And Fox News backs warmongering, racist, homophobes 100% of the time.   Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636.    Jeffrey Dahmer was murdered in prison, should that have been factored in when considering whether to bring charges against him?   Don't know, ask Reuters, it's was there headline before they changed it.   Maybe they will come out during the trial?   Not by compromise. That's the whole point of Sanders.   And yet you assume that this officer wasn't driving at a high rate of speed and his prisoner sustained serious bodily harm while he drove slowly and carefully?   According to conventional wisdom on r/politics, everyone except African Americans who voted for Obama, now regret that decision and wouldn't vote for Clinton either and will stay home and vote for none of the above unless Rand Paul gets the GOP nomination. So if Reddit is any indicator, it should be a cakewalk for Sanders.   I never used the term "High speed". Are your are trying to incite people to lynch me?    shit birt?     They'll still get their day in court and the best lawyers their gofundme campaign can buy.   And without casino owners or super PACs.   This has been covered in this thread already and addressed by the mods, OP posted the original headline just as Reuters had ran it, then Reuters changed their headline on the article.     A "lynch mob" is when you aren't given your day in court because someone kills you before that can happen, much like what happened to Freddie Gray.   No, he needs to keep being Bernie.      After having clicked the link, I'm thinking more like Pam Grier.          [List of charges for 6 officers in Freddie Gray's death](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/01/baltimore-police-charges-freddie-gray/26701383/)      Yes. The rest are being charged with like negligent homicide or something.    When a defendant commits an act even though he knows his act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to someone else. Like doing doughnuts in a paddy wagon with a shacked, but unseatbelted, detainee in the back.   As the mods have already pointed out in this thread, OP posted Reuters original headline   then Reuters changed their headline.    Shaft?   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/01/baltimore-police-charges-freddie-gray/26701383/   Or he could choose option B, win spending less money.          Thank you.    prosecutor  noun  a person, especially a public official, who institutes legal proceedings against someone.  nothing gets to court unless someone is charged.   So maybe some white people should go down to city hall and protest against them being charged?   I wonder if white protesters will show up to protest against them being charged?         But we had all those veterans fresh from the SpanishAmerican War (1898) and the PhilippineAmerican War (18991902).   That's like saying only those with blood on their hands can stop the violence.        make America safe again.  When was that, when was America safer than it is now?   When a pot calls a kettle black, it's still true.   Will Cruz be a unifying force? Will he be able to explain to African Americans why there is a perfectly good reason they're more than twice as likely to be shot in the back or put in a choke hold by a police officer while unarmed for selling untaxed cigarettes or driving with a broken tail light, than white americans are?   Funny how this was basically the norm for the first half of the twentieth century.    Check out the guy's channel on Youtube, he's got The Shadow too.   Looks like the one on the Atlanta Highway in Montgomery Alabama, before it was remodeled.      Look, y'all gonna have to find a narrative and stick to it, Obama can't be a Cheese Eating Surrender Monkey one week and a warmonger the next.     That's like saying that since freeing black slaves would hurt the job prospects of Irish day laborers, we shouldn't free the slaves.   If someone works hard, will they be guaranteed financial success?  Is religious belief necessary to live an ethical and moral life?        If your neighbor physically assaults their SO, is that any of your business?       Pretty sure whoever the next President is, the White House Correspondents Dinner won't be as much fun as it was under Obama and Bush.   And pointing out his ethnicity and/or his religious beliefs is the best way to communicate his political beliefs? Like, if he was Afro-American, you would point that out to show that he is a democrat? Or if he was LDS, you would point to that as proof that he supports polygamous marriage?      I have no doubt of Adelson's support of right wing Israeli foreign policy, but Perry and Cruz prove that one need not be Jewish to hold such opinions and I'm pretty sure simply being Jewish doesn't automatically make one hold those opinions.      Why is it always necessary to note that Adelson is Jewish? If Barbra Streisand donated money to the Clinton campaign, would the headline be "Hillary Appeals to Jewish Donors"?   http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/hillary_clinton.htm         Unless you wanted to have sex with her, what difference does it make?   Bush plead guilty to DUI. His daughters were caught trying to buy beer using fake ID's. 1963 Laura Bush ran a stop sign in the Texas and killed a guy. Bush was not only nominated, but was elected and reelected. This means nothing.   Just ask Rush if he thinks you're hot.   Well there you go kids, you no longer have to face the prospect of having to hold your nose and choose between Jeb or Hillary. You can vote Waka!   Can confirm, haven't heard any of them proclaim that they're the only one who can defeat Martin O'Malley.    So is singing Uptown Funk.   So would they make them a wedding cake as long as they agreed to never adopt any orphans?    But do the hetrosexuals that don't support homosexuallity, support the homosexuals that don't support homosexual parenting?   Considering that a large number of right-winger who wouldn't find this unconstitutional, would never go to HuffPo for fear of having their information bubble burst, I would say it is.     Like Adam Walsh and Etan Patz?   But now with cloud storage....   You realize this means labor union bosses pay more income taxes than right-wing radio personalities?   Actually, there's very rarely black only events. Outside of "Miss Black America", I can't name any.   Anything found   through the ramblings of Jean Shepherd.   is gonna be good.    This is one of those show like Easy Aces, that mostly only appreciated by those who are smart enough to know when to laugh without being told.    Overall a good job and a good idea. You really do have a good voice for the medium. You should look in to an audio editor, like Audacity. It's free and easy to use and would allow you to record your show without the music and then add it in after to improve the audio quality.   So, your telling me that rich, bootstrapy job creators don't move to red states and cities with less taxes and less regulations?   So, if I go to Texas, I can open carry firearms in the House of Representatives?    Remember when /r/politics was crying that Obama was back peddling on his promise to get us out of Iraq?  RingoPendragon remembers.   I'm sure an endorsement from the former host of "The Man Show" will help Cruz with both Evangelical and women voters.   Complaining about the quality of a free public school lunch is like complaining about size of your apartment in in the government run housing project, isn't it?   	199
 Hold   No recess reference here? Dang. This is obviously swing kid all grown up.   I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds excruciatingly painful. Was it an LFT? That is a common liver test that can be indicative of gallbladder problems. Have they talked about having the dumb thing removed?   Meh, been better. I did well on my test this week (I'm in grad school), and got to go climbing tonight. But I was blind sided-ly broken up with by a girl I'd been seeing for 3 weeks. Things were going great until she went on a double date as a favor for a friend and decided to date the other guy instead :( Sorry to hear about the gallbladder attack, may I ask what is wrong? I am in the medical field and am naturally curious about this stuff.  	4

 You ... you are the keeper of the cheese! And I'm the lemon merchant!  Get it?  And Tiako knows it!  That's why he's going to kill us!  That's why we got to get loose, yeah?  Before he let's loose ... *the marmosets* ... on us!   Jed York is not the source of all our woes.  Harbaugh was too loyal to incompetent subordinates, all the retirements made sense even if unexpected, and all the trades or free agent losses made sense.  It's just that they all happened in a very short span of time.    The problem with the American left is that it's addicted to shortcuts.  No, the problem with the American left is that that the American right exists.  Those shortcuts are a necessary response to reactionary state legislatures dominated by an electorate of scared old Boomers who come out *en masse* in the mid-terms.   When posts have sections that one does not understand, one gets bored.  But if one simply skips over these sections and reads on, one will understand everything later.  As for practicing badhistory and good, it is good simply to imitate other redditors.  If you do this, you will change your flair, in time, naturally.   I don't read the script.  Script reads me.   If you were suddenly to change all this, deficiencies and distortions would appear here and there, where you least expect them.  This is worth thinking about.   Bone and bone, flesh and flesh, though we build cities and walls we remain creatures of the earth, approaching death, faced with our own mortality. The sword swings, the cow is cut, but the cow is a man not in fact but in truth.  So at this point you just started dropping acid?  Because I totally understand, if so.   Yes, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm right.  The U.S. has been keeping up a pretty strong air campaign against ISIS for a while now.  That's the opposite of "choosing not to act."   I don't know if you've been keeping up with current events (it seems unlikely), but we've been bombing the hell out of ISIS for a long time.   Nothing quite like having the KKK on your side.    Bristol in her own way wants the new child to grow up without the stigma.  Well, she'd have to change her last name for that.    I'd drop the hyper-commercialized, overpriced and under-hygienic  Disneyland (there are better amusement parks in California) and add the Exploratorium in its place, but otherwise a nice list.  Maybe substitute something with the Monterrey Aquarium, but I'm not sure what.       I'm partial to Kyrgyzstan.  I, too, look forward to the time when a team would trade a player for some vowels.   I'm not saying it's what happened, but the C-124 could have, just barely.    It doesn't  Feel free to tell us all about that time the U.S. defaulted on, well, *any* of its debt.   Looks like /r/TheRedPill sprung a leak.   I recognize it, but I've never used Shinola, preferring Kiwi, since I can get it anywhere.    about two brain cells away from a full lobotomy.  That pretty much sums up the Palin clan, though I wouldn't credit them as a whole with two entire brain cells.    Fuck that we have enough dead weight  You are, of course, referring to all the Republican states that take in far more federal money than they send back?  Because I'm sure that's what you must be talking about.    Your argument would be stronger if they didn't include other things besides slavery.  Ah, yes.  The declaration of secession very vaguely and briefly mentions other stuff.  Way to cherry-pick amidst the vast bulk and length of slave-owning causality.  Because, hey, it couldn't have been the thing that 80% of the declaration specifically talks about, it must have been that other 20%.    I can't really accept this seeing as how the states that left over slavery were all eastern states.  Pretty much all the states at the time were Eastern states.  You really need to change your name, because you completely fucking suck at history.    But for Texas and Virginia it was about nationalism.  What a load of complete horseshit.  Here's the declaration of secession of the state of Texas, which mentions the abolition of slavery about fifty times as the primary point of grievance:    Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?     The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States.     By the disloyalty of the Northern States and their citizens and the imbecility of the Federal Government, infamous combinations of incendiaries and outlaws have been permitted in those States and the common territory of Kansas to trample upon the federal laws, to war upon the lives and property of Southern citizens in that territory, and finally, by violence and mob law, to usurp the possession of the same as exclusively the property of the Northern States.     The Federal Government, while but partially under the control of these our unnatural and sectional enemies, has for years almost entirely failed to protect the lives and property of the people of Texas against the Indian savages on our border, and more recently against the murderous forays of banditti from the neighboring territory of Mexico; and when our State government has expended large amounts for such purpose, the Federal Government has refuse reimbursement therefor, thus rendering our condition more insecure and harassing than it was during the existence of the Republic of Texas.     These and other wrongs we have patiently borne in the vain hope that a returning sense of justice and humanity would induce a different course of administration.     When we advert to the course of individual non-slave-holding States, and that a majority of their citizens, our grievances assume far greater magnitude.     The States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa, by solemn legislative enactments, have deliberately, directly or indirectly violated the 3rd clause of the 2nd section of the 4th article [the fugitive slave clause] of the federal constitution, and laws passed in pursuance thereof; thereby annulling a material provision of the compact, designed by its framers to perpetuate the amity between the members of the confederacy and to secure the rights of the slave-holding States in their domestic institutions-- a provision founded in justice and wisdom, and without the enforcement of which the compact fails to accomplish the object of its creation. Some of those States have imposed high fines and degrading penalties upon any of their citizens or officers who may carry out in good faith that provision of the compact, or the federal laws enacted in accordance therewith.     In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.     For years past this abolition organization has been actively sowing the seeds of discord through the Union, and has rendered the federal congress the arena for spreading firebrands and hatred between the slave-holding and non-slave-holding States.     By consolidating their strength, they have placed the slave-holding States in a hopeless minority in the federal congress, and rendered representation of no avail in protecting Southern rights against their exactions and encroachments. They have proclaimed, and at the ballot box sustained, the revolutionary doctrine that there is a 'higher law' than the constitution and laws of our Federal Union, and virtually that they will disregard their oaths and trample upon our rights.     They have for years past encouraged and sustained lawless organizations to steal our slaves and prevent their recapture, and have repeatedly murdered Southern citizens while lawfully seeking their rendition.     They have invaded Southern soil and murdered unoffending citizens, and through the press their leading men and a fanatical pulpit have bestowed praise upon the actors and assassins in these crimes, while the governors of several of their States have refused to deliver parties implicated and indicted for participation in such offenses, upon the legal demands of the States aggrieved.     They have, through the mails and hired emissaries, sent seditious pamphlets and papers among us to stir up servile insurrection and bring blood and carnage to our firesides.     They have sent hired emissaries among us to burn our towns and distribute arms and poison to our slaves for the same purpose.     They have impoverished the slave-holding States by unequal and partial legislation, thereby enriching themselves by draining our substance.     They have refused to vote appropriations for protecting Texas against ruthless savages, for the sole reason that she is a slave-holding State.     And, finally, by the combined sectional vote of the seventeen non-slave-holding States, they have elected as president and vice-president of the whole confederacy two men whose chief claims to such high positions are their approval of these long continued wrongs, and their pledges to continue them to the final consummation of these schemes for the ruin of the slave-holding States.     In view of these and many other facts, it is meet that our own views should be distinctly proclaimed.     We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.     That in this free government *all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights* [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states.     By the secession of six of the slave-holding States, and the certainty that others will speedily do likewise, Texas has no alternative but to remain in an isolated connection with the North, or unite her destinies with the South.     For these and other reasons, solemnly asserting that the federal constitution has been violated and virtually abrogated by the several States named, seeing that the federal government is now passing under the control of our enemies to be diverted from the exalted objects of its creation to those of oppression and wrong, and realizing that our own State can no longer look for protection, but to God and her own sons-- We the delegates of the people of Texas, in Convention assembled, have passed an ordinance dissolving all political connection with the government of the United States of America and the people thereof and confidently appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of the freemen of Texas to ratify the same at the ballot box, on the 23rd day of the present month.     Adopted in Convention on the 2nd day of Feby, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one and of the independence of Texas the twenty-fifth.  Your slavery-apologia revisionism is a disgrace to America.   ... it's 15 now?    I have asked you to cite the federal power listed in the constitution that allows them to keep states in the union against their will.  ... Jesus Christ, just how many chromosomes are you missing?  The Constitution, by virtue of existing and having no secession clause, creates a binding compact.   You have also woefully misreported the 10th amendment.  Well, I guess either both I and 230 years of Supreme Court decisions are wrong, or someone who can't handle basic logic is wrong.  I mean, the Tenth Amendment relies upon assuming states being part of the existing federal framework.  What's so fucking hard to understand about that?   Uh, everything I've posted has supported my argument.  You've just repeated the same thing over and over like a parrot.  You haven't addressed ... well ... *anything*.   ... you're just not very bright, are you?    how does signing it mean you can never quit? Please cite this for me.  Because there's no mechanism for doing so.  It's a binding contract with no escape clause.  It actually specifically LIMITS federal power. It puts states rights OUTSIDE of federal jurisdiction.  Uh, yes.  But that federal jurisdiction is explicitly stated to exist in the first place.  The Tenth Amendment empirically acknowledges that states are a part of a larger federal framework.  Your argument undermines itself.   You're thinking of the HMS Rose replica.  The prime giveaway is the lack of a quarterdeck - Hermione is flush.    Seeing as there is nothing in the constitution to force a state to stay,  Except for, you know, *signing it*.  the 10th amendment is quite clear.  Tenthers are particularly stupid.  The Tenth Amendment doesn't validate either nullification or secession - it just says that the state can make laws, within the boundaries of federal jurisdiction.  You know, *within*, not *outside of*.    I asked for a citation from the Constitution.  Yeah, just keep shifting those goalposts.  There's no mechanism in the Constitution for secession, you know.  At all.   So you ignored the Supreme Court decisions cited, in favor of ... what?  Your *opinion*?  Just because you don't want it to be true doesn't mean it isn't.   Here are two /r/AskHistorians posts that sum it up better than I could:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3bav35/did_the_framers_of_the_us_constitution_discuss/cskujyc  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3bav35/did_the_framers_of_the_us_constitution_discuss/cskk0x5      a rebellion requires opposing existing controls, not resisting newly imposed controls.  No ... no, that's not right.  You're just making shit up.   One of the most drastic changes to come out of the war was the precedent that the US is like a street gang, you are never allowed to quit  That wasn't a change.  That was true from the ratification of the Constitution.    Or that it was a rebellion in the first place and not a secession movement.  ... it *was* a rebellion.  That's kind of the point.    Sounds like hot air used to diffuse the opinion that the north was waging a war of aggression  It was a political move, to ensure that Britain didn't side with the Confederacy.  But Lincoln needed a solid battlefield victory to do that.   Sometimes, history is re-written by the loser.  The Lost Cause apologists who insist slavery wasn't the motivation for the rebellion of the Confederacy are a prime example.   OK?  I'm not sure what your point is, but that's because I'm pretty sure you don't actually have one.    No other segment of society throws a parade to exhibit its most perverse membership.  You mean like beauty pageants?  Or Mardi Gras?  Or every other day of the year?   You sound bitter.  It's pretty sad.   "Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell," in perfect condition, for $.54 at the thrift shop.    Unfortunately, I just can't get into it - I've been reading the Aubrey/Maturin series for the past two weeks, and "Strange/Norrell" just seems a weak, uninspiring work by comparison when it comes to Napoleonic-era historical fiction.  Which is a shame, because it would otherwise be the kind of book I love.    How come when people desecrate the American flag and people complain, liberals shout "It's just a piece of cloth!"  Now that it is this piece of cloth liberals scream "RACISM!!! OPPRESSION!!!! BIGOTS!!!".  You seem to be deliberately misunderstanding the point - in *both* cases the flags in questions are *symbols*, to be treated as such.      I'm well aware of their capabilities, but the P-8 just lack the presence of the old Orions.  That's funny, I feel the same way about P-3s doing firefighting duty.  They just lack the presence of the old radial-engined WW-II era converted bombers.   Well, if you could tear yourself away from curling porn you might be able to keep up with current events.

When I lived in California, we would pack a suitcase full of Old Bay, Herrs Chips, Tasty Cake, and YooHoo whenever we came back for a visit.  You can get Old Bay and YooHoo in California.   The second half of Singletary's last season was pretty much the whole roster showing up for a paycheck.  Pretty sure Alex, PW, and Frank were the only guys out there playing like they meant it, and that was because all three of them were incapable of doing anything less.   Buffy the Vampire Slayer should not be relied on as a source of information about the climate of mid-19th century Ireland.  I'm glad we cleared that up.  Thank you.   ... oh, that clears a lot up.  I though OP was honestly asking about pork.   I had a Muslim room-mate in college.  He did the whole "praying five times a day" thing, though I don't think he ever quite figured out which way was east.  The rest of the time he partied, drank, and chased pussy.   I'm the liberalist liberal that ever liberaled, and I abso-fucking-lutely love our $13,000,000,000 floating death machines.   I like it.  Got a *ring* to it.   I loved Ultimatum, because it finally said "Fuck character shields," and just went with it.  The problem is that everything leading up to Ultimatum played by different rules - it was an about-face, instead of something established right from the beginning.   Besides Hot Pockets, which I pick up maybe two or three times a year, I'm not seeing anything there I don't already not buy.    Except the Marder and Nashorn were simple self-propelled anti tank cannons.  Aka, tank destroyers.    One small part in the war, where they were used as SCOUT vehicles, just as I said.  The Pz. Kpfw. I was still seeing frontline service as late as Africa in early '41.   The British and the Americans up until 1945 didnt have that excuse, when sending stuff like the Matilda I or the Chaffee.  The M-24 was a very useful light tank, fulfilling a particular role.  It saw even more service with the French in Indochina.   Don't forget that he's both an atheist *and* a secret Muslim.    Marxist   I'm completely certain that you don't even know what Marxist means.  Or Communist, or Socialist.  But you sure know you're supposed to call Obama one or all of them, just because.    why does he get a pass?  Because he's quoting someone else, in a fitting context.  Not a real challenging concept.   I died of cancer after reading that headline.      but its socially acceptable to go to work.  It's also financially necessary.

Not to mention that it's only for 2015, and it's not like communications between heads of state are the only type of diplomatic relations.    What was the point of the Panion Domin (his manipulation?)  The Pannion Seer was a creature of pure pain, and he wanted to spread pain and suffering for its own sake.   What was the point of Ruthald and his Cursed Sword?  We don't particularly know, but it doesn't seem relevant.   Who were the Strangers (the Jade things in the Sky)  The souls of the Crippled God's people, coming to find him and drag him back to their world.   What happened on the Moon?  Some of the Jade Giants ran into it, destroying it.   Why did the other gods destroy the Fallen God?  Why not?  They had their spheres of influence, and he was encroaching.   Why did the fallen god and the other gods become friends?  An alliance of mutual interest - he wanted to leave, and they wanted him gone.   What did the Fallen God do to the Otataral Dragon?  Nothing - that was Heboric, re-chaining the Otataral Dragon.   Why did the Fallen God get stabbed in the back by Cotollion?  Presumably because he couldn't leave in his corporeal form, and had to be freed from a physical body.   Who was trying to kill the Bridgburners? Tayschern turned out to be innocent.  The politics are muddled, but it wasn't so much the Bridgeburners as Whiskeyjack, whom the Empress viewed as a rival power.  Tayschrenn just wasn't good at court politics.   Why were Mallic Rel   friend get spared and become emperor?  Mallick Rel had corrupted the Claw, and his version of the Fall at Aren prevailed, making him out to be the hero.  Laseen couldn't compete with his influence.  These are just the questions off the top of my head, the author never explains anything and now he is selling more books? its just signs of a poor writer.  It's all explained pretty clearly.  It's more a sign of poor reading comprehension.   I'm not sure if "heart-wrenching" is the right word, but I've always loved this bittersweet quote from "Toll the Hounds" by Steven Erikson:   He hurried on, grimacing at the ache in his chest, still feeling the parting kiss of his wife on his lips, the careless hugs of his children round his waist.  He was a man who would never ask for sympathy.  He was a man who sought only to do what was right.  Such people appear in the world, every world, now and then, like a single refrain of some blessed song, a fragment caught on the spur of an otherwise raging cacophony.  Imagine a world without such souls.  Yes, is should have been harder to do.   Did you even read the article?????   Yes, it supports my point.   I'm not arguing whether it's a good or bad name, yes it was started by republicans, but when the admin then starts using the name.... It will stick  The name had already stuck, and was already in very widespread use as shorthand for the ACA, before the White House started using it as a positive.  The very article you linked to points that out.   The term "Obamacare" was in very wide-spread use before Obama himself ever said it.  It's use as a pejorative by Republicans for *five years* before he ever claimed the term for his own is what made the name stick.  Republicans *still* use it as an insult.    Colloquially it will forever be known as obamacare, BECAUSE Obama called it Obamacare...  Uh, no, that name was created by Republicans.    Should not have named it Obamacare in the first place  That was the Republican nickname for it, meant as an insult.   Triggered.   ... are you not familiar with the whole "Game of Thrones" franchise?    Well I mean, in the first book alone Crokus twice comes inches from death because of stupid decisions he made due to his infatuation with Challice and later Sorry, both times only surviving due to literal godly intervention.  Crokus in GotM is, IIRC, seventeen, so "stupid decisions due to infatuation" isn't a plot device so much as a very accurate reflection of real people.   Never thought I'd lose my appetite reading a headline involving eating bacon, but there it is.   EMSK is mostly aimed at trendy, office-dwelling suburbanites.    sometimes people misspeak.   When they do so on a very regular basis, it's stops being "misspeaking" and is a pretty good sign they just aren't very bright.   Probably as change from one of the villages in the Eld, which borders on Modeg.  Also, to go from Vintas to Ademre, he and Tempi would've passed through Modeg.   And that's why he needs to stay in the damned house.   Auri's gifts were specifically mentioned as being among the things he didn't take with him to Vintas, but left safe at Anker's.   I didn't say "all cops are highly trained," but it sure as hell makes it more likely the person will be more competent.    That having a gun, in a church, can be used to prevent a mass shooter from killing people, because that's exactly what happened in Colorado Springs.   That's not *exactly* what happened in Colorado Springs.  Jeanne Assam was a former police officer carrying out her role as a volunteer security guard.  This doesn't match up with the usual NRA "everyone's a potential Rambo!" wankage.    I watched it the last two days, and not once have they mentioned it being anything about religion.  http://i.imgur.com/6XUnNsg.jpg    I live in charleston and a lot of people are trying to make this out like this is a "vendetta against the Christians".  Fox News is pushing that one, too.  Some people are empowered by feeling persecuted.    a robbery / rape / stabbing problem that exceeds the US's 'gun problem'  [Citation needed]      can give the impression that collectively our nation is more violent than that of say, Europe.  It's not an "impression."  It's an empirical truth.  Only four European nations have a higher murder rate than the U.S. - Estonia, Belarus, Albania, and Moldova.   Wonder if there were any behind-the-scenes political strings pulled to cause this.    I'll take my private insurance any day when it comes to terminal illness.  Health insurance is not treatment.  Not to mention the fact that you can't die in a hospital if you can't get in the hospital for treatment to begin with.   I'm sure you can explain them.  Go head, fire away.    When you have to ration care, as is necessary under a socialized regime,  Ah, yes, as opposed to a capitalist regime, where health care isn't rationed *at all*, and mistakes never happen, certainly not to the tune of ~~35,000~~ 210,000 deaths a year.   We've been arming and training them for twelve years.   The Ademre's story from TWMF makes it clear that seven are remembered.  So it's probably six + Lanre/Haliax/Lanre.  Or the "six" number comes from Church storytelling, which is unreliable in a lot of ways.    a chaos following the game that leaves the bay with a crippled dystopian society.  We already have Oakland.    Blowing the leaves take twice as long as raking because the blowers aren't very good when the pile starts getting big.

Like #5, is anyone comfortable looking at all in that pic?   http://news.yahoo.com/us-warship-heads-yemeni-waters-block-iranian-weapons-182036698--politics.html  The actual article, not sure why OP posted to this   Nick is one of the most forgettable 1 dimensional character in the whole show. He just kinda shows up out of nowhere and I guess we're supposed to be interested in him. The other guys Robin dates at least make sense    Frisbee golf is super fun and free at most courses. And the discs cost like $10 and you only need one   Cleaning out the Buick Century I got from my grandma today   It has multiple levels at least   What I think will be crazy about this album is that it will span over a decade of rap styles. Or at least I assume it will?  Style from 2001 is clearly vastly different from now so we'll see   I actually wrote a research paper on this. Basically shoes have conditioned us to run heel first. But our feet are arched to absorb and release energy when our feet hit the ground, and it's much more natural to hit the ground with the balls of your feet first   They do play at surprise venues in Seattle quite a bit   Stop the fiiiight   This really is one of the most generic formats of a joke on all sitcoms   If you don't ctrl+alt+delete you're doin it wrong   Breakfast- I'm with the other guy, none  Lunch-Taqueria Chaparrito  Dinner-Sellas for a calzone  Bar-The Coug although I've been going to My Office alot lately  Dessert-Ferdinands, of course      I think most juniors and seniors tend to do better as you learn how to study n stuff. I did poorly with gen chem but much better with O chem. Plus it sounds like you're more interested now with your classes than you were before   I have an Arizona Tea hat. Not ashamed at all I love their drinks   Well tbh she just heard about the movie and that it had Leo in it, we hadn't seen the trailer or anything so definitely did not expect that   Religious mom, sex scene in every shot, coke snorting out of ass. Not something she would want to see   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-messenger/mdapmeleikeppmfgadilffngabfpibok  I've only had it a couple days. I can't think of any functions it doesn't have though   Sweet wallpaper alert   This looks even less like Robin than the first girl did   I just got Facebook Messenger (not supported by FB) and you can go to the options and have it pinned to your toolbar. I like it for talking to people without having to stare at facebook   I didn't get a cell phone til the end of freshman year of HS in  2008, granted I was later than most people. Girls still passed notes in class though all the way up through senior year   Nothin like burnt pizza with rubber cheese. The chocolate milk was good though   Wolf of Wall Street. With my mom. We never speak of it again      I really liked this episode the first time, but the replayability is low. They kinda beat the theme of it to death. Having to rewatch the same clips like 10 times over gets annoying especially when you already know what's going to happen. I guess it's a nice recap of the show though   time for /r/karmacourt then    In that case I'm pro at Mario Kart 64   I just realized, are you a sophomore? In which case nevermind   The toe thumbs give it away   Pretty sure it says in the confirmation email you got after you should have gone to the grad fair   I just wanted to help the little guy out of there. But I knew he had to do it on his own   Marshal being the only supportive person when Ted bought the house   I'd say anything in the limbs is fairly mild. The torso/abdomen region is when it can get gruesome with all the organs floating around   I can say it is much better than Reggie's   I call dibs on the delicious burger babies   Doesn't matter when your high off cocaine   Playing "American Pie" on the acoustic guitar at parties is lame  Playing piano at parties is very awesome    I know the cooking times and temperatures of all frozen pizza's here in the Netherlands.  You must be my roommate, except I'm in the US   Just wait til you're in grad school, you could write a thesis on this   Sleep all day, party never   Did anyone else read this at a million miles an hour?   More like what the heck is that thing?   "I'm a really famous vine poster officer"   I can get you free flights anywhere a certain airline flies  I'm also really generous with beer   At least you got a 56, better than many can say   I'm pretty sure there's more to their operation than what the photo suggests   Why are you banned from Walmart?      I saw that on my fb feed and thought "yet another news story direct from Reddit" Good job though   that seems huge. Is that from less gravity as Earth or just massive volcano?    /u/Trollabot zdhelix   Muttnik. It's the logo screen after every episode      Who thought "white with random color splotches" was a good tile color?   ===##   Probably because 1999 was most of these people's first actual memories   This is really helpful, especially for diagrams that help you learn concepts. Or Ochem structures or whatever. Also writing down notecards is good because you have the action of writing plus repetition later on   Can Jack Black please be in more/better movies   After Robin says they should go see Woody Allen Barney says "Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday."   Later Ted is explaining why Barney needs a win and Barney says "And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group."   It's not even a joke really but this is how HIMYM keeps you on your toes when you're watching.  There's stuff like this in just about every episode too   /r/theydidthemulletmath oh wait..   I'll actually have a fixed schedule next year so sure!   Do you have more rods than normal? Can you see better in the dark? Also since rods are usually in the periphery do you have more centered? Thanks!   I don't know what the future of NK holds but I feel like when it gets revealed of what happens there we'll be horrified   Tis better to have pressed than to have never pressed at all   Or subscribers   Next years tuition soo 20k?   #Teamtopbutton  Just kidding only with a tie  apparently hashtags mean bold in reddit   A real expendginger for the company   You can have mine. It's free+S H   Well he's saying how Elaine is going to "backslide" with David Putty. So he's sayin after they break up people hook up again later often   If it's carrying bubonic plague then yes   Great part of this is at the end when Barney says he went to MIT and Ted doesn't believe him, then realizes he has no idea where Barney went to college at.   Speaking of which, where did Robin go to college? I want to see College Robin!  ALL ABOARD!!   What can I say Reddit's a bunch of softies   Same here. Between that and glasses well you get the point..   My neighbor friends' phone numbers   chyup chyup chyup chyuuuuu   Gravity would now be one half its strength on each side probably   Reminds me of Dr Kelso telling the Todd we look but we do not touch   http://i.imgur.com/jxFwbe0.jpg  This is perfect. NSFW   or /r/eli5    "Will you (insert menial chore here) while I continue to do the exact same job as you are doing"   I love Marshal but I've always agreed with what you just said. A lot of the decisions that he makes do not make sense at all, especially him clearly being a smart person. Buying a house within a day of seeing it?  I never thought about the car money thing but that's also a good point   I'm 6' 150 and my arms are about that skinny   This is why I don't like texting people during the day. It just turns into 'what are you doing' every 20 minutes instead of just telling them what you did at the end of the day   If you had taken it with no hands I think you would've been golden   I mean like you meet someone at the bar,  get their number, then try and call them later. How did it go?   Bob Burnquist was the best. And Superman by Goldfinger all day   It actually did snow the other day at WSU but this doesn't look like Pullman at all      I live 10 minutes from Idaho. I know where I'm goin tomorrow   Bad experience?    Is it just me or did the 2nd windmill not actually touch it?   Even reheated coffee the same day is bad   I thought the rest of the gang's part in this was hilarious, especially drunk Ted and Barney leading the gang. I just thought Mickey's part was creepy and not realistic at all   That uniboob   M'Claren   I thought it was more the old style of things shining through the new design. I probably over-thought it though   This is one of my favorite episodes, mostly because of Puzzles. That whole story arc is funny. And Marshal telling the story while getting interrupted is good too   Yeahh thebutton is fun but there's like 10 subreddits for it now it's a little excessive    Ahh yes. So proud of my school for this one   I just saw it go all the way down to 12 s so who knows   The closest one on the right it has a very interesting nose   Cool! Any info on the planes in this pic?   Those could have valuable in store credit value!   This episode makes me think it would have been awesome if there would have been 1 episode for the other characters to tell the story instead of Ted, give us a little more insight to their personal thoughts. Especially Barney and Lily, they would be interesting.  So was this a platonic act done by Ted at the end?   No. Also they said they would serve anyone that came into their shop they just would not cater a same-sex marriage. I'd say that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. I can't believe how many people are up in arms against this   Red is more underused than some of these, seriously brown? I'd say teal, mint, orange would have been better advice   	110
 Im using the 960 just for premiere pro at a resolution of 2560x1600. I have gamed with it before, and it does run games like dota 2 and league maxed out at around 45-60 fps maxed out at native resolution. Triple AAA titles, not so much. Battlefield 4 is really only playable at 1600p at low/medium settings.   tl;dr: 1080p gaming: 960 would run all games (with a few exceptions) at ultra settings           1440p or higher: 970 (would run all games at 1080p on maxed out settings easily). Turn down some of the graphics settings if you are playing at 1440p.      plug the battery back in after doing so (if you didn't). unplug the machine, and hold the power button on the case for 15 seconds. Plug it back in and turn the machine on.    Try to find the BIOS battery and disconnect it. This will reset the BIOS settings (that battery still has power even after the power being off for a year).   I love them, my type of shoes. I really like the small logo on these type of shoes, [Just like these](http://www.endclothing.com/brands/new-balance-pre-orders/new-balance-m1500sb-made-in-england-m1500sb.html)   This has been happening to me too, couldn't find anything on google so I gave up on it.   There is a difference between recording 4k video, and recording quality 4k video.

He most likely moved while he was in contract for tv and internet and they served him the fee to finish out his contract.   You can build a piratebox! It is basically your own personal cloud that requires no internet service to connect to. It uses a wireless router that emits a wireless signal (~$70), a storage medium (usually a flash drive around 16-128gbs) and a rechargeable battery. Once you have it all set up and flashed the bios, you can set it up with or without a password for people to connect to. When you turn it on, it should emit a wireless signal that most devices can connect to (the same way you connect to a wifi signal) and upload or download files that are stored on the hard drive. It is definitely a nice addition if you want to start a little intranet at your school for people to get answers to homework, or listen to that new song everyone has been talking about it and it happened to be uploaded by somebody around the premises.   edit: Also, there is no app the devices have to download to upload or download files. You go to the internet browser on the device and the page that is pushed out by the piratebox automatically loads so it is web based. No downloading required. [Here is more information on what a piratebox is and what it does in more detail](http://lifehacker.com/5746102/build-a-pirate-box-for-mobile-and-secure-file-sharing)  	8
 I'm regretting having ever introduced this to you all. It would have never been shared with the world if not for me. It would have stayed hidden in the shadows. in the dark.  I don't know what's going to happen to all of you. The purpose of this website remains a mystery, but if it was only meant for me it wouldn't have been online. There was no need for a website if not to be shared. Someone wants me to scream for help and I have no choice but to do so.   This is very helpful Ra1n. I'm sorry you had to go to the site at all, and I know there are many others who are too afraid to go there (for good reason). Maybe a breakdown is exactly what everyone needs.   I'm so sorry, I don't know what I've done linking you all to the site. It could be anything, from the sound of a whisper to that guilty feeling that arises from nothing. I don't know what it leads to. Please stay with me.   Thank you for the support bunnieh. I need encouraging words right now. The first thing I thought was whether the bridge could be rebuilt, but no matter how I look at it the river is just too wide. A small glimmer of hope just shattered.   It seems to be a sort of e-pamphlet. Everything in it just fills me with fear and questions. I wish I hadn't found it.  	5
 Definitely no.  Not at the price we have Collins at for the next three years.   Obviouysly it was not an era.  The Machida era more accurately was his ascension to the title, and not after that.  Joe Rogan's excitements goes over board a lot, and MMA fans seem to love it and just play with it, more often than not.   Rank the fighters he fought in that time period.  Then give us the records of any fighter with a comparable record not named Jon Jones.   The only solution is for him to fight Vitor.  Cheeus vs. gay Jesus.   Honestly, at this point, any headshots seem like they will take him down.   "umm, Mr. Romero has expressed his concern for the direction of the country..."   Don't be such a racist.  They have malls there that need protecting, you fucking bigot!      i lost this round      **SEE ALL YOU ISLAMOPHOBES!!  THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD WASN'T A PAEDO!  HE WAS JUST GOING WITH THE TIMES!!!**   But when she was sick and needed the best western medical care, that was different, right?   only slightly   by toys he means cocks   Are people forgetting that Hitchcock turned Modano into a defense first player, causing his offense to drop significantly?   She needs a burkha   *elitism intensifies*      Dirk is Love   damn   So he's gonna kill Drogon and Dany, right?  That seems to be his story arc.   The north sees Russia from it's porch.   JUST BLEED BRO!!   Bro, I was so hyped about the Machida era, I was honestly thinking he would retire with like a 30-0 record.   These first inning props are the funnest bets to make now.   Seems like they are intentionally doing it to him for some reason.  Obviously that's not the case, but that's my conspiracy.  Dana is anti-Machida.   Yeah, Jon baited Rua into that.  Zingano flew directly at Honda, right?   yes it does   we lost him   Could you make the image smaller?  I almost read some words.   I want to use this shake as a meal replacement, but not for all three meals, like the website suggests.  Maybe one or two meals a day.  My question is, is this too good to be true?  All the nutrients we need for a keto diet in a simple shake?  There's not uch information on the website, so I don't know where else to turn.  Asking the company itself to critique their product seems counter productive.    I do not   yeah, work sucks   Thanks for the response.  I kind of want to track different people, so now, you're on the list.   Could you elaborate?   Is there any more information than "trust us, we'll make good picks"?      And save the receipt.   Good boy   I was really hoping for a dickbutt AK47   [op](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/5b/5bc63af58a7458e438f4ef2d3ec20876e302c4a586105cdd3491670522ee1727.jpg)   I work in downtown with about 15 Filipinos.  I just sent this to the network printer and am just gonna leave it there.  Pretty sure they'll all flip.   He'll probably try to bully Aldo into a bad fight and have him fight injured, and then call him a pussy in public, like he did with Shogun/Glover a while back.   Nobody's, gonna say anything, about, that comma?   I Just want him to Rock Bottom jabronis in all his movies.   There is an are in between throwing the book at someone and being unreasonably lenient.  And leniency is almost always shown to rich kids, not the poor.  That's whet gets people upset.  Knowing that if they were in the same position, they would not get a 2 year rehab sentence with 10 year parole.   Yeah, that's the stupidest thing I've read in regards to this case.  Since when is the legal system supposed to pity someone's upbringing when doling out justice?  Oh yeah, when they're rich as fuck, that's when.  Poor person with shitty upbringing/bad parenting background commits a crime?  Throw the fucking book at him.  Whoever gilded that retarded ass comment is a fucking moron.   You just didn't even try, did you?   now's fine   Good god, consider the fucking source, OP.  This site is batshit crazy right wing propaganda at its finest (or worst, I don't know, whatever).  Hell, FOXNews would be a more reputable source than this bullshit.   Who will ever know?   Oh yay. ESPN covered nudity.    Thanks for updating your results.   rollin dubs   such transformation   Forcing her to pay money she legally owes is **RAPE**.  And if you disagree, you are a rapist!!  Don't anyone DARE try to hold glorious leader accountable for her actions!   This is sickening.  My only hope is that the IDF doesn't use this as an excuse to go all ham on people not involved.   Those seem kind of like filler words that don't really mean anything.  Maybe in his era, doing what you love could keep you happy and fed, but rarely is that the case today.   Those damn black muslim commie antichrist presidents!  When will people stop electing them?   The Longest Yard?   oh, your friend is 2009 popular culture?   why?   /r/itdoesntmatterhowoldyouarethisisretarded   Bovada's late lines are the bane of my existence   SHAME!!   God damn. Reem was owning, too.   oh   /r/TeamWhiteWalker    Where is the fucking downvote button?   Yes.   You know what gets cut.  Social safety net programs.   Daniel Day Lewis ain't got shit.   TOO LOW!!!   well, obviously   Hey, that's not a real website!  You're a phony.  A big fat phony!         At this rate, Olly is gonna double murder Dany and Drogon.   no fucking way...is that fan fic?   **ALL YOU CIS SCUM MISOGYNISTS!!!  YOU JUST WAIT UNTIL ELLEN PAO GETS IN HERE AND BANS YOU ALL FROM THE INTERNET!!!**   So the whole fucking narrative changes to defend the girl?   Really?  Well, fuck me, then.   Oh absolutely it's better than 90% of what's out there.  I'd even bump it up to 99%.  When I said I was disappointed in HBO's writers, it was in comparison to their own work, not others.  They've set such a high standard for themselves, I felt that they didn't live up to expectations.  It's the old Soviet factory problem.  If you work too hard, the boss expects more of you each time.   What a stupid fucking third grader.  Let's burn him alive as an offering to the one true god.   Shows like Deadwood and The Wire were near perfect.  Probably because it was original writing, and not an adaptation, I guess.   The last two seasons of GOT are enough to make me start losing faith in HBO writers.   It's overused as fuck on reddit.   What do you think of the Character "Sugar" on Cinemax's show Banshee?   LOL at the people thinking some intense badass like Vin Deisel or Jason Mamoa would be a good Shadow.   HBO's tv writers seem to take too many liberties with book adaptations.   Boss also had the problem of going up against a much more hyped up House of Cards.  Sort of a Deep Impact vs. Armageddon scenario.   Damn.  That's disappointing.   Is 99 Pedro the GOAT?   What is the law of the land?  I just thought that was a movie expression.   Why don't people finish their sentences anymore?   To fully embrace "The Jagr," Gore is gonna have to play for at least half the league.  At least.   Oh my god, how fucking seriously they take their social justice bullshit.  Crime?  Labeling any perceived offense as a crime?  And they are the arbiters of justice now?  It's up to them to decide guilt of their perceived crimes?  Fucking CRIMES?  Crime:  feelings were hurt.  Punishment:  ruin this person's life.   ITT:  Everybody knowsfor a fact that Lebron is being a douche on purpose, and not joking around with the opposing team's ball boy, like ALL OTHER SUPERSTARS DO,      New Sidebar?   What if someone gets offended and feels unsafe?   Do any of them do anal?      What's the difference between magnesium, magnesium citrate, and magnesium oxide?  All three are sold by the same manufacturers at health stores.   Lol, yeah, lots of butthurt from the fanboys.  It was just a poorly written show about a bunch of douchebags.   Motherfucker re-hosted the image.  My link was not purple, so I clicked.   You're better off fast forwarding to the good parts.      Jon Stewart DESTROYS conservatives with his EARTH SHATTERING DEVASTATING LOGIC!!!   He wrote a comment about Machida, so there's that.      I've read some material saying that keto is ok for diabetics, and people with kidney stones are not in any danger on this diet.  But those seemed to be opinion pieces.  Are there any hard scientific sources supporting a ketogenic lifestyle for someone with kidney stones who is borderline diabetic?  My neighbor fits into this category, and I don't want to give him wrong information.  He's been making great progress, but he told me he is pre-diabetic, has kidney stones, and gets occasional gout flareups.  He's so far done it by plain old calorie restriction, but now he wants to cut out carbs all together.   Waiting to rip it off and reveal an NWO shirt   Is this really more important than the Penis Mightier?   It works in so many levels!   Honda   Consummation occurred at age 9 as per Aisha's own testimony.   No.  I should have added /s      Wait, I thought that was capitalism.   Too many.  This is one of those bands whose albums are solid A+ from start to finish.      Well, the prophet, who is the ideal for mankind, did marry a 6 year old girl and consummate the marriage when she turned 9.  You know, when she was ready.  Oh, and he also forbade adoption because he wanted to marry his stepson's wife.  God ordained it, so it must be.   He's actually pretty decent on screen.  You realize how fucking big he is when he's on camera with the two main protagonists of the shot.   Why u so sexy, Machida?   it was fucking purple, and i still clicked   Bullshit   please use a more shadowy picture.  I almost saw something.   The circle of life.   Don't you dare blame me for my mistake!   I hate this cult if victimology that has been embraced by society. Nothing is ever anyone's fault.  No, OJ, it's not your fault. Nicole repeatedly ran into your knife. No, Osama, it's not your fault. Those pilots veered off course (plus jet fuel).    MMA MATH BRUH. COME AT ME!   MATT HAMMIL GOAT 4 LYFE!!!!!   Unless he loses a filler match.  Anyone remember Gus/Rumble?   **NEEDS MORE JPEG!!!**   Please, OP, we need more pixels, and preferably, a smaller sized pic as well.   Stockton, bitch.   Yes, 30 years ago, while they both had good jobs, they should have anticipated corporate downsizing decades in advance. Got it.   Do you have any idea how many people sacrifice their health for work because they HAVE to?  They provide for their families, pay for their own health insurance, and what not.  People will willingly work themselves to death to provide for their loved ones.  My mother worked two retail jobs to provide for her three children.  My father, still at age 70, drives 2 hours to work and back to support my mother and himself in their retirement years.  I send them whatever money I can from my own paycheck.  Their health is definitely affected.  What, pray tell, are their options?   I love idiots like that.  "hurr durr just leave, nobody is forcing you to work there.  get a better job.  just go out and do it!  it's that easy."   well, for those five years, i'll still use amazon   Only if they could ripoff whatever original design he came up with.   Lebron made it on 5 covers   Isn't he though?  What else do they have in their history more significant?  edit: Lol at all the butthurt Wizards fans.  Even with their championship and handful of great players, all of that combined pales in comparison to being associated with the most well recognized pro athlete in the history of this game.    This is some KenM level trolling right here   that's some [10] guy shit right there   Perfect, I'll inject mountain dew directly into my neck in front of my LAN buddies.  They will cower in fear.  Or defeat me with their superior immunity   imagine?   OMG your June numbers.  You poor bastard.  May God have mercy on your soul.   The misspelling of bodies does it for me.   Fuck this stupid chuck norris shit   Banned for harassment   Stone cold   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MACHIDA ERA?!?!?!?!  IT'S STILL GOING ON, RIGHT?  WE'RE STILL IN IT?   This is actually the only thing that I want now.   HOW CAN YOUR EYES BE LIKE ARPEGGIOS IF MIRRORS AREN'T REAL?!?!?!?!   Still waiting on the Penis Mightier   He was actually referring to the fact that the creator of imgur is a redditor, who explicitly created imgur for reddit.   no, stupid!  you only protest false rapes   Thanks, Hunto!   So, that would make three.  Two to the hands, one to the feet.   The only real rape that actually occurred in all of this.   So they stalked Gaben and decided to crash his party or something?   I have  a 2010 Legacy, which I love, but wanted to see about trading it in for the 2015 model.  Basically, there is nothing new here.  A little bluetooth here, some rear camera there, and that's it.  I thought that a 5 year break in between models would offer significant upgrades, or at least changes.  Everything seems the same, or just negligibly improved.  Even the gas mileage is the same.  NO IMPROVEMENTS TO MPG IN 5 YEARS?  No other car company has stagnated like that.  I guess I'll keep this one for another 120,000 miles.  	163
 I stayed lucid for, what felt like, hours. That's not a problem it's just control the dream and the environment.   Eviiiil!    In general, when you're at school or shopping or basically anywhere out of the house.   No, there's vehicles, you can explore pretty amazing maps and the areas aren't linear as you can tackle most using different means for example you could drive in and be loud or sneak in and be quiet. It's really fun!   Generally yes. Some people take 90 but it can take between 60 and 120.   How big of an inconvenience has having diabetes been for you?   YES! Halo has an incredible storyline and great characters!! One of my all time favourite games!   Kanye west, he'd make a HUGE deal about it!!   Ha, ha :)   Ha, ha if you look you can still see some people's faces!!   I never made the picture, just saw it online and grabbed it :(      Lets agree to disagree.   Structure yes, plot no. Structure- like you said smart and dumb physical and weak outcasts and have to work to get back on top yes but they have a different storyline and you're confusing that (plot) to be the same when it's the structure.   Like the lion king, frozen and the hunger games then. They aren't the same but have similar structure.   Ha!   Back then women were seen more as objects than people. They were there to feed the family, keep the house inviting and raise the children. Nothing more, they were essentially second class when compared to men. So it was thought that the younger the girl the more children she can have.   This goes back further, if you look at ancient greece women were not to dabble in mens affairs (yet at the same time in troy women were living the life of luxury!!).   Of course society progressed, things like medicine and science with it. It was realised a girl should be able to grow before birthing a child. Almost 100 years ago there were many womens rights movements like the suffragists and suffragettes. They campaigned for a womens right to vote. When they eventually gained this many continued to work after the war, even though many men thought they should be at home. It eventually became the womans choice if she wanted to work or if she wanted to give birth or both.     Not really. In MU they go to university because they're that age. In 21 js they go undercover.   Literature, ha! I never found that in-game, funny that they added it.   It's upbto you. To be honest I wouldn't get it permanently done. I pressume you're a woman? (Correct me if I'm wrong). If you shave I'd just stick with that cause you might want to grow it back in the future. But again, it's up to you.   Ha, ha! What game is this... eh I don't want to pl- play it. A friend asked me to ask you. Yea- yeah that's what happened a friend asked me to ask you. It was a friend... not me. A friend.   There's going to be a million "dick size" comments here.   Do reality checks throughout the day (I cover my nose and mouth) if you keep doing it you get in the habbit then if you do it in a dream you'll know you're dreaming. For example, I cover my mouth and nise but in dreams I can breathe when I do that so I realise I'm dreaming.  This [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream) might help you.   Keep a dream journal and when you wake, lie for a few minutes and think about your dream then write as many facts as you can remember down this will make future dreams more vivid.  Enjoy LD they are awesome!    Hey, I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/3ds0j8/i_want_to_lucid_dream_but_im_terrified_of_sleep/) yesterday, explaining that I was terrified of SP so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who answered, I feel a lot less worried about it now.  So before I start I want to say I used to LD  as a child but never really knew how I was doing it or what was going on.  I had my first DILD (in years) last night. It was pretty cool, I was in water and realised I could breathe with my hand over my mouth and nose (my favourite reality check). I knew I was dreaming so I could now control myself but i couldn't control the area around me or do anything (like flying etc). Then I started doubting that I was dreaming and my mind kept going back and forth but I knew I was when I realised how weird my location was and that I could still breathe with my hand over my mouth. No other reality checks that I did worked (e.g putting my finger through my hand). Any way the dream lasted for a pretty long time which was cool but I was wondering how I can better control my environment in dreams and how I can do things like fly. I read that you just jump and imagine you're flying or close your eyes and imagine then when you open them you will but that never worked.  So how can I better control my dream environment?  Fly?    Thank you!!    I actually managed to have a DILD last night when I did a reality check (covered my mouth and nose and could still breathe) no sleep paralysis!! Can you get SP through DILD or just WILD? I couldn't fully control the dream however. I could control me and knew I was dreaming but I couldn't change my surrounding (very easily) or fly etc.   Ha, ha!! :D   I managed to have an LD last night infact (no SP!!) But it was strange, I knew I was dreaming and could control myself but I couldn't controk the area around me or fly etc?      If thay happens you can forcefully wake yourself or make it change (difficult).   Lucid dreaming is when you realise that you are dreaming and can go on to control what happens in your dreams. People can train themselves to lucid dream by doing "reality checks" throughout the day.   r/casualconversation great bunch of people, very friendly.   Try taking a cold shower. I know it sounds taboo but it wakes you up, energizes you and makes you feel aware. Definitely worth trying but be careful if you have any breathing conditions.   If they gave consent before hand I don't see why not but if they have to get permission from their lawyers or they just do it it's unethical since the actor or actress may not have liked the project.      We aren't prepared. We aren't prepared!! What if they use a hoover?! Those damned feline fanatics might wish they were like our brethren but they have wits! We mustn't underestimate them!   Damn it! Get me dogfort we need to organise before an attack of this magnitude!   Wow. Sounds like there's something else. You handled it pretty good. When she cools down talk to her and see what she says.   But still what you're saying is wrong.   Honestly well done! You could have fapped and you chose not to.    Good post but there are many other types of people and reasons for joining nofap around here. I get that you're making a point but still...   Maybe you shoukd see a doctor. I don't want to sound mean or rude but I don't think nofap alone will help this.   Ha, ha I thought that was it but I've seen a lot of people complain about it while on hard mode   Yeah, the US tried to stay out of it. It was mainly a European conflict but of course the US and other countries got sucked in.   From what I know the flatline is when you have almost no libido. So should this not make this period easier? Unless I'm wrong and it's a period of high libido then I don't understand why so many people find it to be a period of difficulty.   I once fell in a pile of cow shit! Having a huge phobia of germs I ran home and showered for hours on end, got out bathed, showered again and then dried off. Even though I was fully clothed when it happened. Needless to say the clothes went in the bin.   Yeah it's like what happens if he gives him a hug or whatever. They're meh, derp.   I saw this a long time ago and laughed my ass off!   Walking. When I feel an urge, for the last few days I've got teady and taken the dogs for a walk. They enjoy it and it stops me from doing anything I'll regret.   That's to bad. Maybe you should try going back to warm and then in a week or two try cold again?   Awesome, count me in!   You too, stay strong. It's good that you stopped.    Hey man, good job. It's not easy to do that kinda thing. It'd be cool if you could post another picture (along side these two) in two months and show us your progress :)   Okaaay.    Did you "finish" if not I wouldn't reset, it's called edging but don't do it again. It's one of the worst things you can do since your basically teasing yourself.   Glad to hear it. Stay strong brother.   Ha, ha I'm literally just out of one. I think that's going to become my new norm.   Sure is, I heard it years ago but figured I'd post it anyway.   The Scotsman opens his lunch and says:  'Fur fuck sake if ma wife makes this pish again am gonnae jump aff this buildin'  As he looks at his ham sandwich.  Then the Englishman exclaims:  'Oh bloody hell if me wife makes this rubbish again I shall jump off of this building'  As he looks at his pickle sandwich.  Then the Irishman opens his lunch and says:  'If I get this again I'll jump off this building'  As he looks at his cheese sandwhich.  The next day they stop for lunch:  The Scotsman exclaims:  'Dumb bitch made this shite again, see yees later' and he jumps to his death.  Then the Englishman:  'Bloody hell, cheerio ol' chap' he waves to the iriishman and promptly jumps to his death.  Then Irishman:  'Ah well. It had to be cheese didn't it?'  And he jumps to his death.   The three wives are friends and decide it's fitting to have a joined funeral.  As the Scotsmans wife and Englishmans wife mourn their husbands the Irishmans wife walks past them laughing in fits of hysteria.  This confuses them so they ask what's so funny to which she replies:  'My husband made his own sandwiches!!'   Ha, ha funny (I'm scottish) :D   Ha! Sick but ha!   Most people think it takes anywhere between 60 and 120 days, the most common being 90.   And you (yes you, I'm going to call you Mrs Pennyapple (I don't care if you're a guy you are now Mrs pennyapple)) are trying to fix that problem  I'm not going to try and say something inspirational, there are a bunch of posts there that we can all use but I am going to say well done. If you were to ask any guy to stop masturbating they'd probably laugh in your face (poor Mrs pennyapple) and if they did give it a shot they'd probably last a day and then give up and make a joke about how heavy their balls feel. But you, Mrs Pennyapple have realised and are trying to better yourself. So even if this sub is considered "weird" or "gay" or "culty" it doesn't matter because you are changing yourself for the better and they aren't. Well done Mrs Pennyapple.  Yes I posted this last night but I thought I'd add to it. Some of you aren't just struggling with PMO. You might be trying to quit weed, or videogames or maybe you want to lose weight. Yes this sub is called r/nofap but you, Mrs Pennyapple, have realised the issues affecting you and your family and friends and even if you fail at least you are making the effort to better yourself. So if you don't lose that extra belly fat, if you do play a videogame, if you do smoke a joint, if you do fap. At least you can say you tried. Yes you might fail but if you do pick yourself up and try again. Don't let it hold you back. Almost everyone here has relapsed at one point or another. Do you think those that have made it too 800 days just did that? No! They struggled and fought and made themselves do it and so can you. Keep going and you will get there, if it takes 90 days or 900 don't stop untill you reach your goal, whatever it may be.   Catholic here, hey. You're making the right choice. There are a few ways that can reassure you when you think of porn:  * Think of what a lot of those poor women have gone through. While many do it "for fun" a lot of pornstars were abused or are very poor. It's not nice to watch a woman struggling through life have sex on camera.  * it's essentially filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Hopefully the answer is no, so why watch others?  * Sex should be private not something for the whole world to see.   These make me think of why porn is so bad. If you do get a serious urge there are a couple of ways you can get rid of it:  * Meditate - This is VERY useful. Meditation can help you become calm and relaxed and get rid of stress (and urges). Here is a [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) that explains some basic meditating techniques.   * Do something. Urges normally come when you have free time so take that time and use it constructively. Read a book, learn an instrument, exercise do anything to get your mind off of it.   * All else failing install a porn blocker and randomise the password then when you get an urge put some ice cubes down your pants (this is only good at home not in public or at anyone else's house). The coldness really helps get it down. Finally if everything else has failed tell yourself you don't want to watch porn and then go for a cold shower. Seriously it helps.   Good luck.    I know but who cares?    Ha!   It's a website (obviously). You subscribe to subreddits which interest you (like r/gaming or r/baseball etc) there is a subreddit for virtually everything!   Here you can talk to people with similar interests as you, trade things, ask questions (as you have done so eloquently yourself) and more!     Wow! Congratulations!! That's fucking awesome!   You have to try them! I've heard people talk about them since I started nofap in January and last night I said fuck it. It was a pretty cold night so I wasn't sure it was a good idea but I went for it. Holy shit. It felt great, freezing, but great. Definitely try it if you haven't already.   No. A lot of people here have SO's. It's only an issue if you want to do "hard mode" (no porn, masturbating or sex). If you would like to do that you could tell your SO about nofap. But if you decide not to it's perfectly ok to have sex.   Craigslist is evil!   Oh my god 1.5tb of porn!? Well done for deleting it. Good luck on your journey. You did the right thing to delete all of that shit.    Ha, ha! I came here to try and tell you to stay strong or harden up etc but you got me! :D   When I get an urge I do one of two things:  1). Meditate. I use breathing meditations. It clears your mind of all thiughts (including urges) and is very effective. It's a very basic begginers guide but if you'd like to try it you can [read this wikihow article.](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) Like I said, it's basic but it can help you get started. Visualisation is also very useful. Lot's of people imagine that there problems are a balloon or a rock etc and they let them go or throw them away. It sounds very silly and childish but it does work.  2). If I can't meditate I change the subject in my head immediately! I don't care what too, straight away I think about school, tv, my doys! Anything that works!  Good luck, the fact that you've gone an entire day with it in your head and bot done anything about it is an achievement in itself. Just keep going.    Ha, ha    Her shit smells as bad as mine and no one's too good for me.  I like that. Thanks for the encouragement.   Ha, ha good luck Mrs Pennyapple!   I think it's because it's the social norm. It's often encouraged and people say it's healthy. Which I suppose in moderation (1-2 times a week, without porn) it could be. Peopl think because something's normal or acceptable it's ok or healthy but, like I said in the pist, I bet more guys have an addiction and don't even realise it. If they stopped I doubt they'd last.   Wow. Thanks!! :D   But you (yes you, I'm going to call you Mrs Pennyapple (I don't care if you're a guy you are now Mrs pennyapple)) have realised that you have an addiction.   I'm not going to try and say something inspirational, there are a bunch of posts there that we can all use but I am going to say well done. If you were to ask any guy to stop masturbating they'd probably laugh in your face (poor Mrs pennyapple) and if they did give it a shot they'd probably last a day and then give up and make a joke. But you, Mrs Pennyapple have realised and are trying to better yourself. So even if this sub is considered "weird" or "gay" or "culty" it doesn't matter because you are changing yourself for the better and they aren't. Well done Mrs Pennyapple.    Thabks for answering. Enjoy work!  :)   I mean legend, anniversary and underworld.   Or oblivion or tomb raider    Almost everyone loves McDonald's but there is a definite stigma (in some areas) for people that work there. Do you feel there is a bad view for employees?      I like a "natural look". Skin coloured foundation and lipstick (I hate red lipstick on a girl). I also like dark eyeliner.   Ha, ha!   I know right.   Thank you. I did go outside and I'm going again soon. It's just walking my dogs instead of my brother doing it but it's a start. Ive played xbox today (playing it now) but I liked that article. Today I got up first thing, cleaned my room, ate breakfast and went a walk. As far as real life friends go, I had a great group but moved a while back. I have friends here but... meh. I don't know it's not the same. Plus when I did hang out with them after school one of them always wanted to talk about porn, gaming and masturbating so I think it's best I stay away from him.  I'm going to start writing again (I used to write fanfics). I don't think I can get rid of my xbox(s) but I'm going to play them less and less.    Hiya!! I'm Devlin, I'm 16. I love writing, tv, movies, books, gaming and music but I have a passion for history. I could talk about it forever (but I won't). I'm on kik:  DevlinFr3w99  Just send me a message here or there and we can talk :)   Bow and arrow. Replaying every game in the tomb raider series (yet again) and I'm on the reboot so I guess I'd use the signature weapon.      Hey, it's great that you're trying. I'd say the best thing you could do is 'cut out' these friends or tell them that you're trying to quit:  (1) Cutting them out:  This is extremely difficult and a hard choice to make but you should ask yourself a few questions:  A). Are they toxic?- - -Is there any possible way I can be around them and not smoke weed?  B). Are they really friends? - - - I don't know how far back you guys go back but ask yourself if they're really friends. One way to do this is to think if they've been there for you during hard times.  C). Would your life really change without them?  (2). Tell them you're trying to quit. If they're your friends they'll understand and won't get high when you're there, maybe they could quit with you?  I know better than anyone how hard it can be to make friends (past experiences) but it's possible. I don't know how old you are. If you're in high school try joining a club or finding people with similar interests as you. If you aren't in school or college try going online and meeting people in your area, this one can be a bit awkward but it's possible.   Also pot isn't actually addictive, it has no addicive properties other than the fact that you enjoy it but it doesn't have addictive properties like heroine.   Good luck and you're doing great quiting porn and going even further by quiting weed. Great job so far!!         Ha, ha someone else already asked but sure go ahead :)      Maybe it's not for you. That's fine, you can continue fapping but if you do I'm asking you not to watch porn. It sets unrealistic standards for what men expect, many of the women were/are sexually/physically/emotionally abused (I know lots aren't but you never know what people have gone through). It's someone's daughter, if you have one really think about what you would feel like if someone was fapping over her. Of course it's up to you but those are the negatives to porn.   Don't get me wrong I am not depressed. I love life but I've taken a look at it and I feel empty. I don't know if that's the right word. For context I'm in my teens, high school, and I feel like I've wasted this summer holiday. I've lain around the whole time on xbox and I've done nothing that'll make it memorable. I love gaming but I just find it so boring (I have for the last two days). I've never felt this way before.   I keep saying I'm going to go outside a little more each day (since I spend a lot of time inside but I have asthma and it got pretty bad the other week to the point were I could barely breathe. I know I'm using that as an excuse since I feel much better now. I'm going to go outside tomorrow 100%  I can't really describe this but I feel angry since I know I failed my exams. I haven't had the results yet but I failed the mock exams which should've been a wake up call but... here I am. I can still pas  if I really focus next year.   I realise this is just a rant but I don't know what to do. For the first time in years I'm really, really bored. Xbox normally keeps me happy and failing that a good book or movie but nothing's working!   I have to thank nofap, however. I started this In January and have had some pretty good streaks but then I've quit and came back a few times. This is the first I've felt like this and even though I don't like it now I'm glad I do because I can see that I need to get my shit together. I've also meditated on and off but I'm back on that, thank you nofap. I intent to fix all of this crap. Tonight I'm turning off my xbox, going to sleep and waking up fresh and ready for whatever I decide to do first.    Ha, ha awesome. I wonder what he went on to do.   Ha, ha prove it! Marry me?!   Ha, ha female humans, do you enjoy this "subreddit" on the internet machine at the domain which your species calls "reddit?"   Yeah, I did. I really just said "gals".   So-so sometimes it's organised an  fun others not so much. Cyrodiil is also a great place to quest but also dangerous. You don't need a group but I recommend one.      When in pvp stay with other players. If you go off on your own you will likely fie. Th  larger the group the better. Try and fight others around your level, that's not to day don't figbt back against a higher level but don't actively seek them out.   Use all of your offence and defence abilities. A good idea is to have your main hand for offence and your second hand (unlocked at level 15) for defence.   Practice makes perfect. Th  more you play the better you'll get.   I'm the youngest of 6 children so my mum was in her early 40's at the time and my dad his late 40's. I honestly don't remember most of the dream that vividly but I remember the fear the room gave me and when my mum told me she had it too. I mainly remember the cloak and choking.   Yeah, I'm flattered. I never really thought much of it. Use a head.      This is my exact post from r/paranormal can anyone tell me ***anything*** about what this could mean?  When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey). The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room: My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing. The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do. One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said: 'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream' She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away. The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt. EDIT 1: So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon. EDIT 2 So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today.   Wow. In my dream I lost my breath in the room aswell and he, I call him he but most of his face was covered by the cloak, just began relentlessly choking me. I wonder if they were to do with the house?    Could you link me to the app?   Awesome. Enjoy it and stay safe out there.   Ha, ha good one :)   Can I ask: how did you do that? Drawing? Computers? Either way thank you so much!!   Oh my god that is so fucking awesome, thank you!! :D   I've started looking into it, I'll keep you all posted :)   Ha, ha I doubt it'd be very interesting just an old house with a cold room and some creaky floors :) I'll see what I can find out about it though.    No. Not since I moved. She never had it blessed and while she doesn't talk about it a lot I know my mum's had some paranormal experiences. I checked and the house was built during world war 2.    I could check. I know some people that live near there. I never really thought about it. I've wondered if I maybe caused it. At the time I was maybe eleven? Twelve? One of them and I ha  been reading (quite a bit about astral projection). I decided (because of religious reasons) not to go through with it but I tried one day. Maybe it's related, maybe not?  	119
 thats almost the benefit of living in an autocratic society   MARTA needs to rival DC and/or Boston  Make it happen!      LEAKING DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE NOT READ IS NOT WHISTLEBLOWING   Because they ferry stolen documents. Its not that hard to understand.   IF you're a man raping little boys it is...   This doesn't change what Maduro said in the WaPo article.    Doesn't matter. Private information is private info   you do realize it is illegal to jail a reporter until he gives up his source, right? look up Shield Laws and what they're about.   Actually its not.    Stealing medical records is a HUGE no-no   Thats not the problem. Private medical information is just that.    HIPAA exists to fully prevent this. Its totally illegal. heads should roll over this.    I'd sue.            its only because Russia is on the security council    Here we go!                                 why is he not stalling?      19 monuments.

Its basically everything you need in a box without thinking about what you need      Oh this is golden   such an elite artist   Drake's versatility should really make everyone worried out here            is this all fight talk?   he's relatively young too so his post-presidency will be very interesting   Yeah they have. All the time.            how the entire hell is this "black american" culture?    this isn't "black culture"          its too niche of a place to just have random people stopping by      The reality is that there are only a tiny handful of schools even worth attending.  Eh...I'd say depending on what you major in, that statement changes   They knew EXACTLY what to wear    This was no more prevalent than when that PoS Chuck Johnson was on here   This REALLY is starting to piss me off about Joe...like sometimes I legitimately think he's a bit of a racist who gets away with the "I'm a comedian" card but he's clearly not pushing those limits that frequently or that flagrantly so I tend to just overlook it.   But you can't tell with what sounds like fake enthusiasm sometimes. Its an important subject but many times it sounds like Joe flat out disagrees with these same talking points with a different guest.   I know people think this, but its really not true.   It CAN be true, but many cultures, including even the USA, have notions of masculinity in which homosexuality isn't really accepted. In the USA at least we're ***tolerant***...in other countries, gays are seen as a distraction and a weakness in the image of the nation-state. Its prevalent in nations that don't have their shit together, but to say that these people are secretly dreaming of gay men is untrue. A lot of it is religiously based and a lot of it is flat out hatred of gays...you don't have to be exhibiting Ego-dystonic sexual orientatio to do this.          HOW SWAY?!   I have no problem with that considering its the US HQ   They can't go against the popular vote if the margins aren't close.   Gore v Bush was only so significant because the race was so close                              Way too low. Easily deserves a 8.5+    HE ADMITTED TO ENGAGING IN BRIBERY HIMSELF!

One of the best episodes in the entire JRE history.    Looks like I've found the white guy.

I don't care if Joe laughed.    No. People were upset. People aren't pretending. It was offensive and it wasn't' funny.    So what?  The internet saw it.  Didn't like it.  And she got taken to task for it.  Too bad.   Twitter isn't your written diary.       Not tolerating intolerance. Gotcha.       GODDAMN   I swear to  god ^(whatever you believe in) Shure needs to revamp these cables. Its such a big complaint on here.    I don't care if it was justified.  She got bad to worse in her responses.  Of course people don't deserve to be told they're going to get raped...but that doesn't mean she should keep her job either   why is ok for white people to continually actively hate anyone thats not them?   Solving problems includes calling out jackasses.    Who cares if it "fixed" anything?  She said something dumb and the internet took her to task for it.   it wasn't funny and it wasn't appropriate, especially for someone who worked as a Chief of Public Relations   Well yeah, thats exactly what I'm saying.  Theres protections in place legally, but you can't work in public relations then act surprised when the internet doesn't respond favorably to your "joke"   Actually, in a world where everyone has a voice, you're just hearing more voices. Just because their issues don't apply to you doesn't change what they deem to be important.    The government didn't challenge anything. The public did.   Theres no foul here.   If you want to make jokes, and unpopular opinions, be prepared to encounter those who find fault with what you have to say                  Then thats her fault for thinking the internet was supposed to respect her. She put that out into the world.  The only thing we're arguing is whether or not people should have ignored her...and once its online, thats not up to her.    I disagree.   Online, its out there for the world to see and ultimately you leave yourself open to THE WORLD to interpret anything and everything you say. Different demographics will interpret everything differently and a lot of people live in this bubble free from acknowledging how other people really view things. There are some people in the south who LEGITIMATELY don't even view the confederate flag in a negative light...these people haven't seen or been exposed to other view points that challenge their own  When you rush to online expressions, be prepared for any and all backlash.           I need this "in my life"    MAJOR                  This is great...but...  Seriously...whats the deal with all this talk about SJWs instead of calling out people for actually saying ridiculous things that deserve ridicule? Its like Joe et al doesn't enjoy being called out or held accountable.  Justine Sacco said something that was incredibly offensive and yet its everyone else's fault for putting her out of a job. Not to mention she's a rich little girl who worked in public relations herself, but its always the P.C. culture for some reason.     No ones rights are being violated.    do you have the floorplan? Ive been looking at this place online for months                                 Why?   WHY?!   This will be a massive failure.   They all have the same interests and basically hate each othe      Tomorrow is gonna be wild   Good God         This.  Theres a lot of weapons charges tied in with those         Actually, its necessary  See, the world is moving very quickly and advantages enjoyed by leading nations now can easily disappear if not "managed" so yes, leveraging your influence into more favorable deals matters for all of us.   Its sheer geopolitics.    This was incredibly petty of all parties    Always the nation.  When you're dealing with international forces, you have to look at things on a bigger scale   Free trade is going to need to happen in a globalized economy. You can't escape it   This seriously pisses me off.  I wish he'd start his own blog. Its all i'd read from that damn site anyways    hahahahahahah   Free Speech isn't leaking government documents.      I don't even know how'd he'd be safe IN Ecuador since the nation itself probably couldn't protect him   How petty are some redditors?      no south sudan either   Racism doesn't apply to religion   SHUT. THEN. DOWN   GODDAMN!   THIS!  I swear when I was younger, navigating the MTV website was a MAJOR pain in the ass   Whats the deal with Don Lemon?        	190

 Hey there everyone!  I was wondering, how should we approach small businesses, or maybe even larger ones, for research and information (example: for the EE)? Do you have any wisdom to share? Tips, advice? Share please :) Thanks :)   Don't you wish this was more common? Anyone disagree?   Hey there my fellow dwellers of the IB,  I know some of you may also be interested, could we discuss how to formulate an ee economics question. What did you look for, what criteria did you have when thinking of a question?  Hope your IB is going not terribly, wish you an above average day in IB!   I'm just concerned on self improvement overall. Knowing more about myself is something I think would do so. Thank you for the response :)   Thanks for the response. Do you suggest either psychologist or counsellor?   Academically, I believe I am not getting the grades I can, and was wondering if meeting a psychologist or psychiatrist would help.  Socially I do have numerous sociopathic (lack of empathy, selfish, confused) tendencies, and was wondering if that too could be something.         Hey there I am debating whether I should go to a psychologist to discuss (not sure how to describe) about how to improve myself. Deep down, I kind of believe it to be  useless. Could you  please explain why that may not be the case.   Hey r/IBO! I cannot think of a topic that is within our syllabus (SL) and that makes any sense. Could you please help me find something. For example, the '4 colour theory' that many of you may know off, is interesting - but how exactly does one write a math IA about it? I do not understand. :(   I'm interested in many different areas so hopefully this shouldn't be too hard. Areas I am interested in: Investing/stock market (anything really) Economics - (more macro) Rocket launches and rockets generally History (ww1, ww2) Military of armies Nukes  4 colour theory (Plan B)   Why would you ask this question? What are your reasons for or against? What made you believe you should ask this question? Please lay out your rationale.   Finally someone spoke out! :D  Please send me a link if there is one!   Why is there a noob question in ADVANCEDentrepreneur?   This sub-reddit has great content, but lacks comments! What do you guys think about Macau? I personally wonder, is comparing Macau to Vegas reasonable in long term projections? Or are they too different?    Than you. This is the kind of response im looking for.   No, I want a biography. I already read II and will start SA.   Because time is a scarcity ;)  I did, but wanted to ask here too   Hey r/investing!  This si a simple question: which book describes his life, his philosophies and his views best?   Thank you :)   You are awesome    I stands for international, not your chavish british one :D  Hopefully will get to LSE and maybe even meet up one day 3 great answer m8   I know, and I read it. But I was curious what YOU think. You seem knowledgeable.   What website would be appropriate for in France/EU?   Are there ways outside of the internet?    If someone could ElI5 PROBM and send me one link showing it, I should be fine learning everything related to it :)   Hey r/nootropics!  Im sorry if this post is not of high value, so I will keep it short.  I live in France  I have a limited debit card which does not allow me to purchase over the internet   How do I purchase nootropics if I were to want to?  	25
          Yet most republican voters blame Obama for being a socialist. Ironic?   Might want to start now. Everyone in your position will be doing the same exact thing once that happens.   Blame the younger generation who are stuck with the idea that their vote doesn't matter.            An athletic department spokesperson told the Journal-World on Friday that the situation regarding furloughs would have minimal impact for KU athletics because of the limited number of state employees on the payroll.  I call bullshit on this one.            I live in a college town and during the first month of move-in and class starting, you will see cops (homeless people) laying down in truck beds, along the busy streets, holding up speed detectors in a paper bag.      Sorry about that. I had copied the text directly from the article and did not notice.                   BCBS here and the site shows a 30+% increase on individual coverage.             Flew last week. My watch set off the detector. The fact I had scissors, [pepper spray](http://www.womenonguard.com/mace-keyguard-self-defense-spray-pink), and tweezers in my carry-on bag never alerted them while scanning my luggage.      Wonder what was going through the lady's mind when she decided to recycle it. Must not have taken in to consideration the fact that it says Apple Computer and looks ancient.                     There's a huge difference between calling something a pizza when it is actually a deep dish pizza.                                  Oriental Bistro has excellent sushi and for a decent price.    First Management owns most properties in Lawrence. Do whatever you can to avoid them. They rob you of your money and keep your deposit for the most ridiculous things.   Tall muscular nerd with genetically tanned skin.  Checkmate!   He's working by himself and making a few bucks as he goes. It isn't a lot but we can manage. I was able to support myself before we met and can do so while we are together. She is just stuck on the idea that if I'm not marrying someone who is already making six-figures, then he isn't worth it.    Whoa there. You might want to back up real slowly and leave this comment thread before I whoop your ass.    Yeah, pretty much. She has a lot of talent when it comes to art and singing, but she is stuck with the idea that you can't do hobbies for a living. So instead of doing something she enjoys, she works for someone else and hates her job.    High five and an upvote for surviving the crazy fucking weather that blew through last night!    It's hard not to when she complains that her mother did the same thing to her yet she inflicts it upon you. Hypocrisy at its best!   My mom always told me sex was bad and it's the only thing guys every want.  Found out last year that she had cheated, for 13 years, on the guy I knew as my Dad. So for her, sex is ok as long as it is with a wealthy man and you're cheating on a guy who thinks he is your father.     Both, but not the amount my mom would prefer.    We live in Kansas. Few people are smart or rational until you travel north to the KC metro.   I'm both joking and serious.    Step 1: Do or make something using colored pencils   Step 2: Become famous  Step 3: Show the bitch who's boss.    I have and she doesn't care. Her perspective on life is that you can't do what you love for a job, no one can do that, and that you are supposed to hate what you are doing.  He loves computer science.  I love helping people. I am going back to school in the fall to complete courses in psychology and art. In the end I hope to have a *Masters of Arts in Counseling with Clinical Mental Health Counseling and Art Therapy Specializations* (program offered at a grad school in Seattle)    He cooks and we both do chores. My mom's just a bitch. She said that she would be "ok with it" if we were married. We haven't gotten married because we wanted to wait until his work started taking off. It has and will be phenomenal once everything is up and running.    We both have jobs, but his is writing codes and all of that fancy computer science stuff. To her, that isn't a job. She'd rather see him working at McDonalds than doing something that he has a passion for and has been doing since his childhood.    My mom also got on to me about how guys only wanted one thing from girls. In high school it was sex. As an adult, it's stealing your money.   Edit: typo      The link doesn't take you to the survey results.    WTF kind of response is that?                      Ahh ok. For some reason I thought it was their Monday special taco pack. Are the tacos $1 or less?    I was so excited to try Crimson and Brews. Not knowing that they do not offer food to go...seeing as it is a bar and all, I was out of luck and went for shitty tacos.  No food to go because...tacos + beer = mucho dinero.            Where in Lawrence is this special available besides Taco Johns and Taco Bell?   *Burrito King is on Monday            The study referenced:  Nature Communications | Article  [Fat, fibre and cancer risk in African Americans and rural Africans] (http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7342.epdf?referrer_access_token=PCbkeqRsrsOPcZ1cR26hBdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PGvowOInK6Lou9N9ZRCqlh5AW4X3SFrORbxSsdASfqfltUnObjWjLREI1CgS_ClErDoKvNtllKITsBJMMipQVO0BeeJ7feYpgcPpzB5OXRdfuCl_G46jYBWmZ7N-fwSQDNOKvaH2n1V-RokQ5-oRkGJtEYp0yBTFYCTULl8h7Wm25nI3OkGlQe3Q9CxV9PgzwFBL2ehhhn32QzSq2YPiXazlHMIXbSACXy4OqUcasbtw%3D%3D tracking_referrer=www.smh.com.au)  edit: words   The study shows that this applies to African Americans and rural Africans.                   There's a hotel called Big Bears on Top in Key West (or there used to be). Always make me thing of it when seeing this picture.   Kansas isn't boring. I've lived in the Wichita and KC area my entire life and the weather makes living here suck.  Also the fact, that we're land locked, have no access to fresh sea food, and a lot of the population comes off as being ignorant.      This post reminds me of a yahoo chat room from the late 90s and early 2000s.     Yes. It's Henry Reich, the host of minutephysics and MinuteEarth.               I get what you are saying and you make a valid point, but using glass bottles seems like it would cause a safety concern. Especially with the parenting skills shown by today's parental figures.         You..you stole it from me ;'-(!!!!  Nah, no worries. Thanks for the up vote and spreading the word on such a serious subject matter.    The plastic breaks down into about the size of a sand granule. So if you take a sample of sand, how much of it would turn out to be plastic?   Watch the documentary "Tapped" it goes in to a lot of detail about this.   Someone submitted it yesterday. I found out after submitting it to the subreddit. The mod username looks similar to yours o_O   Thanks for the info!  I've already competed a poetry course (hippy GTA and laid back environment = awesomeness to the max) and I'm enrolled in Abnormal Psych for the fall semester. Personality Psych with Dr. Illardi was great and I can't wait for Abnormal Psych to start.   How I see it, glass might be a safety hazard. Last thing you would want to have happen would be kids playing with broken bottles.   Took that class for my first bachelors. Loved that class! He was one of my top favorite teaches.               Nah, a Necromancer would be my top choice.     I'll go ahead and do that. Wanted to give this a try.....  	107
 The Fast and The Furious 2001 was a very successful hit.   I like his first three albums   I started Blood Meridian today after only having read The Road. Already loving it.   Malekith and the Ronan were practically the same character   You're the shitty son   Our dad eh? What a great guy   I love how good he is, but how sad he looks. If I had such talent id be smiling everywhere    Which ones specifically? Have the hardcover and stalled at about 150 pages in.   Going in with a couple waivers, which bases are off the list?   Well I saw it 3 years ago   This post will get quoted after the next school shooting   fuck that, he coulda died. no one would have accused him of submitting.   Make sure you actually like her. I dated a girl for a whole year because I convinced myself I loved her. Huge waste of time.   To live happy for as long as I can. To never find myself being mediocre or perpetually unhappy. To be able to look back on my life on my death bed and smile.  After this there is nothing, so the purpose is to enjoy this as much as possible, while not infringing on others life experience.   Good luck!  Also, if you ever dont feel like going to the gym, remember that once your there its easier. Do just force yourself to make that drive.   Before and after pics   You dont look thirty, and you arent ugly   stumbled upon this subreddit right now and this is one of the top posts of the day.  OP, seriously? You are not ugly, you cute as fuck. Shit. Im kinda hoping the other posts have more attractive people to stare at.     The economy isn't shit right now. Well, at least corporate profits aren't shit right now. The market is at the highest it's ever been.   Preface: I only watch the playoffs, so the last time I've watched was about a year ago.  Watching this first round and I see a shitload more traveling not getting called. Was the rule changed?   Sounds like you don't want to go.  Dont go.  Support your wife, and go to school while she's active.   If an optometrist told you you were blind, believe him.   "you thought id leave without saying goodbye?"   This is r/boxoffice we have like four things we can talk about, OW, WW, domestic, and bombs and budgets.   Surprise of the summer?   I remember tuning in for a couple weeks to watch Journeyman. Then one day it wasn't on. No explanation :( That's when I found out hoe tv worked   No, it got $788 million. Plus, this one had Imax.   Is your MEPS station really far from you? Because if they have to fly you/put you in a hotel, you would probably do everything in one visit.  But if you're close to your station, like I was, you just go on seperste days to do things.  I say research all the jobs military.about.com and the branch websites.   What branch are you going into?   Only thing I care about celebrities, is what their next project is.  "Oh, Ben Affleck cheated on his wife? What film was he working on?"   $115 million. Love that season.   While active duty can I have my mom on my healthcare? Thank you.   I remember almost 7 years ago in ninth grade seeing on yahoo news the weekend box office results, I think it was I Am Legend that was on top, and ever since that I would check the box office every monday, eventually finding boxofficemojo and checking daily.  I dont even know why I care   http://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/306grn/is_a_billion_guaranteed_for_furious_7/   Yup. This franchise has been on an upward climb for years. It's not just the Ledger Effect.   xmas season box office is different, it isnt about blockbuster opening weekends, it is about amazing holds.  domestic:  $115 million opening weekend (shattering previous record)  $80 million second weekend  $580 million final domestic gross.  International I have no idea. lets say, enough to get it to $1.7 billion WW total   If anything itll just mean a higher sunday   I agree, except the WW total, $1.68 billion   sometimes you do the whole thing at once, asvab, medical, swear in. But my process went: Speak to recruiter, take online pre-test, schedule real ASVAB at MEPS, take test, wait for results, then almost a month later I went in to take my medical and swear in.   "I am groot"  read it in any voice   Because the conservative party combined religious "morality" with financial "freedom". They prey on the weakminded.   We bout to see a dozen Riddick sequels   Lol, why call out Ron specifically?   Anyone could have played groot   You really must like westerns lol.  The Painter by Peter Heller was very enjoyable too.   Devil InThe White City is one of those books that deserves all its accolades.   The Road. I didn't want it to end.   Oh ok   What does your skin color have to do with anything?      So when I go to the gym, I look like a thug?   Thanks white people    Context clues man, obviously Avengers 2 is going to not be the least grossing MCU film    I guess I just dont like his writing style. Read three pages of Survivor and you will understand what I mean.   Thats not what they said at all. You might be confusing their domestic predictions for worldwide numbers.   Not really young adult, but if you're looking for funny stuff about young people, read Tina Feys Bossypants. Yes she's forty years old, but the book is mostly about her youth.   To save everyone some time, dont read Palahnuik. Every book reads the same, all of them trying to recreate Fight Club. Just dont waste your time.   Source, ive read Choke, Survivor and Fight Club   Thank you, you answered my second question perfectly   He said he went to seal school, he didnt say he passed   Civil War will be huge. Iron Man 3 numbers, maybe a little more. Depends on 2016's economy.   I'm from Florida and at the time hurricanes were a guaranteed yearly event, only those who lived through Andrew actually feared the storms. My question, among your classmates, family, friends, were hurricanes a thing to fear? Did the general populace actually know how distructive the things can be?   Nope. I say: 90 percent of the firsts gross.  Reasons: I dont think it will be good, the trailers them selves dont scream "must watch" if anything, people are watching just because they've seen the eight other marvel films.  The first one made a lot of money.  A lot.  Many things had to go right for it to go like that, and I dont see those same things happening again.  One thing that might prove me wrong, there's no competition. Mad Max ain't doing shit to Avengers, so it will have some time to gross freely.     I thought that was the usual strategy when it came to things like this.  	62

 Why not both?    I'm still waiting for my identification pony.    Of course not. He didn't tank his personal finances. He tanked his company [four times.] (http://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-is-donald-trump-able-to-file-for-bankruptcy-so-many-times/)    Senator John McCain's war record is astonishing. His aircraft was the one that inadvertently ignited the fire that burnt the USS Forrestal to the waterline. While it was in dry dock, he volunteered to serve on a squadron fighting in Vietnam. He was on his 23rd mission of that tour when he was informed that his unit was being tracked by enemy radar. He remained with his formation and dove to deliver his payload. It was during this time that he was shot down. He fractured both arms and a leg ejecting from his aircraft. He spent the next six years imprisoned as a POW. Two of which were spent in solitary confinement. He was offered release because of his father's high rank, but refused to leave without the rest of the POWs.   Donald Trump is a pompous blowhard who has no experience with the military, veterans, or. Politics in general.    Conservatives don't watch The Daily Show. They can't stand the sound of people they disagree with.    Senator John McCain was one of the few Republican senators to support the reasonable veteran's funding legislation last year. He actually cosponsored it with Senator Sanders. Trump is a pompous blowhard who has no experience with the military, veterans, or politics in general.    Not by voting for conservative representatives and senators you don't. The last round of VA funding legislation that was designed to seriously address the issues within the VA and the treatment of our veterans was presented by the left, obstructed by the right, and ultimately gutted down to less than a tenth of its original amount before they would pass it.    Because people are stupid.    Source?    Source?    Yeah, that guy was a real piece of work. Representative Duckworth lost both of her legs in the service of her country and that guy had the nerve to insult her record for the sake of political expediency.    Next year? The guy's gone bankrupt multiple times.    No one with any sense has ever claimed that the US is a true democracy, so why are you arguing against that strawman?    Refusing to vote is essentially the same thing as voting for the GOP and corporate interests.    Found the Trump supporter.    Mathematically, as income goes down a fixed tax like a sales tax will increase as a percentage of ones income. Your ideas suck because 1) sales tax is a discretionary tax. Since rent, car payments, food and I some cases clothing are not subject to sales tax, what IS subject is the discretionary items. If we give low income earners a break on the sales tax on the big flat screen, maybe we are just paying for them to go from the 40 to the 50 incher. That should not be my responsibility.  If you want to have an honest discussion about who should pay for our governments services, I'm certain that it's not the governments role to supersize tvs.  Again, my state charges sales tax on food. People who buy cars pay sales taxes on them. Not everything in a person's home is discretionary. People need refrigerators, laundry machines, ovens, and other appliances to live and those things are taxed. You repeatedly bringing up televisions amounts to basic hateful demagoguery. You might as well be Reagan with his racist caricature of the Cadillac driving "Welfare Queen". You continue to ignore the taxes that the poor pay on food, clothing, appliances, services, utilities, and everything else that costs money.   The idea also that the all of the non taxpayers are retirees and handicapped people is farcical since it's fully 50% of working age people. The demographics aren't even close to being in your favor. Last your ideas suck because every outside source you cited supported my viewpoint - the nominal tax rates, the bogus nytimes stat and the last citing that confirmed half pay nothing.  Those 50% that you're talking about don't even earn enough to feed themselves and their families. I've repeated this in every reply since you first mentioned them. This thread is a discussion about allowing them to earn an income that sustains life, and here you are complaining and alluding to them being lazy moochers. What good would it be to tax people who aren't able to cover their basic food and shelter requirements? Are they going to be more productive workers and* students when they're homeless and starving? How would that serve society?       He'll just have to make a bigger ass of himself, if that's even possible.    There's so much that's wrong with your statement that I don't even know where to start.   First Senator McCain wasn't a soldier. He was a Navy sailor and a pilot. His capture wasn't the result of incompetence, but of valor and commitment to his mission. It's always a good idea to do a little research about the topic at hand to avoid making ridiculous claims that result in you looking like an obtuse blowhard.    I am a liberal Navy veteran. McCain's service record is a matter of national history. His aircraft was the one that accidentally ignited the USS Forrestal. He escaped death many many times.    But all Trump supporters, Republican or otherwise, are idiots.    Both are equally worthless reactions. I imagine that this and any other news source would be fine with either reaction. Fuck any news source that publishes big photos of the aggressor and doesn't focus on the victims.    When a low income earner buys anything the sales tax affects them. Considering that a family earning the American median income would likely spend most or all of their income on basic living expenses and most of those expenditures would be taxed, it's disingenuous to have a discussion about marginal taxation without discussing these things. Ignoring these things doesn't make them go away.   "Your ideas suck." You can't objectively attack my ideas so you have to resort to base insults. I think I've adequately proved my point. Have a nice weekend.    You're not wrong, but that doesn't mean that amount of distance doesn't present a significant problem for tens of millions of low income Americans everyday.    I don't care what you do or think. I was simply pointing out the flaw in the logic of* your assertion that gun ownership is the root cause of police violence in the US.    I'm not defending the police, i'm being realistic and explaining reasoning behind their actions. Just because they are wrong doesn't mean there is no reason behind their fear.  No, there's not. If they obeyed the law (the constitution), they would have little to fear as they would not often find themselves in terrible situations where they are and must be the oppressors.    Canada also has guns, but only 1/3 ownership, and comparably lower shootings by police and otherwise. Things aren't perfect in Canada either though.  And just what do you think the rate of gun ownership is in the US? Because the [data shows] (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/15/the-demographics-and-politics-of-gun-owning-households/) that it's roughly ~~the same as that of Canada~~ a third.   If only police would police eachother more often.  This isn't just an issue of the police policing each other. This is about the criminal justice system ignoring the very clear text of the constitution and the simple and basic rights that it provides for the American people.      That's because most decent people believe in at least the concept of justice and wouldn't be comfortable with the possibility of executing innocent people. The question is, why would you be comfortable with the possibility of executing innocents?    Something like 90%.    It is when you live in an area which they've been known to operate in the past. I live in a town of less than 40,000 people and we have had a resident serial killer and there have been plenty of other murderers and predators that have popped up from time to time.    We've always had guns in this country. We're not alone in gun ownership. Canada allows gun ownership.   Americans possessing guns is not an excuse for the police to act like belligerent brutes. A majority of their crimes would simply disappear if they were required to honor the inalienable rights enumerated in the constitution.    You're having a difficult time following linear thought aren't you? That 10% to 15% can be added to as much as 12% for sales taxes depending upon the locality of the tax filer.   I just explained that group that supposedly pays nothing in [federal income taxes] (http://money.howstuffworks.com/only-53-percent-pay-income-tax.htm). They're the retired, the disabled, and those who are earning well below the poverty level. Instead of complaining about these people, perhaps we should be figuring out how we can help them to escape the crippling paralysis of poverty.    How can that be true when half pay zero percent of their income in federal income taxes.   What? The median American household income is $50,000. Their effective tax rate is between 10% and 15%, not zero. The people you're talking about* paying nothing are retirees, the disabled, and severely impoverished families earning less than basic sustenance levels. If you take issue with not taxing them then that's for a different discussion and it would be about basic decency and morality, not the tax code.       That's ridiculous.    We're not talking about retirees or the disabled. We're talking about working American families. They're paying as much or more as a peroof their annual income than the wealthy.   Some states exclude food or all? My state doesn't. What state excludes clothing from sales taxes?     Yeah, and as you can see from his other comment that is what he's arguing. He must not have read anything else about Grning who has admitted to having knowledge of the worst operations of the camp.    Sales tax doesn't just affect purchases like electronics. You're ignoring that a family earning the American median household income is likely spending most or all of their income on basic living expenses. Much of which will be affected by sales taxes. Considering that, a family earning at that level is paying around 21%  What are you talking about? Capital gains taxes are even lower than payroll taxes. For instance the Romneys paid 14.1% of their $13.7 million income into taxes last year. Add the sales tax and they might have broken 15%.    Yeah, that's rich. Those poor occupying soldiers. They were just there to subjugate a people. It was unfair to target them because of their organization's well established evil agenda.    Of course it is. Who's arguing against that point?    Here's another gem:  It's not about forgetting anything. It's taking into account that he ISN'T responsible, and that he allegedly had no knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes just as many in the Wehrmacht didn't. They were forced to defend their homeland, he was trying to do it in the most harmless way possible to prevent his own execution of treason. That's what you don't get. You have one mindset that he has absolutely no compassion for the camp's victims and actions. He's a frail old man going to prison. Learn to forgive and forget. Vengeance is a dirty move.     I knew that shit was coming. What a dipshit.      It's not about forgetting anything.  It's taking into account that he ISN'T responsible, and that he allegedly had no knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes just as many in the Wehrmacht didn't.    Read his wiki article. He knew damn well what was happening and has admitted it. He personally observed the operations of the gas chambers and the burn pits.   The Wermacht were not just innocent soldiers. They were complicit in countless atrocities including rounding up "undesirables" for the camps, razing villages and raping and murdering civilians, and destroying German infrastructure in order to prevent the* allies from being able to utilize it. All of which have been well documented. Your's is a revisionist, apologist's history.   He's a frail old man going to prison.  Learn to forgive and forget.  Vengeance is a dirty move.   I stand by my previous statements addressing this misrepresentation of the facts.      Are you serious? You must not be American. Your's isn't even an unpopular perspective here. It's virtually nonexistent. Then you're ignoring the fact that gun ownership is an inalienable right under protection of the 2nd amendment.    Were the residents adequately compensated? I didn't see anything in the article that explained this.    Best way to deal with a meth head is to put a couple bullets in their head!  I think the new legal system should work on votes from the community wether pieces of shit like this get to keep their life.   Maybe this new system you're talking about should exclude votes from people who lack basic spelling and grammar skills.    It is 100% legal to abort a child at any time during the entire 9 months.   That is unadulterated, Grade-A bovine excrement.     It's estimated that a large majority of people with substance abuse problems also suffer from mental illness. I think the number in my state, Missouri is around 80%. I'm sure that some of those people developed their mental health issues because of drug use, but it's generally accepted that substance abuse is often a symptom of mental illness or in other words self medicating.    This article suggests that a child costs $13,000 a year?    Seems to me like everyone having a gun is the problem here.  Or maybe it's that the police should stop violating basic constitutional rights and judges should stop enabling them.    Your perspective ignores what wealth is, where it comes from, and its purpose in bettering society.    So let's just forget about all of the people his unit killed, right? He's just an old man now and he's been really good since the war so let's just forgot about all of those grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, aunts, and uncles that they brutally tortured and killed? He was a member of the SS his job was to steal the personal possessions of the condemned innocent and catalog them to be included in the Reich's spoils of war. He's personally responsible for these atrocities whether you want to admit it or not.   Since when did we drop the punishment/retribution aspect of prison sentences? Even the most progressive states view prison sentences as punishment. Sure rehabilitation is important, but that doesn't mean that people who commit atrocities should be able to avoid the consequences of their actions if they can demonstrate that they've been rehabilitated. He may die in prison. He may not. It's only a four year sentence. Will he even serve the whole thing? Who knows? But if he does die in prison it will be in better conditions and under better treatment than his organization ever afforded anyone. I've no sympathy for him now or ever. He's lived a long full life which is something that millions of people were never able to do because of him and people like him. Good riddance.    Do I think you should have a trust fund to have kids? No. **But you should be able to afford to send them to school with lunch and provide them with clothes and a safe and healthy environment**  And just how much money should that cost? How much of parents' time should have to go into earning this income?   You're putting words into more mouth by trying to tell me what I support. I support families and their right to be together. I'm for supporting families and the children they have rather than drawing imaginary lines and standing on a stump telling everyone else how their families should live. I support finding solutions to our problems as a society, apparently you support hate and prejudice.   Edit:typo.     Exactly. These guys should really open a book or five before opening their mouths.    Except it does. How about punishing him for his involvement in some of the worst crimes against humanity in recorded history? Maybe you weren't affected by his actions, but millions were. Think about it. Your best argument is that he shouldn't be punished because he got away with it for so long.    He was a member of the SS, attached to the camp, and intimately involved in its operations. His duty was to collect and catalog the possessions of the condemned like some hellish ghoul. This man and his actions are indefensible.    That analogy would make sense if the police department's only purpose was to work people to death and/or gas them, and the clerk was responsible for stealing and cataloging all of their things.   Unfortunately, it seems that today you cannot be a public official without first being a millionaire.    It can mean that they're hateful racists.    I know. He was a member of the SS who was attached to the camp. What more does one need?    Exactly. He was in the fucking camps. His job was to collect the possessions of the condemned like some evil ghoul from hell. This is worse than a Wehraboo. These guys are arguing that one could be attached to the camps and intimately involved with their operations and still be considered "innocent".    Yeah, the first sentence is the link.    Okay, thanks for the source. It doesn't prove your point, but thanks anyway.   In 1970 the top marginal tax rate was 70% not the 90% of the fifties. Your link says that the effective tax rate was 33% on couples earning $12,000 or more. Where do you think that puts the super wealthy?   Furthermore the top average effective tax rate today is not 33% like the article suggests. [It's more like 21%] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html?_r=0) and when you consider sales taxes our current system is regressive with median income families paying at least the paying at least that much or more.   Yes loop holes allowed and still allow the wealthy to weasel out of their tax obligation, but undoubtedly they paid more before Reagan began thisrace to the bottom with our marginal tax system.    This one's pretty fucked up too.   This is idiotic charging a book keeper for the said crimes. That would be like charging a clerk at a police department for police brutality when another officer committed the offense.   Edit: Here are the full comments. https://np.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/3dd8dw/auschwitz_bookkeeper_oskar_groening_sentenced_to/   And how would you define that? Where do you draw the line and how?    That's just what Darth Vader would look like if he were on Squidbillies.    Chesticles.    I think the number of people who died at the hands of his unit is pretty morbid. Can you imagine this guy going through all of the personal belongings of the people who were to be worked to death and/or gassed? How far did it go? Was he responsible for counting gold teeth and such?   Edit: grammar. Removed an extra "the".       What do you mean?    I fun looking at your pics of dead kids.    I like this one better than the first.    Go thump your bible somewhere else.    [Are you sure about that?] (http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2013-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets) It's worth noting that the effective tax rate would be the same during those years with a high top marginal rate because employers would not pay much into the top margin as it was a waste of money. Why pay someone more when it's just going to go to the government?   Edit: I love how I provided a legitimate source and you simply downvote me. You made unsubstantiated claims and could not resist the urge to use some shitty slang to describe the people you disagree with.    "Sun comes up, sun goes down. Tides goes out, tide comes in. There's never a miscommunication. You can't explain that!"    what sin is is just religious guidelines as law, but if you already knew about law youd know people 3000 thousand years ago had laws too   I know damn well about the history of cannon law. Religion is not the basis of US law. Sin encompasses stupid shit that cannot be considered crime like masterbation, apostasy, blasphemy, idolatry, vanity, and so on and so forth.    So are you talking about the [50 million Americans living beneath the poverty line] (http://www.npc.umich.edu/poverty/), the [46% that have less than $800 in savings] (http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/), or would you prefer people to be in the top 75% in order to have kids. I mean, we just want to be clear about who you think should be allowed to reproduce, because this is important. You've made it clear that people cannot love their children unless they make a certain level of income and I would really like to know just where you've drawn this line.    It didn't. It's not. But methods of production and their outputs have increased incredibly. If we actually implemented these processes properly our civilization would be entirely sustainable and resilient.    We're still extracting all of the metals we need. We're more efficient than ever at extracting and utilizing these materials. More can be done to recycle them, but they're not so scarce* that we're going to run out any time soon. I addressed the rest of those things in my other comment.    Fossil fuels production is at a high right now and expected to increase. Arable land isn't diminishing in the US and it's pretty well known that we can do more with less land than any other time in human history. Yes, fresh water is a problem but it is solvable. First and foremost we should be focusing on preserving the fresh water we already have.    Which resources are becoming more scarce?    What finite resources are decreasing? I mean sure we're using plenty of resources but much of this consumption has led to an increase in the extraction and production of materials. What resources do you think should be more difficult to obtain and therefore more expensive?    So only the wealthy should be able to have kids?    Because he's a fucking joke. He's always been a ridiculous hack, and now he wants to be a ridiculous hack that holds the highest political office in the country. He doesn't deserve to be taken seriously by any legitimate news source. He needs to be called out and ridiculed.    So what you're saying is if all doctors started doing this unpleasant part of their jobs, there wouldn't be this problem.    Did I? How so? Please explain to me how "sin" is more objective than either of those. Explain how sin is of any consequence to those outside of your belief system.   Edit: I want to point out that you opened yourself to that simple honesty by stating that sin was real. You could have just disagreed with what you read and moved along. You didn't have to make an unsupported and unprovable assertion.    You're right he resisted by putting his hands up and saying no. Those officers had no choice but to choke him. /s   Yeah, I wonder about that part.    No murder is a crime. Sin is an imaginary concept. Much like a person's aura, ESP, any other such superstitious nonsense.    Sin is an imaginary disease invented to sell you an imaginary cure.       Disgusting.    You're being too gentle. I would have called him a vile, murderous psychopath who most certainly should have been executed after the war with the rest of his traitorous, slave-driving co-conspirators.    This is why we need to restore the top marginal tax rates to their pre-Reagan levels. In that tax system ridiculous executive salaries and bonuses were prohibitively expensive because after a certain point the company would would have to pay a dollar to every $.30 that the executive received. Under that system the shareholders wouldn't stand for these crazy benefits that executives have grown to expect.    From the job creators of course. Don't you know that the wealthy ruling class is just waiting around with all of that capital for all of those people to go to HVAC school. Then they'll share some of the economic gains the country has made in the last five years.    Of course they're lazy. What do you call working 60 - 80 hours a week just to pay your immediate living expenses while slipping deeper and deeper into debt?    I completely agree, but who are we to argue with those who feel it's necessary to maintain a population of people who are* even less than second class citizens. "They broke a law (who cares if they were fleeing crippling poverty, exploitation, and persecution) they should be thankful to shine our shoes in constant fear that they'll be rounded up into camps and deported back to the chaos from which they escaped".    Thanks for clarifying that for us. I'll get that data disseminated to the masses.   **Attention! Attention!**  **You lazy fucks can do "better". Do it now. That is all.**   You're right! I've been telling these people who work for a living that they should be ashamed of themselves and generally depressed so that they'll just give up and off themselves. It's not enough that they have to do the work that the rest of us refuse to do, they need to suffer as people and in their interpersonal relationships too. Human dignity is a luxury and if you can't figure out how to benefit from the enormous return your employer gets from your labor then you don't deserve to enjoy the status of "human being".   You're absolutely right. It wouldn't fix everything so we shouldn't do it. It's kind of like how having clean drinking water didn't cure all diseases so it was just a waste of time.    Absolutely. Also, it's important to remember that employers would pay their employees **much more** if it wasn't for the government making them pay the minimum wage. The government is artificially lowering wages. That's what **minimum wage** means.    Yeah, she could have done better. Maybe she'll try a little harder the next time such a rare specimen is in her court room. Personally, I would have went with something that used the phrase "like a boy".    He's figured out how to solve the national problem of poverty! Just don't be poor assholes! If you were wealthy you wouldn't be poor. Figure it out already.    It's not the only way to write a title but it is a universally accepted method in the United States.   Edit: I meant MLA instead of APA, but both are relevant.   Also it's a bitch move to downvote someone you're conversing with.    It's not surprising that someone writing at a college level would be confusing for you. Maybe you should read some articles from some legitimate news sites and check back with me when you've figured out that you're wrong.    You had to show four forms of ID? That smells like bovine excrement to me. I only had to present my social security card and birth certificate. What other forms of ID did you need? Your identification pony? Your family crest and a lock of your great grandfather's hair?   Edit: Your ultrasound and a vaginal swab from your mother? Your library card and three copies of your Subway Sub Club card? Your passport and a facsimile of your ass? A years worth of toenail clippings, a portrait of your dog, and a stool sample? This is a lot of fun, thanks.    [The Myth of Nathan Bedford Forrest] (http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/Ashdown%20 %20Caudill-MNBF.htm)          Right, because kids need parents a lot less than employers need wage slaves. Everyone knows that each and every one of us owes our very existence to the corporate class that rules us. If we cannot honor our eternal debt to them, we might as well kill our kids. Now get back to work you filthy, worthless moochers!   You mean that medicine appears disproportionately in a sub about health?   Edit: Btw, cannabis and marijuana are the same thing.    That's fine. The federal election commission and IRS will most likely want to have a few words with him about the fact that he's on the [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners). I'm pretty sure that what he's doing constitutes collusion and coordination.    The reason I cited ~~APA~~ MLA guidelines is that they are generally accepted by universities and colleges. My English professors made us all buy the APA book and follow the rules that are defined within. In other words, you just tried to insult someone for using an almost universally accepted method of writing.    That's a perfectly legitimate way to type a title under ~~APA~~ MLA guidelines.    I'm glad we have this jackass to explain his unqualified opinion and ignore the general medical concensus on the topic.       It seems even the police prefer vigilante justice to their own practices.       *unless the rules of the subreddit prohibit it.   Edit: This is one downvoting ass subreddit. Multiple times I've been downvoted for adding and agreeing with a comment. Don't expect even the people who agree with you to stick around when you treat them like shit.    Yeah that's good stuff. Delicious and easy.       There are nurse's, truck drivers', and contractor's unions and they have to carry insurance.    How about the revelation that Perry is on the [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac?] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners) I can't think of a clearer case of coordination or collusion.    Make them pay for it. Make officers carry professional liability insurance.    A violent homophobic police officer in the NYPD? That can't be right. /s   Oh yeah, it's perfectly acceptable that the officer slammed a small teenaged girls face into the tile floor while she was handcuffed because she kicked him in the chin. We can't have that officer's ego getting bruised. Who knows what kind of awful things she said to him? Teenage girls are mean. That poor brute.    $2 million worth of legal defense doesn't make it sound like they have a weak case to me.    Were you expecting electromechanical mechanisms under your skin?       I'm for more and more radical reforms, but I don't see that happening any time in the near future.   What information are you talking about? Insurers already rely solely on the information they* receive from PDs to make decisions about drivers. Police are notoriously bad about properly filing accident reports and whatnot. This would put the police and IA in a position of criminal liability if they fail to properly report incidences, and the insurance companies in a position to press criminal charges against dishonest and unprofessional officers. These days you're not a person unless you're a corporation. Let them answer to their insurers. The communities certainly aren't getting an adequate response to their concerns.   Insurers would have an obvious interest in protecting their investments from unprofessional and reckless officers. Once an insurance company has assessed the risk involved with insuring each individual officer, I don't see why premiums would have to be any higher than they are for nurses or truck drivers. Officers with bad records would have high premiums or would simply be denied coverage. Problem solved. In assessing the risks of insuring officers in the field the companies would inadvertently be assessing their risks to our communities and weeding out those who were unacceptable.    *indicted    An Atlanta Journal-Constitution/Channel 2 Action News investigation of the case found that:  - Glynn County police officers interfered with the GBIs investigation from the start, seeking to protect the officers.  - The department tampered with the crime scene and created misleading evidence that was shown to the grand jury.  -  The local district attorney shared the states evidence with the officers nearly two months before the grand jury convened and cut an unusual deal with them just before it met.     No, they get off on violence and hurting people.    It assumes no such thing. But it does put the burden of defense and the liability on an insurance company rather than the tax payers and justice system. Let an insurance company investigate and explain the actions of their premium holders. If they can't, let them assume liability and terminate the policy. The officer will then be uninsurable, out of a job, and no longer a threat to the public. It also separates the criminal and civil liabilities of the job. Tax payers need not pay for crimes committed against them.    I'm a Democratic socialist and I agree that police should be held to at least the same liability standards as we hold nurses, doctors, contractors, and truck drivers.    Recently it came to light that he is personally on the ~~payroll~~ [corporate board of the biggest donor to his superpac?] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/rick-perry-kelcy-warren-super-pac-energy-transfer-partners).

That's terrible that they blame music for the actions of human beings. Millions of people listen to metal and never harm anyone.    Why? Its not relevant here.

 Doran.   I think the infected part has to touch her, and it didn't.    She didn't touch his infected spot.    Because they aren't really that good at throwing things. All they really hit was a giant dragon that you'd have to be visually impaired to miss. Also, at that point the Unsullied would collapse into a ball protecting Danaerys with their shields pointing outward.   Doran, Danaerys, Jamie, Brienne?    What 180? Desperate times call for desperate measures. He said previously that he would risk everything.    Probably patrolling the rest of the city. I'm pretty sure that you don't leave the city unsecured even though there's a gladiator tournament.    Give it to Jamie or Doran.   She's going to pull an O-Ren Ishii.   We didn't see any expert spear throwing. You have to be utterly awful to miss a giant dragon, and that's all they really hit. These guys are fanatics, not trained soldiers. They have no military training and they got scared once their plot was found out by Jorah.   These aren't trained soldiers. They are some kind of religious/anti-Danaerys fanatics with no military training. They are still scared of the Unsullied, Naharris and Mormont.    She wasn't touching the infected part.

Who is preaching about a dragon queen...Wait, I have a theory.  [Lord of Light theory](#g "Based on the preaching of the priestess in Volantis, I think the dragon queen is an integral part of their faith, and that Melisandre is eventually going to sell out Stannis in favor of Daenerys, either by the end of this season or after Stannis possibly becomes King.")    Is that you, Stannis?   I don't think he's ever even seen a wight and might doubt their existence.   We already are. Public viewing parties are huge when the World Cup rolls around. Plenty of MLS teams routinely sell out their matches, with Seattle averaging 38,000 fans per game. International friendlies always draw tons and tons of fans.   The sport hasn't reached mainstream status, but it grows every year. And as you saw at the World Cup, the national team does well, too.

Messed up of the Qataris considering one of Prophet Muhammad's famous quotes is "An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab, except in piety and good actions."    The whole notion of Muslims instituting Islamic law is fear-mongering. Some states have tried to laughably ban it despite US law already prohibits any law from superceding US law.

If she's just around other women or her blood relatives, then she doesn't wear the hijab.    It's actually three substitutions for the entire game, not the half, and that's true worldwide, in every top tier league in every country.   It's only in college and youth soccer in the United States that the substitution rules are different (some subs can come back in the game, there's more than three, etc.).   Regarding strategy in subs, yes, they are used for that, and they are also used to sub out tired players. It's up to the coach of each team. Sometimes a coach feels the need to make tactical adjustments with different players, and sometimes a player gets hurt or gets tired.     the mod who was leading that charge MIA  It must get pretty spirited in those debates.    If she's sincerely wearing the hijab, then she's a practicing Muslim, and thus not having sex outside of marriage. So unless she's married, which would be quite a feat for a high school student, she's almost assuredly not having sex.       She's probably a super freak for some lucky fella.  If she's sincerely wearing the hijab, then she's a practicing Muslim, and thus not having sex outside of marriage. So unless she's married, which would be quite a feat for a high school student, she's almost assuredly not having sex.    I'm pretty sure that Muslims were persecuted and unfairly expelled as as well. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos   If a dog sniffs you, or their saliva touches you, you become ritually unclean and can't pray unless you wash with something other than water (old traditions say sand, soap is used now), and that basically means a shower. I don't fear a dog that isn't attacking me, but I pray five times a day and I can't go run and shower and/or change clothing.  As such, Muslims are discouraged from keeping dogs unless we have a real purpose, like for hunting, using one as a guard dog or herding sheep on a farm, for example. This has led to Muslims seeming skittish about dogs, and since we don't keep them as pets, those of us who never spent much time around them (i.e. people who grew up in Muslim countries) may have some misconceptions about dogs.   Really, though, most of us keep our distance because we're thinking about the next prayer and don't want to deal with showering and changing clothes.   I was way off on the state, lol. I'm in PA.    It should be noted that the governments (at least as far as we know) aren't the sponsors, but private citizens in those countries. Of course, some of those private citizens have royal connections.    What about the Muslims who were kicked out? Oh wait, Spain probably hates them.    Hope you sent him/her a PM.

In some of the more conservative Muslim countries,  sure, that rule is there and it is misguided, but the lack of education of many there makes it a safety issue for women.   I've been to Iran, Pakistan, Iraq (mid 1990s), Syria, the West Bank, Egypt, Dubai and Jordan, and I've seen women walking around all the time on their own without a male guardian. My mother and sister got to work every day on their own and both wear the hijab.  We use modern technology,  unlike the Amish, and we tend to wear all types of clothing, unlike them.     Evidence to the contrary be damned  Did it ever occur to you that your "evidence" isn't representative of Muslims, and that what you see here is what Muslims are *actually like?*   Meanwhile millions of Muslims go through live every day, going to school, going to their jobs, raising their families, living their lives as ordinary citizens, throughout Europe and the United States, not bothering anyone.   Except you though. Because you sat behind your computer screen, read a couple of articles about some out of the blue, rare, abhorrent actions, and decided that those actions defined an entire religion made up of a billion plus people.   I can see some radical, sitting behind a computer in a far off Muslim country, hearing about a terrorist attack in response to a U.S./coalition bombing and thinking, "You can do your Do-As-We-Say shit in the U.S. or Europe, but here we will not tolerate it. We will not have non-Muslims control our behavior through violent acts."  You aren't quite that different from that radical. He doesn't have the benefit of an education, so he might do something stupid. Thankfully, all you'll ever do is post stupid things on the internet and continue thinking stupid thoughts.    That looked like a legit HBO promo. Well done.   I recall her being very uneasy during the marriage. For example, she was very relieved when Jorah showed up with his gift.   **EDIT:** I was referring to Daenerys's wedding to Khal Drogo, not her (upcoming?) wedding to Hizdahr.    Aww yeah, BJIV is in!   We're not the Amish, lol.    Dude, this is pretty old. I've seen quite a few.    Not just rooting for the US because they're my team, but because Myanmar is treating the Rohingya minority like crap.                                  I get the feeling that if he was supporting the Israeli government, you wouldn't be saying that.    It's amazing what happens when punitive actions are threatened. This is why the BDS movement shouldn't be discounted.    They sort of did: http://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/37nt71/israel_offers_concessions_in_bid_to_avert_vote_to/   If you scroll down:    According to the source, Israel offered a four-point proposal that addressed most of the Palestinians grievances.   1. Palestinian players and coaches will receive special documents to facilitate their travel from Gaza to the West Bank and abroad.   2. Israel will ease restrictions and promote soccer-related projects in the West Bank, including the construction of a stadium and other facilities.   3. Israel would cover the costs of tax and customs for sports equipment imported by the Palestinians to the West Bank via Israel  predominantly via the Ashdod seaport.   4. A joint committee comprised of representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and FIFA would be formed and would convene monthly to address day-to-day issues and any problems that arise.             It's important also to note that Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, not an absolute monarchy like the Gulf states,  Eh, this is debatable. They profess to be a constitutional monarchy, but the Hashemite family pretty much calls the shots. They have a secret police and political dissenters aren't always free to express their opinions. They are somewhat better than the Gulf states, but aren't a constitutional monarchy like England or Spain.       York is cheap and has a few bars, plus it is relatively cheap to live there. It's close to Gettysburg, Harrisburg, Baltimore, and Lancaster (sort of in the middle of all of them). Lancaster is a really cool city with tons to do that has a lot of shopping, organic stores, great restaurants and young people, and since that would really be far from Gettysburg, York is your best bet.    The Caribbean bloc of CONCACAF were the ones implicated in the scandal. The lone Central American personality indicted was Eduardo Li of Costa Rica. It should be noted that CONCACAF provisionally suspended the current President, Caribbean Jeffery Webb*, in favor of a Honduran official.   *EDIT: Just scrolled up and saw the name in the sidebar picture. Of course, it's Jeffery Webb.   This is the full story from the NY Times.         I've been to the mosque. You couldn't even see the Ground Zero site from the mosque.    Trevor Noah, a South African comedian, is taking over.       It can't be makruh. Arab Muslims practically invented coffee.   Except when you eventually die from scurvy...   This post is the most pretentious thing I've seen in quite some time.    This is kind of old news...   Do yourself a favor and click the "news" section on Buzzfeed. You'll find a surprising lack of clickbait and plenty of substance.    If you ever wanted gun control in America, that would be the sure-fire way to get it.    Ray guns are haram and biddah! Stick to bullets and AKs like the Salaf used!!!   /s   A tasty, tasty law.    Unless you're black.    Starting from the bottom, soon we'll be here.   You're welcome, international soccer fans.    **Your** username should be **you're** as the latter form is being used.     there is only one religion/unified group overthrowing countries  LOL, you think Muslims are unified? ISIS is Muslim, most of the people they are killing are Muslim and the people fighting them are Muslim. They have not succeeded in overthrowing any countries, as the countries they are in are *already Muslim* to begin with.    If you're thinking about Pynadath, he's in Real Madrid's system.   A man does not know the correct usage of "you're."   Two buckets??? What kind of money are you making?    We have a Shariah movement AND a Muslim President???   Bold theory: She's no one.    It isn't known?   Only lemon cakes.    Someone should have yelled "You screwed Zack Ryder!"   Bronn is sitting in a prison cell with Jamie in Dorne.    That was a completely different kind of creepy, though. He was very quiet and reserved.     the High Sparrow said he recanted   I think you mean repented. Recant means to take back what you have said while repent means to express remorse on what you have done.   Well, he grew up with her and loved her from a young age.     They not only can beat you to a pulp  Won-loss record says otherwise.    Last year, they qualified for the AFC Cup, the first international tournament they have ever qualified for.    I think you mean the FA Cup.    [Original Tweet](https://twitter.com/MLS/status/602272391440539648).       LAND IF  **LAND OF**!!!    presumably because the Palestinian FA failed to notify Israel that a convicted player would be traveling with them  Aren't national team rosters released to the media ahead of time usually?    Why are you being downvoted for providing sources and quotes? Good stuff here.    They call him Mr. Glass...   Not since the accident.       Yes! He's the one. He gets along well with Tyrion, too.    Especially that one dude who dies fighting the Lannisters and saves Arya at the end of season 1. Wait, are we sure they aren't related or something? They look a lot alike...   Cersei and Melisandre.      That's because Saudi (and the rest of the Gulf) uses workers like that as pseudo-slave labor.    It's that white beard he used to have, isn't it?    *You're   I think I hear /u/JFLORESHYPETRAIN or whatever his name is crying.    Hope Solo should have picked him.       Parents just don't understand.    Claire McCaskill is a woman, geniuses.   It's more like a hype boxcar in this case.       Probably a replacement for EJ's roster spot.    Ugh, Pablo doesn't seem to have gotten the memo that most of American soccer has stopped going after the biggest guys and are now looking for actual technical skill.   You also forgot Joshua Pynadath. In Real Madrid's Academy.    As much as I like the New Day, Damien San/Mizdow wins this by a mile.    She was born to Scientologist parents.    Don either finds peace or sells out and makes one of the best ads of all time. I like the open ending. Too much fan service on the part of Peggy + Stan that felt too contrived. However, I like Pete's situation. It seems more natural.    Don shot that down in the pilot, lol.    Really big pay raise. He makes $6 million+ per year. Also, he wants to raise his kids closer to home.    He was battling a foot injury at that time. After the 2014 season he had foot surgery.    They should combine the two.     this violence is explicitly part of these religion's dogmatic writings.  Not according to what I was taught, and to the scholars which I follow. Tell me, what is the nature of your expertise with Islam? Do you follow the religion, or have a theological background?       Thanks for your views. There are many things wrong in Baltimore and the police department is one of them.      I don't comment there. And why? I hold no ill will to you or even most police.    Funny thing about that: many who invoke religion don't know the first thing about theirs or do and are only using it as an excuse. If they can't use religion, they'll use something else.    It's to provide background about Baltimore's situation.   You seem to be going out of your way to not comment about Detective Crystal or what happened to him.   I tend to be optimistic about people. Hopefully, I get at least one genuine comment before this post drops off the front.    You took that excerpt out of context. The story isn't even about Freddie Gray, It's about Detective Joe Crystal, an officer like many here (at least I hope so). You took two paragraphs about a subject not related to the main focus of the article. In any case, the quote you pulled says that the state's attorney concluded this fact, not that she was right or wrong in doing so.   In no way have you addressed the main content of the article: what happened to Detective Crystal after he reported his fellow officers for misconduct.    What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? A good article is a good article no matter where it comes from.    I just posted an open-ended fresh question in a fresh post. I must confess, I've been in this sub before, and this is most abrasive reaction that I've ever gotten.    Ok, this is long overdue, so here goes:   I saw this and was genuinely shocked at what happened to this officer. I want to know what you all think, and what your experience is regarding officers who report other officers for misconduct. I have no idea of how uncommon or common that is in a police department.    I guess you can waddle back to BCND and tell everyone how P S disregarded the article because of the source.  Can you honestly tell me how that is helpful to any discussion? What's done is done now. It seems you're having a bad day, and I'm sorry if this article was just the straw that broke the camel's back. What do you think about the article? Is it unfairly prosecuting? Does the officer in question have a compelling story or does something not add up? Please, I mean no offense.     Please, enlighten me.   Posters in this thread are judging the story by the domain name, and I see few comments on the actual content of the article itself. i didn't post here to provoke or insult police officers. I wanted to see the genuine opinions of police officers on this subject, positive or negative. Is anyone willing to say anything?     RULES  Be respectful in your posts and comments.

Uh, yeah, ever heard of [Serpico?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpico). This isn't new, and that's not an appropriate way to respond to public criticism. You're not doing yourself or your fellow officers any favors.      I think what I like about police most is their friendly relationship with the community.       What's the difference between ISIS and these kinds of people? They both look at texts literally without studying their context or deeper meaning.   I genuinely wanted to see what police thought of this story by posting it here. Instead, these comments are about people bitching over Buzzfeed.    I'm guessing you saw that post in /r/worldnews. Thank you for having an appropriate response and not resorting to "OMG Islam is evil just like all religions" like many on Reddit are prone to do.    Using the term "SJW" is an attempt to shut down a discussion or nullify a point by completely disregarding the person posting it.    The history of humanity contains rampant violence, religion or not.    Did you actually read the article?    Ever heard the phrase "don't judge a book by its cover?"    Oh thank you, wise internet man, for educating me about my own religion!   I think Godwin's law needs to be invoked any time someone uses the term SJW or any derivative of it.                   I don't know if Lee Cosgrove is trying to "take the mick," as they say, but he's hilarious.    This is typically only displayed right at the start of the game, and perhaps at halftime, as far as I know.    Smurfs are royal blue, buddy.    I thought it was funny that NYCFC fans showed up in Harrison today, considering that many of them refused to support the Red Bulls because it meant they would have to actually go to New Jersey to watch the games.

Dude, Brooklyn is pretty diverse. I'm pretty sure a sizeable amount of kids know what soccer is.    Well, he did help write those rules.    I thought Kompany was considered the best CB in the world.    Why isn't Roman Gall on the team? He helped lead them through the qualifiers.       B-b-but NYC Soccer Warz!   The failed tag team of Brodus Clay and CM Punk.          Such a shame that this isn't widely known among Muslims.   	199
 It would be interesting to know, though, if there enough homology of brain structure and function that common language strategies are likely to emerge, even if language wasn't part of the ancestral state.  Even if bird and human communication systems are an example of convergent evolution, understanding more about birdsong and how it evolved can still reveal a lot about how evolution shapes communication systems, and the general principles of how those systems arise.   Maybe they are trying to say that letters are not phonemes?  There could be some confusion, since consonant/vowel are used to denote speech sounds, but also used to denote letters.   Thank you for doing this AMA!  For some birds, such as zebra finches or cowbirds, the social responses of other birds to a young bird learning song is important to shape their learning.  In birds that don't produce a stereotyped song or set of songs, but use song more flexibly, is there still this type of "teaching"?  If so, how does it work?   Here's what the authors say: "The primary aim of our ENIGMA-MDD Working Group is to identify imaging markers that robustly discriminate MDD patients from healthy controls using an individual participant data (IPD)-based meta-analysis."  So they do have the advantage that they are directly in communication with the various labs and groups that generated the data, but it's not an existing database of scans, it's one that they assembled for this work.  Recruitment procedures, etc. were not standardized across all those research groups; they used different instruments to assess severity of depression, for example.  The structural quantification was also done "locally," by each individual research group that contributed data.  This is really important.  Volumetric analyses often come down to a judgement call, and while one researcher can remain consistent, it's difficult and takes a lot of training for two different researchers to judge boundaries from an image in exactly the same way.  There are ways to account for those differences statistically, but it will potentially introduce bias into the study.  This isn't precisely my field, but I found the press coverage linked here to be really out of step with the primary article, which I tried to take some time to read before offering some criticisms.  I looked at your comment below, and I definitely agree that although sometimes measuring brain volumes like this is the best one can do to understand physiological changes in the human brain, they are really hard to meaningfully interpret.  Like you, I'm also a little bothered that the author stuck some of those details (like the fact that different labs used different diagnostic procedures) in the supplement, although this is important information and doesn't take up much space to say in the paper. They also do use a correction for multiple testing, which is good, and they use a very stringent one; this addresses your concern about measuring many brain volumes and the concern of finding a false positive by chance.  However, they report the uncorrected p-values in the paper, making things appear much "more significant" than they are, unless you carefully read the methods.   Here is what the authors of the original study say: "Many studies have found structural alterations in various subcortical brain regions in MDD. To date, volumetric differences have not always been consistent and are poorly replicated for some regions; moreover, sample sizes are often small, limiting the power to detect subtle brain differences."  This study was a meta-analysis that re-examined the data from many other studies, to try to draw broader conclusions about what regions of the brain are structurally altered in depression.  They also say: "Clearly, there is a continued need for longitudinal studies tracking hippocampal volume changes over the disease course, to further elucidate whether hippocampal abnormalities result from prolonged duration of chronic stress (that is, scarring), represent a vulnerability factor for MDD, or both."  In other words, this quote from the beginning of the linked press article is just completely wrong: "Brain damage is caused by persistent depression rather than being a predisposing factor for it, researchers have finally concluded after decades of unconfirmed hypothesising."  I don't know why they quote the coauthor Hickie in a way that contradicts the published research, or why they misspell "hypothesizing," but it seems like a case of poor journalism.      According to this reference: https://www.hon.ch/OESO/books/Vol_5_Eso_Junction/Articles/art103.html  In healthy individual who is fasting, gastric fluid (including stomach acid) is produced and emptied at a rate of ~1 mL/min, with an average of around 10 mL of fluid in the otherwise empty stomach at any given time.  But this would obviously change depending on eating habits and behavior, time of day, the individual, etc.   Poor reporting.  There are multiple studies already published that used RFID tags for bees, as well as other insects.  To list just a few:  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030023  http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/3/513/htm  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-012-0156-7  Not to mention years of studies that used other types of transmitters, including radar transponders that actually track complete flight paths of bees.    Just wanted to add that many researchers (although maybe not all?) do consider the rest state of insects to be true sleep; it shares many biological/neurological characteristics with vertebrate sleep.  Also I wanted to write a sciencey comment so I could add that I love your user name!   This is the first test of a drug, in a rat model of depression, that tries to mimic the long-term effects of traditional antidepressants, since these drugs typically take weeks to produce improvement.  Their results were really exciting in that the animals did show rapid behavioral improvement, as well as some signs of more healthy neural activity.  It seems like in this initial study, they didn't test the drug's effects beyond a few days; I would be curious to know what would happen if they did repeated treatments.  Would rat "depressive symptoms" disappear?  Or would they become desensitized to the therapeutic effects of the drug?   I have a lot of luck with shortening my stride on uphills, and making imaginary truck gear-shifting noises in my mind.   It sounds like they already do have an individual medical record number, plus they are referred to by their mother's last name, but I guess even that isn't enough of a memorable identifier to avoid some of these errors.   **Seveneves, by Neal Stephenson**  I finally reached the top of the wait list at the library . . .    The original paper is open access: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2015/07/08/peds.2015-0007.abstract      I agree with you that they didn't test at all what the default is.  However, these researchers did not directly study adults of two different cultures.  They only compared the results of their participants recruited only from India (it states in their methods section) to results of other published studies.  Here is what they say in their discussion: "Our  cross  cultural  analysis, although it is formally not correct, shows that residents in India are, on average, less cooperative than US residents."  They believe that because inexperienced adults behaved similarly in tasks that required them to respond quickly vs ones that allowed a long deliberation time, while adults experienced on these behavioral tasks were more cooperative when given less deliberation time, that they've shown intuition that is shaped by experience helps determine level of cooperation.  	16
 o_o; I  don't even know how to respond to that.   Keep on calling/writing and on escalating the situation until you reach someone who has the power to wave the fee.

My parents were in the army.  You wouldn't happen to be from Moncton, would you? :O My sister moved there a few years ago for work, and only recently made the move to Halifax.

AHHHHH!!!!!!!   **AAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!**   It's always good to know a curse word or two in every language, though I find throwing my fists in the air, stomping my feet, and screaming "RAWWRR!!" to be pretty universal.   In my heart, you *are* Richard Gere.   Just do a combination of all the things you imagine when you think of **Canada**, and that's me.

"My hamster knows things I would never tell my wife"  P.S. You've got your perspectives mixed up:  * First person: **I** walked along the beach, eating your soul.  * Third person: **He** walked along the beach, eating your soul.  * Fifth person: **The collective** walked along the beach, some eating your soul, others licking dead jellyfish to try and identify the correct sub-species.   Good point, but I have a soft spot for animals. : (    ;---;    Result may not be as advertised.   I hope not. : (   Agreed.   I'll ask Grandma next time I visit her.  Judging purely on the fact that these beaches have been around for a good 200-300 years without serious hauntings (that I know of), my guess is that it's probably safe  unless you do something stupid like take sand home as a souvenir.   *Gulp*   Unfortunately, yes and yes.   I wasn't loved enough as a child?   Orange juice without pulp and without alcohol, because I don't drink.  What I actually do is listen to the NSP theme song. That gets me goin'.   It was a canine. The root actually makes it pretty long. Admittedly, I'm a city-dweller, unlike my grandma. Figured it was the tooth of a *small* wild animal.   Have you ever been to a white sand beach that seemed a little out of place? Rarely do you see them in the northern part of the United States or in Canada, but there are a *few* exceptions. White sand beaches are usually found in tropical areas, and theres a good reason why: theyre actually created by a very unique fish, called [Parrotfish]( http://i.imgur.com/rzlOxfi.jpg). Few people realize that those paradise-like beaches are the excrements of a creature that eats rocks and coral reefs. Over millions of years, the parrotfishs  gastric rejects  wash up on shore to form the scenes you see in travel magazines. Parrotfish, however, only live in warm saltwater and stick to the southern hemisphere. So, how is it that you can find white sand beaches along certain freshwater lakes and coasts in the north? Well, that white sand isn't *supposed* to be there. If you take a handful of it, youll notice that theres something different about it. You wont know why, but it wont feel *quite* like regular sand. I found out the truth while visiting my grandma.  Grandma Taborri, who was one of the village elders on the reserve, looked as ancient as the trees in the forest. She was the serious type, never cracking a joke or straying from her tight morals. The generational gap between us couldn't possibly have been wider, which caused a bit of friction between us. Though I had nothing but respect for her, I was going a little stir-crazy being cooped up alone in the cabin with her, so I decided to go to the lake for a relaxing swim. I was delighted to see a white sand beach waiting for me in the sunlight. Large, soft boulders were scattered around, as though forming a trail to the water.  As I was walking along the shore, I felt a rock slip between my foot and sandal. Thankfully, I was able to avoid stepping on it. After pulling my sandal off, I reached inside to retrieve the rock in question. To my surprise, it wasn't a rock at all: it was a sharp tooth. *Huh, wonder what animal it comes from*, I remember thinking. A mountain lion? A wolf? A bear, perhaps? I pocketed the peculiar item so I could make a necklace out of it later.  When I returned to the village, I gleefully showed my find to Grandma Taborri, hoping shed be able to identify the animal it came from. The expression on her face suddenly soured, increasing the depth of the creases on her face.  Where did you get this? she asked me in a raspy voice.  I pointed outside, By the lake, I answered.  She grabbed my arm firmly, and pulled me towards a wooden bench by the fireplace. I took a seat next to her, wondering what had gotten her in such a state.  Do you know how white sandy beaches are made? she asked me.  Yeah, actually, theres this freaky fish with teeth that- I began, but she cut me off using nothing but a stern look.  No, child. That is not how they were created here, she replied, pressing her lips together, I will tell you the story, but only if you promise to sit still and listen to the end.  I nodded, fairly certain she was about to tell me a long-winded tale about Nuktuk, the Serpent god who swam in the sky and broke apart into stardust to turn soil into white sand, or some sort of ridiculous mythological tale of the sort. She had a way of drawing out the ancient stories, and I confess, I sometimes found my thoughts wandering midway through. Still, the seriousness in her tone was enough to force my attention on her. I was not expecting what she was about to tell me, nor the conviction with which she told the story. I knew that *she* believed wholeheartedly what she was saying, which made the tale ring eerily true.  When the white man came, he held in one hand a gift, and carried the shadow of death in the other. His bloodlust and greed knew no bounds, she said.  I was a little taken aback, having not expected a history lesson. I knew how it went: colonials invaded, killed a bunch of Native Americans with infected blankets, and then kept being jerks for a long time. They wanted the land and didn't mind killing what they considered to be savages to get it. Still, I listened patiently as she explained, in dreadfully boring detail, everything I had learned during Thanksgiving week in grade school, though her alleged death toll rang much higher than the history books claimed. By the time American History 101 was over, I had completely forgotten about the original topic, but then, she continued.  It wasn't long before the white man learned of the beautiful ivory shores on the lower-continent. His settlements already built, he could do nothing but lament the rocky cliffs and brown beaches outside his window. He yearned for the bleached sand, of which he heard so many rumors, she continued, pausing to adjust her collar.  Go on? I urged, finding myself strangely intrigued.  She seemed distressed, but continued nonetheless, They turned to the slain bodies of our brothers and sisters. For weeks and months, their bones and teeth were carefully ground into tiny speckles, which were then spread along the shoreline, she murmured.  My heart stopped. Was she saying what I thought she was saying?  Pay heed to what I have to say, child. When you walk upon a white sandy beach, where white sand should not exist, you walk upon your ancestors. That is why you will find a path of boulders along the shore, for we do not wish to step on the souls of the departed.  I looked at the tooth in my trembling hand, I'm  going to go put this back where it belongs, I murmured.  She nodded peacefully, That would be wise, she answered dully, letting the sorrow escape her body through a single teardrop.  Twilight had fallen by the time I returned to the lake, covering it in a beautiful orange sheen. I leapt from boulder to boulder until I reached the waters edge. There, I placed the tooth right where it belonged. As I turned my gaze towards the water, I saw the faded outlines of my ancestors, and offered a simple prayer in the hopes that their souls would one day find peace.  So, dear reader, if you ever find yourself walking along one of those white sandy beaches that shouldn't exist, I implore you to be careful. Youre standing not on microscopic rocks, but on a burial ground.   I feel as though I just lost a few braincells. o_o   Do you promise to behave this time? :/ I'm tired of having to clean up your bodily juices.   This is some kind of demon riddle, right? I'm not very good at riddles. No immortality for me. :(   Love it!   Try not to think about it. Otherwise, *they'll know*.

Dolphins are notoriously cruel and will sexually abuse other animals, as well as toss baby whales around like a beach ball. Believe me, Dolphins are twisted sons of guns.

I had a story where the protagonist slips on some Skittles and hits his head on the coffee table on the way down. The story got narrated and put on Youtube. Someone commented saying:  "Taste the rainbow motherfucker."  That is my all-time favorite comment. I laughed so hard.   Gnggnhnn, that voice. That beautiful voiiiice. You can read anything of mine any day, man.   That's what ...she...said?  Wait, why am I dissing myself?   No.   I'm digging so hard, I've hit bedrock.   I believe it *used* to be against the rules, but that was changed when they modified them a few months ago. I recommend carefully going through the rules page to confirm, though.   Damn, Knotty. I had no idea. I will send positive vibes your way, via carrier pigeons. Please do not shoot the pigeons.   Nah, you don't need to use a throwaway. Post it as you are. People'll just refer to you as 'OP' any ways. :)   Am I the only one that feels like something's crawling all over me?   You can get in touch with Jude by following these steps:  1. Go into a windowless bathroom at 12:00 pm. 2. Place a candle in front of the mirror, but don't light it. No matter what you do, NEVER light the candle. 3. Recite the summoning incantation, which goes a little something like this: *Nah naaa naaa na-nanana na-nanana, heeeeey Jude!*  The candle ought to light up on its own. If you look into the mirror, you'll find Jude standing behind you, hand on your shoulder. Don't look away from the mirror, else Jude will disappear.  (I'm sorry, I don't know who 'Jude' is. I can't actually help. : )   My mum usually reads through my stories for me. She's amazing at picking out mistakes.   Shhhhh, those are his *special friends*.   Done!   I seldom reply to comments because it rarely makes sense for my *character* to reply. If it's a PM; however, I will reply out of character.   That voice  that voice is so adorable. 3 Manen approves!

I am *always* terrified to post my stories because I don't know whether they'll be a huge flop, or successful  but I can't say it's because I doubt my work. There are so many factors behind why a story -even a good one- can fail on NoSleep, that I just put my heart into it and hope it gets traction.  That said, I do have a file folder of scrapped ideas and half-written stories. I think that's normal. You can't always spew out pure writing gold.  If I can be so bold as to offer a bit of advice  maybe you should try printing your story out and revising it on-paper? I personally find that my brain works a lot better that way, and I can catch where the story loses its flow with a lot more ease.  Aside from that, all I can tell you is: post. Post as much as you want. What's the worst that can happen? Your story won't gain traction. That's OK, you can try again with the next one.   No one of value is going to tell you your story sucks. Like everywhere online, there are always a few jerks who will find something to poke at in the story, but believe me, they aren't fellow writers.  Even if you were to specifically ask one of the writers to critique your story, they're not going to flat-out tell you it's bad. They're going to give you tips on improving it, so please don't be afraid to post. You'll never be able to please everyone, so just hope for indifference, and if you get good reviews, then jump for joy!   Goodness me, thank you! : )  I'm still going to try and make it work. Thought of an idea while washing the washroom, but I see now that it doesn't work with the premise, so I'll put that idea aside for another story. Tourists. Right. Tourissssts. I'm so doing it.   I'm not sure if that's a compliment, an insult, or a challenge ... but I am taking it as a challenge ... and I ACCEPT the challenge!   Ah, yes. New blood is always the tastiest.   "One evening in an abandoned farmhouse haunted by an alien creature, an insane widower becomes possessed and buys a tome of eldritch lore at a yard sale."  Holy cow. Aliens, tomes of eldritch lores, insanity, AND supernatural possession? That's a LOT of balls to juggle.  Edit: "One night, a group of tourists find a strange television set using a disturbing pendant, a lost ring, and a strange book."  Hahahhahahaha, because it takes three mystical items to find strange old TV sets.   Fun! What a fun question! :)  I rather enjoyed writing [There's nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2piqpq/theres_nothing_in_the_dark_that_isnt_there_in_the/), though the story wasn't exactly popular. I'd say [I thanked the man who murdered my only friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sr06h/i_thanked_the_man_who_murdered_my_only_friend/) is my favorite, though. Mostly because it features one of my RP characters, the crow guy. It was a lot more fun to write.   *Cough* [Shameless self-promotion](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2x0z0z/i_used_to_hack_baby_monitors_one_night_i_learned/) *cough cough*   You definitely should do it. I'm pretty sure none of the authors would object, as long as you ask them beforehand.   Maybe from the [Rockcliffe Flying Club](http://www.rfc.ca/en/)? If memory serves me right, you can pay for an introductory one-time flying lesson where you get to fly one of the planes. (Around 75-100$, I think?)  If they're red, then I believe it might be one of uOttawa's planes. I heard they (inexplicably) have planes.   The STO bus passes cover both Ottawa and Hull. Depending on where you live, the commute to Ottawa from Hull can be anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes.  For instance, if you choose to live on Plateau (a good neighbourhood, fair rent and plenty of stores nearby), it'll take you about an hour to get to Algonquin in the morning. You'll have to transfer busses once you reach Ottawa.  In the end, you'll have to decide what's worth more: your money, or your time. Ottawa is expensive, but you'll get to class a lot quicker. A long bus ride can be a pain, but it's also relaxing and you can get some homework done.  	77

 I dislike games with traitor mechanism or those that require backstabbing. I just can't identify any fun factor. Why do people find lying and deceit to be fun?  The only game I can stand in this genre is One Night Ultimate Werewolf because it lasts 10 minutes.   Whilst I agree with your points, it would be more accurately named as "successful medium-heavy game designs".    Before buying the copy, why not try it online at boardgamearena.com to see whether it's really what you are looking for?   I've won with the strategy you described, but I've also won before by rushing the knights to gain more early actions, then dominating movement and trading posts.   The issue I have with the game is a more generalised description of the above: the lack of variability and a deterministic opening two rounds. This means there are standard opening moves for knight strategy, scribes strategy, cog strategy etc.   Don't waste the back page of the rule back with credits! Put something useful there - icon references, FAQs, explanation to end game scoring, just generally things that players may need to look up frequently.   I've taught 3 games now...and it's really tiring. Another issue is that no matter how many times I tell newbies "it's really important to get cars, don't just focus on training and getting seats", there's always one player that ends up with only 1 car and loses by a margin of 40+ points.   **Terra Mystica with expansion** - played Chaos Magicians, came in second and lost to Riverwalkers. If the Aurens were not in play I could have gotten more points off the cult track..  **Agricola** - 5p tournament game in which food was brutally tight. Pulled a close win by playing the Braggart in round 12.  **Goa** - finally tried this. Love the tech tree upgrade aspect but I'm never a big fan of auction games..  **Nations the Dice Game** - Fits the bill for a light civilisation/drafting game that plays under an hour. I expect to be playing a few more games of this.   **Elysium** - I've played a few 3p games before and didn't realise 4p could be so cruel. Every move is a blocking move! Gives a very different feel compared to a 3p game.  **Kanban** - Great game. I hope to play a game with all experienced players some time. Teaching to newbies is very tiring.  **Small world** - Still not a big fan but I'd still play it from time to time.  **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - Very tight and enjoyable game. Just don't play with players with AP..  +Various fillers including **For Sale**, **Perudo**, **6 nimmt**, **Criminal Dance**, **Troll**   Looking forward to **The Gallerist**, **Nippon**, and the **Castles of Burgundy** spinoffs, although the Gallerist will be on kickstarter anyways..   I've been to the Yellow Submarine in Tokyo and they have a good selection. Links to Yellow Submarine Osaka shop:  [Map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/%EF%BC%88%E6%A0%AA%EF%BC%89%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B5%E3%83%96%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3+%E3%81%AA%E3%82%93%E3%81%B0%E5%BA%97/@34.6622139,135.5048524,18z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1z44Kk44Ko44Ot44O844K144OW44Oe44Oq44Oz!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xa527c0acce5e5ace) [website](http://www.yellowsubmarine.co.jp/shop/shop-028.htm)   If there's no luck in a coop game, it means that there will always be an optimal solution. Experienced players will recognise and suggest the optimal solution while the inexperienced players sit there executing the plan. This is why cooperative games almost always need luck of some sort, so that your attitude to risk is an input to your strategy.  Relatively speaking, **Robinson Crusoe** and **Hanabi** has less luck involved. **Mysterium** also has minimal luck but it's a different type of coop game.   I think if a group have tried a variety of games and decided they don't like social deduction, then it's just a matter of taste. It's the same answer to "how to get my friends to like euro games/war games/broccoli/horror films etc"   While I own and enjoy both **Kanban** and **Panamax**, I don't think they would be games that you're looking for based on the games you listed above. With a 4-p game, it **always** go beyond 2 hours. In my opinion they get recommended regularly partly because they came out in 2014 and new games always attract more attention.  For mid-weight economic games, I'd suggesting trying **Power Grid**, **Chicago Express**, **Imperial 2030**, **Concordia**? Perhaps even **Terra Mystica** or **Brass**?  For mid-weight worker placement games, I'd suggest trying **Manhattan Project**, **Tzolkin**. **Dominant Species** also seem to be a good fit for your group as you enjoy cut-throat games.   Exactly my thoughts. In **Macao** you get coloured cubes that don't represent anything and you can spend money to buy points, can't get more pasted-on theme than that.   I really enjoy 3p games. In 2p, the dummy player introduces extra randomness. In 4-5p, there's a lower need in paying attention to other players' choices. I think 3p presents the best player interaction in terms of phase selection.   Asmadi games published the beta pnp version online: [link](http://asmadigames.com/MottainaiPnP.pdf)  I've played Impulse but not Innovation. It's slightly similar to Impulse where everyone contributes a card to the "phase order track" so whichever role you choose it will benefit other players. One difference is that the role card you choose this round will not be activated again next round - instead your previous role would be discarded into the "pool". Similar to GtR, cards from the pool could be hired as clients or taken as materials.  Even with a few cards that allow you to directly steal things, Mottainai had less direct confrontation compared to Impulse. It's also not as obvious who is winning, as players could reveal cards from the hand at the end of game to score extra points.   Went to a weekend convention here in the UK so I managed to play 33 games last week, but I'll just post the memorable ones :P  **Elysium** x2 - Very simple yet brain burning drafting + set collection game. Plays within an hour and a lot of player interaction for a Euro. It was a hit at our con. Only complain is that you're never sure what will be available next round (unless you play with a certain deck).  **Roll for the Galaxy** - Full of interesting decisions yet very quick. One of the most played games at the con. The other two are probably Elysium and Quartermaster General.  **Argent: the Consortium** x2 - My fifth play and still enjoying it thoroughly. Everyone was in the run for winning until the final reveal.   **Panamax** - Played it many times but this is the first time to play with a full table of experienced euro gamers. Lots of table talk. It was INTENSE. Scores ended up 94-94-108-114 which surprised all of us.  **Terra Mystica** x2 - Still my all time favourite. Riverwalkers were fun to play with.  **Aquasphere** - I wish it could be more strategic. Ends up being very tactical and you just have to be at the right place at the right time.  **Captains of Industry** - I love economic games but I'm starting to have mixed feelings about this game. The random time tracker can be annoying at times.  **Mottainai** - It felt like a constipated version of Glory to Rome as the pool was always empty. Just doesn't flow as well, but perhaps we made some rule mistakes.  **Red7** - A pleasant surprise following the disappointment in Mottainai. Very clever and fluid game once everyone understand how to break ties. I should pick up a copy.  **Scoville** x2 - A decent game. Both times I played the final round seemed like an anticlimax though.  **St. Petersburg (2nd ed)** - Clever game, but gives a clear advantage to experienced players who know the distribution of cards by heart.   1. **Terra Mystica**  2. **Agricola**  3. **Mage Knight**  4. **Kanban**  5. **Castles of Burgundy**  6. **Panamax**  7. **Concordia**  8. **Le Havre**  9. **Brass**  10. **Glory to Rome**  	17

 Swiss and white cheddar on rye with honey and red pepper flake.   You went to Denny's.   Really?! I'm from Bloomington and the Dreaded Breaded is everywhere (that's at least what my family always calls them).   Pretty much any curry benefits from a long simmer. I love my crock pot for dal (lentils), but I'm not sure if that counts as a grain.  I don't have my own recipe, but tortilla soup can be made as spicy as you want. Same with chili, but I won't open that can of worms because I'm a beans-in-chili heathen.   I may have to do this to my various suitcases, even though I make a point to only buy distinctive ones.   Depending on how sad, the album Everything to Everyone by Barenaked Ladies has so many good ones. Aluminum, Unfinished, and Take it Outside are good for first level sad.

About to get a handle of New Amsterdam. This was just because I was broke last week.   Also a girl. I guess being a good friend means my own problems don't matter.   Also just spent my second night in a row that I passed out before taking my meds.  My friends are fucking nuts, and pretend to love me while I hide behind a fucking smile. I'm supposed to be there for someone who blacks out every day and repeats over and over about how much it sucks to have people falling for her all the time, while I'm so fucking alone that I can't even get laid when I try. And she fucking ignores me when I start to cry.  I need better friends.   Went out last night to see Whitest Kids U Know again. Almost got kicked out because my friend was too drunk. Then we went to the only gay bar in town, they stopped serving me and she got legit kicked out. Then I went to a house show, got my knee kicked in while trying to dance.  Just waking up now, still drunk.      Plant birches. Creepy ghost trees for your creepy forest cemetery.   Waiting for Across the Universe to finish downloading. Musicals and gin help me forget my problems.   Watch Mamma Mia. Fuck my neighbors, fuck my only class tomorrow, fuck people, fuck boys who don't understand going through a handle of gin every 3 days.

If they start to hurt or change, go to the doctor; otherwise, you're probably fine.      Because I just got an IUD implanted. Too bad I'm too crampy to go to the ATM and my guy has already left for Spring Break.   Seasons 6 and 7 don't hold candles to the rest of the series.

We always called them One-Eyed Egyptians. But I've never heard that outside my family.   I can't personally do this, but I know the people who run these events on campus, and they're super awesome people!      I use my friend's sometimes, and got one years ago for my multiple joint sprains and dislocations. A brace is still necessary most of the time, but it can keep the pain from being too bad. In my experience, at least.   Thanks, now I'm overwhelmed with my earlier desire to order a pint of mac and cheese.   Same thing if you ate a lot of chili.   More than sort of.   Crying now because of the news of Leonard Nimoy's death. But I agree. Trek is my ultimate escape.  Edit: may you all Live Long and Prosper.   My joints make it impossible to leave my apartment on a weekly basis. I did ballet for 9 years, so I'm used to sprains, dislocations, slipped disks. I'm 22 years old and have arthritis.  I slipped on the ice on my way to class Thursday morning. It didn't hurt too badly, so I didn't bother going to the Health Center on campus. Since then, it has gotten worse and worse. I serioualy think I may have re-dislocated the knee I injured last winter.  And I don't care. I've been wanting to cut again recently, so the pain from this injury is actually making me feel better. It wakes me up at night, it takes me 5 minutes to walk from my living room to my bathroom, I start crying when my cats decide to climb into my lap, but I don't want to see a doctor about it.  The guy I've been seeing thinks I have to go, even though I know that the doctor will only say things I already know (stay off it, wear your knee brace, ice and heat), but he doesn't know my history with self harm. He knows I'm depressed, and that I've been through an abusive relationship, but not that I've cut on and off for 10 years.   Another excuse to drink gin and eat rosemary? Sounds good to me.   It's just another way of frying an egg. Look up the crispy egg. I will never turn back.   We even have it up here in IN, also at Kroger.   If you can steel yourself for a trip over to Ellettsville, the hill in front of Edgewood High School is great. But, you have to go to Ellettsville.   Especially when you realize how sharp that knife has to be.   http://www.chocolatemoosey.com/2014/06/26/strawberry-layer-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting/  I love this strawberry cake. I do usually put on chocolate icing, but it's great on its own, too.   Haha, I'm actually watching that season right now. Really really good.   Happy Birthday, Romeo! My furbabies have a shared birthday next month, also almost 2. Here's to furbabies for the next 10-20 years!   That's a great idea! However, this yarn is so beautiful and soft that I want ro make something to wear (for the past month, all I've done is rub my face on the skeins).   I do love arm warmers, maybe I can use the silk blend for that. They would feel much nicer than the long acrylic ones I made a couple years ago.   I'm thinking a beret, at least of the peacock. I already have an amazing winter hat that I've worn every cold day for three years, but maybe I have enough for a nice fall/spring hat.   So, for Xmas, I got a gift certificate for my LYS. I mainly got some gorgeous wool, but also got two skeins just because they were pretty, which I never do.  http://www.imgur.com/bhqzu4n.jpeg  Here they are. The peacock one is 100g (197yd), 70/30 acrylic/wool, and the other is only 50g (109yd), but 75/25 wool/silk.  I'd like to make something I can use on a regular basis, but don't know any patterns for this small of an amount. Since I've never bought yarn without a project in mind (I know, you'd think I would have after nearly 13 of crochet), I'm stumped. Plus I've had afghans on the brain for the last year or so.  So, anyone know of good patterns for small amounts of yarn?   More pictures of Bill, and one with his sister, Kate. http://www.imgur.com/XgfNh7d.jpeg http://www.imgur.com/2VbRRac.jpeg http://www.imgur.com/5DLrM3g.jpeg      I think I grew an extra pair    I keep seeing this around here and keep wanting to find it in real life so I can learn tatting, haha. My Grandmommy taught me all the other things, but tatting died with my great grandma on the other side.   Looks like a modified star stitch, but I'll let OP identify it exactly.   I went with kitties because of a foster failure and needing a low key companion, since I'm still a student. As much trouble as they can pose (playing with or chewing through yarn), they are necessary.   Congrats!    I'm super single, but still look to things like this for my future wedding. I thought I was crazy for wanting to make my own wedding cake, haha.   I just want to share something my non-crafty sister posted on Facebook a few days after I gave her an afghan: "A handmade blanket is like a permanent hug from the person who made it."  It brought a tear to my eye, and reminds me of why we all make things for the people we love.  Edited to correct the quote.   Oooh, je t'aime, tu es trop mignon/ne. Or maybe it's just that my (American) cats seem to respond better to French. Sophistication and such. Mine know "tu sais mieux que ca" and "ne mange pas cela, ce n'est pas la nourriture" better than "you know better than that" and "don't eat that, it's not food."   My Katie was a failed foster, haha, but if you can let them go, fostering is a wonderful way to get some kitty love in your life.   The orange one miiiight be big enough for all of these. I also have a boatload of bigger rectangle scarves that I love for using as mid Spring skirts. Thanks for the tip!   That is beautiful, thank you! And I think it will look good with the orange one that is an all over pattern,   That napkin style is how I always wear square scarves. The first style is also lovely, I'll have to try it.  Since I usually don't have a purse with me unless I'm going out (where I do not at all want to take a vintage silk Liz Claiborne scarf, haha), I won't do that style, although I love it with cheaper scarves. Thank you!   I recently got these three gorgeous scarves from my Grandmommy. They are all fairly light, and have at least some silk in them. The mint one and the pale pink (looks white in the photo) are both Liz Claiborne, and my sister got several Liz ones as well.  How would you style these? Today I'm wearing a mint sweater with the mint scarf, dark blue skinny jeans, and short heels in a similar color (it's gonna get up to 40F here, so I only need my stupid looking warm hat for a few hours).  http://www.imgur.com/746h5oh.jpeg http://www.imgur.com/C5nCwGY.jpeg http://www.imgur.com/k9jBvNR.jpeg  Edit: she will be 93 in March, so all of these scarves have stories behind them. I know how to care for them, but styling is not my forte.   I'd easily kill the seaweed ones in one sitting, and I'd have to try the blueberry. I could see them being quite nice.   I'm not even a huge fan of walnuts, but that cake sounds wonderful!   Is it only when they're alone? Like, do you like custard? I have plenty of friends who gag at runny yolks, which just means I never cook eggs for them.   I don't know exactly. The taste and the texture just don't do it for me.   Seconded, although that's oartly becwuse it's mostly mayonnaise or Miracle Whip round these parts.   Haha, I love okra! I eat it raw like a carrot! To each his own.   As long as you've tried it several times, it seems fine by me. People have different tastes. I just tried pickled herring again for the first time in years this Xmas season (my family is Scandinavian, so pickled herring and spekemat are always there) and finally learned to love it, but still hated the hummus privded, too.   I'll add another, that no one I've ever met seems to understand: avocados. I have no idea what it is, but I have never met an avocado that doesn't make me want to turn away and restrain the gag reflex.   Does this still happen with onions that are cooked or caramelized?    My dad and sister both have the "cilantro tatses like soap" gene.    I'm similar. My thing is that liver and kidneys are filter organs. They filter the toxins out of the animal. Give me a fried brain sandwich and I'm happy, and I've recently gotten into buying ground beef heart, because a local farmer sells them to my favorite local grocery/health food store for super cheap, and super delicious.   I feel you on cheese. Only in the last few years have I been able to handle it, outside of pizza. And I still can only eat mild ones, and only when melted.   Ao glad I'm not the only one! It tastes like mud!   I used to be like that. The very smell made me nauseous.   That reminda me of when I decided I'd learn to like coffee when I studied in Frnace back in 2010. Mine went better, though, although now I can only drink really strong black coffee, haha.   I love black olives on pizza, but in any other context I can't even handle the smell.   I'd think Sunny D could be ok in a screwdriver, although I haven't been able to touch the stuff since I had a bottle that went rancid when I was 6 or 7.   Reminds me of when I was a little girl and decided to make gingerbread cookies for my swimming teachers. Misread the recipe and used baking soda instead of baking powder. Those things tasted awful.   I am always happy to cook for people who don't like certain foods, but personally will never say that until I have tried a food in every way possible, several times.  For me, I personally cannot stand chick peas. I've had them in stews, curries, falafels, hummus, what have you. Same thing with mayo. Alone, mixed with anything, the only time I think I've eaten it without gagging was when I had walnut shrimp in Chinatown in San Francisco this past May.  So, what else fall in this category for others? Sometimes you try hard to like something and just don't, and I think that is just fine.   For ones that aren't as super popular, /r/ladybonersgonecuddly, /r/askhistorians, and any of the subreddits for your hobbies, like if you crochet, /r/crochet is awesome   I'm 22 and still sleep with one every night. Same deal with my sister, who will br 27 in April.   It's Elmer the Patchwork Elephant!    Had it all the time when I was studying in France. Can't say it's amazing to my (quite broad) American palate, but good for spreading on crackers while waiting for the rest if the meal.   I really like how all the flowers are the same color throughout. I'm working on my first stuffed animal based on the african flowers (giraffe for me, since they're my favorite animal).   So jealous. It's 10F here right now, and I need to layer up to go grocery shopping.   Not to mention all of those Eye Witness kids documentaries. Those things were my favorite growing up.   Good to see some mulberries! Every summer I go around town every day for a week or so and pick as many as possible. I still have 2 full gallon sized bags in my freezer, so I think I'm gonna make one of these soon.   Some people don't like peas. I'm not one of them, and I don't understand them, but it is a matter of taste. Good on you.   22 year old female in Southern Indiana, USA. I'm a political science major and Arabic/French double minor, planning on taking a fifth year of college (and possibly picking up Dutch in that last year).  I live alone with two wonderful kitties, who are my life. I consider myself an intermediate crocheter; I have never done fancy stitches, but I can pretty easily draft patterns using the stitches I do know.  I hope to post more in 2015, and I hope to learn a lot more.   Still working on last year's to make blankets for all my family (and hopefully friends for graduations), but I'm also gonna make myself somthing nice, because I haven't done that in ages and I got a gift certificate from the local yarn store that my mom actually forbade me from using for someone else, haha.   I love that stuff! It's my grandmommy's favorite.      God, a shit ton of my Facebook friends do this. I've called a couple of them out on it, but they all just freak out and say that it works.   I was making a really dumb face, haha.      You can get anything at a restaurant or wineries/breweries, but that's it.   Weed is my #2 hangover cure, #1 being oatmeal, haha. But nothing but water prevents a hangover for me.   I absolutely cannot mix them, even though I'm experienced with both.   At least a store is open today. Even the Kroger by me closed at 6pm yesterday and won't open till 9am tomorrow, and it's open all day on Thanksgiving.   Could be shitty Indiana, where you can't buy any on Sunday at all, till 7am Monday morning.   They can be, but if you make sure to either use entirely separate utensils (including cutting board) or wash evrrything in super super hot water a couple times in between, it should be ok.  As for a smaller shrimp dish, I'm a huge fan of shrimp and grits. Look for any recipe, although when I'm lazy I just put the two together, mix a boat load of butter into the grits and smother it all in Old Bay. I know it's not traditional, and Old Bay isn't as common outside Maryland, but I can find it here in Indiana if I look hard enough.   Thank you so much for the detailed answer! This is wxactly what I need.   As I said before, I'm gonna play it safe, but I assume it would be like any other allergy. I have friends who suffer allergic reactions from secondary exposure, and that's why restaurants specially prepare items when a customer says they are allergic to something.  Better safe than sorry.   And this is why I'm gping to ask if she could bring some untainted utensils. We're going to be cooking together, because that's our thing, but I want to keep her from getting sick.   Good to know! Thanks!    My friend has legit Celiac's, as in she gets very sick for days after ingesting any gluten at all. So I'm gonna play it safe and not use anything with gluten at all, including any utensils that have touched flour. I want to share the holiday spirit, not make her sick when it wanted to be nice.  Edit: I also have the experience of a father who needed an epi pen after eating sonething fried in peanut oil, so I'd rather be safe than sorry.   Good idea. I was planning on making some chili anyway (and yes, I'm a "bean in chili" heathen), so I will definitely include this in my soup-a-palooza.   Thank you! We both love soups that kinda require a roux or some type of flour covered seared meat, so this is very helpful!  Edit: plus we like to cook fairly in depth recipes together, so the fact that I have a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking plays a bit of a part. We both think of Julia Child as a personal hero, so it's been hard to adapt.  	109
 Yep, he's a *muslim*, not a Muslim.   Intoxicating substances like alcohol, weed, etc.  are not allowed and pig is not allowed neither is tobacco.    No one is free of sins, at least drinking is not hurting anyone.  Do you know how many times I've turned the TV on and the news guy is reporting about how this drunk driver the killed this family coming back from vacation or some family get together?     Explain?    Alcohol is haram in the same fashion yet everyone drinks openly.   maybe on pizza or something like that at most.   You can't do any of these, like never, not even on pizza.      But he was drinking alcohol?

No, it is not, because your standard of living only gets you the basics: food, shelter, utilities, clothes at $2400 USD.

Whats that?    *Extreme-right-wing-sociopathic-wahabi-let's-twist-up-Islam-for-our-own-gain- version-Islamic.*   By saying that it's not Islam related is just demonstrating how little you know about Islam. Islam decrees that any artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed.    I tried googling that but I found nothing. I will admit that my knowledge of Islam is not that of a scholar.  But I'll say this, if artifacts that predate Mohammed should be destroyed is truly a thing, and please cite as I couldn't find it, then during Mohammed's time, when he was alive, during the Abbasid and Umayyad Caliphates, then ancient sites that predated Mohammed would have ALREADY been destroyed.      Isolationism like after WW1   Ahhh, its part of maintaining their image as the protectors of Islam when in reality they are selling the loot to buy AK-47s.  And its working because the way people are viewing ISIS actions: not as looters that sell treasure and oil for AK47s  but as vandals that are destroying to protect religion.   Also, by skewing perception as Muslims are evil, their acceptance rate increases because westerners bully the Muslims causing them to leave and join ISIS.    Edit:  Its is plausable that meusium prices are catalogued thus you can't get very much because they are known about as a result easy to track. So they destroy them for propaganda.   Also is it me or on their videos and pictures they are destroying bigger artifacts due to them being harder to smuggle?    I agree to an extent, it is to rationalize their twisted un-islamic religious beliefs.    Hipster millionaires wet dream!   Trust me its not Islam realated.  Religion is just a ruse for ISIS. Its all trickery not in the name of God but for Power.   '"Conflict antiquities" are artifacts that are looted, smuggled and sold to illicit dealers around the world, with the proceeds going to fund military or paramilitary activity.

Destruction of Palmyra is not because of Islam, if Islam is the reason then Palmyra world have been destroyed hundreds of years ago. ISIS is going to destroy Palmyra for the loot so they can finance their war machine. Its all a show for the west.    Have you had the UN or a military approach you for training?

Damn I didn't think of that.    When your country is underdeveloped, you need assistance from other people, usually they are from the west because that's where all the best universities are and that's why rich Asians send their kids to USA, Canada to study, when Cambodia devolps, they can take care of themselves.

 I'm making the drive from Ohio with a few friends. PM me if you end up going and we can say hey.                                 That's the bigger issue to you?

Being able to double cast it would be awesome.                                 Literally true.   Interestingly enough, it used to be illegal for men to be publicly topless as well. In 1936 men changed the laws, because they were tired of having to wear a shirt when it's hot, but women got left (and still remain) behind.   Missed your primary?   Well, the average of his 250,000 donations was something like $33. That suggests that it's mostly people. Conversely, Hillary raised 3 times as much money with 5 times fewer (50,000) people donating, which suggests that her donors are making significantly larger donations.   Call them and ask.

I listen to NPR primarily, and they don't give him much attention, beyond a passing comment here and there.   The primary is going to be the real race of this election cycle. I'm pretty confident that if Bernie wins the nomination, he'll win handily in the general. And with all of the energy in this grassroots campaign and the bi-partisan support he's getting, if he can't beat Hillary, no one can.  So by the end of the democratic primary, we'll know who our next president is.                                 Thanks. I'll be sure to try one!   Social media, yeah.

Unless you're playing at a professional level, every hero is viable and perfectly fine to play. Consider comp, of course, but there are probably a hundred other things that are going to make a far larger impact on the game than a particular hero's balance.   You mean people?   This is great.                                                                                     I think it has to do with what can happen to you if you're caught with/using marijuana. I think if it's decriminalized, it means you can still be fined and/or charged with a low class misdemeanor, but if it's legalized then there is no penalty (possibly up to a certain quantity).  I don't know for sure, though.   I'd imagine most people will opt for shoes (I know I will) but actually there are people that run barefoot independent of nude recreation. I couldn't tell you why, though, but there's like a whole movement for it.   [Race info](http://www.barebutts5k.com/race/bucket-list-race/)  [Sunshower's website](http://www.sunshower.com/)  Some commonly asked questions:  **Do I have to be naked?**  For the race, no. Clothing optional. I don't know about afterwards at the resort. Normally it's nude-only, but since the event is CO, they may make an exception at the resort (though definitely not in the pool). Call to verify.  **Why naked?**  Why not? Seriously,  attend any socially nude event, and within 5 minutes not only do you forget that everyone is naked (including yourself), but you also forget why you cared in the first place. You stop seeing "naked people" and you just see "people".  More to the point, it's incredibly freeing to be casually naked with others. There's no judgement, no shame, no staring, no prejudices, no barriers, and no pointless swimsuits.  You really have to try it to fully understand it, but once you do, you'll be hooked.  **What if I don't look good naked?**  One of the other things that becomes immediately apparent in a clothing optional environment is that nobody has a perfect body, and that's okay. You often hear people make remarks like "nudists are usually the people you don't want to see naked". That misses the point entirely (you don't go to *see* people naked, you go to *be* naked and to relax and have fun), but there is some truth in it in that many people attend clothing optional events/clubs because they want to learn to love (or at least stop hating) their bodies. Years, even decades, of body shame melt away almost immediately once you let go of the fear and shame embrace the idea that there's nothing wrong or embarrassing about your body.  Plus, everyone is naked, so nobody is going to judge, look down on, or gawk at you.  **Is this about sex?**  No. On the contrary, most nudist resorts (including this one) are family oriented, which means any overt sexual activity or sexual advances would result in the offender being immediately thrown out, and most likely arrested. A good rule to follow is if it would get you in trouble at a community pool or rec center, it will get you in trouble at a nudist resort (except taking your clothes off, of course).  Despite what society would have us believe, nudity is not inherently sexual (just as something sexual does not necessarily involve nudity). This is another one of those things that you just have to experience to fully believe, but within minutes the nudity becomes normalized and you quickly see there's nothing sexy about it. It's just people.  **What if I become aroused?**  You won't.  **But what if I do?**  You won't. Every guy worries about this their first time, but it's never an issue. The advice that always given is that if the wrong thought or breeze or whatever causes a situation, just go swim or lie belly-down on your towel for a minute, but I've never seen or heard of anyone actually having to do this.. Nudists are open-minded, accepting people (and they're all naked too), so if that were to happen, as long as you didn't provoke, flaunt, or maintain it, nobody is going to care (or probably even notice, people will be looking you in the eye, not the crotch).  Trust me, this is about as sexy as going to the doctor, you really won't have an issue.  **What if it's that time of the month?**  Nudist clubs always allow women to wear bottoms (even in the pool) if it's that time of the month. I don't see that listed on Sunshower's website, but it's almost certainly the case.  **What should I bring?**  A towel, which you'll use not only to dry off if you go swimming, but also to put down any time you want to sit down (no bare butts on chairs!). You'll also want plenty of sunscreen (I'd bring both a 30SPF and something lighter like an 8 to re-apply if you're not completely dry), and some money for food/drinks. You might also want to bring a book, frisbee, tennis racket (I see a court on the website, though it probably also doubles as a volleyball court), etc.. Other than that you just need an open mind and a smile!  **Other questions**  Feel free to ask.   Hope to see you there!                                    Higher and higher.                                                                              /r/gogopgo   John Oliver. I'm pretty sure I already have.

Absolutely.         	200

    Did he shoot the man in Reno just to watch him die?      Thanks but the other device is wiped clean.   I bought a new phone today and used the backup and restore options on my old phone and new phones respectively. When i tried to restore, it couldn't restore. Help me please. I love playing this game. It bothers me more that i recently bought the garbage man.   I can get it under $2.30/gallon around here.   Gatorade. I'll take that lifetime supply.   My store is open on thanksgiving if enough employees volunteer.   At my store (close to a university) we've had 200 pie orders on many occasions.   I started as a driver (still a driver) but on day one I trained on every crew level operation except for the make line. It seems odd to me not to train people that way.   Same here. We had a rough week. The roughest I've ever seen. The franchisee of the store I work at extended the fifty off until tomorrow...   I'm a delivery expert but the guys on the make line prefer the older version. I do enjoy not having to put in a zip code on a card swipe.   John C. McGinley. I'd like a scotch drinking rich guy so I can try expensive scotches. Also I'd like a mentor like Dr. Cox.      Thanks so much! That's the one.   Thanks. That looks like it but it doesn't have the swimming things.   Good find, but no. It looks like a music maker app you might find in the Windows app store but the individual notes are represented by little swimming shapes made up of little squares. It's web based.   I think I was here in this sub a while back and found this web based music app that was really cool. As you created parts of the song it had these little swimming things that represented each sound. It was cool but I've lost the link.      Not the plot but it'll do. "Bullshit I can't hear you!"   Wow! You can identify a basic pizza. Hmm not impress.   I've got an 18 year old bottle of Glenlivet. Good stuff.   Thanks a lot. This is really helpful.   A little late, I know but I heard you have to pay for training courses to get into that. Wether or not that's true is fine, I just didn't want to walk into a scam.   North Mississippi here. No storms today was the first rain free day in a while (had plenty of rain and storms the last few weeks). Today was one of those busy for thirty minutes at a time with ten minutes in between kinda days. It sucked.    My wife! Bwahahaha! Just kidding... or am I? Seriously though, I ate two large hand tossed pizzas from Domino's back to back then ate four lava crunch cakes.   I would so fuck Skyler White from Breaking Bad. I don't care what anyone thinks.   Took so long because I've been driving but... Drivers unite indeed!   Same here. I love my job. It's awesome.   I work for Domino's as a delivery expert and couldn't be happier.   I would install that patch if it would include an option of installing the ability to project dreams for review and for others to view.   I was in a dessert wasteland type place. Nothing around for miles. It's during the day and the sun is out on a cloudless day. I'm just wandering around aimlessly. Suddenly, I start to hover about two feet off the ground. All I can think is "wow, this is neat". So I just continue to wander around aimlessly but now I'm also floating. Now everything is suddenly dark but not like night time dark but like bad storm clouds dark. I'm now paralyzed. After a few seconds I'm moving but I'm not in control. I'm turned around after hearing a child's voice scream "Help me!" The voice sounded very distant, though it was two feet behind me. Directly behind me is a set of prison bars that only appear about six bars wide but I knew it would be impossible to get around. behind these bars is the child that screamed. He doesn't have eye balls, just sockets. He screams again and that scream sounds distant again. Then I start to scream a high pitched wail like a higher pitch than I can accomplish while awake. I do this scream in my dream and for real to the point it wakes up my wife. It's like a ghostly sound. I have a lot of dreams like this. The surroundings are slightly different but the base idea is the same. I'm floating around and suddenly I can't control where I go and there is always a kid trapped somewhere screaming for help then I scream. My wife wakes me up and then I can't sleep for a couple hours.   I'll tell you what my parents taught me. Every morning look in the mirror. If you're satisfied with what you're looking at, you've failed. What I mean is deeper than appearance. Are you better at your job/classes? Are you a better you than yesterday? Have you improved in any little way since yesterday? If you don't think you've improved yourself in twenty four hours, you aren't trying hard enough. Everyone struggles with something everyday. You'll never be perfect at anything but you still must be great at something. Don't worry how good Joe down the road is at x, just focus on how well you are at xyz.   Stop acting as though just because we're never going to know the pain of childbirth that any pain we do experience isn't pain. Getting kicked in the nuts doesn't hurt any less just because we'll never give birth. It still hurts like Hell. Saying stuff like "well, it's not like you pushed a human out of yourself" belittles our pain like that changes things. "At least you don't have to have periods". Just in case you were wondering, yes my pain is still just as painful. I'm still just as sore. It still Fucking hurts. I've never insinuated that getting kicked in the nuts is the same as child birth or periods. That's because my pain is exclusively a man's pain as your pain is exclusively a woman's pain. Neither gender will know the other's pain. Stop talking down what men go through.   I go through this all the time with my wife. After she rejects all my ideas I tell her to pick a place and she either gets mad because I won't decide our she picks the very first place I suggested.   Then there could be a super human universe.    I've gone for so long thinking I was the only one that has thought of this.   I've always said this.   I'd like to base my "what if" from yours. What if for every parallel you that dies, the other still living ones get a little stronger. So the final one still alive lives a long life. Which is why we have people who live 110+ years. So if you die, you're strengthening yourself in a parallel universe.   I fall in love with my wife all over again every morning when I wake up next to her and every night before I fall asleep.    Wrong button   Wtf is "bae"?   I just watched that the other night. That's one of my favorite scenes.   A million upvotes to this comment. I love that creation of the food gods. The only thing worth getting from KFC.   I prefer their lemon berry slush. The delicious chunks of strawberry and slices of lemon. Yum!   Steak* FTFY   If you're going with taco bell, anything with Baja sauce is awesome. I get a few sides of it myself.   KFC brought back the double down after its been gone for so long. It's the only thing I eat from there and I can't get enough. I just wolfed down 2 and I'm still hungry.   I made $146 in tips delivering pizzas today and I have to spend it all to fix my other car.   When I got medically separated from the Army or when I dropped out of college for a stupid woman. I can't decide. Those two happened immediately one after the other.   I had to teach that (and many other keyboard short cuts) when we first started dating.   Yeah I know it's bad. Thanks I'll look into it.   Thanks. I add half a jug in the morning and the rest in the afternoon.   I deliver pizzas for a living so my car is my job. I've been losing coolant as though I've got an endless supply. I have spotted where it's ending up but not the actual leak source. Wherever it's leaking from the coolant falls onto other parts (I can't see the entire drip path and the hoses and what not are too tight together to fit my hand between) and the coolant makes its way under my car. So basically I'm having trouble locating the actual source of the leak. I do not own any pressure test device and the cheapest one I can find around me costs as much as a new radiator. I just want to know if there are any tips anyone can give me on finding the source of the leak. All help is greatly appreciated.  	54
 k   Oh wow, I haven't played with that mod in so long, I completely forgot that you could get it from sources other than ore xD   Well, since things like the furnace result in you getting the same EMC out that you got in (ex cobblestone goes in with an EMC of one, comes out as stone with an EMC of one), I'd make them relatively the same as the beginning ones.  * Manasteel: 256 * Mana Pearl: 1024 * Mana Diamond: 8192 * Elementium (which iirc is two manasteel - one elementium): 512 * Terrasteel: 9472 * The gaia drop thingy name: 1024 * Gaia Spirit Ingot: 13568   * Marble: 1 * Limestone: 1 * Andesite: 1 * Diorite: 1 * Granite: 1 * Prismarine: 1 * Basalt: 1 * Teslatite: 32 * Nikolite (does this still exist?): 32 * Copper: 128 * Tin: 128 * Aluminium: 128 * Zinc: 128 * Certus Quartz: 256 * Osmium: 1024 * Ferrous (Nickel): 1024 * Lead: 1024 * Silver: 1024 * Charged Certus Quartz: 2048 * Tungsten: 8192 * Shiny (Platinum): 8192  Manasteel, Elementium, and Terrasteel shouldn't have an EMC value, as I'd imagine it's something /u/vazkii would be against   The point of the mod-of-the-month pack is to build a pack around one specific mod. If you're expecting another kitchen sink, you're in for a shock :P   I'm pretty sure it'd be hard to base a pack around Decocraft haha :P   I'm perfectly cool with it - I try to help people understand configs and scripts and such. All of the Phoenix Team packs have their configs available on github for anyone to use them, just for the purpose of helping people learn. So long as they aren't copying an entire pack, I'd be happy to let people use my configs as their own.   :)      No idea what happened there, but you appear to have spawned above the bedrock of the Erebus. Kind of like how you can get above the bedrock in the Nether. I recommend just going into creative and breaking some of the bedrock so you can get down there.   We actually have a person dedicated to changelogs - that'd be /u/VikeStep. Normally we get the packs to him earlier, but he's a little busy with education things right now, so the changelogs will be a little late.      Neat   The old one should work fine with the new system      http://paste.feed-the-beast.com/view/433593b0   \_()_/   Oh, you can certainly make it a mother lode. Make sure it's large vein size. That allows you to set it to as high of a vein size as you want. I've got motherlodes with vein sizes upwards of 100. Nearly solidly fill a whole chunk of stone.      Lookit that handsome face.   It seems to really just be the first big accomplishment. I work for FTB, and I've still got the Running Red flair.   My point? It's different. Surely you complained about the first pack you played that had Hunger Overhaul, or Iguana's Tweaks for Tinkers (hardcore style), or not allowing you to sleep through the night. This is a challenge just like those, it just hasn't been done before. However, apparently every other person who's played Pathfinder has felt that the inventory restrictions were unsatisfactory.  And yet, over 50,000 people have played Jaded's Agrarian Skies 2. Which has the exact same inventory mod. Out of those 50,000, I've only found two that complained in the slightest about it. Yet for Pathfinder, almost everyone does.   Is it just any combination of mods thrown together? Does it need to have no config changes? Would you classify [Phoenix Reborn](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-phoenix-reborn-tech-magic-progression-ores.59301/) as a Kitchen Sink pack, or [Dark Trilogy](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-the-dark-trilogy-public-beta.51854/)? Does something like [Infinitech 2](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-infitech-2-modpack-v2-1-8-1-gregtech-balanced-hard-mode-modpack-updated-4-2-2015.50185/) count? [Blood N Bones](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/public-pack-blood-n-bones.31815/)?   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u78NM9SceTnTaSKMu25___zD35XCCfEtxY0hgkUlguY/pubhtml   The beauty of this is that it doesn't need to rely on timers to do it - it gets activated when there is Livingrock/wood available. No errors made there, without the need for CC, OC, or SFM.   Obviously for Livingwood - input logs into the system and replace the Livingrock under the Rannuncarpus with Livingwood.  Bluepower could of course be replaced with Project:Red or even vanilla wiring, but who likes that. The Block Placer could be replaced with another Rannuncarpus, and the Terrain Smashers with Mana Spreaders with the Boring Lens.  	26
 verified studies huh?  If you have actually seen these studies and thought for half a second you would realize how stupid they sound. Wind mills aren't made out of some special super intensive co2 spewing method.. its a big fucking fan and generator.. on a pole. A fucking kid in a hut in africa made one to gen power for his house, and charge phones for his village... he made it out of bike parts and a tiny generator.  but even then..its mounds and mounds of BS.  the telegraph an infamous denial rag.. published a story under the ominous title  [Wind farms will create more carbon dioxide, say scientists](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/windpower/9889882/Wind-farms-will-create-more-carbon-dioxide-say-scientists.html)  OH MY...  with the subtitle...  Thousands of Britains wind turbines will create more greenhouse gases than they save, according to potentially devastating scientific research to be published later this year  oh umm   followed by  We contend that wind farms on peatlands will probably not reduce emissions we suggest that the construction of wind farms on non-degraded peats should always be avoided.  oh.. gee ok, well maybe they should have started with that part.  but even they...  Even the initial version of the calculator found that the carbon cost of a badly sited peat wind farm  on a sloping site, resulting in more drainage of the peat, and without restoration afterwards  was so high that it would take 23 years before it provided any CO2 benefit. The typical life of a wind farm is only 25 years.  no 100s of years.. and notice the caveat of the sloping site.. this is a worst case scenario.. and even then.. it still reduces emissions for a couple years. unlike coal, which emits every year you burn it.  but yeah they spun the ever fuck out of it.. replacing a carbon sink with a windmill... and then it had to be sloped and bad drainage, and even then they couldnt make windmills as bad as you say.   now maybe if we made the blades out of burning coal...    well you have a point but dont think its totally unfair...  1 1967 budget adjusted for inflation is 37 billion and in 2015 its 18 billion.  so yeah its only double and not ten times.  and the [defence budget.. on the other hand, despite things are actually more peaceful.. has never dropped below 3.5% gdp.. ](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/defense_spending)  so i dont think its totally unfair to expect spending to be more consistent as a percent of gdp.  but yeah it looks a little less worse when adjusted for inflation.. but we still are operating with half as much.     I saw my mechanic at the bank in my car.. said snarkily "i guess it is done then"  i do accept it was a test drive though, even though he was at the bank cashing his check.. my car was shit, no one was joy riding in that thing.   killing is just really evil and wrong.... unless the dude really really really sucks, then its ok.  life imprisonment is a worse punishment, people seem to think it isnt, because they dont want to die..but a dead guy doesnt give a fuck after you actually killed him. Where the guy behind bars is going to give a fuck about being behind bars for a long time   lol i only heard wtf, only cause i looked it up and that's what all the other articles complained about.  didnt hear i'll be damned until reading these comments.... and now i hear that fine. pretty cool.    and its the same people who heard shit on records they played backwards.  omg our brains like to make sense of shit.. and thats why clouds sometimes look like faces... and sometimes jumbles of sounds will sound like words.. amazing. We are very pattern orientated.    I'm guessing its not that hot.  No one is sweating or fanning. no fans at the booths. Hot girls in pants. besides shocked she looks a little chilly.. i'd say 80 max. waters probably a little cold from just filling.  edit: yeah op says wyoming.. looking at their weather is highest they going to see this week is 83.  not that thats all that cool, but yeah that waters prolly not that warm atm.  edit:if you ever filled a pool even on a hot day, its a bit chilly, and sorry but there are a lot of large people there and no sweat.. down here, where is 95, everyones fanning and sweating. That waters probably a bit chilly for the likes of me.     there was a talk where mr degrasse responded to the oft used quote  "if we can put man on the moon... why cant we"  where he educated people a bit about how much we spend on space these days  sigh... [pining for that 60s budget.. 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA#/media/File:NASA-Budget-Federal.svg) was 9x as much as this year, all adjusted.  and we are much more efficient and better these days.. with even half the budget of the 60s we would be doing amazing ass things. more amazing.  and of course there is the war examples. ALL of NASA since 1958.. all of it, the rovers, the moon, our part to the space station, hubble.. all the probes..cost overruns and all... all of it.   [cost a little over 500 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA).. i know hard to believe. WE got gps, and better weather shit, and all this cool explorations,  we can communicate from middle of nowhere with sat phones, tv, and remote education, cooperative science. gps is so useful we all got a reader in our pockets. seeing hurricanes come... damn.  now iraq will  [cost us about 2.4 trillion in direct costs in total.. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_cost_of_the_Iraq_War)  1 trillion spent already.(but mind you this doesnt include the years of no fly zones and the first war)   maybe i'm not very forward thinking, but i cant point to anything i have that i wouldnt have had, had their not been an iraqi war. Except maybe more people that hate us. and that was less than a decade of spending. Idk, i like the gps  and weather shit and even the tv shit space provides over the war crap we spend on.. it just seems to have better ROI.   heavy heavy sigh at the people who say we spend too much on space.     well i can see that but this instructor definitely meant it how it sounds. I can find the youtubes, if anyone questions their existence or my interpretation of the comment, but like i said, i dont necessarily agree with the dude, but he definitely has the qualifications.      [A Florida man may be questioning his wardrobe choice after being arrested for methamphetamine and marijuana possession while wearing a T-shirt reading: "Who needs drugs. No, seriously, I have drugs."](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/john-balmer-arrested-while-wearing-i-have-drugs-t-shirt-n281226)   Not to disagree with you, but at least one programming instructor said programmers are inherently lazy, they are constantly trying to devise ways to get the computer to do tedious crap for them.   and i get what he is saying but there might need to be a new term for people who work really hard to achieve as much free time as possible versus those who just try to take as much free time as possible with no effort.    well a small ice pick could help you hit the recessed reset button, some routers have.    No the most fun thing to watch.  [the trouble with chicken](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/trouble-with-chicken/)  which I like to rename to a more accurate, less popular title.. the trouble with libertarianism.  tl;dw  its basically a story about a salmonella outbreak that killed people in the us just a few years back.. we knew were it was coming from. There just werent the regulations to do anything about it, and the company in question refused to pull their product. See we had whole chicken regs to prevent salmonella, just not for the way most people buy chicken, which is in parts.  tried to tell the people so they could vote with their feet but information doesnt spread fast and people arent always good at disseminating it.. or perhaps they just thought.. "well the shit on the shelf has to be safe or they wouldnt sell it".. either way people kept buying.   and now we got to deal with a people/country that have rules and regs we dont have representatives for.. yeah there are some import controls and protections, but most of us in techy land and some others i am sure, know china is the hot bed of false advertisement and its a bit annoying.   yeah i think it would still be hard to prove.  Not that he conspired and all, but that a diluted equity into a functional company is better than all the equity in a failed one. (and often there are share dilutions and share holders even vote for them sometimes) Even if it didnt work out. I mean your allowed to be stupid, it comes out to intent.  and even his 'confession', he states it was due to the fact that the 100 year old dinosaur would never realize the potential of their investment with full control.  Prolly a little late to say not a lawyer, and maybe one can slap me down, but I do think he could argue he was trying to do whats best for condi by reducing their shares and control, would leave them with more value than leaving them in control and letting them destroy reddit.(even if you think they did a good job of that themselves.. like i said, your allowed to be a crap ceo.. fiduciary duty doesnt say you have to be good, just you have to try to be good.)   theunwise1 writes like I do...a bit mistake prone, due to stupid fingers.  kyptonaut, is an expert in typese.. the language of typoists. And has graciously translated the comment, theunwise1 made, for those of you without such expertise in reading bad typing.   so let me translate the translator by combining the two comments.  I think the second guy also got whacked ~~I'm~~ *in the jewels ~~but~~ *by the shovel  not so sure on the *'s but i see a lot of folks expert at correcting me, use them, so i figure i would be safe and use them as well.   yeah idk if this makes sense to just one of you, i am happy.   seem  and thats one reason we do science, things arent always as they seem.   I don't see why the psychoactive chemicals in cigarettes wouldn't do the same.  Hmm, maybe, well no maybe about it, I'm not very educated in the actual physical and chemical effects 'psychoactive' chemicals have on the brain, nor am i educated in the least as to the physical attributes of schizophrenia, so just in case you might........Can you expand on why you assume this? I ask because most science, really hates assuming. Just because every berry i have found and eaten has turned out to not be poisonous, its not a truism to say that all berries arent poisonous. Perhaps there is a "psychoactive chemical' that helps schizophrenia and protects from its onset.  Of course this is wholly conjecture out of ignorance. However it always bothers me when people assume one thing should be like the other, because in their experience things like that are. Most birds fly, ostriches dont.     well yeah you should quit.. thats pretty much a rhetorical question at this point.    and they blame the nicotine? I wonder because there are similar studies with cannabis smoke, and the studies have had some of the same complaints you bring up.. but also, fairly sure it doesnt have any nicotine in it.   heavy alcohol users have the most concerns.  its scarier than it sounds, a lot of countries have a lot of underage drinking. our society  grew up with a lot of underage drinking. Thats not to say, ignore this science.. but dont let the small bit of alcohol you had as a preteen, keep you up at night, or even go to the doctor over it, simply due to this info.  we can almost always be healthier and do things better, this info helps us choose to do that. So you can tell your kids more than no. and use facts.   damn it brain, none of them words are bacon.. and breakfast was hours ago.. just quit it.   anyways back to the pict, this is one of those times, i would take the path less followed.   for a week on either side of the 4th    I bet it gets thrown out.  There are rules, you can't just protest with bullhorns at 4 am.. but the anthem is arguable political speech and well this might be more difficult than just a noise complaint.    "on call" is total bullshit for most of the low paying jobs.   "hey guess what, you cant do shit today, cause we might need ya, but if we dont, we aint paying ya shit"     the heavy shit sucks. For sure.. and it can be hard to be frugal when its hard to buy in bulk. And its harder to do on a bike than most people realize. but if you got a bike, they make fairly cheap bike trailers that make groceries a lot easier... and biking harder.      it used to be this way all over the south.. slowly the blue laws went away. My local walmart is still 24/6   if you want to 'see' some em wavelengths.... take out the spinning dish in the microwave. put some american cheese in there. FUCK YEA. 10 -15 seconds.. take out, your cheeze(it just should have a z) will have some regular hot spots, measure between centers and you have the wavelength.. divide by the frequency on the back of the machine and you get the speed of light.. f-n cool... so they arround 2-3 inches apart.... and thats why its hard to nuke ants.. not that you have ever tried but them little dudes avoid the hotspots... which is why a magnifying glass is much more effective than a microwave at burning ants.    well it was kinda obvious...i mean the worst time for perk also is the worst time slot for ads on tradition entertainment.. shit kicks ass at prime time.. but 4am eastern.. not so much'  they should be more straight up.. I figure they are afriad people will just cut their phones off at the slow times, but i doubt it.. people just want to know whats going on. Earnhoney(not the best beermoney but a newish one).. they'll outright tell ya.. 'ran out of ads'.. its nice to see. it still crashy a bit btu i definitely like knowing whats going on more than not.     eh wrong question. Its meaningless as posed. The question you want answered, is "how much do you guys get per phone on average".. which takes some caveats like locations and such.  on average per phone, i am getting about 60 cents a day without much effort besides restarting phones and clicking ok when they dont crash.  thats the info you need. "is it worth it" is meaningless and subjective.. earnings per day isnt. bill gates would laugh, homeless people sleeping behind subway and have a droid, would think its freaken awesome. The rest of us exist somewhere between.   is 60 cents a day per phone worth it for you? 20 days to pay off a ten dollar phone and start profiting. if others think that is worth it or not is meaningless.  edit: lol got to love this subreddit. Sorry but its a fact, the question is meaningless. Any business doing cost benefit anaylsis will tell you the same.. the key isnt "worth it".. the key is earnings per..and only then can the Individual decide worth. its not 'worth it' for bill gates to stop and pick up a quarter. The earnings per stoop just isnt there for him.      and what do you call a cow after an abortion....  decalfinated.  ba dum tiss.  yeah dont try to beat a cow at cow jokes, its udderly impossible. :P    Its very hard to think of a situation where the people best at getting legislation passed are best at implementing it. They are a different set of skills.  reminds me of a startalk, where the scientist complained that the last people in the world to come up with budget numbers for projects are scientists... thats not their skill set, their skill set is science not accounting. But time after time again, they get asked, and time after time again, they go over budget. It costs more to have professionals at budgets do it. They think of things like sick days, slow downs due to wrong or misdesigned parts.. and everything under the sun most people dont consider.  We got people good at shit, we need to better use them.     greece has more grounds. It is greece more harmed. Yeha the EU trying to bail out greece and yeah the EU was lied to.. but they could cut greece free.  here in SC, gambling is illegal. if i pay someone to let me gamble, and lose... guess what, crazy as it sounds, i can sue them for 3 times my loses, because its against the law for them to facilitate my  addiction. Its kinda nutty, and i dont know EU law, but i suspect there is good reason for this article to be worded this way.  now sure the state could sue the gambling org.. and probably would fine them, because i gambled away my kids food budget and now need food stamps, but the way its set up.. I'm the one that does the suing.(not a true story by the way.. just an example..the laws are true but I dont gamble or have kids)    there is a ton you can do, but you do know that popular, and respected sites get compromised?  the [new york times got compromised and infected a ton of people.](http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/what-to-do-if-you-saw-an-antivirus-pop-up-ad/) .. the perps, actually bought legitimate ads and ran them for a week for a different but real company.. and then changed the ad to the infected one later on.  i guess you stay away from porn, hacking and copyright iffy and crack, cheat sites? You know some of the best places to get attacked are religious sites?   being attentive gets you 90% there. the other 10% sometimes require help.  I fix a ton of peoples computers who will argue with me about that 10%... 'but i never .. ever open emails from people i dont know..." blah blah blah.. what the fuck ever.. you can either listen to me how you got infected or get infected again.(last be of snark directed at stereotypical customer and is mental thoughts.. not trying to be an ass)   I think its appropriate to recognize the climate is changing and invest in the proper research to find solutions over the long haul, but not be alarmist about it, Bush tells the paper. Not say end is near, not de-industrialize the country, not create barriers for higher growth, not just totally obliterate family budgets.  Love the right. Want background checks for gun shows and private sellers? You must want to take away all guns and give them to the bloods and crips.   PS putting out house fires, may cause flooding, its a bit unavoidable atm jeb. And jeb only the right see this as a political, left, right issue. If you can solve it with tax cuts, hey I am all ears. Yall just havent offered anything besides 'wait and see.. maybe someone will invent a better way for house  fires and we wont have to flood the place'... well how about we just call the fire department while waiting on einstein.     most these are eh.  instead of adblock get ublock.. reddits newest fav adblocker.. its better on not locking up pages as it blocks ads.  tunnelbear  is ok.. but private internet access is better for a fee based system, there are other free solutions, that arent as good   or connection or size of video. i'm guessing your doing it via wifi?  the best is to get some coax.. yeah cable, its faster than cat5 but the routers are expensive.. but you dont really need all that.. you can get cat5 and good nics and should be good.   edit: any of the downvoters want to debate? offer something useful? I have set up a few cable networks in peoples homes, its better for streaming 4k moves. and its better than cat5 which is better than wifi.. you could do cat6 or cat6a if you want. Just saying wifi isnt the best way to stream and most people with 'laptops" are connected wifi. And it probably wasnt the hardware, but the connection. his laptop actually doesnt have to do a lot of processing.. there could be issues with diskspeeds but most his bottleneck would be in the connection for anything high def.     well its the same thing they been doing in everything that costs some corp money.  its not real.  ok its real but nothing we cna do about it.  ok its real and we can do shit about it, but the solutions are too drastic.  er its not really real. and back on the merry go round we go.     actually they will still rise out of poverty. they arent the problem we are.  the 'dial back" is mainly due to you guys saying "just wait".. which you have been saying for decades. It would have been easier to start this in the 90s and ever decade it gets harder.  also you guys said the same thing over so2 and you were wrong then as well. It worked.. we didnt have to wait for magic.. (which by the way.. still hasnt arrived).. it didnt kill society and now statues in the parks melt less. Co2 is bigger and more costly and will be more disruptive than cap and trade of so2.. but really your side has been wrong ever time.  from cfcs, to leaded gas, to addictive cigs..to so2 and now to co2.  and really, yall have denied us into such a worse situation, not sure why anyone would listen to the right for a solution. 'yeah yeah we stopped all progress on this problem for 30 years now.. but hey listen to us for this weak ass, not going to work, just wait for some magical invention idea'      the problem is real, your solutions arent.  Heres one... you know we will never ever ever ever ever ever ever.. have an optical telescope on earth that can resolve cars on a planet in proxima centauri. Billion years from now, i might not even recognize humans. we could be so advanced that even seeing that shit would kill me from awe and yet, we still wont have that telescope.   There are just fundamental limits to optics, that no amount of technology will ever change.  Anyways.. some things people might grasp.. as long as the resources are there.. it will always be cheaper and easier to make a drinking glass, than putting one back together after you break it.  its always going to be easier for us to put co2 in the atmosphere than take it out.    its going to be more expensive to take co2 out of the air than it took to put it there..  we have been spending a ton.. you do realise the most depressed people over climate change, are the scientists? You know the people with biggest grasp on what might be accomplishable in garages.  and we been talking about thorium reactors for decades..they sure would help now.. where are my thorium reactors.  and for that matter when the fuck if graphite going to get out of the lab? you know how much money that shits gonna make?   the problem is we need to go ahead and do the solutions we have, cause solutions we may OR MAY NOT.. come up with, are going to take some time to go from paper to saving the fucking planet.   Its really kinda the default safest idea, to assume we are at the limits of knowledge for all sakes and purposes. Not that we are.. but you know a building on fire, and you in a hallway.. its best ot find a door and not wait on someone to invent a teleporter. Yeah we put a fuck ton of money behind making nuclear bombs.. but we bombed the fuck out of the japanese while waiting. That time it worked.. we tend to not talk about the times they didnt, like all the esp crap we threw money at.  if someone magically invents something..better.. hey great, we will weave it into the plan,... and really it helps to go ahead and start.. even for that. Like when we first cap and traded so2 the clean up tech was in its infancy and not the best, when it became an actual market.. then we got some major innovations.       and exponentially so.  and its like that with most things.. we need to really push that. You can drive around on squeaky cv joints rather than have them repacked but in a few months, your going to replace them instead.    and we got most of the time saving basics down.i could use better vaccuum bots, a better mowing one, and a cook,maid bot but after that, techs pretty much got all my hard household hours taken care of. washing machines and plumbing were the big ones. i can add a heater to the seat of my toilet, maybe use fire instead of water(incinerator toilets) but the toilet is mostly done.  transportation.. we can go electric and make them lighter and such.. but besides for drilling massive tunnels in the earth. Planes are the top of the transport pile.. we can tweak.. hit low earth orbit.. jam more people in them. but people waiting on a teleporter got a while wait.   and one of the HARDEST things for people to learn, and disappointing for the scifi kid, is that science has limits. There is no going south of the south pole. Thats it. Done. Finito. A billion years from now, that will be true. We might be sharing thoughts through wires and shit, but Roald Amundsen, in 1911 made it to the south pole and that was the end of that. No one will ever go souther. He never seen a smart phone.. or auto driving cars.. but no one will go further south.(yeah its an overly simplistic example but its a limit people can readily grasp.. where a lot of people seem to think science is the magic of infinity, we can pull anything out of a hat if we dig deep enough.. thats not to say there isnt magic in that hat, but there is a limit to what we can pull out of it)    one the worst problems about climate change is the lag. It takes 40 years for co2 to be fully felt.  Your grandparents helped set the record last year. The record last year was help set by adults in 1974. The emissions we do today will be felt by our grandkids.  It is predicted that every dollar we spend on the problem today(effectively) is $8 we will save in 50 years.(much more when inflation kicks in.. thats in todays money)   jeb and the right want our grand kids to have to spend $8 so we can save a dollar.  and while this is MUCH MUCH worse, these same yahoos said the same shit when we cap and traded SO2 due to acid rain and smog. "you will kill the economy" and "it wont work anyways".. same old head in the same shit. from the same people.. heartland. (who really should be charged with crimes against humanity for their constant denial of science and pushing of fake scientist to prevent policy change.)  The reality. [Cap and trade of so2](http://www.forbes.com/sites/justingerdes/2012/02/13/cap-and-trade-curbed-acid-rain-7-reasons-why-it-can-do-the-same-for-climate-change/) worked better than anyone imagined. And was cheaper than the most optimistic predictions.(ok you can argue we were crap at predictions) But the thing is you dont have to listen to acid rain weather reports much anymore and that shit was getting much worse. But we also created and lead the market for cleaning up factory emissions.  we went from spewing 26 million tons a year, to 5 million.  there wasnt even a recession.. attributed to it.(we had a few in that time space since the 80s but nothing out of the normal)  Its pretty sad but had we had gore.. you know the dude who actually got the most votes and we started on that AGW thing he was so worried about.... This would have been exponentially easier and cheaper than it is today.   not really.   and yeah people got to quit thinking science will give them the solution they want, and fucking listen to the solutions science has.  floods suck.. floods suck back, they fuck up houses. You have to get flood insurance. its one of the very worst things that can ever happen to your house..... except when its on fire, and then we flood the shit out of that bitch.  maybe someone in a garage will invent a way to not do this, but if your house is on fire now, i suggest you call a fireman and not wait on the garage hero.  (and yeah we could have space crafts that drop massive house sized candle snuffers,a nd have them land on your home, putting out the fire.. but what people really want, is a switch or a fuse at the pole.. house on fire, flip the switch, fire gone.. lets go have shots at fannys bar)   title is misleading only because it is missing the fact it is about past warming events.   change to, "Studies have shown that over the past 3 million years Global sea levels have risen six meters or more, many times, with just slight global warming"  and it would be fine    thats not what its saying..3 million years is just the time frame investigated. The warming and cooling happened many times over that period. And that some of those times, produced sea levels 20 feet higher than today, and this happened when warming increased by 1 to 2 c, which we are already bought into with AGW. (last part after the comma, not in the actual summary i am reading)     People like to talk about how things were made better in the past, but part of the reason, is because they didnt know how crappy they could make stuff. Now we got computers and models, and now we know exactly how fucking thin we can make toilet paper and have it not fall apart until it actually touches your ass. And we havent quite reached the limits yet, a couple years from now, tp will only be a couple atoms thick and you wont be able to even tell you arent wiping your ass with an empty hand.   yeah its freaken vegas out there. Thing is the decent companies need to really turn against the not so decent ones.. yeah begging us to whitelist is all and good but still leaves the very reason that drives people to adblock in the first place, costing places like reddit.. who have non intrusive ads to lose money from those who never bother to whitelist.. and reddits losing this money due to douchey websites and their advertisers who dont give much of a shit.   it the net was like reddit, i would uninstall ublock.. there wouldnt be a need. i dont have it because i hate ads particularly. i dont have it for bandwidth, i dont have it to be a dick to developers or try to get 'websites for free"..(i do use it a little as a security tool),  but for the most part the only reason why many of us ever sought out ad blocking was noisy and intrusive ads.. ads that cover content, or make noises at 3am and a little less so for me but still annoying, just animated ads.   hey advertise to me.. i like the content yall provide, just dont be a dick with your ads. An ad that expands to cover content, will make me actually think bad things about the company, whose add i am desperately trying to figure out a way to close.

So no i would move on. Its ok. its better than nothing, but nah i wouldnt use solely.   its a bit hard and expensive to keep up an AV.   would there be major problems with that?   thats was my biggest benefits of cord cutting.  i realized i watched a lot of crap, just cause it was on. Sure some of it i enjoyed, but now the cord is cut, i have zero desire to seek out some of these shows and then i question why i ever watched them in the first place. I did enjoy them, but it was that pointless watching you speak of.    damn it.. i was going to post that.  yeah just saw that the other day.. and when he started to get all graphy.. thought immediately of this sub.  Fucking excellent show. Hes both more optimistic and more pessimistic than the average joe. And man did that dude look so happy riding his bike the first time. lol  well tl;dw the world is better off than most people think, but the future trials are a bit scarier than  a lot  people think.(yeah us on reddit tend to be supportive of AGW science.. and while finally most americans agree it is real.. most give it a low priority)   the interesting thing is corps have been doing this for ages to avoid taxes and other things. When they down right own both.    take that /r/til mods  lol  (they deleted the post after it got to front page yesterday.. though i agree it is a better fit for /r/videos as it isnt science and isnt really that learn worthy)   from his comment history.. which is a bit full of jizz.  What the fuck are you talking about. Black people are way more racist per capita against white people than white people against blacks. Its just so widely accepted as part of their culture nobody questions it, because if a white person questions some aspect of black culture that doesn't jive well with "polite soceity" its racist.  I think we know what specific group he is talking about. This guy is the same as dylann. A divider and ignorant.  If you look at the actual facts.. [Black people are slightly less racist against whites than whites are against blacks.](http://imediaethics.org/what-the-ap-poll-on-racial-attitudes-really-tells-us-part-1/)  if you look 47% of african americans harbor anti white views, while 59% of white people have anti black views.    you just wont read this on the council of concerned conservative citizens website.  sorry toss, but your part of the problem that SC needs to recover from.. does there need to be recovery on both sides? fuck yeah, but you sir need some self reflection.    THE REASON THIS ONE FLAG WAS PUT UP WAS RACISM.. dance around it all you want. Doesnt matter how you feel. THE REASON... the INTENT... THE MOTIVE.. was racism.  If i shoot you and happen to take out a tumor before it gets out of control, that doesnt make me a surgeon, even if the results are the same. My intent was to kill. That might have been a historical artifact, but it was abused by bigots who raised that flag in bigotry. Doesnt matter the bullet took out the cancer.. doesnt make bullets a cure or the shooter a doctor and same with the flag.  The intent, the motivation, wasnt historic, it was bigoted.     yeah sorry you cry history all you want, but you cant ignore the parts you dont like. It was put up specifically for racist reasons. you might have a point, if the south constantly tried to honor the confederacy and people constantly tried to stop them. But it wasnt.. it was put up to fight segregation.   What you should be pissed at, is that people took a piece of your revered history and besmirched it with racism. Yall should be pissed that it was so abused by the klan and others, specifically to tell black people "THIS AINT YOUR LAND AND DONT GET UPPIDY'. dont be mad at those offended by it now.. when it was totally used for offensive reasons AND NOT AT ALL.. NOT IN ONE IOTA was that put there for any honoring of the civil war or the people who died in it. Not in the least.    he was friends with the jailers... which OFTEN happens. i mean we just had a high profile escape due to people becoming friends with the jailers.   I get the idea, but his shaking hands wasnt some noble gesture in the face of hate. No he shook a friends hands, who was happy his friend was finally released from jail.  I agree with your concepts.. and treating each other with respect.  but  Yes, this flag is arguably symbolic of suffering on both sides past and present nevertheless it's end should have been treated with respect because it's everyone's history. American History.  NOPE  and hate to go to the most relevant example... once again, the nazi flag deserves no respect, even if it is ALL german peoples history. Nor would a polio infested blanket, which is also our history.  No one has to respect that flag. Sorry. Doesnt matter if it is our history. You cant scream to black people "treat it with respect and reverence cause its all our history"  They allowed to be pissed, just like others are allowed to feel reverence. the big problem is when the gov decides whats the default way you should feel.  would it be better for healing for people to be a bit more toned down.. keep some of their jeers to themselves sure. Totally agree. But the respect and the mandela thing, not so much. (totally support mandela but the story of the jailer thing is just spin)    But as for the real-time Brainet sharing of complex information, personal ideas, and emotional experiences between people? Experts think society wouldnt want it, even if it were technologically possible.  I wouldn't be so quick to say that. A small bit of the population both the foolish and explorers would do this and if it offered unique benefit, it would spread. Also i would think they are judging their distaste, from a point of view of society as it is now. If we get many other brain interfaces, that help more than the handicapped, the next leap, combining brains might not seem so outlandish, maybe even to some of these unnamed experts. And just considering the possibilities for science, from minds being able to share thoughts and concepts without the labor of describing them, i would suspect some governments might experiment with this even if they dont have willing participants.  i wonder what happens to the memories, especially when split up.    I couldnt take it anymore, i give up, i just went ahead and sent the nsa a picture of my penis. I give up trying to keep it hidden, they can have it.   thank god this wasnt a pair of scissors in need of a pair of scissors.   the best i can conjecture..  No misleading claims. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.  not that he was suggesting this is science, or mislead, but my guess is they removed for the "suggestion" that this would happen all the time with men versus women rather than this particular group, without the scientific backing of such a statement.   so basically his til was "there was a cool episode to this show".. i'm a bit on the fence of the removal as many found it interesting but i guess i can see where they think the title is suggestive of a truism when its not really misleading beyond people ignorant on how science works.   so it sounds like you put a little too much thought into this already. Should we be scared? and where is your lair?   you know a scientist not hell bent on world domination would probably say "you know we never thought about it before.. i mean why would anyone bring back such a killing machine, we arent over populated with whales"  i got my eye on you jack.   well wouldnt the next question be if you gave someone like me with zero skills, a basketball and told me to practice shooting hoops for 30 minutes a day.. i mean did they just prove that learning, and in this case with hand eye coordination.. increases brain volume. And does it equate to actual usefulness? there could be arguments about some of the eye hand skills and their uses in certain jobs.. but what if we tried to find the most useless set of movements.. have people practice trying to wiggle their ears. there's not to man jobs out there what would require an exceptional expertise in ear wiggling but i suspect we might see similar growths.. some not, as mario obviously has more kinds of skills involved.    yeah it just fits the definition.. but i have never seen it used in terms of a criminal spilling the beans on co-criminals. heck people call for 'whistleblower protections", i'm pretty sure they arent thinking criminals who just want a lighter sentence. Maybe some, but.. most are thinking of insiders like snowden doing the right thing.  it was however invented by ralph nader cause he thought 'snitch' sounded bad. And [not a lawyer but sounds like by legal definition it does look like even criminals count.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower#United_States)   Really in my perfect world the government is generic. I dont even like speciality plates. It's just asking for trouble. People might not like this, but in my perfect world, the cool stunt Obama did wouldn't have been right either. Its a divisive issue, and while i think the right side won, its not up to government but society to rub their noses in it. Still we have christmas shit all over in the holidays, and other crap we do, so I cant raise too much objection to what Obama did. and it was a cool burn.  But really even if individuals in government support views, the actual government should be seen as an unbiased entity.  It's not and won't be any time soon but one can dream.     yeah i searched all over for that quote.. embiggened the text and all and then watched the video and sighed.  He was definitely in the wrong. 100% supporter of gay rights, but i like my government to be cold hard generic, and they tend not to be already but in the other direction.  They have no business promoting any point of view.  and i could see someone saying that, but i would like to hear it for myself, or see the quote, most likely if it did happen, they were just being a snarky ass. But to me it just sounded like he was belittling the complaint, when the town had a very reasonable objection... for a change.   old one  [how to impress girls on reddit roulette-pict](https://i.imgur.com/tVrY3.png)  ..  [how to impress girls on reddit roulette-source](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b2ldw/how_to_impress_girls_on_reddit_roulette/)   and no it dont exist anymore   but that would get less clicks.    Triceratops could put its head down and point its brow horns at another animal, making the frill stand up. This made Triceratops appear larger.  and in this case, looks to me like it could be mistaken for a big gaping mouth. With slightly bad vision, it would sorta look like something with giant canines and a mouth full of teeth, that could bite on a much larger animal.(total conjecture, but without my glasses thats what it would look like to me) scary either way.    I love the awe on the face of that one woman right before she talks about the place being orderly.   I really hate that when that happens, he's lucky he can afford to move to the bahamas but what are the rest of us to do.   I say this a lot but it doesnt cease to be true, the whole set up of reddit negates most needs for mods. The only true need i see, is illegal activity(porn or scam links), spam and personal info.  Other than that, the down vote, is supposed to be solely for community moderation. And though it is more used for disagreement, the actual purpose, if you read reddiquette is only for  comments and posts that dont foster discussion and not ones you disagree with. Even reposts are fine, different title verbiage, or w/e.  the whole point is the community decides what to see.  I get that will sometimes lead to subreddits, that arent posting things in the ways you like, like /r/games versus /r/gaming. And its not horrible when there is a massive community split so each can have their own but even then the communities should be mostly drive by self moderation. yeah we can suck at it at times but mostly we dont, and thats the price you pay for the usefulness of reddit.   some of the very point was to get away from editorial controls. A minority of people telling us what we should consider important and allowing us to decide that ourselves. Reddits kinda reverting into a problem it was designed to solve.   Its such a beneficial adaptation to recognize the calls of other species and you see it so much on land, and many whales have such wide ranges of hearing frequencies, it would be hard to believe that its not extremely likely that most whales would recognize certain sounds from other species, be it threats, or similar foods. this is askscience and science doesnt care about feelings but it feels like it almost has to arise in creatures with hearing, as the first ones that do it, can eat more, and die less, which is a hallmark of survival. And I dont know the science of it in us or really much more than the basics on evolution, but it seems like we instinctively recognize a lot of sounds animals make. especially when it comes to threat or hurt sounds. First time i heard a gator hiss at me, i knew it was mad. you dont really need to learn the sound cats make when they are fighting. and they tend to be similar, most hurt sounds seem higher pitched. and i know my dog would react to the sounds of cats fighting and you use hurt animal sounds to lure in preying animals. Well i guess the question for me then is, are there hearing land animals we know of that dont react to the calls of other species   True, but i'm not sure how much the endurance would help if we couldn't track and kill our prey. Our noses arent the best.   Thats a [different wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism)  necons are the military wing of the GOP that believe in imposing democracy  Neoconservatives frequently advocate the promotion of democracy and promotion of American national interest in international affairs, including by means of military force, and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism  and  While neoconservatism is concerned primarily with foreign policy, there is also some discussion of internal economic policies. Neoconservatism generally endorses free markets and capitalism, favoring supply-side economics, but it has several disagreements with classical liberalism and fiscal conservatism: Irving Kristol states that neocons are more relaxed about budget deficits and tend to reject the Hayekian notion that the growth of government influence on society and public welfare is "the road to serfdom."  The wing you describe is the supply side economics or the [neoliberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism)(yeah hate that term).  The gop is a coalition of the social conservatives, the neocons and the neoliberals.   well its wrong on so many levels. even when they tried to backtrack and say it was about obamas part time economy.  Economies dont even work that way.  The kid at mcdonalds can probably cook more burgers, there is probably room there for him to be a little more productive. Or you know we can make a machine that spits one out a second... but that will just put the store out of business.  demand drives economies.   And I really hate how they always word the productivity thing, for the most part, its code for jobs going away. more things done by less people. Needing less man hours to build a car. Its kinda the point, so when they talk about increased productivity they mean the   business will have less job openings... really if his goal is "employment" and more hours, the last thing we want is to be more productive.. no you want to be less.  So it takes more humans to satisfy demands(and yeah you can go too far, i'm talking about still meeting demand in the same time, just with more people)  Its so incredibly wrong.    It is quite ridiculous that the end user has ever been treated as a criminal..... well, that is if you think the goals is to get them off drugs.    Could be the first step in a changing attitude in religious circles on how to combat the "ills" of our society. Instead of punishment, help your fellow man with compassion.  UM, hate to break it to you, what you percieve as "changing attitude", is simply the difference between the left wing religious and the right. The right is authoritarian, fire and brim stone and more about punishment and penance and many believe suffering is a path to heaven, while the left is more about lead by example, and is more about compassion. Its like the last pope versus this one. One was more concerned with gay marriage and abortion and people doing wrong, and the other is more concerned with helping the poor, global warming and toning down the hate.  its not changing attitudes, though they do shift some, its as old as the church itself, one side wants to beat heaven into you and the other side wants to lead you there.   [religious conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#Religious_conservatism)  In most modern democracies, political conservatism seeks to uphold traditional family structures and social values. Religious conservatives typically oppose abortion, homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage.   [Progressive Christianity ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Christianity)  Progressive Christianity is a form of Christianity which is characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, a strong emphasis on social justice and care for the poor and the oppressed, and environmental stewardship of the Earth. Progressive Christians have a deep belief in the centrality of the instruction to "love one another"  one focuses on the care for the poor stuff, the other focuses on the "rules"    One thing, they never seemed to ever teach in english class, was that you should design titles to mislead. I always foolishly thought that the title should sorta be a summary of sorts.  And not to be pedantic but whistleblower is one word and while technically correct, colloquially whistleblowers tend to be people who expose wrong-doing before getting caught, while informants, tend to be the ones that do it after. Though It still can be used here, i think eventually it will cease to be correct.     same as others ios runs fine, have to restart droids.   i wont tell you the odds, but maybe i should about video splicing? still one of the better fakes out there.(er entertainment value wise.. unlike the one where the guy is tossing cds into players and shit)     Well, bad guys tend to be harder to catch if they dont wear that stupid burglars mask all the time.  To belabour a point, I would never fart and blame it on someone else, them people are sick, they are like the worst people in the world, who would even do that and dont listen to those other people saying i do that sort of thing, cause thats just wrong. i'm totally against that sort of thing.  Btw i think allie totally just farted right now, wasnt me, i never even had gas.    The lag of global warming is an insidious truth. It takes decades for the full effect of emissions to come to fruition. The record warmth we have today, was mostly caused by emissions of your parents and grandparents.. back at a time when there was less cars, and we used a lot less electricity.   its estimated to take about 40 years, between emissions and effects. Many of you werent even born. I was shooting a cap gun when the emissions went into our atmosphere that helped push the record of 2014. the world pop was 4 billion, now it is 7.3. The emissions from you will be felt by your grandkids. And a lot of you dont even have kids yet.  and you really got to consider the growth.. 2 decades ago, china hardly had much of a car market, they wll road bikes, now its the largest auto market on the planet.  in unconscionable the world we are asking our kids to live in. Yes we are going to have to eat some bitter pills, and as respectable adults, thats what we got to do. Our kids are already going to have to eat worse ones. we need to make sure they are as easy to swallow as possible.  But people really need to be cognisant of that 40 years, stop all emissions today and we still got nearly a half century of this. the emissions from my driving today will be felt in 2055. RN its all relatively minor, there is sea level rise, islands starting to have trouble, glaciers retreating, some corals are starting to struggle and permafrost melting screwing up roads in alaska.. project that over 40 years. [This pict shows 17 years](http://www.effectofglobalwarming.com/images/global-warming-pictures5.jpg)  and know our emission rate grows.. every year more than the last. We need to step up and be the adults we profess to be.    well a lot of it has to do with reporting and its not quite like how you say.   you can make statements like, 20 years ago, we cna stop this, if we start now.. and 10 years ago, repeat the same statement and not be in conflict.. the difference being how much of cuts needed in how short of a time  and a lot are saying "we will be less fucked if we start now'.. rather than we can fix this.     nah it isnt a waste and they will continue to spend like this and you have to in a rationing position. you cant just take the price of the product, because the price is invalid due to rationing which allows everyone a share. The crime is less the theft of water and more teh violation of rationing put there for public good.  if your all crashed on an island with a single box of crackers and one dude eats them all.. he ate more than the $2 they cost.       its a bit different when its a limited resource, the value obviously isnt sold at what the market would bear, hence the rationing.  its more like stealing during a natural disaster like a hurricane.. except california's been on going for years. So yeah they will spend more than the value of the theft as the value of the crime is much larger.      ok fair enough didnt know it was 2:30 in the afternoon. And yeah families saw them but in my experience they can be out quite late with kids on vacation,  and didnt equate that to mean day time sex on a crowded beach, though i still would like to know what exactly they were doing.    ok when i search for these apps via the ply store i get a different page.. same looking app, just a lot more downloads.. are there special perk differences to the ones in the links versus the ones you find searching?  edit never mind yeah they perk .    which is that it is going to automate a lot of jobs that we thought would be "safe" until recently,   unfortunately politician isnt one of them jobs that will be replaced any time soon.    land of the free.. get over it, humans have sex. and if you lived near a beach, you have had sex on the beach and found out it kinda sucks, but growing up on a beach, i dont know anyone who hasnt.       a few reasons  1. cause well oil is more than handy.. its solar power in concentrated form, put down after hundreds of thousands of years of sunshine.(yeah i know what its made of, but ultimately it all comes from the sun) even with oil money, its not going to be that easy.   2. your asking them to admit that their main focus is harming the planet, and do things to harm the bottom line of their main money maker. "our shit is fucking up the place but dont worry we are researching in ways to not fuck up the place"   3. dinosaurs are slow to move, just ask block buster. They no longer like high risk adventures. They did that, they succeeded and now they are a mega corp.. high risk adventures are better for smaller corps which often go under when they dont succeed, we only talk about the ones that do. Not a total truism but an extremely strong rule of thumb. The nature of the corp resists change. you get everything set up working, you kinda want to leave it that way until forced. look at bandwidth.. why give us more until someone moves in next store to force them to give us more.   and just because you are first to market, doesnt mean you will own that market  could they have sure.. and believe it or not, they are.. they didnt do a manhattan like project to bring us electric cars and thorium reactors but even if they had there is no guarantee that they would have been successful.. there is good reasons why GOVERNMENTS are some of the best pioneers in the most high risk adventures.    and another rule of thumb.. corps dont give a fuck if they kill people as long as the money comes in. And they will often fight tooth and nail to be able to continue to kill people as long as the money still flows in and this is one of the many reasons why corps shouldnt be allowed to influence elections.   seriously how many fucking times does history need to repeat itself.    and you know we didnt ban its sale? right? we just said they couldnt sell it in the US, but we let them sell it and still sell it, to foriegn countries.. mainly third world countries. And gave nascar an exception until just a few years ago when they switched. This despite, the science is diamond hard and the fact we all share the same atmosphere. and besides the the equatorial split, the atmosphere gases mix  and spread fairly quickly.   and really.. heartland institute, should be before the hague.. they are the one stop shop for denial scientists in everything.. from leaded gas, to cfcs, to cigs, to global warming.. to fracking fluids.. you need someone to deny hard science, thats where you go  PS.. [that dude who discovered lead stopped gas knocking.... ALSO unfortunately, gave us CFCs as well. Smart man but.. damn his discoveries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley,_Jr.)  but seriously we need to push back AND CRIMINAL CHARGE corps and think tanks that knowingly distort the science that is actively harming people, for profits.    I still contend that most dont worship any book or words or gods, they worship themselves.  if you look at the loudest christians, who love these monuments.. they tend to be a bit right wing. They have no problem with people working sundays, in fact  on christian republican wanted to get rid of weekend rules. Honor thy father and mother? not if they want to retire.. another christian said there shouldnt be retirement because noah worked til he was 600. Thou shall not kill? well unless its for nation building or the government killing criminals.. but god damn that same government if it pays a dime for an abortion.. how does that even work?(yeah i get the "their day in court' crap but the ten commandments seem to be missing that caveat)  adultry they dont like, but are very very very quick to forgive if the person has an R on their sleeve and a cross around their neck.   many 'good christians" went to defend that bundy guy who was stealing from us, by not paying grazing fees like everyone else was.   bearing false witness? you can do that against dems(chill right wingers, its just the right wing version of christianity is a bit louder and you know it.. same people used to be left wingers, we didnt want them) and other countries apparently.  looking for gay marriage on there... or the part where god meant to keep the races separate so he put them on different landmasses, so no desegregation or interracial marriage, but slavery is ok.(this isnt past crap.. nearly [50% of missouri republicans want to ban mixed marriages](http://www.thewire.com/national/2011/04/mississippi-republicans/36455/))   nah they worship themselves. I follow the instructions better to build a fucking swing set for the kids than they do their instructions for ever lasting life. but see i actually believed in the swing set.. that when i was done, i would have something for my kids to play on. Its not possible for them to really believe in the bible if they dont follow it.     well its possible to have a monument to those things without being in violation..... The whole point was to not worship people or objects that god is in all things and you dont have to travel to any monument to have a conversation with him,. To worship the message, not the man or the object. It depends how its treated.. thou i suspect many might treat this more than a historical artifact or a biblical message.. both of which would be ok as long as you dont treat it as divine. (but yeah christianity is chuck full of graven images)  now of course, they ignore most of those commandments anyways... especially bearing false witness and working on the sabbath(if you can get the abrahamics to even agree what day that is)  and they are in multiple [violations of the flag code](http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/flagcode.htm).. but no one ever gives a shit about that.   unless it is mirrored, the stars got to be on the other side. its not supposed to have an eagle on it no matter how cool that looks and not to be used to advertise or promote anything but the US.   i wonder how the movies will play out 20 years from now. what's he going to be, a youtube reporter? and then 40 years from now hes fucked, no one will need glasses.   [this quote from mark twain has always stuck with me](http://www.twainquotes.com/Spelling.html)... especially since i enjoy butchering the language, I find it quite inciteful. :)  It is about spelling, though i suspect the same can be said for some grammar issues.  I don't see any use in having a uniform and arbitrary way of spelling words. We might as well make all clothes alike and cook all dishes alike. Sameness is tiresome; variety is pleasing. I have a correspondent whose letters are always a refreshment to me, there is such a breezy unfettered originality about his orthography. He always spells Kow with a large K. Now that is just as good as to spell it with a small one. It is better. It gives the imagination a broader field, a wider scope. It suggests to the mind a grand, vague, impressive new kind of a cow.  the way we write when wrelaxed, do give insights to people character.   lol and yes i am completely retarded but life is more enjoyable thus so.    it would just be Bruce Wayne with a reporter pass.  your forgetting the glasses and they are the key to the disguise.    another aspect of the PCE which wasnt stated, is it the one that does the substitution crap. meaning when things get priced out of peoples ranges they switch to something more in their range. So while your grocery bill might not rise as much, the food you are eating is getting to be worse quality or desirability.  So when you substitute the maxwell house for the clear value brand, it doesnt count as "inflation" as long as the price you now pay for generic is the same as the price you used to pay for premium.   and yeah there are good arguments and good reasons to use this.. depending on what you want to show. like  how much of a percent of income they are spending on food.. that doesnt really matter so much the  substitutions. you just want total bill.  but when we are talking about flat wages, I think most of us think of quality of life compared to the past. Can i afford the same as my parents and then i really think you need to take into account the changes people have made, just to be able to survive.. me switching from nicer more expensive breads to cheap ass bread.. doesnt mean i am doing just as well as my parents did. even if my cheap ass bread cost the same as their nicer breads used to.   but yeha cpi has its issues, because some things do rise in price that has nothing to do with inflation per say but things like depleting resources and like it or not some things like gas will rise faster than pay even in a equal wage growth society.  last even if you just accept the articles outlooks, there is still arguments to be made about income inequality, even if "it isnt as bad as stated" we are a society and america is actually twice as rich as it was in 1968 adjusted per capita and for inflation. All businesses and workers have helped make this so and before this time, the growths in income were more equal and well slowly sizeable portions of this country have lost the benefits of living in a country with such a growing economy. and yes this is a different separate part of the debate, on if meager growth is good enough, or should we all have a more equal share of growth like we used to when unions were strong.  also looking at the median is better than average and all but still doesnt tell the whole story, the problem gets worse the lower the brackets you go.. and the lowest bracket actually ads a cost to all of us as they tend to need government help and are less likely to get this job provided insurance.. and if we want a complete picture, you got to take this into account that the most expensive bracket tax wise, is the one with the least wage growth over time.    i had the pass, the pass wasnt on mirror, it fell on dash. Caught cop giving ticket, showed him pass, he gave ticket anyways. In court cop said he didnt think i was disabled, and that i should get the ticket anyways. The judge said i had the right to park there. It was over 20 years ago. The cop was probably arguing i should get the ticket due to not proper display of the pass, but all i heard was him saying he didnt even think i was handicapped. but I DID show him the pass when gettting ticket. and of course it was a campus cop. But they are real cops. And actually here, they have a wide jurisdiction.  either way believe it or not, dont care, that part isnt really pertinent to the story. Just an addition to the concept that people will give you shit if they dont think you need it, when you can actually need it.    its also an infamous [NP hard problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard).. like mail routes.  which yeah you covered a little with 'available runways and air traffic' but the point is, its far more complex and hard to do than people imagine and really it can be hard to grasp how hard it is until you actually try to do it.   well scroll through this on air traffic control and they talk about the [np-hardness but you will see a lot of math most of you dont want to do.](http://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/papers/AirTransportation/The%20air%20traffic%20flow%20management%20problem%20with%20enroute%20capacities.pdf)(warning pdf)   well.. ok we know the entitled are out there but here is my story.  I was run over by a drunk driver but i could walk afterwards.. what i couldnt do, was walk and carry a lot and long distances gave me a lot of trouble. My doc gave me a handicap pass, while in physical therapy.. that i ONLY ever used for school. Grocery store i can push a cart.. but a backpack full of books all the way from student parking.. that was a bitch much.   but i would get a lot of hell for getting out of my car at a handicap space and walking. a cop actually gave me a ticket despite the pass because "you werent really handicapped".. the judge threw it out.  anyways, had i had to go to say an amusement park with family at that time, i probably would have gotten a scooter. Not to be an entitled lazy dick.. but it fucking hurt to walk long distances and keep up with family  I wouldnt have done like these ladies, i was very self concious about it all but just saying just cause they rented them, doesnt mean they didnt NEED them. especially in a crowded venue, where the walk might have been long to get to where they are.   edit: as for entitled, just remembered this tidbit,  steve jobs famously thought of handicapped parking as "premium parking" that you paid for later.(which is one reason we got to get progressive in fines)    and we hooked our vote to a network.. sigh.   at least the gov going back to paper when they list all the mental issues of people in government.. a bit late, but still, its a bit harder to hack paper.    ["jap" is generally seen a derogatory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jap)  Jap is an English abbreviation of the word "Japanese." Today it is generally regarded as an ethnic slur among Japanese minority populations in other countries, although English-speaking countries differ in the degree to which they consider the term offensive. In the United States, Japanese Americans have come to find the term controversial or offensive, even when used as an abbreviation.[1] In the past, Jap was not considered primarily offensive; however, during and after the events of World War II, the term became derogatory  so if the search terms were combined, pearl harbor and jap, it actually sorta re-enforces it, since thats when it became derogatory.  Not that the searchers meant it that way.. you can say derogatory things out of ignorance and not from hate and people often do.   just like ["jew"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews)  It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases such as Jew lawyer or Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility  though i think people are forgetting the racism behind these terms.         you just need a square can.. you will find the paper bags are infinitely better for trash.................. as long as they dont get wet. Ok they tend to get wet a lot, but they can hold a fuck ton of pointy trash without breaking.    yep sorry but this is one of those weird times, when the markets and green ideas followed the same paths for no other reason than money. And you can still get paper in some areas. mainly where richer people demand them.  also the reason plastic bags are so fucking crappy, isnt due to recycled materials, but.. "HEY lets see how little of this plastic shit we can get away with" and thats why you have to double bag if you have anything at all heavier than a nanner in them.  yeah its all about money.  Along with this plastic ban, cali is charging a paper bag tax.. fee w/e, to try to encourage stores to go 100% reusable and not just go 100% back to paper. Though most WILL at first.      these bags are made from recycled dog poop.  you can mail your dog's in and get free bags.     Does this mean I can stop buying sugar?  oh for sure, shits good. You can even train ants to move them bastards around to the sweetest parts of the tree.  of course, you kinda want to eat this bug shit before you go all wrath of god on them. Gods wrath will kill anything in its way, so dont get mistaken for an aphid.  as for your car, i guess you could join peta, fight for aphid personhood and then sue them bastards for car cleaning bills.    they shit sugar. "[honeydew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_(secretion\))"  neem oil can help if you want to be green.  systemic insecticide tends to be better if you just want to lay down the wrath of god.   and yeah [aphids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid) for sure.     Stop oppressing me.   we have before.  It my hometown we changed lighting laws, for the loggerhead turtles and have contributed to a lot of their recovery. Some people were already turning off their lights during the egg laying season but a lot werent. SO government had to tell them to stop and now things are improving.  unfortunately when its cheaper to ignore change, it takes government to force it because a portion of the population wont change. Plus you cant expect the public to be experts in all things, which is why we hope the governments listen to those who are the experts and make the wisest decisions based on the information at hand. The biggest problem is when governments have corrupting influences, that encourage the humans in government to make decisions based on personal gain rather than based on the facts.  though the public can be corrupting in themselves if we vote out people that make the hard and wise changes that we dont like.   well recycling mainly started for landfill and different pollution reasons. Emissions is a totally different problem.  We have had improvements. WE cap and traded SO2 and it was more successful than ever dreamed. WE have greatly reduced our lead emissions and there is decent evidence it caused a drop in our violent crime rate. We have made progress on  the ozone hole.  And through various environmental laws and sheer human effort, we have saved many species from almost certain extinction and have even managed to remove some from the endangered species list, though we tend to add more than we remove, there have been a ton of environmental successes and perhaps we do need to do a better job at advertising those facts.    "no return" isnt really the best phrase. What people mean is we are going to suffer bad effects and not a lot we can do about it but the earth has had higher ppm of co2 and one day can eventually have lower amounts than we do today. I mean there is a return, but we are going to have to travel over some hellish roads, for a very very very very long time, to get there.    well ultimately the intelligent beneficial ruler is the best system, its just not easily achieved.   it does appear that we  have an [ increasingly bad extinction rate](http://news.sciencemag.org/2011/03/are-we-middle-sixth-mass-extinction)  and this article does have a link and a quote suggesting the worst extinction this planet has seen was caused by acidic oceans.  However i dont see anything in the article or the paper summary that supports the part of the title before the word alarming. They dont even seem to even try to tie any current extinctions to a change in ocean acidity. The summary does say warm water corals are already being 'affected'  and that under the strictest reductions concidered, they will still be under high risk for extinction but dont attribute any extinctions to modern acidification(not denying that might be happening but it doesnt appear like this paper addresses that). It does suggest we are at risk for extinctions in all reductions scenarios and that business as usual would leave us at high to very high risk of mass extinctions within 85 years. Which is a scary short time frame.  I do wish we could edit titles without deleting the submission, especially in subreddits like this. With the political climate, it can be very damaging to not be as accurate as possible in our claims.      well some in the GOP have suggested that NASA do less "earth studies".. meaning AGW   what gets me is that anyone talks to him anymore.. And its kinda bizarre that he got so far in the field of science(even if just astronomy and not biology), that he can still lack healthy scientific skepticism.(and that doesnt mean denial, that means demanding proof and scientific rigors and not just accepting the bs that he seems to spew) and he does real science from time to time... i know a lot of scientists have trouble separating themselves from personal beliefs, heck even einstein had troubles with that, but he is just above and beyond most others when it comes to jumping to conclusions due to his desires for things to be true. its like he skipped his freshmen year but still managed to graduate with honors without the benefits of knowing the basics. Its down right bizarre. Its like he can do calculus without knowing addition. or really more like those people who scan mars rover photos and cry alien at ever rock they think is shaped like a statue., as if you cant see the same thing all over this planet that had nothing but natural origins. i got a tree with a face across the street. No aliens involved.. just some wounds and cancer.      yeah aint no way it couldnt be.. shit takes a second to dry and its too obvious due to the design.   i guess that should be owned, but horses can be driven or rode, so i guess it dont matter... still a bit hung over   A horse of course. We are finally perfecting the mechanical horse.  a little late for independance day but i was drunk off my ass just like the founding fathers.   Everything she has now, the dragons, the army, they all seem like they sort of just fell into her lap.   fell into her lap? you mean how she was pretty much sold as a slave, husband killed by a witch, and then she threw herself into a fire?  you have an interesting definition of "fell".. yeha only she could have done that and by blood she had all this coming to her, but "fall into your lap" is normally crap that is just given to you and like it or not, she did put a bit of effort into it. Not sure how many people would jump into a fire.. not even knowing you would get dragons for it.. maybe you jump into fires all the time.. idk.  its less shes self entitled, but thrown into a leadership roll when just a little while ago, she was a terrified little girl and she really doesnt know shit about how the world worked and she is feeling her way out. I suspect you thrown in this situation might find it a bit hard to deal with as well... even with some slightly unruly dragons at your side. She never asked for any of this. She never wanted it. HER BROTHER WANTED THE EVER LIVING SHIT OUT OF IT. And no matter how shes tries to be, strong, weak, fair.. shit tends to have a lot of fuck ups.  tl;dr give the girl a break, and think about what she has been through and know she didnt seek any of this.. it wasnt thrown into her lap, it was forced onto her.    your body is not an explosive launch device, not from the head, dick or butt, or any part of your body.   shhhhhhh  cant blame the banks in the least.. dont you know that. See it was the worlds poor and middle class who all at the same time decides without any help from the banks to all be irresponsible at the same time.. and please dont look at the laws the banks lobbied for. Must blame the POOR.. they are 10000% at fault for destroying the worlds economy.    he doesnt want to blame the banks at all.  just like the right in the us.  please ignore we  in the US had laws on the books that would have prevented those shitty loans to people with bad credit... and NO the government didnt force them,  on the contrary, the banks spent big money buying politicians willing to get rid of those laws, because banks, make bank, loaning to the poor.. especially those who care barely pay and are frequently late. And here in the US we bailed out the banks, AND Demanded that we give no rules on using tax payer money on bonuses, while at the same time, demanding autoworkers take a paycut before they get bailed out. Basically we only asked the poor and middle class to tighten their belts while the big banks already enjoying negative interests rates(do to inflation).. read free money got to play with tax payer money to shore up their accounts. Please ignore they knew exactly what they were doing, as they sold the same products short out the back door while pushing them onto our retirement funds and communities investments.  BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DONT GIVE THE BANKS A SINGLE BIT OF BLAME.    well except they announced they had several people to take over her position.  I'm not taking reddits side.. but they do have people to take over the AMA stuff.  and I do agree with shabinka, that we would be taken more seriously if we didnt immediately go to hitler.    this guy sounds like he  needs a tar and feathering.. /s  when reddit gets in tar and feather mode, even for legit reasons... its best to just stay out their way.    really? I have gotten ones  but its rare, never twice in a row or anything... the most i have gotten is 8.. normally i get 4. Its one of the better apps for points for me.. just its a pain in the ass a bit.    do you have a screen shot? i dont see it    Ban members who don't disclose but heavily evangelize all things Perk, 24/7? I'm not talking about people who like Perk - many do - but obvious paid shills?  I ask again.. how can you tell the difference?  I use perk.. like most of yall.  I like my amazon cards.  I attacked peopel who said stupid shit like watching only app trailers get you banned.  does that make me a shill? according to some here it does.   and who the fuck cares? there is just as many of people who hate perk irrationally as people who are likely paid shills.  well put it this way.. what do you think paid shills accomplish in this subreddit?  its not like they are adverting to many non perk users. Most of us came here after discovering perk on /r/beermoney   the "moderation" these people want.. is to ban anyone who doesnt say perk is hitler on a daily basis.  it doesnt matter if you dont promote perk.. if you dont agree with any of their witch hunts.. you got to go.    for the most part they will run.. doesnt matter time of day.. if you jump on them or they cant see you, they can attack, but generally they dont like the taste of humans. They are more dangerous at dusk but by far most get bit here fucking with them, actually jumping on them in the water, or being too close to a nest and not listening to the hissing warning the mother gives. Notice they say "almost immediately yelled for help.. he prolly jumped on one.  now crocs.. they wil fuck you up. they are the wasps of the gator looking world.   and yeah they absolutely love marshmellows. I grew up with them, caught them.. friends had them as pets, swam with them, been chased by them.. they get in your pool sometimes. Never seen anyone hurt that wasnt fucking with them or landed on one.   how do you even know?  My problem with this thread, is sometimes I DISAGREE with the witch hunts. No I am not a premium and yes perk can suck balls, but so can the kids in this subreddit who pull out the pitchforks for anything and everything, real or not. And I fear this cries of premium users will just be used to say "no i am not being unreasonable or stupid.. its just premiums downvoting me"   For example, for a while in the start people were screaming that you got banned if you only watched app trailers. It even became part of hte faq.. dont just watch app trailers or get banned. IT WAS TOTAL BULLSHIT.. but try to explain that at that time and you would have been downvoted into oblivion. We had a similar thing happen recently where suddenly people thought you would get banned from perk pop quiz if you turned on lightning mode and left it unattended. THIS IS ALSO BS.. if they wanted to stop that all they needed was a next button after a set of questions. ITs not hard. it wouldnt cost a lot of money or programming.. its like 3 fucking lines in java.  I still use perk.. i still enjoy the cards, yess i get less than i used to but they are still the best beer money app right now for people who want totally passive earnings. and no i am not a preium saying how fucking awesome they are.. thats just a fact.  edit figured on the downvotes.. teh age range of this subreddit is so retarded. sorry if i dont say perk is hitler on a daily basis.    i suspect it means they are the ones that get to play with beta crap. They might get broken upgrades before the rest of us.  I do suspect, though they said no, but then deleted it, that they might get a little more points per videos in helping them with their beta shit.  Thats the only thing i can guess their premium crap can possibly mean. That instead of having a new beta program when ever they have something like perk plastik, they have a group of beta users already ready. It just makes their lives easier, since signing people up for beta programs, does take time and normally humans. By doing it only once. with perk premium.. they can save them humans to give bullshit answers to CS inquiries    videos?  unlock and win, has no videos that i know of.. just the static ads.  it should not come up with you are watching a video in another app.  IT IS sometimes slow to come up from unlocking a slow phone.  but it has no videos.    and see these things have a negative effect.  1. this man is less likely to help the police if he hears something in the community, because he doesnt trust the police.  2. terrorists in the community now have more ammo to recruit with, when they tell young confused Arab youth, that the west is bigoted against them and their religion.     none of his previous felonies were due to violence.  if he was an american he would have been released teh same way, and she would have still be dead.  the only difference is he was here illegally and like it or not that doesnt predicate that he is a murderous asshole, as this would have happened had he been an american.  they simply wont turn them over to ice, without violence or robbery. A drug charge and being here illegally, there is no way they can predict that means he wil turn to violence. Yeah its trajectory but it isnt like they "put a previously violent illegal" back on the streets. No they put a previously caught with over 2 ounce of pot 4 times due on the streets, the other 3 were reentry which they dont recognize and would have had released he been american too.  so a judge released a man he had every reason to assume he was a non violent criminal on the streets, due to state law not turning voer non violent people in this country illegally. Tragedy yes, but this isnt quiet how some are makiing it.    and none of his previous felonies were violence, they were all drug related.    true, hes just being technically correct.. the tree in the water is bonsai like. The bon in bonsai means its in a pot.  so while it is a cute tiny tree that was probably formed naturally in much the same way as man made bonsai.. meaning the roots get pruned either by air or water.. ad it is cool as fuck, but it isnt actually literally a bonsai tree.  that being said I have no problem with it being called a bonsai simply do to resemblance even if technically it isnt one.  if we put it in a pot though......     yeah thats the problem with time shifters comments.  even as he trys to justify it from below.  that has nothing to do with teh socrats method either(not that he ever claimed it was) and it really doesnt work because basically you are belittling someone.. making them feel bad, while presenting yourself as someone with stank less shit.  All he will end up doing is pissing people off.  seriously.  And yeah we all do it some on the net.  Does pointing out extremes ever work?  all you do is get them more set in theri ways.  and make them feel bad about themselves and less wanting to listen to the smart ass, being smug.  You force them to justify a belief that contradicts their beliefs  nope, you will never get there. They will get pissed and tell you a to fuck off.. because you have been trreating them like a dumbass.. who needs to be educated, rather than  an intelligent person who knows the aswers themselves.  Liek this.. people say tax cuts actually cause the government to get more revenue.. i know yall heard this claim  I have often smuggly said.. "well the perfect tax is zero and we will be awash in money.. or even better, lets make it negative and we will be so rich and have so many jobs, we will be expanding welfare to other countries while begging mexicans to cross the boarder"  how many people you think that converted? How many replies from tax cutting advokates do you think i got? How many do you think just got upset at my snarkyness?   and yes that is logical and just like timeshifter is saying we should do.  and yet nearly 100% of them got upset rather than educated and think more of me as an ass than a teacher. IT doesnt work. You cant belittle people on their beliefs and expect them to change  and yes i have done it a lot.. and shouldnt.. cause it absolutely never works.  you cant educate someone from a position of hostility or egotistical superiority. Peoples brains just say fuck off.    le meuh    Thats not his problem  His problem is A.. the dude he is replying to shows no trait you could ascribe to the Socratic method and his description of the Socratic method is so bastardized by his comment on pwning that  he seems to miss the entire point of the Socratic method. one of the points of the Socratic method is it makes the person you are speaking with, feel more your equal and feel more like he is coming up with teh idea rather than being told. There is NO PWN at all.. thats kinda of the point. THE Socratic method makes the student feel good about themselves. PWNing and the crap timeshitter goes off on, are really in opposition to the Socratic method.  And 1000 years on, its still the best way to teach anyone anything.  its the difference from "be very careful, with that.. if you spill it it will get everywhere" versus.. "what do you think will happen if you tip that over".. "oh you think it will make a mess? "so how do you think you should treat it"... oh carefully, yess you are correct. Its leading someone to the right answer versus telling thems the right answer. WHen they are leadto use their own mind, they learn better, then simply told a fact.       actually no.. pointing out "logical inconsistancies" isnt the socratic method. WHy would you think it was? where does he even exhibit any of that crap?  all you have to do is keep pointing out the blatant inconsistencies in their own viewpoints.  That my friend, is describing statements not questions.  and calling someone a dumbass, while saying "you are exhibiting this logical fallacy" wont get you anywhere with anyone.   and socrates wasnt about pwning people or making them feel like shit. IT is a learning method where you help the people find the answers for themselves through questsions versus statements. IT creates a much stronger bond in the mind when they actually get their themselves rather than told they were wrong by some smug smart ass who things be is better than they are, EVEN IF  HE ACTUALLY IS IN THIS LIMITED SUBJECT.     unfortunately if this was reality, there wouldnt be so many of them.  you arent the only one to try to dispell their fucked up believes.  Most of these people went to college.  and its been proven that your approach actually makes them dig their heals in.  you want to know better? a little less smug and assholish?  get them their by questions and not statements. When you attack them for their beliefs they will ignore you. You help them lead their selves there.. and it might actually help.  you really arent doing any good at all.    /r/animalsbeingderps   problem is those people dont change their minds and they are the ones making the laws.  Unless you have changed the mind of the  house  republican head of the science committee  who believes the earth is only 6000 years old, evolution is bs, global warming is a scam invented by al gore, and and that teh big bang theory came from the devil. SHould I wait while you fix this?    well except in this case its true. Anti intellectualism has been peddled by the american right for so long that education is akin to another dirty word of theirs elitist.      whats more amazing is no one would have given a crap in 2012   she also said the Australian worker was greedy and [wanted to be paid too much, because other mining moguls.. get workers in africa to work for $2 a day.. so Australians need to take a pay cut.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198868/Gina-Rinehart-Worlds-richest-woman-calls-Australian-workers-paid-2-day.html)  cunt is a bit too nice of  a word for her   is it adjusted?  just a question, cause i make more than my parents, didnt see it in the article, but maybe my old eyes missed it. the point is 60k today might be more than 50k yesterday, but not wiht inflation.  thanks for answering    doesnt matter if he could afford.. its unusual it gets reported and besides he probaly used the car in committing the crime.   not really.. he just raped a woman, violating the very law he was supposed to upheld and then blackmailed her.  and probably used the car to pick her up  and its hyper unusual  the shits going to be reported.  If he rode off on a skateboard it would bre reported too.. why? cause it would be fucking weird for a corrupt cop to rape a woman and then black mail her and then jump on a skateboard to get away.  you people harping on the car are ridiculous. it would be reported no matter what and should. No being rich isnt a crime. Being a cop and having a lambo is unusual as fuck and unusual as fuck gets people to read your shit.     and no one thinks he used an exotic sports car to get his victim to go with him?  its a TOOL OF THE CRIME.    hes a crooked rapists cop who happens to also unusually drive a lambo  sorry its newsworthy  its kinda amazing how upset so many of yall are over the reporting of the car.  the dude is oviously a douche  he raped a woman  and then black mailed her  and the CAR IS PROBABLY HOW HE GOT TO HER ANYWAYS  yeah maybe this douche got the car legit. I have a feeling if he was a thief you would get it. The guy already proved he doesnt care about the law  and hey lets say his department provided it.. ITS STILL PERTINENT.. he used a lambo to pick up a girl and rape her and then blackmailed her to shut the fuck up.  deal with teh dam car and lets talk about teh contents of the story.  So sorry some of yall dont get it.  **Its unusual and the dude is a fucking rapist asshole. its going to be reported. Fuck it would be reported if he flew away in a balooon, even though the fucking balloon had nothing to do with the rape. WHY? CUASE IT IS UNSUAL.**   well actually the idea was sold as a way to catch more criminals.  one using a drug dealers own car  and the other was the police force got access to a wide variety of undercover cars versus all the ltds they used to be provided with  it was never sold as intimidation.   doesnt mean it doesnt work that way.. but they never presented it that way   you dont normally see rapists cops driving lambos but hey maybe you do. AND the wealthy always get bored and join one of the more dangerous police forces in the country  I think some of you are just perturbed.. does it matter he had a lambo?  NOPE  but think of this.. HE IS A FUCKING CRIMINAL  you fucking admitted he is a fucking criminal   dont think a fucking criminal might also do other criminal shit?  LEts say some asshole robs you.. steals your pos pinto.. cops come to his house and he has two lambos in the driveway.. would you automatically assume he got that from a lotto.. and legal?  why not? I am saying we have proof either lambos are not legitamately bought.. not the imaginary ones i made up.. or the ones from the story. But both would be reported.. WHY..  HES A FUCKING CRIMINAL.     i'm betting there are more corrupt people than lotto winners.  hummers arent lambos.. that would have had to be a much bigger settlement and a much stupider use of it   you cant buy a destroyed lamborghini on a cops salary   well not one of those conspiracy folks.. but.. the president only has as much power as he can get through congress.

YEP I am.  and you have been debunked before you even commented.  These are christians. The identfiy with it. They just are more progressive and they are just as much christian as the conservative ones who ignore poverty, who reinterpret the eye of the needle, who ignore working on sundays and lying politicians and multiple marriages.. but GAYS.. OMG GAYS.. there was 2 verses in the old testament about gays.. of course ignore when we point out the worst of the old testament 'christians" always say it doesnt count anymore.. until they need it to count.  Sorry not buying your "no true christian' comment.    well i def see a lot of the religious as super narcissistic to the point of mania. Maybe not the perfect term, but they made religion into a body mold, that fits them perfectly God dont care that much about their sins, but he sure hates everything you do.. and cares about the sins others do that you care about.  lying? eh god wasnt serious.  working on sunday? yeah that was a long time ago.  help the poor? LOLOL, i think liberals added that part.  But gays.. yeah fuck them, and Dont call me a bigot, gods the one who said that, not me.   basically we do have a lot of self worshipers.  (and just to pull back a little, it is kinda human nature to see your own shit dont stink but others do... i might cook some stinky ass food but its my neighbors walking on the ceiling thats really annoying but still point is valid, they have a religion of self.)    its most used by conservative catholics who disagree with the progressives on what is the main beliefs.  you know some people think the gay marriage thing is a more important fight than helping the poor, and well some think the exact opposite. dont really have to tell you which is which?     so "the religious"  yeah wake me up when someone threatens to set themselves on fire because we let people work on sundays.... that part was only written in stone..matter of fact the term "written in stone" meaning permanent or important, comes from this exact story.     Totally untrue man. And sorry if we only did one thing at a time, we would still be arguing over spear heads.  [Fallacy of relative privation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_relative_privation)   we can be concerned over healthcare and the enviroment.  I can be concerned over feeding my kids and the power bill.  The world doesnt stop as we solve one problem at a time.    sorry dude you are wrong on so many levels. First most our oil comes from canada, we hardly get shit from the middle east. and you know with the shales and fracking, the us production is through the roof.  the problem is oil is a world wide market.. and so the middle east is going to be a big player.  Its also really stupid to suggest we do one thing at a time. I get these issues are ones that dont mean shit to you, but if it was school vouchers and killing obamacare you would be cheering from the rafters.  Its a bad fallacy and something yall do all the time, to suggest we can only do one thing at a time.  yall said the same with healthcare "its the economy, sure people dying in our system sucks but look at UE" and some how we managed to do both at once. I know crazy.  sorta like how google can do the search engine shit, the youtube shit and still manage to find time to do the isp thing and the phone thing. WOW amazing, so much multi tasking.   and dude.. the gay marriage and confederate flag wouldnt have been such a issue, if your side didnt fight it tooth and nail into the ground. dude, your side is still fighting a losing issue after they lost. So give me a break. Seriously if it is no big deal.. if we should be concerned on other things, why did the right put up such a fight? why are they spending millions in my state to try to keep fighting gay marriage?  nah your side is transparent, gay marriage is important, your just upset that the ruling went against your views.      I would be equally annoyed if developing nations could be more profitable simply because nobody is holding them accountable for polluting. I understand that these laws surrounding fossil fuel production and emissions DO have a big effect on the consumer in terms of price for food, goods, and most other things that require fuel/energy in the modern world.   thats actually one of the big  nearly intractable fights. Both sides have valid points.  the poor nations say the rich nations got theri on cheap co2 and they should have the right to do the same or get compensated for being asked to leave it in the ground, because the right nations have already over polluted. They didnt add all that to our co2 ppm.. we did, they just are starting now.  where rich nations want everyone under the same per capita rules.  and you also got to figure, most of the poor nation polluting is to service the richer nations, and often they didnt build that crap, richer nations put that crap in poorer nations for the cheap labor.     their subsidies dont hurt   I think that argument could easily be destroyed by someone who understands the science. but then again those who tend to scream the loudest about planes, are the ones who dont even believe in agw.      well you know the funny thing?  It used to be the opposite. "It's" used to be possessive.  [So its kinda funny to see the people correcting, when this way was actually the first correct way.](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=its)  wyrmsaintph is just being old school. :P      its a cheap excuse.. that might be true..and yes some of those standards were made so their darwin candidates could live.. but the thing had lights and noises and witnesses prove she was an idiot.  Sure was the idiot protection not completely installed? yeah. Sounds like she would have died anyways. Thats just a lawyer being a lawyer, and noticing that updated code hadnt wound its way all the way down.     thats just some laywerese for my clients and idiot.   google wont help.. its mainly impatient people, ignoring the flashing lights that are normally there, assuming the train is traveling slower than it is.  we had to put the gates all over town to try to get people to actually stop for the flashing lights.   yeah there is a coalition of right wingers with different goals.  some trying to kill teacher unions because the want to get rid of all that labor protection crap.. they are trying to make the US more ceo centric for a polite term.  some want to change the history, to try to train more americans to be accepting of the right winger BS.. like trickle down. They are like if science and evidence is against us, we will just teach people it worked anyways.  there are the bigots that hate their kids go to school with black kids.. its kinda big in some areas down here.. in some of the areas where the public schools are a bit minority heavy in population.   and they join with the religious who want to downplay evolution. but it is definitely multiple groups with multiple goals   its in the article.. not picking just saying.  The vouchers were at the heart of a series of conservative reforms that have transformed Douglas County into an educational battleground in recent years, pitting teachers unions, civil liberties groups and liberal parents against conservative families, a majority conservative school board and a group backed by the billionaire conservative Koch brothers.     good it didnt happen.. but the right are pretty fucked up with the revisionism.. and the left would never get away with that crap. Can you imagine us forcing textbook makers to make our history more progressive? maybe play up more how much of a traitor to the country reagan was, and how his actions caused a lot of trouble and we were all saved by bill clinton. and progressivism.  The right winger chant on brainwashing would be deafening. It really would be. We would be called hitler, stalin and every other oppressive controlling regime on the planet.  i think the left must not do that as much cause the right cry so loudly when we point out their bs. It is amazing how fast they can go from tough guy to pooor little ole victims.    This whole thing isn't about public vs. private schools so much as it is a bunch of well-funded fundamentalists being upset their kids are being taught things like gasp science, and history.  yeah well part of that is decline of favor of conservatism, and they want to teach that fucked up history texas school board is in favor of, you know the one where slavery barely happened and was no big deal.. thomas jefferwho? yeah we dont need him no more. and the freemarket  killed hilter. and protests against the gov? never happened.  and then their is some resegregation going on.  but yeah the koches arent spending millions on pushing the voucher program for religious reasons.. they want to control how people learn.. its private market big brother. 2 +2 = 5 cause the koch brothers need people to think its 5.  the fascist right, just find helpful allies in the uber religious right.    we they were ruled legal.. and they are trying to take it back to scotus.  and yeah the kochs, fucked that place up   well figured cause it said colorado court, but yeah some might not get that. They arent right either way. The right are using them for resegregation and to stop teaching evolution.   wot      it depends on the area, but some small areas are like that. Quick look at the map and yeah this place is [nowhere ohio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/105+Milan+Elyria+Rd,+South+Amherst,+OH+44001/@41.3579614,-82.2401419,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x883a753f97d9df6f:0x9064196cbc1073d7)  could be a bonus though, could  get min wage but a bonus if called.   yeah they actually said that in a different acticle. They were banned on the rides forever, but people ignored it. They kept having to stop rides because people had the sticks out and they could hurt someone. and since a lot of people couldnt follow the rules at the ride, they ban them at the gate. I think they said they stopped a ride for like 45 minutes.. and that they got to stop when they see people with them, just incase.   we'd look scarier with a bunch of beards    but yall all do walk around pushing your $50 [watermelons in their own little  cooler cart](http://theawesomer.com/photos/2010/07/072010_portable_watermelon_cooler_1.jpg), like I invision?    most likely a lot of us wont see it in our life times.  i suspect first we will expand the food stamp program to include everyone.  we will greatly expand the military for jobs.. and greatly expand things like park service, more and more of us will work for the government as jobs in the private sector get automatized.  they will shift society this way and that to avoid basic income.  and it wont even have a chance, before hiring the entire country becomes completely untenable.  but they will try.    and it wont be simple and we should debate exact more what it would entail.  obviously pretty much all of welfare gone except maybe healthcare.  no more min wage i suppose  and what about legal and illegal immigration? i have mixed thoughts on that, since as long as non citizens didnt get the basic income, it shouldnt be horrible if they took some jobs.  But i'm not sure the whole effects a basic income would have on society.  the right would probably want more appeasement, maybe we would actually have to do the civil service they want, like in israel where everyone spends a couple years in the military or some other civil server. and maybe even keep the perpetually unemployed on call for civil duty, like after natural disasters and such.  theres going to be trading to go on to get this through.  Its not going to be peaches and cream, we are going to have to choke down some bad things i think just to have a chance.  shit do you know how long we have been fighting for single payer? and the evidence it works is all over the planet. we still aint got it. obamacare is about the worst BETTER idea than we had. But its a step. we actually changed something. And look at what it went through just becoming and staying a law. Heck people brought out guns to the debates. There were fist fights, one dude lost a finger. And it barely passed. and barely survived twice.  its a simple solution with a hard as fuck implementation.      indicates a possible reentry of space debris.  its debris from an unidentified flying object  ;)    one more i really like, especially for family but i have to admit i like it too.  [unchecky](http://unchecky.com/). All it does is make sure none of crapware is checked, when you install things, even if they are below scroll bars or worded weird.  So no more avg toolbars and crap.  i admit i missed the check box now and then and cursed avg or aoil or who ever as i uninstall their shit. but it really shines for less computer literate relatives where the toolbars seem to breed.    The fact that this is a debate, shows that perhaps we need to work a little on our language. Sure we could work more on teaching grammar but when so many have trouble in some areas, like the rules of the semicolons, it might be time to revisit the idea and see if we can come up with more intuitive ideas. And put some hats on our vowels, that's just handy.  lol people good at grammar always downvote this stuff. Like it or not our language is more mistake prone due to not having hats for our vowels. Imagine this, archeological dig in the future, and they find this big device, some people think it's some kind of mechanism like a clock, others think it's a horrible torture device. They dig out more and find a small plaque and all the writing is worn off but one word- wound. With the information at hand, is it a clock? or a torture device? hats would help.    well now they can profit from it, like they did the wiretaps.

 No Ragrets!   It's funny, back in the "dark" days we were irrelevant, Fitz wasn't so bad.  Maybe it was b.c there wasn't much to cheer about, but I don't remember getting annoyed since I didn't mind listening to him on KNBR.  But slowly as we got better Fitz began to change as well, more so on the radio.  He would actually berate callers if fans criticized the Warriors management, etc.    Now when you turn the game on, Fitz is unbearable.  He's such a homer at the most obvious times, and his stubborn insistence of using "Human Torch" has worn thin   CP3 and his flopping ass.  He's always getting tangled up and then throws his hands up in the air when a foul gets called against him.    Right behind CP3 is Blake Griffin and his flopping ass.  Someone that big always on the ground?  And then tries to pull the tough guy act?  Fuck those 2   17 y.o can't calm shit   Similar happening but on a bus tour.  My wife and her friend did a bus tour from NYC-New Orleans (3 day ride).  The bathroom on the bus was not working because it was a old bus.  A huge sign was on the door that clearly stated not to use the bathroom either.    Clearly, the sign didn't matter as the passengers (mostly Chinese) all used the toilet.  About 2 hours into the ride and the entire bus smells like a septic tank.  Literally the entire bus smelled like shit and none of the Chinese passengers seemed to mind.  It was still day 1 of the trip   You hit it on the mark re "look out for yourself".  Buddy of mine who used to live in China said it's because of the way communism works over there.  Literally every single person is looking out for themselves only, and loses complete disregard for others.     You know it's bad when they have [signs](http://www.businessinsider.com/china-is-embarrassed-by-its-tourists-2013-5) at the Louvre in Chinese      Along the same lines, but there's gotta be some correlation between fast food and aggression    Dahntay Jones don't play, what's he doing in the picture?     Born in 77 as well, and was definitely spoiled growing up.  I remember times if the 49er's weren't up by more than 3 TD's that I would start panicking.  Especially the '95 team which was so fun to watch.  You just don't realize how good you have it til you see the same team go downhill.     Fitz a legend?     I'm feline it   Wallace never struck me as a "team" guy, and there's been reports he gives up on plays.  Plus he doesn't block well in the run game   Young's 1 on 1 play wouldn't jive with a lot of playoff teams.  No way in hell teams like the Warriors would let him disrupt chemistry by him jacking up 3ptr and 3ptr.  In fact, there's probably a reason teams weren't pushing harder before the trade deadline   I'm Asian, I don't sound like that   It also depends on what you're doing before/after games.  Grande Hyatt is nice, but not much going on late late night.  The weekends are even worse.    If you're going strictly for the games, I'd suggest downtown Oakland.  The hotels won't be as nice, but you can get to OCO in 20 min or less.  And these days , the bar and restaurants are solid on Broadway.    I'm Asian, and I don't sound like that       Tasmanian devil for sure.     Exactly why when child and sex abuse cases come up, you try and not have the child repeat their story multiple times.  Each time it could change slightly, especially if they have to testify   This is kinda creepy, but I sat a few rows behind you guys!  Sec 103?  I was chuckling to myself when I saw the Vo jersey.  Way to represent the bay, there were hella Dubs fans.  The best was when the crowd started to chant "MVP" when Curry was at the line      Purely speculation, but Harbs refusing to bench Aldon and Ray Mac after their arrests played a part.  Our window to win the Super Bowl is 2 years max, and it would be risky to keep the staff intact and gamble another season.     I'd bring up the fact that the Warriors were awful for the longest period of time.  We were the laughing stock of the league, but the fans were still so loyal.  That should get a conversation going.    Another topic I like to bring up at sports bars is the excitement Curry brings to the NBA.  The last time I felt as though a player could dominate a game was MJ/Kobe.  There's times when everyone stops what they're doing and just watches Curry drop 3's from downtown.  The last player to capture that kind of excitement was Jordan.  And please, this is not an comparison of players.  Just a comparison of how dominating and exciting these 2 players are   I wish they could do a study on the effects of Fast Food and Anger.  There has to be some kind of correlation and how it affects the brain.     True, I think there is just more of it theae days due to reddits popularity.     It's bc the demographic of Reddit has changed in the recent years.  This place used to have great content with real conversation.    Now you got a bunch of young H.S and college kids that like to troll and post crap comments.  Remember a few weeks ago, there was a pic of a guy dying of cancer that posted a pic of his wedding day?  Some redditors joked about his baldness, others made fun of his fiance.  Truly tasteless   BC there's a lot of teenagers on this sub.  Once he got the swaggy nickname, he became this icon around here.  Pointless and stupid    I think this is similar to sports analytics which many teams in basketball use.  There's a ton of metrics and spreadsheets that essentially gives you data such as best spot for jump shots, running certain plays, etc.   This stuff is used a lot esp since its devised from programmers in Silicon Valley.    My guess is that the F.O is huge on this formula with Marathe heading it   I'm waiting for the sequal, Whore 2.     It wouldn't be this bad if the F.O had a actual plan in place.  Watching everything unfold, it looks as though they're grasping at straws.    We went from proven leader and success to somewhat unproven (Tomsula's 100% win percentage is too small a margin)  Put it this way, the Seahawks game last week was unbelievable.  Special teams did some amazing shit, and the play calls were remarkable.  You think we can match that kind of wits right now with that staff?      Wouldn't go as far as troll account, that's giving him too much credit.  I like the term "Internet Tough Guy"  "Hey!  Look at me, I found Reddit and now I'm talking shit and feel like such a strong man"  beating chest and cock together simultaneously    Was thinking Mangina   I meant in terms of the dislike the teams have for each other   This year our rivalry is with Houston.  The clippers are an after thought    I bet he's a blast at parties   I'll take it one notch further.  Reddit is about pics and discussion.  But at what point is the line drawn where stock photos are posted without credit, or posting of pics without any explanation of where it originated?    This sub in the past was real food from real people.  Now all I see is a glamour shot and a title that screams "strawberry filled  strawberry cheesecake!!!"  Mind you that post I was referring to had its water mark cropped out    [Here](http://badblooddocumentary.com/) is a informative documentary that details what went on    You gotta wonder if this all the handpicking done by Balke.  I really doubt Tomsula wants it this way.  But again, this is part of being a "yes" coach to the F.O.  Tomsula will agree to it b.c he wants his shot as a Head Coach   Can you explain how this is considered fast food?     I do sound like that "guy".  Even the other day I told my wife by how shitty music had gotten.  But this pic is different, with a person dying,  enjoying whatever time they had left.    Leave it to the punk ass to bring their own agenda.  The jk wasn't even funny.  Reddit 4 years ago is way different than today.  There were trolls and such, but much more worse now   They have an in house patisserie, all she does is bake bread.  And the butter from France along with salt was incredible.    Again, never thought I would rave about such simple foods, it was unbelievable   If you're able to create+ taste what was posted, you could work at any restaurant in NYC or in the world.    The chefs that work at Eleven Madison usually go onto opening their own restaurants and those joints become well known.    I get that a carrot seems so simple.  Having lived in different countries, I realized how much better produce is compared to the US.    Perfect example?  Chicken sashimi in Japan.  Unheard of here right?  But what if the chicken was killed that morning by a person that specializes in certain breeds and its been handled for generations.  It tasted so clean, I had nothing to worry about.   My point is, the food that you're used to, depending on where your from isnt comparable to what your seeing in this post   You wonder why reddit goes to shit these days?  Posts such as the one above.  Good job kiddo, you've discovered the Internet and now you have chance to act funny and hide behind a screen bc you'll never do in "real" life   You couldn't have post this at a better time.  There's a divide in this sub, and it's clear what makes front page and what doesn't.  Shooter sandwich, In and Out, charcuterie and cheese are all front page click bait.  Funny thing is, some of the pics are stock photos!  Some go even as far as cropping out the watermark.   What I'm trying to get at is, there's the older reddit population (30+) and younger generation and its evident when you read some of the comments in here.      You could do that at your house, but I'm pretty certain you won't be close to duplicating the same flavors    I used to think that was the case at these restaurants, but when my wife and I went to a 3 star, we almost had to be carried out.   The dessert section alone was 4 courses and they let us take it home bc we couldn't finish it.     My wife and I went to jean gorges for our 1 yr.  Some of the dishes looked similar.  And I agree, the bread and butter was the best ever.  My wife even snuck extra pieces in her purse.     It's funny how every laker fan was bashing D'antoni, but looking back now, lots of folks would do anything to have him back   I like to lurk in r/Lakers sub every so often to read the absurd posts.  It's so cringe worthy.  Stuff like, can we trade for Anthony Davis?  Or let's trade Nash, Lin, and some draft picks for a super star.       I see the Xs and Os as Pop, and the mental aspect as Phil Jackson    Our window for "successful" is extremely small, maybe 2-3 years tops.  And as much as everyone has been praising our Defense, we lost McDonald and possibly Justin Smith.  That's 2 seasoned veterans gone right there.    I'm optimistic, but very very cautious as to this year's draft.  The 2012 draft that Balke whiffed on can bite us in the ass down the road as well   Uhhh OK. Id much rather watch a old guy on TV than a pretty chick.    I'm throwing this out there.... There's a good chunk of Alex Smith fans that are still salty.    There's also a good portion of folks that don't know shit about football in general, I.e possibly bandwagon, possibly generation gap, who knows.  But the posts on here are showing exactly that.     STEVE YOUNG HAS ONE RING FOOL  Congrats.  You done fucked up now.  You managed to "out" yourself as a fan that doesn't know shit about your own team.    I was wondering these days the types of "fans" we had on r/49ers.  There's a huge divide in here and you just exposed it.          What's in your tare mixture?   So far what I love the best is that Steve Kerr is playing rookies and not afraid to put them in the lineup. Just like the spurs, gsw is going to be able to develop talent for the long run   Hey look, I can find pics on [pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/1688918586070362/) too and act like I made it or ate it!  Why not give credit where credit is due?    Source?   Please post a source.     Don't feed him, he's secretly a Clippers fan   what did you miss about him?  And if he were to be on the roster today, which player would you replace him with?  I get that he was a great teammate, but man it's comical he's even mentioned this year especially with us being title contenders    Be right back, heading to the gas station to pick up a burrito   It's b.c OP took this pic and claimed at as his.  This person has literally stolen dozens of other people's work and claimed as their own   I posted an answer similar to yours when the charcuterie incident went down.    20 year old me would have posted burger and pizza pics all day   Late 30s me is all about a home cooked meal I.e oxtail stew; handmade pasta, etc.        I love food, and everything about it, and I'm also a purist, which some could label as snobby.  But if I see a post that is inaccurate, or a stock photo, or people using words for click bait, I'll try and educate without being a dick.  Maybe it's b.c of my Japanese upbringing, who knows.    But I assure you that this sub a few years ago had awesome content, all of it being genuine.  And I felt as though today was finally the day to bring this up as a conversation piece   You couldn't have replied this at a better time.  There's a healthy debate going on as I type this about this exact sort of B.S.     Thank you for doing that b.c OP hasn't posted a single recipe for any of the other posts.  The link that was provided which was quickly deleted was of the recipe you had mentioned.      Surprise surprise...look at the other posts submitted from OP.  3 other posts, no recipe.  Again, I'm not trying to bust people out, or be a dick, but this sub was a legit with "real" food from "real" people.       Last 30 days I haven't posted any food pics.  Feel free to see what I've submitted in the past.     That's pretty spot on.  A few years ago r/askreddit was starting to change with clickbait questions and unnecessary info before the question was asked.  The mods quickly enforced the rules and it got much better.      Top posts that usually make it are:  In and Out  Sushi drizzled with sauces  Charcuturie Plates  Shooter Sandwich     I'm all for that, but I'm also seeing stock photos being re used from time to time.  There was a request awhile back where if you posted food pics from an establishment, it was necessary to add the name and location.       Serious question here.  This sub used to have quality posts of food pics that were amazing.  These days, it's taken a nose dive.  Case in point, the infamous charcuturie pic that was voted #1 for days.  Or today for instance, OP posting a burger claiming it to be Kobe.    What's upsetting is that when you take the time to scroll down, there's actually some really solid, authentic cooking.  I'm done with my rant, please feel free to agree/disagree on this, or add suggestions as to how to improve this sub.     I'm betting most of those cases in the NYC courts are mary jane related   kid n play would like to have a word with you    I would put izakaya in the same class as tapas.  Small dishes to share that go well with drinks.           Sounds like the John Madden of football   Daring to go out on a limb here and risk the divide, but I think the demographics of r/49ers goes something like this:  Old timer fans, and New Generation fans  Early days fan born late 70's-early 80's= Fortunate to witness multiple Super Bowls, Joe Montana, etc...I myself was lucky to see this.    Newer Gen Fans= Abysmal years Nolan, Singletary, etc..Then its Harbs and Kaep and we got ourselves a new team, new identity.    I'm not dogging either one, but you can tell the discrepancy when reading posts and pics, comments, whatever.  But you did bring up a very good point, which is football discussions are very hard to relate in this sub.  I believe it's the generation divide amongst the fan base.          Defensive end all the way.  Our pass rush was nothing like the 2012 season.  And now that we lost McDonald and most likely Cowboy, we have some holes   The year Baltimore won it all, John Harbaugh fired his O.C midseason.  Unheard of, and ballsy, but it was the move that put them over the top.  Keep in mind, the O.C Cam Cameron was Harbaugh's close friend.    Now flip the script and look at Jim.  He's loyal to a fault, which most likely cost him his job.  He should have been held accountable and I wouldn't to waste/risk next year retaining Jim and watching the same anemic offense we have for the past 2 years.    his is the difference maker between the 2 brothers.  Jim is rowdy, ra-ra-ra, and loya, John is on the sidelines, composed and calm but rational.  There's some eerie similarities between SF+Baltimore, but the Ravens are coached way more efficiently with far less talent that SF.        Holmgren has a better approach and balance IMO.  He did more with less in Green Bay than Shanny did in Denver.  It's easy for me to say this now, but having Elway and T Davis is a formidable 1-2 compared to what Farve had in Green Bay.     Purely speculation, but my guess is bc Holmgren likes to have full control of football operations, which we all know Trent ain't gonna give up.  Curious as to why they were interested in Shanny since he usually is bith GM/Head Coach   This year I didn't know which 49er team would show up playing.  Sometimes they were run dominant, and other times they did spread offense which looked like dogshit.  Last year they were unpredictable at times, maybe bc of Crabtree.  I just wish they played like they did on the road in New England in 2012.  Moss and Crabs were balling out that game       Just curious but how much time does he interact with the F.O?  A daily basis, once in awhile?     Him and Fangio were assistants back in Baltimore during their hay days.  No doubt the guy knows defense.  Thoughts?   Wow before this, I never looked at Balke as a condescending person, but now it's a whole different light.    Also, how the fuck can they say that they are looking for "teachers?"  Harbs was the best teacher   I remember reading an article when Harbuagh was first hired that he was excited to have access to hours and hours of Bill Walsh videos.  There was nothing this year that was remotely even close to WCO.  No slant patterns, no play action for deep passes, etc..  Was it because of a lack of speed receivers?  I'd like to hear thoughts   You know in the back of my head, I'm hoping that he leaves Mich early, and re signs with us.  Then at the press conference, Jed stands up and apologizes on camera and they both hug.  Camera angle then focuses on Balke standing in the back of the room, clapping slowly (80's movie reference)  and all will be restored in 49er land   We gotta get AD up on reddit   I wanna add that in DC, Shanahan hired his son as the coordinator and was very unprepared.     Yeah really, Cutler is way better.  So good, that he could beat the Pack in Green Bay in the dead of winter.  Or come from behind and beat Atl on the road.  Or set a playoff record for rushing yards by a Qb.     The Spurs play team ball to the ultimate degree.  Duncan doesn't give a shit about scoring, or how many touches he gets a game    Piggybacking off this, but what happened to our acclaimed West Coast offense?  I remember when harbaugh was hired early on, he said he had access to hours of bil Walsh videos of him breaking down offense.  There was nothing this year that looked remotely anything close to WCO.  No quick slants, no play action for bombs, timing patterns, etc.  It's as if he was trying to use his Stanford play book and tweak it to accommodate Kap.   We need someone proven, Holmgren, bill Cowher.     But how does letting jim go make the FO more comfortable?  The heat is on them moving forward.  Finding a new coach, having to answer to the relentless media is gonna be taxing.     The niners FO is ran differently than the majority of nfl franchises.   Look at Dallas and the iron fist of jerry jones.  Cowboy fans are waiting for him to croak so they can start fresh.    Or how about Cleveland and they're worthless owner who has a trigger finger for firing coaches.     We have a win now mentality, and our window is closing quickly.  Again, I really don't think Jed and Trent are that petty and sensitive that they're letting jim go simply bc they dislike him.    We're taking a humongous gamble here, but seeing how progressive we've been in literally every other business scenario, I'm at peace with this.   I for one can't stomach another dismal offense, and waste another year which it sounds like was going to happen since jim refused to let roman go   I want to give the FO the benefit of the doubt here.  Although we will never truly know the full story, harbaugh must have pissed the FO enough times for them to be fed up with it.    It's not like there letting him go on a whim.  The FO knows how valuable he is/was.  They're not stupid, the fit isn't there anymore .  All I'm hoping for is that they have a legit candidate in mind.  One that is proven, I.e Holmgren, maybe Cowher.      And that's why it was comical seeing him taunt his own teammates last week in practice.  I get it that he's trying to push em and make em tough, but the whole "charmin" comparison and tough guy approach is cring worthy.        Without being judgemental in age, you can see the divide in generation gaps in r/food.  20 y.o old me would have post a burger or pizza and be completely thrilled.    Not that those kind of foods are bad, but now that I'm in my late 30s, taking the time to enjoy a meal I.e oxtail stew, or risotto, hand made pastas are much more satisfying    You can tell the meat was taken straight out of a package, not even sliced from a real market.  I wanted to give props to the cheese, but again some basic grocery market shit.  Thing is, pretty sure if OP took the time, he/she prob could have found a legit cheese monger   Why does everyone assume fangio would consider the hc position?  He's been with Harbs for the last 2 gigs.  He's gone if Harbs is gone    No point trying to explain football to a newbie.     Rght and the inability to throw down the field is the OCs fault as well.  If Alex fanboys such as yourself keep spitting out the same excuse of switching coordinators, this argument has to wait for 5 more years till Kaep has had a few more years under his belt   So you did see the stat that a Chiefs WR hasn't scored a TD in a year?  Let that settle in for a second    I'm with you re Balke, and although he has made many good picks, the person prior to him is worthy of mention.    Scott Mclouglin was the G.M before while Balke was the understudy.  Most folks jump to praise Balke, but let's not forget how who the person was before.   And no surprise, after Sf fired Mcloughlin, Seattle hired him for a quick second.    What round do we take a QB?     This was the 2nd time same officer Daniel Pantaleo deployed a illegal choke hold.  I'm not sure how much bearing this had in the indictment, (obviously none) but you would think that the jury would weigh his past offense heavily.     The 2007 playoff series vs the Mavs felt like that.  I swear at one point, Oracle felt as if it were shaking   	113
 Who is this?      I figured as much but it's still not fair. Hah   At least your possums are cute looking, the American opossum is fucking terrifying to look at.         It is the technical term but from my experience, if a patron orders a drink like that, they are either extremely new to drinking or an ass.   When people use the terms 'cupa libre' or 'cape cod.' Bitch, you're getting a rum and coke or a vodka cranberry, quit trying to be fancy.   7777      Fuck^yes      Where as I believe it to be a real building, there are several programs that can render to lifelike extents. This one appears to be revit using the acad render farm that's free for students. Either that or a boss computer!   	13
 Slytherin!   Me too, hence username.   Frank Turner   Every account on reddit is a bot except you.   I love it   Don't sit down cause I've moved your chair - Arctic monkeys   Congrats!  You should be so proud. My stats are similar F/5"4/ SW 154/CW 149/GW 120. Do you use MFP? I'd love to add you. :)   You're a ridiculously beautiful specimen.     	9
 Are you saying that religious ideals are narrow minded?   Is it?   Are you calling religion "bullshit"?      what do you mean by "religious freak"?                  next time wear a gopro and put your drone in the air first   tl;dw: "cocks taste good"                                             Who does   It's true.  My son-in-law operates a very successful business in E. Longmeadow with cash only.  It's a completely legit business, he pays his taxes on time and in full.  He just prefers to operate on a cash basis.  No banks involved.   I think this is a pretty big thing out here in Western Mass.  Most of my friends and colleagues are bank-free.  Instead of socking away excess cash in a savings account or CD, most people are buying land or other assets that will grow over time.            The POTUS role is not of captain, rather of cheerleader.  He/she has no real power.   Don't worry, he'll drop out soon enough, or the Clinton machine will do something drastic   This gear is not college-level.  This is pro gear that costs a lot of dough   It usually is.   People don't take him seriously because he's not a serious candidate.  He will drop out sooner or later.   Your point being?   Fear Theater /r/feartheater   20,000   did you see that movie "wag the dog"?   So Ellen was merely a pawn, cannon fodder if you will.  I hope you paid her well   sticks and stones, my friend, sticks and stones   It sounds like you're having a panic attack during these episodes.  I recommend learning how to breathe through it.   /r/conspiracy is protected            You don't need a lease to walk a dog, not in Massachusetts anyway   I love it.  Putting it on my twitter profile! (the part with the black fish)                           I learned how to drive on my Grandfather's John Deere tractor.  Been driving now for 53 years (I'm 63).  Never, not even once, been in an accident while I was driving.      hey 18 year olds fight our wars...why not drive out trucks too?   I'm actually thinking of doing it when I retire next year.  I'm in excellent health, have 20/20 vision, my night vision is impeccable, and I've always wanted to see more of the country.     we are amazing animals, we humans, but in the end, we are just animals   Agreed.  And taken pictures of the dogs, the leg, the owners and the location...but I'm sure they were freaked out and forgot all of that.  I work in an ER.  Some people just cant stand the sight of blood                        I saw someone driving a Smart car yesterday.  The license plate read "EPANTS"   Neat idea.  Incredibly slow            I agree on the internet.  I spend a lot of time in South Korea.  When I come back to the states it feels like dial-up for double the money!      Lol it went right to spam!   Voat rhymes with Stoat, smells like Goat      Awww, I miss @ekjp already :(   Two stickies for a week's worth of work?  Geez, can I have your job?      Because she obviously had no parents            It's not about sitting at desks...it's about desk farms in corporations/businesses...that's what's on the outs.  If our dinky little hospital in Springfield, Mass can be more automated and efficient, why can't yours?                     They look like ballast to me (59 years of sailing)   Well I am an ER doc and most of my staff are nurses.  We use palm top devices for notating and keeping track of most things.  I do have a desk at home, but I rarely use it any more.  When I sit, it's to take a load off on a break.  Even our staff use hand-held devices.  The only people in my hospital that sit for their work are people that interface with the client support system...that is still pretty antiquated.  But it's changing.  For example, an IT firm from Boston just made a presentation last week about how the whole interface (registration, questions, scheduling, billing) system will be automated with touchpads and software within 2 years, eliminating the need for people to sit at desks.   Wake them up, you mean   I'm a physician.  I work at an ER for a big hospital near Springfield, MA   Holyoke, MA has more churches per square mile than any other industrial city in this New England state.  When the factories moved to Mexico and later China, the tax base in the city dropped by a huge percentage.  The city had to find a way to recoup its loss, so it forced the churches out (in subtle ways).  Many of them have been converted into public housing and private businesses, replacing some of the tax revenue and eliminating the waste.   Believe what you will.  Honestly, I can't say any more.  Don't ask me any more questions.   Several times a day.  We have software that can automate most tasks.     Buy your surplus AK47s now!  They're cheap      Don't just go with that site...There are others that are more credible.  I can't say more.                     That's cool.  I'll torrent it   #feartheater /r/feartheater   It constantly amazes me that people still work at desks in offices...   I bought one   Regardless, he's either pathological or on serious drugs.  I'm guessing the former   You're absolutely right it could happen.  In fact it did, many times over.  Remember Katrina?  Yeah.  How about Sandy?  And that's just in the last 5 years...when I was younger earthquakes in California were rampant...seemingly every couple of years something would wipe out LA or San Fran...   I'm not a member of those groups   Therefore, God   Because the father is pretty stupid.  It amazes me that in this day and age, people consider "texting" to have the same value as talking in person.  This douchebag got all pissy because his girlfriend wouldn't answer his text, so he goes and tries to kill his family and himself.  That's fucked up   I hope you do and good riddance!               Well maybe it wasn't you, but it was a lot of the same old conspiratards:   http://sgtreport.com/2015/06/jade-helm-whistle-blower-possible-emp-attack-in-texas-on-monday-june-15/  https://verumetinventa.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/new-world-order-jade-helm-possible-emp-attack-on-texas-61515/  http://jamesfetzer.blogspot.com/2015/06/jade-helm-going-live-15-june-with-emp.html  http://www.veteranstruthnetwork.com/index.php/usnews/item/290-jade-helm-going-live-15-june-with-an-emp-over-texas  http://resistancejournals.com/2015/06/14/texas-under-attack-saudis-gunfights-jade-helm-and-emps/   Welp, they said they would...so it could be a coincidence   Also Seattle and parts of California according to this map http://map.ipviking.com/#   But it's not your body, it's your kids body, and if they are in a public school where there's a good chance of picking up germs or infecting other kids, neither I, nor the CDC want that to happen   Still waiting on your EMP from a month ago, OP   Yes yes and what's your point?   This whole "petition" thing is BS.        Not really.  I live in Amherst, Ma.

According to our source, while studying at Indiana University, Fogle ran a very successful pornography rental company out of his bedroom. His porn collection was vast and extensive, and Fogle took his business pretty seriously. A video would run a patron a dollar a day (cheap!), and people would come from all over to take advantage of the deal. Needless to say, Jared had enough porn to keep his customers happy."

 BJ?  https://youtu.be/U4QBCqy3Cms   The thing is... she really is ugly. I mean... come on people she looks like a fucking horror movie.   Congrat-u-fucking-lations you've managed to do something completely ordinary.    something something potato    I can jack off to this   yuck   "Against the Day" by Thomas Pynchon (more steampunk than sci-fi but still awesome)  "Diamond Age" by Neal Stephenson (a must-read for every human on the planet)  "Snow Crash" another Neal Stephenson  "Neuromancer" by William Gibson  "Feed" by MT Anderson   Hey Kevin Smith, the 90's called.

Reverse the sexes... do you feel the same way?   why why why is a teacher taking a student out anywhere? This movie was cringey.   good thing I typed this then eh?   can't lose the ugly though   I know it's too soon for the next review, the half-drunk bottles are starting to pile up...but I didn't make the purchase this time. This cute respiratory therapist that I work with is trying to win brownie points with me so brought me a few samplers. I'm excited for this one especially because it will be the oldest scotch I've reviewed so far. Here goes...  The BenRiach 16 yr  43% ABV  I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.  Color: light amber  Nose: honey, butter, intense fresh pear  Taste: cinnamon, nutmeg, tart apple  Finish: oily, spicy burn right up the nose  Best Speyside I've had as of yet, though I must admit the only Spey I've had is Speyburn. Not much character to it though. A forgettable whiskey.  3/5 stars  Thanks for reading!       your kid is a dumbass   weird face weird feet   http://imgur.com/2A9ywcm   Welcome back! Another paycheck, another bottle. And to my fellow beginners, good luck!     The Macallan 10 yr Fine Oak  40% ABV  I take my scotch one ounce at an time, room temperature, with a dash of water.  Color: lite beer yellow  Nose: lemon oil, raisins, bread dough, faint fudge  Taste: its so very complex and pleasant I'm having a hard time separating the flavors... its like a heavenly flavor all its own...I'll try my best here...oak, toasted marshmallow, orange, cocoa, faint burnt butter, faint pineapple...holy shit did I drink three drams already?  Finish: a wonderful full-mouth burn that leaves behind a pleasant aftertaste of oak and hickory  OK folks, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is my favorite scotch since I started reviewing. I know a had a lot of love for my Glenfiddich 12, but this is just so much more awesome. Annnnd....I'm drunk.   4.5/5 stars   Thanks for reading! I'm gonna have another drink....       um no...I dwell on the fact that they exist in the first place and feel they deserve special treatment   If you personally base someone's intelligence on how they feel about fat people, I guess so.

But did he make the Kessel run in twelve parsecs?   you said you didn't like the taste of blood, either do I, but I like rare steaks   You obviously give a little bit of a shit if you're taking time to defend yourself   but you don't like steak   you don't like steak   I assure you there are bigger twits   it's not blood. Educate yourself   man up   yeah right   pussy   ignorance   then you don't like steak   it's not blood   because they are uncultured freaks   then you don't like steak   stick your dick in the steak because if you cook it well done you're fucking your meat   she's a dude lookin chick   that's not blood, that's protein juices.

I love love love Glenfiddich 12!    My thoughts exactly!   After much thought I have come to the conclusion that I'm not yet qualified enough to offer reviews out of score of 100.  I don't know what a 1/100 tastes like and I certainly have not found my perfect 100/100. I also aim to make my reviews accessible to those who might be in the same place in life as me, a scotch whiskey beginner. Henceforth, I am scrapping my ***/100 review style and replacing it with a **/5 star review style in half-star increments, much like Netflix does. Now...on to the review...   The Famous Grouse, a blended scotch whiskey.  I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.  Color: honey gold  Nose: underripe banana, apple cider, slightly yeasty  Taste: there's that tart cider again, toffee, espresso bean, dark chocolate, slightly woody, faint black pepper  Finish: Oily, coats your tongue with that black pepperiness, finishes in the back of your throat with a pleasant burn  A good blend for the price, 22 bucks in Michigan. I would buy this again to bring to a party or if I'm broke and craving a dram.  3/5 stars  Thanks for reading! See you next time!      it has Bluetooth... it's just called something different. It's called "WHT." Here is a screenshot of it being paired with my friend's Samsung S3. It also has an SD card slot so you can upgrade the storage yourself. Shut up and do some real research.  http://imgur.com/8Mdc2us       You can do all of that stuff by holding the power button and up on the volume button while powering up the phone. You can do your recovery blah blah blah and your root blah blah blah and install your own android OS from the SD card      it's an unlocked android 4.4 phone. How much support do you need?   it's better than a moto g   too bad I get skin allergies with silicone      Horrible Movie 2   he killed himself... end of story. She did not  hold a gun to his head   I received this phone in the mail two days ago. It's super powerful. The only downside is that it comes with just one screen protector so if you screw up putting it on (bubbles, dust)... but I discovered that the Samsung S4 screen protectors fit it perfectly.      Didja paint.... didja paint her boobies?   Is your sister hot?   Glenfiddich 12....yummy yummy   NRB or partial NRB   by not being a dumbass   Was she hot?    Who cares... Hank is the man!   It'll be JJ Abrams...guaranteed   it's mofuggin good!   Dunno...haven't done the 12! Skipped right over it, I did ;)   THE Glenlivet 15yr  Can't call myself a cheapskate this time, shelled out 60 bucks for this in Michigan, the priciest bottle I have purchased since starting this marvelous chapter of my life.  I take my scotch one ounce at a time, room temperature, with a dash of water.  Color: Jurassic Park-like amber  Nose: cinnamon, nougat, fresh flowers, buttermilk, custard, marshmallow, faint cedar pine  Taste: hickory smoke, dark chocolate, vanilla, browned butter, faint brandy-like notes  Finish: like the aftertaste of fine french vanilla coffee with a little pleasant burn that goes straight up my nostrils, and then its gone...the palate goes blank after a few seconds....just making me want more... and more... and more...  95/100... the most personality I've had in my mouth since my last girlfriend.  I'm getting more of this stuff.  Thanks for reading!      what kind of life support?    are they tats?   yeah that lollipop has the hiv now   there must be something in the water   Was she hot?      wrong   Average = fat   you must be fat   I'm sure his coronary arterial walls are "fluffy" as well.    Have you ever been to a code? Would you rather have a clusterfuck code with a kid resident doctor fumbling with a resus mask and some sweaty-armed tech thinking he's helping by putting all his weight on it by making what he thinks is a seal while a new nurse starts compressions on the belly button, or a team of two RTs rotating bag and compressions so you have time to draw up your meds and attach the shock pads?   your dog needs a diet, you monster   So you expected me to outline every detail of my job to you here? You lack a certain...something...oh yeah, common sense. Let me refer you to my pal [Egan]( https://evolve.elsevier.com/cs/product/9780323082037?role=student)   Hey! An RT doesn't just phase out of the wall when a code blue happens then after it's over phases back in. We have plenty of time to connect with our patients during treatment rounds, oxygen checks, vent rounds, and we especially get to connect with our cystic fibrosis and pneumonia patients that need postural drainage and percussion therapy.    wuh wuh what?       I'm super impressed by your ability to discern the level of compassion I have for my patients in a difficult and dynamic career through a few sentences posted anonymously on an open public forum.    Maybe I'm just a crusty old jaded RT, you know, the guy at the head of the bed keeping his cool during code blues ;)   As a healthcare worker myself (respiratory therapist) that has seen plenty of deaths young and old (my job sometimes is "pulling the plug" on a patient's ventilator) I feel this title should be rephrased to "young nurses after a patient suffers a miscarriage." An old nurse would clean up the blood, go smoke a cigarette, and then after getting the mom an order for ativan move on to his/her next patient.    You literally found a figurative representation of what Michigan looks like when drawn by a three-year-old   it's amazing what silicone and injections of various posions can do   apart?   gross   As a respiratory therapist this is something we all have to be cognizant of. If a patient is on greater than 60% oxygen for long periods of time the lungs can suffer from irreversible fibrotic changes.   Anyone here see Big Hero 6? The scene where Baymax has his healthcare chip removed and his eyes turn red..........fucking awesome.   She is looking old   A costume bachelor party?   ..............Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay   let's split the difference and call your answer $50. Thanks!    Relative to a $50,000 bottle of rare Dalmore or a $100 bottle of 18 year Glenmorangie? I'm trying to gather opinion to establish an objective dollar amount to base my subjective cheapskate reviews on. Please be helpful, not preachy, thanks!   	130
 Or a bad-eye deer.   Oxygen and magnesium together? OMg!   A skeleton walks into a bar and says, "I'll have a beer, and a mop."   Actually his favorite letter is P. Without it he's irate.   And the horse says, "My alcoholism is destroying my family."   Off to upvote the "dank memes" comment.   ... wut?   Well, it's true in the Antipodes.   "I'm doing OK for an old fat guy."  "Oh, you're not old!"   Knock knock.  Who's there?  Abraham Lincoln.  Abraham Lincoln who?  Don't you know me?  ------  Knock knock.  Who's there?  Thomas Jefferson.  Thomas Jefferson who?  Was Abe Lincoln just here?   There's always collecting state license plates. You probably won't see all 50 (plus DC) in one 16-hour trip, but it's fun anyhow. A friend and I once went on a long road trip and we saw 48 states' worth -- and the ones we didn't see were *not* Alaska and Hawaii, as you'd expect; one was Rhode Island, I can't remember the other (we were mostly on the West Coast).   I hadn't even noticed it was going on. No changes in my neighborhood, which is pretty safe to begin with.   At the gym, a young woman compliments me on keeping up with the college kids in an exercise class.  Me: Not bad for an old fat guy, huh?  Her: You're not old!   ... I've always just rested my fourth finger at the base of the thumb and it worked OK. I just tried it with the fourth and fifth fingers, and it changes the tone of the sound. TIL!   CC might have meant searching on text from signs. I do that sometimes when I don't have a clue otherwise. Once it got me way off because I searched for text on a billboard, which it turns out was advertising some resort town 1,200 miles away.   Too true. What's worse is when someone gets banned for abusing people and later some others start saying "It's boring here now, we should invite back the shit-flingers to make it more interesting."    Well, fuck a duck.   We're talking grad school after years of working, in both our cases. Also both single at the time.  My dad could help some if I asked, but so far I haven't had to.   I'm close to your age with a similarly intimidating amount of student debt (and I never even finished my doctorate). Other commenters' advice about income-based repayments and loan forgiveness is invaluable; be sure to follow up. I found that getting that process started helped the feeling of powerlessness ease off, and it's made a difference in how well I function.   It helps also to just know there are others in similar financial boats who are functioning OK. I was feeling real down on myself till I spoke with my mother, and she was in basically the same situation when she was my age and now she's retired and doing fine. Just hearing her story gave me a boost. It's a tough road we're on, but it's do-able.   I heard about a different case where a guy had some sort of compulsion about downloading images and burning them to CDs or something, usually he used some automated process on photo sites and never even looked at them. There was some CP among the pix and he got in serious trouble. Anyway, the guy in the OC seems to be targeting CP specifically, but in addition to that problem he probably has some compulsion issue as well.   A friend in high school got a pot pendant from his mother who said it was a "nice maple leaf."   This is the main factor. As it happens the textbook companies seem to be pricing more aggressively than they were when I was in school, too. But state cutbacks are the prime mover.   My dad would say "Hay is the first stage of horseshit."   Some will play just for fun, but most of them are hustling for dollars. I work near Union Square (where this photo was taken) and I like to go watch the chess players on my lunch break.   The way you can tell the regulars are hustling? They don't play each other.   Well, it was kind of late. Not a lot of people have seen it.   [3 to disintegrate it.](http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Zat%27nik%27tel)   Lobsters and crabs are bugs. That's why I don't eat them.   Why not both?   *reel life   A few years back a Starbucks opened up around the corner from where I worked, and every day someone had to go make a Starbucks run and come back with a load of their silly coffee drinks. I found this particularly annoying because the same storefront had had a locally-owned coffee shop with the same drinks only better, but they didn't have the cachet of the overdone chain. Starbucks and the property owner basically forced the local place to close.   Grizzly bears have claws and teeth and are considerably larger than gorillas. I suspect a gorilla who saw an angry Kodiak bear would NOPE out of there in a heartbeat. Gorillas and strong and smart but at a huge physical disadvantage.   I read recently that they would throw a bear and a lion together expecting a good fight, but the bear won every time. Lions are built more for speed than bears are, so their bone structure is lighter. The bear generally crushed the lion's skull first thing.   NO NEW WORDS! ONLY OLD WORDS!   But look what you did there: You said how black people should conduct themselves. We white people really need to NOT do that. I hear your desire for less conflict, but we need to work from our end of things, not other people's. What if you'd said, We don't need more Rush Limbaughs, we need more Abraham Lincolns. (Or whatever white figures you find illustrative.) See the difference? We have our own house to clean up.   I've changed my situation recently and haven't been having those dreams as much. I think I was feeling somewhat out of place in my previous situation, and the dreams may have reflected that sense of displacement.   Pineapple + hot peppers is a way underrated combination.   Came here to say this. Sprinkle on some basil while you're at it.   Hey OP, this comment is exactly what you shouldn't do: Tell black people and allies to stop talking about race. This is how white supremacy stays supreme.   I have a lot of dreams where I'm in what I call the dreamscape, which is similar to the real world but with a few geographical differences, just enough to make it seem weird. It's as if you visited my city once a few years ago, then described it to someone who'd never been there, and the dreams take place in the city as you describe it. Nothing weird happens, just normal things in a strange place.   After college I played some contract bridge, the card game. At tournaments there's no money at stake but you get to play against some of the top players. I've played against a few of the big names, with a notable lack of success.   In high school I liked to play chess, and one day a grandmaster came through town to play a couple of exhibitions. I was one of 10 people he played "blindfolded" -- we each sat at a chess board and he sat where he couldn't see the boards, and an intermediary went around to each board in turn and called out the move we'd made, he called out his reply, and so on.   In this sort of event the master is bound to have a lapse in concentration at some point and make a big blunder that loses a game. By a stroke of luck it happened against me, and I was the only one of the 10 to win. I wasn't a very good player, just got lucky. Some of the other players were the best in the city, and he mowed them down without breaking a sweat.    Sex in which I'm a participant.   Saw a picture of the all-state high school girls' basketball team and thought, "Damn that coach is hot."   I recall someone pointing out that the main character isn't even a patriot -- he turns down appeals to his sense of loyalty and country and only joins the fighting to get revenge. Not a principled bone in his body.   Nah, I memorized this years ago; don't remember where I first heard it. This is the first time I've gotten to actually use it anywhere (hence its presence in the "useless" thread).   A mosquito was heard to complain  That a chemical poisoned her brain.  The cause of her sorrow  Was paradichloro-  Diphenyltrichloroethane.   Minuscule.   *spooling   Someone down the street from me a few years ago just put up a string of lights spelling out "Bah Humbug." Best display in town.   Brevity: Wit's soul.   Surely even a second-rate hit man gets more than $500 a pop. Cheap-ass button.   She has a master's degree, but I don't know about her job these days; she was working in a bar when she hit the big time.   My boss at work never deletes or archives email and never even marks them read if the subject indicates she doesn't have to read it. Her unread count is in the mid-five figures. (We do a LOT of emailing at work.)   "Charles Manson just got married. Why are you still single?"   Once I went to a seminar over Halloween weekend in a city I'd never been to before, and someone invited me to meet them at a party later. I went over there fashionably late, and my inviter hadn't gotten there yet, so I got to introduce myself to a houseful of strangers. They were all real chill, so it was not nearly as scary as it could have been.  	55
 The decellularization process, when done correctly/adequately, should eliminate virtually all DNA and immune antigens from the tissue. This means that there shouldn't be an immune response and no anti-rejection/immunosuppresive drugs are needed like a normal transplant.   Organs decellularized from pigs have been used in humans without the need for immunosupressants so that shouldn't be an issue with this technique if it gets that far.      Taking L-citrulline (6g per day) can improve intense (but not moderate) exercise performance.    It likely does this by improving oxygen delivery to muscle (so the muscle has more oxygen available to it) and promoting muscle to use more aerobic metabolism. More research is needed to know exactly how citrulline improves exercise performance.   This study was done on normal people (20yr old, recreationally active men with no "disease") and they did find an effect.  By oxygen uptake kinetics they referring more to uptake of oxygen by muscle and not blood oxygenation as you're referring to. Oxygen uptake can be increased by improving oxygen availability to muscle (e.g. improved blood flow to muscle) and shifting from anaerobic to oxidative metabolism and/or increasing  the rate of oxidative metabolism. In short, citrulline seems to be capable of doing both hence the improved oxygen uptake and exercise performance but more research is needed to figure out the mechanisms and relative contribution of each process.   A brief breakdown for you:    1. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a kinase that is activated in response to energy stress (specifically the increase in AMP:ATP ratio).   2. Leptin is an adipocyte secreted hormone that can regulate metabolism. satiety and can increase AMPK activity.     3. Leptin dysregulation has been found in Alzheimer's, in particular the leptin receptor - so even though leptin levels are normal the signaling cascade doesn't occur (well it probably does but at significantly lower levels).  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23895348  4. In this study leptin decreased amyloid (I guess should be good for alzheimer's) and inhibiting AMPK reduced this decrease in amyloid.    5. Leptin also improved performance in a maze and AMPK inhibition again abrogated it.    As Alzheimers patients cells seemingly do not respond to leptin it likely won't help in Alzheimers (unless you increase the leptin receptor with a drug or via gene editing etc.).     Yep what you're doing seems fine so keep it up!  Personally, I need at least 2 days rest a week or I get injured (my family seem to have bad tendons and slow regeneration/recovery - not saying that you will!). I'd recommend having one rest day a week just to make sure you don't overdo it.   The effect of more vigorous exercise on life expectancy is hotly debated and still being figured out. Several studies have shown that those who do a lot of endurance (20miles/wk) **appear** to lose the benefits of exercise on prolonged exercise - it doesn't shorten life expectancy but doesn't increase it. This is one of those studies and is free access and easy to read.    http://indorgs.virginia.edu/MuscleClub/OKeefe_JH_article1%2B2.pdf    Some of the studies are limited as the runners aren't split into groups with confounding variables (e.g. family history of CVD, other illnesses etc.). When accounting for those variables one study found the same effect, very intense exercise prevented increases in life expectancy.   http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1855458    The studies don't mean that you shouldn't exercise at high intensity and if you enjoy what you do then keep doing it. It might be that quality of life is higher but life expectancy isn't increased for people who chronically train at high intensity. More studies are needed to be done to understand if there is a true relationship between very intense exercise and life expectancy.    Definitely, I didn't mean don't do strength training just that from a mortality point increased cardiovascular fitness seems to have a bigger effect. CV and strength training have overlapping and distinct benefits. From a quality of life point of view, increased strength and resistance programs in elderly patients improve quality of life and help maintain independence.   For the study I was involved in it was 12 - all the patients were diabetic, all were over 50 and the majority not exercised for a long amount of time. There are obviously concerns with those patients so the lower end of moderate activity was targeted. A previous small trial at the institute had found that for those patients longer adherence to the exercise program was achieved at that scale compared to higher RPEs.  I should have put the range which is 12-14 for moderate exercise so thanks for the input!  	9
 Hey deadlymajesty this is really useful stuff.  I've stickied this post.    Thanks for compiling it and posting it here.  I'll throw you a mod invite.

Requesting users to post contact information  is not allowed.  Valve the company has a public contact address.  Use it.  Don't use this sub as your personal army     Does the bbc even own it?  Wouldn't Channel 5 or Dave be more likely to bring it back.   Look at what happened in the case of red dwarf etc.   Announcement http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/366635196/1432825486  Latest trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpzZH7Lcpvw   "Developer nDreams told Eurogamer it intends for The Assembly to come out at the same time as each of the three major virtual reality headset."  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-04-the-assembly-aims-for-all-the-virtual-reality-headsets         ok no worries. I don't like it because it doesn't fit reddit rules of personal information and encourages people to investigate someone who might not want attention or a discussion about them about them.  e.g. There are plenty of people who are pissed off with the battlebots live experience so far.   https://www.reddit.com/rules/  I left it for a week but it was slowly bothering me for the moderation standard it would set.   So it stays removed.   If people with battlebots associations want to start discussions about their experiences under their real name that would be cool.  Similar to /r/IAMA with vertification.  Maybe better to do it on /r/IAMA and link to it from here    Removed.  Feel like personal information from a throwaway account. I have no idea who he is and don't think he is a public figure.     When a post is downvoted to 13% it is usually  either the result of vote brigades or profile stalkers.  This is because default setting hide posts when they reach -4.  So you are right it isn't normal reddit but it isn't /u/bbrex either.     I don't really care about drama in the world of VR nor what other subreddits are doing to maintain post quality.   What I do care about is people invading posts on this subreddit to downvote them in an inorganic way.      All your recent and long comments in /r/oculus  have been removed.  Hence they are stuck on 1 vote and no replies.  Log out and have a look at  the threads.  Seems like you are wasting your time there.  I can only suggest you talk to their mods ,  Sorry your attempt to move the discussion here proved unpopular. But thats reddit.               Thanks for adding that.  A lot of people here just have a casual interest in virtual reality.  So I hope you don't mind if I keep challenging you .   Nice to hear some positive feedback after the recent gloom.   BTW, you should visit /r/shadowban    I'm not sure how well fast moving combat works on those free live streams.  I don't find them ideal for sports.  Hopefully there will be some high quality pre-recorded streams.        Thanks for the info.  Feel free to start discussions about robogames in /r/battlebots.  This sub is about competitive robotics in general and not limited to the Battlebots brand.    If you have a professional connection to robogames, maybe declare it with a user flair selectable from the sidebar.     Not enough  substance here to warrant a submission.  Hence you are downvoted.  No one knows who these names are or what they did.   There are unofficial websites streaming abc live internationally accessible.    http://www.time4tv.com/2013/08/abc.php  http://www.stream2watch.com/live-tv/us/abc-live-stream  (best with ad block)    We can only hope that they will learn from their mistakes and the feedback.  It isn't much effort to be considerate to an audience and keep them on your side.      Can you edit in some better context about who these people are, what it is all about and how it relates to virtual reality in a way that the average person would care.    This comes across as a personal rant which is hard to understand.  So I am not sure it belongs here.  Sometimes it is better to post facts in the OP and save your opinions and personal experience for the comments.  This post is attracting some reports and some aggressive but empty attacks in the comments that I've seen fit to remove for not meeting the "be nice" guideline.

I think if titles and comments are clearly marked, there is no problem having them.   Thats us fixed.  Unfortunately, your account has been shadowbanned by admin.     Visit /r/ShadowBan for some info on what to do   Hey  James.    Thanks for the invite.  Sorry I missed your reply.  Must have been under a deluge from one of my technology posts.  It would be cool to have a /r/robotwars community there and it would really work if they revive robotwars.     If you got the original hypnodisc then you deserve to keep the throne on that sub!  Half the reason, I wanted in on that sub was to update the side bar with some other subs and x-post there.   So will gladly accept the invite.   The new shows has new rules about active weapons so it could be a variety of stuff.   Any industrial bot like snoo could be cool.  Saws, claws, spikes and even flames are cool.         Hi.  /r/battlebots is a community for fans of Battlebots, robot combat and the wider world of the world of competitive robotics.  There is a new tv series starting soon and so I am expecting the subscribers in the sub to grow substantially and fast.  This could be a fun snoo to create.  Any input appreciated.                        http://www.oxfam.org.uk/get-involved/how-your-company-can-partner-with-us/emergency-banners               I'm trying to figure out why do x86 emulation rather than just making an x86 chip.  Does x86 emulation avoid licencing fees? Or is is the chip designed for more specialist applications rather than the mass market? If so, why bother with x86 at all?   If I had to guess, it's because this chip's primary purpose isn't running x86 code; it's running Elbrus code! But it's handy to have x86 compatibility, for legacy software and other stuff that hasn't yet been ported.  I think an x86/x86-64 license would be required from Intel/AMD, even if it's only an abstraction layer and not a hardware implementation.   With this latest news Rightscorp must certainly be on its last legs. The  shareholders' confidence was already in the toilet and this certainly  won't help any. This case should prove to them, once and for all, that Rightscorp is run by greedy morons and bottomfeeders who don't comprehend the first thing about the legal system.  The entire basis of Rightcorp's business model is leveraged upon ignorance and can only succeed where those they are pursuing are ignorant. This particular action of Rightscorp against CBeyond proves it quite handily. Ignorance is, especially in the information age, only temporary and, therefore, the stragegic basis upon which any alleged early "successes" Rightscorp ever had are now quickly evaporating. If I were a Rightscorp shareholder I'd cut my losses now while my shares still had at least a little bit of value left.  A subpoena has no force of law unless it's signed by the judge. The signature of the court clerk only evidences that it's been filed with the court, nothing more.  I'd like to say "Kudos to Christopher Bunce" but all he was doing was what every other ISP's legal counsel should be doing -- telling the copyright trolls to get a valid court order to produce client records. But to get that the trolls must first file a lawsuit for copyright infringement and, then, under that lawsuit, pursue client records under Discovery.  Tragically, there are still a few ignoramuses in charge of ISPs that don't understand the basics of due process of law, so instead of telling copyright trolls to go pound sand (or better yet, just ignore their color of law "subpoenas") they sometimes ignorantly hand over customer records at the drop of a hat. Such ISPs could easily learn a few things from this case... if they wanted to.   Nearly any program can be justified 'in the name of security', but how much privacy and how many freedoms are you willing to trade 'in the name of security'. This single decision will not end the debate, so expect to deal with it as the digital age matures and becomes more deeply integrated into every facet of our lives. Think well now what decision you make lest you come to regret it later.   Good news for battlebots          Mods, please sticky this, seems helpful?   Hey qwertythe300th, I've added you as a mod so that you can sticky and unsticky your post as you see fit and maybe help keep this place going smoothly in other ways.  Hope you can accept.  Thanks for keeping us up to date and thanks for using spoiler tags         They neglect to mention GCHQ having its own military satellite system called Skynet - more a name coincidence.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28satellite%29         ok.  thanks for contributing    Pinging /u/twister662  - Please see this thread.     As a quick fix, I've commented out your changes to the css just to revert us back to something that works for everyone.  I really liked how it was before and I could see what you were trying to do here with the dark background.  Unfortunately, the current state  meant a broken experience for many users.  Not sure if you realised this.     You can still make of the css whatever you want as you got some great ideas.  I only patched it because it was unreadable for many.     Thanks for the feedback.  You can remove the custom styles using this link http://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots+nocss  I agree it is hard to read at the moment.  I am not a fan of white on black styles for reading .   Maybe it is my old eyes.  However, I can see what it is trying to be and it has the potential to look good.  It did use to look really good a few weeks a go and it was from the same mod.  This restyle just needs some tweaks.   I don't want to step on the work of other mods too much as it was only changed yesterday and so might be a work in progress.  So suffer for a day and if it nothing changes I'll revert or fix it.    EDIT: Ok I'll fix some of it as we got black text on a black background in the body text of self posts!  So it is broken/   EDIT2:  I think it looked good and worked  if you had RES installed and have it on night mode.  Otherwise it was broken and sometimes unreadable.     ----------    The way I see it, they are giving away access to their limited internet because that is of benefit to their advertising business.  It will lead to monoplies and undesirable stuff if left unchecked in the long term.  However, in the short term it is a finacially viable way of giving internet access to the poor.  They would not fund internet.org if there wasn't some stong benefit for them.   But who is going to pay for that ?      Same could be said for Americans.     Thanks. It is a great help                                          This is the time to stop mega corporations from deciding the fate of the country. The time to rise against monopolization, against the internet sales tax, against the destruction of net neutrality. This is the person you want, people.

However, your link appears broken.  Plus it was already caught in the spam filter and so never made an appearance.   Feel free to repost with a direct link..              I don't think people want it to be different.  It just took a break because it stopped being so fresh.  New younger audience should enjoy it.   I hear it will be more reality tv focused .  So maybe influenced by shows like x-factor .     American version.   More like the later series of robotwars when it was more pure battles   Hope fans and those interested can join us on /r/battlebots .                                           Do you prefer your American TV persona or your british one ?   Do you get a choice of how the editors portray you and do you mind?   What do you think about the American system of tipping the service staff ?        Just like that film "Edge of tommorow"            You're understating it   If they merge, they should be investigated under the RICO act, as both have horrible Customer service   together IMO it makes a criminal enterprise.  However, all Comcast will do is just keep killing people until RICO goes away.              Net neutrality fundamentalism isn't always a good thing straight away.  I feel that they could return to the question of net neutrality 10 years down the line when they have infrastructure and everyone online            I wonder what extra info a HMD can provide about the users?  Trivial stuff like how tall someone it.  And maybe  some sophisticated stuff about posture.  All this can feed machine learning and recognition algorithms.                        I just foresee the conspiracy theories trying to paint the reason for leaving .

 http://imgur.com/MxtFdy8  GO BERNIE   Well, folks, I'm proposing today. Gonna make sure I hit my lifts hard, get a great pump, and go into it with as much confidence as possible. Though I don't think I've ever been more nervous in my life.  EDIT: SHE SAID YES      [~~All of Reddit~~ This thread right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jn8K8EA7-Q)  Edit: Wow okay guys, I get it, you don't give two fucks. Thanks for coming to the thread about Ellen Pao stepping down to let everyone know just how apathetic you are.    I think it's more the fact that he has an off-season reality show instead of focusing his time on training and becoming a better player. There's nothing wrong with going to a club, but it's a massive distraction from his job playing football when he has a camera crew following him around that he's trying to impress. I promise you Chip would not have let that fly if he were still in Philly.    I'm [outside](http://imgur.com/zxiZOh3) the statehouse right now and there have to be at least a couple thousand people here around the roped off area. I've never been more proud to be a South Carolinian.    And once you nail down the 40-hour work week, then you raise the minimum wage so people can afford to live with a 40-hour week. Which will doubly ensure a shorter work week because overtime on a higher minimum wage would be very expensive for companies.  	7
 Sorry you had to go through that OP! I'm glad he got what he deserved though. Am I the only one that had "Bartender" start playing in their head when they read the first few lines of the last paragraph? Just seemed fitting somehow   definitely try to keep a low profile. Changing clothes and hair color are a great decision, but also keep in mind this guy seems to be very tech savvy. If he can hack into security cameras, he can also probably get ahold of traffic and street cams. I wouldn't travel to any large towns if you don't have to, and don't use any cell phones because they can be traced by any call over 20 seconds. Some can even be tracked with the phone turned off. It sounds like you dear need to go way way way off the grid. Don't trust anyone you meet in person, because anyone could be his eyes and ears in spots where he can't physically see you. Stay safe OP!  	2
    It's broken.. for sure it's broken.   Nashville local here. I was working security at a local concert venue and she showed up to see the guy performing. As I walked by her one time I overheard her saying that she had been selling out venues since she was 14 or 15.      You know, the first thing I thought when I saw this picture was, "this has to be in Tennessee." It was confirmed when I saw your user name.    This happened to me earlier today actually. My brain went into overdrive and I wasn't able to answer either question I was asked for several seconds.    Oh yea! Went to the store and fought some people for bread and got the last jug of milk. Don't know what I can make with the two but I'm ready.    Jonesborough, TN!     	9
 its easier for apple because they control every aspect of the hardware on which Safari runs.  Its probably hard to do this on firefox or chrome since it runs on a variety of hardware; but yeah there could be optimizations done to make it better :)     by black do you mean graphic glitches?   i'd suggest you to update your graphic card(s) drivers and check it out if its occurring.    Also you could do a refresh(you'll lose add-ons) if problems seem to take place within safe-mode as well.     * 3. there mostly a nomodeset option listed in the boot parameters for that specific boot entry. (Be warned of trying to remove it - You can edit it in grub menu by pressing 'e; make it permanent by editing /etc/grub2.cfg)   i have a dell too. And yes Lenovo is the best! :D    Thing is you need to have both cards to be enabled to use bumblebee. Your manufacturer has allowed a bios option to use specifically one; which is good in a way since you can choose what your want, but you'll have to reboot and set it again if you want to use the other.    What bumblebee does is, it auto-manages both the cards on the fly; most of the time intel will be active(as it does all normal stuff fine, and is light on battery) while the Nvidia card is used for heavy graphics apps(Heavy on battery and heating).    You can specifically have bumblebee run on the heavy Nvidia card by using the optirun command for an app (eg. optirun firefox).   Also having primus installed gives a slight improved performance over the default optirun.      I feel its a win-win situation and the user is well in control. :)       wait i guess :|   https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3d5aun/so_i_was_hanging_onto_firefox_for_one_reason_and/ct1xs3f   JUST DO IT! Anything is Possible!    Google one of the main donors for Mozilla.  They rely on yahoo now.   Thank you so much! This works! :D :D :D   also do you have any other driver installed from anyother source for your nvidia?   yes it will work! :)    First have a clean install done.   Next follow the instruction on that page; by installing all the dependencies etc. and the proceed to install bumblebee, bbswitch, bumblebee-nvidia (driver).   After that reboot the system, login and wait for sometime; it'll compile and load in the background(you can notice this when your fan starts to slow down and system begins to cool).   If things are working great and you use heavy graphic intensive apps install primus which is listed on the same page    I can root for bumblebee. I've used it for a long time and its working great a long long time! :)    I can help you out if you need.      Is it a dual gpu system, Optimus technology, nvidia+Intel?  If that's the case you'll need bumblebee.    Follow this guide for bumblebee, use the proprietary driver for better performance.   https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bumblebee    If it's a normal nvidia card, a package from rpm fusion will certainly do the job.      Yes you can. Mint might include in its default repository.   I'm not sure where you can download it but perhaps Google will help you out.    It works great for me on Fedora. Also you might need to create a tiny file to enable sub-pixel rendering(patent blocks to ship by default)    Edit - i tried a bit of looking around. could find any right links(some key words like libfreetype). Maybe it has a different package name for ubuntu based distros. Perhaps you'll have to stick with infinality(which is really good and more customizable).    I'm not sure but I heard they are packaging a new version for w10, why don't you try that out?     Similar usage, Firefox works great!    Freetype-freeworld is also a saviour    Try using Uninstaller from Adobe site and then try installing flash again.    Try safe mode?     Yesterday you said tomorrow :(   Second this. As the world goes more and more towards portability a good browser with the minimum effect on battery will be the clear victor.    yeah i'm looking for a vid in which the initial sparks/discharge starts between clouds(hopefully a close up video).   i've searched youtube and pics but never got the results :(   They did a kickstarter, animation support will come in soon    check in safe mode?   they pay adobe for that     since you mentioned codec check - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1160424     Have a look into this:   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings    If that does not fix it try a new profile(back up data):   https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles     If you're still having problems uninstall and reinstall Firefox by getting a file from the official site.     webM is still under-development. So you wil run into issues.   if it affects youtube playback you can have it disabled.   webM is still under-development. So you wil run into issues.

Lot of graphic cards act in weird ways.     haha xD i understand what you mean ; but as they are concerned about national "security" its better to develop stuff in house   Keeping every aspect of pro-privacy aside.    Total Stupidity; to buy or even think of buying "hacking software" from an overseas firm that deals with several other govt.(s) behind your backs.   This is buying yourself into stuxnet. An easy deal.   You get bugged and you get looted as well    If you're so interested make your own.     this sounds good, an option in preference will do fine.   i love the 2 separate bars; helps me focus on different stuff; also acts like a temporary notepad.   its beta :)   try the m version m.reddit.com   can't thank you enough for bumblebee!   Its God-sent stuff! :D    shadows, weight(gravity) and lights   yeah the discharge between two clouds, the actual source   Ah the problem is with adwaita.   Zukitwo does if fine.      Oh okay, I mistook the feature I guess. My bad.    valid point!   Preference-Privacy-Related searches from the default search engine   happy to help :)   happy Youtubing!   it actually should boot normally. This is very strange.    Since you got a screen then i don't understand why you should'nt get a screen now.    Worst part is you're not getting ther terminal too :(     No text too?     Can ya add nomodeset option to the boot parameter?   You can add it at the bootloader by adding parameter before the OS is loaded. i guess by pressing 'e'.    on this line ' GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset" '   i think you need to have windows media player installed to have codecs on your system    Choose a version appropriate for your OS:   http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/download-windows-media-player    I hope this helps   on the login screen can you see the small gear icon? choose gnome classic and try to log in   thats strange;    Are you of the EU region?    alright goto about:config and set these to true:    media.mediasource.enabled   media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4   media.mediasource.mp4.enabled   media.format-reader.mp4   media.fragmented-mp4.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed    Set this to false:   media.mediasource.webm.enabled    Note - incase there are some entries here not present in the about:config, skip em.    OS please?   can you stay online for some time? can proceed faster that way     alright, so you get no visual after logging in.    Try Ctrl+Alt+F3 (or F4/F5/F6)   and login  Also: try move your move and see when you get a blank screen when you switch if you dont get a text console     are you able to stay in the desktop? Meaning you get the GUI and stay logged in?     Try a restart    boot into the OS now without the live USB Stick.   Are you able to get a desktop?   Can you log-in to the user account you created during install?    Are you connected to the internet?   If you can get the terminal or ctrl alt f2 gets you a terminal type in "lspci |grep -i VGA" and put the output here.     startpage then :)   correction you will need bumblebee later on.   Thats the only way your card will work.  F-up by nvidia and lack of progress on the open-source end as well.   So bumblebee is the way to go; no worries shall help set it up! :)   /u/Baliverbes has remoded the kernel arguments and blacklisted stuff   It might be a issue to get any display     alright!    Mount is like unlocking a gate to enter it, umount is the opposite.    Once you get the desktop back, time to rock and roll   ah not the right way.     Use the live USB and i think you can format via the installer there.    There should be an option hidden during the partition selection thing.   If there's nothing there then in the desktop version of Live USB(not installer) use the disk utility to format.   You might have to umount the harddisk for it to happen.     alright, since i think we are diving head-first into re-installation.     Suggest you to format the disk first to erase everything(Back up using live boot USB if you have anything important on the HD)     Then let the auto partitioner take care of the job to split up the disk or you can do that your-self if you have the experience.     Wait until system installs and buzz back here.   Are you still using a usb stick to boot? If so stop that and boot via the bootloader menu.   And continue to undo any changes you've made     Uninstall command:   sudo dnf autoremove Packagename   The easier way is to definitely reinstall, but you'll have to reinstall all your apps again.   If you have a speedy connection then that's good   REINSTALL:   You should get everything back after a clean format and reinstall.   Remember to make sure of the partition things in windows if this is a dual boot, since there is a strong chance of losing the bootloader.      Once you completely reinstalled then buzz back here.   I'lll guide you through installing the driver.   Same optimus stuff on my laptop.   Preference-Privacy-Related searches from the default search engine   Amon Goeth from Schindlers List   alright the problem should be that the drivers you installed are already there on the system.    Do you remember the way you installed them?   If you do; undo all the things you have done so far.   For starters uninstall the nvidia driver you already installed.     If you did via the terminal, then hitting the "up arrow" will show you your previous commands for that particular user account.     i tried with a theme called Zukitwo and those lines dont appear after scrolling.    These Dotted lines don't disappear after the scrolling is completed. They remain there.   Its particularly annoying on the transmission where you get a rectangle on the top and bottom of the scroll list.     faora from Man of steel.   She was brutal    Hope to help you out:   Are you able to access the desktop now? or are you stuck with a black and white screen with a bunch of text ?   enter this in the terminal "lspci |grep -i VGA" and paste the output here    i upgraded from F21 - F22   Thought it might be fixed in the next few updates. Nothing has happened so far.   Gnome version is 3.16.2; adwaita-gtk2-theme-3.16.2-1.fc22.x86_64    It also happens in the light version of the theme (Non-Dark)   the dark version of the default theme Adwaita   http://www.sitepoint.com/5-reasons-to-reject-webkit-monoculture/    Some things are not a specific standard and supporting things like that will do more harm than good later on.   Firefox is steadily improving on the html5 adoption as well.       Im having a bunch of these "-------------" dotted lines at the top and bottom of any gtk3 app.   They appear after scrolling up and down.    Nautilus, Transmission, Evince everything is affected    https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3cbelv/eli5_can_anyone_explain_googles_deep_dream/   Great! :)     Bottom right red is okay, webM needs development.   The other parameters it's okay if you don't have em, I was reporting from a nightly version so it might not have landed.    Check for codecs is a nice idea, maybe the team should be notified about it, but I'm not sure how it is going to be.     Anyway happy YouTubeing!    alright i hope you are on the latest version of firefox.    And if you are of the EU region then probably you are missing codecs on the system then you'll need to install windows media player.  EDIT - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16546    have a look at this i think its the right one  EDIT2- description - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/968211     please try to do that.

Could you check in safe mode and see if this happens   hey!  Try avoiding the the dark themes for now.   Fedora 22 ships with gtk3 build as default and it isnt complete as yet.    There was a post on /r/fedora to fix certain annoyances.   If you have the time look it up.   I shall try to link it here if i find them!   Off-Topic:   Hey! could you check about this comment issue? https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3c9zds/whats_new_with_firefox_390/csufsgp   ah thanks for this info, i see your point clearly!   I guess its being actively worked on.   have your reported this on bugzilla?   The nibs wear away fast; so its better to place a sheet of paper on top of the tablet or even a thing plastic sheet. Be gentle :)   I like a lot of whats posted here! :D   Hope it makes it to release on desktop and android! :D   ah maybe its an asia thing :/   Intuos is great! if you can manage the price then i guess it'll be perfect.   Im using Fedora 22 so it ships with the near latest kernel :)     only webM has problems(Still in development), mp4 works great actually on YouTube    oh repo updates, some can take a looooong while.      this = http://www.wacom.asia/onebywacom/   i have a wacom one, the smaller sized version :)   have a look at the comment below   Disable "media.mediasource.webm.enabled" in about:config have these set to 'true':   media.mediasource.enabled   media.mediasource.mp4.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed   media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled    Verify at www.youtube.com/html5    http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/   https://wiki.mozilla.org/Shumway    Maybe the potential is limited in the beginning, but they can always work on that     Maybe, but not by default.

 I understand the appeal of siq faydez but they are not for me. Very slight wallet, whiskers, and honeycombs are fine but when the thighs and knees start going I don't like it anymore.    Online stock is actually reflects all stock including items at retail locations now. However, people are always returning stuff (I actually have one of these in a small that I need to return, so look out for that!).    Yeah, the 770 is their tapered cut, in between the 1040 slim straight and the 484. It is my absolute favorite cut for pants.    I believe it is a J. Crew Baird McNutt Irish linen shirt.   But everyone else is on par. Most brands will be short enough, or you can get them hemmed by a tailor.    Square looks much better but it might not be the shape. All the ones from your home try-on are too narrow for your face. Your rectangle ones right now are the right width. Try more pairs that are wider (Warby's website has a filter).    You're gonna be waiting a while for the Oneplus Two. Oneplus CEO says he will release it in either quarter two or quarter three of 2015.    Everyone else's advise is solid. You really need to find a scent that *you* like, and works well with your natural scent. That means going to a store and trying a few. There are multitudes of guides on reddit (one in our very own sidebar!) to get you started on some popular, quality colognes.   Just a note: you will be damn hard pressed to find a fragrance that lasts 10-12 hours. A good longevity for a summer fragrance is about 4-5 hours, winter fragrance around 7-8. 10-12 is basically unheard of.   Another note: don't skimp on fragrance. Cheap fragrances will smell cheap and you'd honestly be better off not wear anything. A bottle lasts a long time (more than a year) so spend a little more on a good one.    It definitely doesn't need to be all that close. The usual recommendation is the same shade or a few darker. The goal is to have it look like a shadow. It is normally ill-advised to match the socks to the shoe, especially black-black, since it makes your shoe look like a boot. With a suit, however, I think it's fine. A few shades down from charcoal is black, after all.   Personally I like to have my socks have a little flair to them, so they are interesting. I have stripes, dots, fair isle, and speckled socks that complement the rest of what I'm wearing. This is only for casual outfits though, definitely would not do this with a suit.   You should only wear white socks while working out.    The measurement listed is the relaxed or unstretched measurement. I got my usual size and it was fine.    You can get them for around $20-30 regularly on sale.

Unbutton the bottom button of your blazer, either unbutton the top button on the shirt or button it all the way up (your second button is undone, I don't know if this was a mistake or intentional). The sleeves are also about an inch too long.    Those aren't suit pants, so I wouldn't try to exactly match a jacket to them. A charcoal blazer might work, but know that it will never be on par with a suit.  *Edit: on second thought, they might actually be suit pants. Still, I would not try to match a suit jacket with it, since that always doesn't work. Try to find a complimenting blazer.   Generally too many patterns is not pleasing to the eye. To be completely conservative I'd say only one should have a pattern, though that is flexible if you know what you are doing.   No, the two pieces do not need to have a bit of the same color in each. I'd even go so far to say that you run the risk of looking matchy-matchy if you do that. At the very least they need to be complementary colors.   Side note: argyle pattern is seen as very unfashionable and has been for quite some time.   I'd just go into a local Nike or Nike outlet store and have a look at the clearance racks. They usually have some pretty fly shoes there for relatively cheap.   You could try a hot wash and dry but in all honesty it probably won't shrink much if at all, and you run the risk of messing up the construction of the jacket (zippers get all wrinkly, padding gets loose and bunches up) and the material might not feel the best afterwards. I would just wear it as is.   You're probably gonna want something that's more natural looking, such as rope or leather. Maybe some wooden beads or something like that?   Metal might work as long as it's not super shiny. Raw cuts or slightly tarnished metals might look cool. Larger rather than smaller links.   Sorry I don't have any examples. I'm not a huge fan of necklaces myself.    Nothing wrong with that. What would be the alternative? Buying a piece, wearing it once, and then selling it or throwing it away? That's just not practical or smart.  I think your clothing is an extension of your own personality, and your personality doesn't tend to change too much. People will see your clothes and think it's "you," not think you're wearing a uniform that someone else picked out for you.     Remember that the only person you're trying to dress better than is your old self - not everyone around you.  Damn son, that is so wise. This would be inside an MFA fortune cookie.   The Uniqlo ones are even shorter.    Yes, they taper much harder, with a much smaller leg opening. The thighs are a little looser though. I had to size down one for my 508s (though with Levi's inconsistent sizing that probably doesn't mean anything).   Try 508s (I think thnk they just recently got renamed to 522s?). Just by looking at your pictures, I think the 510s will be too tight in the thighs. The 508s/522s will preserves your thigh space while giving you the taper you desire.

Good luck!   There are different "formality levels" to shirt, which depend on the construction of the shirt, the fabric, and the pattern.   The construction of the shirt is arguably the most important.

It's called a button-down because the collar buttons down onto the shirt. All shirts that have buttons on the front are called button-ups. A button-down shirt is also a button up, but a button up shirt is not necessarily a button-down!    Fabric is the next important. There are many different types of fabrics for a shirt; [here's](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-shirt-fabrics/) a really in-depth overview on the most common ones. Generally, thinner, finer, "shinier" fabrics are more formal (broadcloth), and thicker, rough-textured fabrics (oxford cloth, twill, flannel) are more casual.    You say you want a solid shirt, so I'm going to leave patterns out. Generally, though, solid colors and more formal and any sort of pattern is more casual.   The most common casual collared shirt recommended here is the oxford-cloth button down, or OCBD.   Remember, dressing well does not mean dressing up. It means maximizing your outfit in your current situation (wearing well fitting t-shirts and sweaters, not swapping them for dress shirts and suits).    The Durands and Prestons look the best. The reason why is because the other ones are not wide enough for your face. Try out wider glasses; Warby Parker has a filter on the website from them.    You are legally within your right to refuse a return for any reason. Whether you want to risk potentially pissing off a customer and getting a bad rep is up to you.   [Here's](http://www.retailers.com/FAQRetrieve.aspx?ID=51537) an article I found with a quick search. I have no idea if it is reputable or not.    Put a little water into the rice before you microwave it (maybe two tablespoons per cup), microwave it for longer than you think, then fluff and let stand for a minute. It will be as good as new!   *Note: only works on reasonably recently cooked rice. Not five day old crap.    It's also occasionally called Donegal. [Here's](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/WallaceBarnes/PRD~30690/30690.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=donegal isSaleItem=false color_name=CHALKBOARD%20DONEGAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) one from J. Crew, though it has shoulder patches.   *Edit: They also sell [normal](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/sweaters/LAMBSWOOL/PRDOVR~B2153/B2153.jsp), non-collab ones earlier in the season for cheaper, but they are all sold out now.    That is the most perfect explanation for why fake glasses are douchey. I've always been put off by them but wasn't quite sure why, and now I know. I will be using this from now on. Thank you!   The term you're looking for is "dress shirt." A dark dress shirt is even less versatile than a dark OCBD. That dress shirt has been $12.90 at Uniqlo for the past few months and there's a good reason why they aren't selling. Don't buy it.    He means a dress shirt.    Another suit that is often recommended at that price point is the [J. Crew Factory Thompson Suit](https://factory.jcrew.com/mens-clothing/suiting/PRDOVR~47226/47226.jsp?color_name=charcoal).   Look into blocking. You can form your sweater to fit how you like.    Steve Maddens are generally looked down upon as having poor construction. Check out this [boot buying guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/2r0fld/a_beginners_boot_buying_guide/) to get on the right track.    Yes, the one that is fuzzy is Heather Gray. The other two that are not fuzzy are a sort of pale red and purple (I think Old Red and Pale Violet?).    Just buy it and try it. Free returns.    Take a look at the Getting Started guide in the sidebar.    You're right but you used the wrong word. The correct term is "rise", not inseam. Inseam is the length of the pants leg, rise is the length of the top block.    Wear your pants up higher in your waist. If you don't them to sit so high try low rise pants. You want to minimize the amount of extra space between your balls and the bottom of the pants crotch. Too tight jeans will also make them blow out faster.    Nope, I actually kinda like it. I think it feels nice and soft like a flannel. I have yet to see whether any of my other ones will get fuzzy like this  since I haven't washed any of them yet.    Mind you I probably would have exchanged it if I had purchased it new. But no it has not stopped me from wearing it.      The one I got used on grailed is like that but all the ones I've bought brand new have been like regular oxfords. I think it might be because it was machine dried, but I have no clue.    You can't :(   The first ones hands down.    If your feet hurt at any time while wearing a shoe, especially after 5 weeks which is more than enough time for a good break-in, something is wrong. Talk to someone about it.   	47
    Your argument is bad and you should feel bad.   No, Nimloth is the name of that one tree, not the family. If you're going to create a category name you'd logically have to go to the root of the family tree.            Hmm..Silmarilli apparently, though I can't remember them ever being referred to as such in canon.    The White Tree is the symbol for Gondor, and represents Aragorn's hereditary right to the throne of Gondor. With the slow disintegration and eventual disappearance of Aragorn's family line from the throne of Gondor, the "Tree in the Court of the Fountain" withers and dies. So the White Tree of Minas Tirith is clearly connected to the health of Gondor's kings, and to the wellbeing of the kingdom in general. When Gondor loses its king and comes under the power of the line of Stewards, the White Tree dies out.  When the Black Gate first falls and the Eagle comes flying to Gondor to spread the news, the proof the Eagle offers that things are going to get better is that the White Tree will come back to life:  *And the Tree that was withered shall be renewed,*  *and he shall plant it in the high places,*  *and the City shall be blessed.*  When Aragorn comes back to Minas Tirith, Gandalf leads him to the mountain behind the city. There, Aragorn finds a little baby White Tree: "Lo! here is the scion of the Eldest of Trees!". And Aragorn replants this tree in the Court of the Fountain. Its health and rapid blooming proves Aragorn's claim.   But the White Tree doesn't just symbolize Aragorn's family or the health of Gondor in general. It also represents the link between the Men of Nmenor from whom the people of Gondor are descended and the origins of Middle-earth in the lands of the Utter West and the Blessed Realm of the Valar. That's a fancy, Tolkienesque way of saying that this tree is a symbol of Gondor's roots, which are long and, well, pretty powerful.  This tree that Aragorn finds on Mount Mindolluin, Gandalf traces its descent line: "Verily this is a sapling of the line of Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and that a fruit of Telperion of many names, Eldest Trees."  The return of the White Tree to Minas Tirith proves that Aragorn has restored Gondor's former glory as the home of the Men of Nmenor. Sauron, a servant of the original Great Enemy who destroyed the Two Trees in Valinor, has been driven permanently from Middle-earth. The replanting of the baby tree descended from those original Two Trees shows that we have come full circle: the powers who destroyed the Two Trees in the first place has been conquered and Good (represented by that new young tree) has won out in Middle-earth.   No, no special term for the lineage, and they were known simply as the First, Second, Third and Fourth White Tree of Gondor. Also, it's Silmarils.   Because I can, here's the history..  Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees, silver Telperion and golden Laurelin shedding light comparable to moon and sun. Telperion was referred to as male and Laurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside Valimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the tears of Nienna. Because the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where the Vanyar and Noldor dwelt together at first. This tree, named Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no light of its own being. It had many seedlings, one of which was named Celeborn, and planted on the isle of Tol Eressa.  In the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the Nmenreans, that was known as Nimloth, the White Tree of Nmenor. It lasted through the vast majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took control of the island he had king Ar-Pharazn chop it down.  The first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great personal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of Nmenor, before it was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He suffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.  This sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was eventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when Sauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that captured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree.  Isildur escaped the capture of Minas Ithil, taking with him a sapling of the White Tree to Minas Anor where it was planted in the citadel courtyard in memory of his slain brother Anrion. This tree died in 1636 during the Great Plague.  A third sapling was planted in the year 1640 of the Third Age by King Tarondor. This one lasted until the year 2872 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.  At this time no seedling of the tree could be found as the tree had rarely flowered after the line of the Kings had failed and therefore no fruit was produced. It was left standing after its death "until the King returns".  When Aragorn became king he discovered (with Gandalf's help) a sapling of the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city, which he reverently planted in the Court of the Fountain. The dead tree was removed from the court but was placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour that would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of the year 3019 of the Third Age the sapling was already laden with blossom.    Thank you for your submission!

[and buseymonsters..](http://i.imgur.com/sN1a9g1.gif)   Most similar to a beech tree. From *Unfinished Tales*:  Its bark was silver and smooth, and its boughs somewhat upswept after the manner of the beech; but it never grew save with a single trunk. Its leaves, like those of the beech but greater, were pale green above and beneath were silver, glistering in the sun; in the autumn they did not fall, but turned to pale gold. In the spring it bore golden blossom in clusters like a cherry, which bloomed on during the summer; and as soon as the flowers opened the leaves fell, so that through spring and summer a grove of malinorni was carpeted and roofed with gold, but its pillars were of grey silver. Its fruit was a nut with a silver shale.   From Letter 340, from JRRT to Christopher:  "I never called Edith Luthien  but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the Silmarillion. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing  and dance. But the story has gone crooked, and I am left, and I cannot plead before the inexorable Mandos."   Thank you for your submission!

The chances that anyone has ever shuffled a pack of cards in the same way twice in the history of the world are infinitesimally small, statistically speaking. The number of possible permutations of 52 cards is 52 factorial otherwise known as 52! or 52 shriek. This is 52 times 51 times 50 . . . all the way down to one. Here's what that looks like:   80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,  975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000.   To give you an idea of how many that is, here is how long it would take to go through every possible permutation of cards. If every star in our galaxy had a trillion planets, each with a trillion people living on them, and each of these people has a trillion packs of cards and somehow they manage to make unique shuffles 1,000 times per second, and they'd been doing that since the Big Bang, they'd only just now be starting to repeat shuffles.  ~ Stephen Fry, QI   Imgur's just a blog site.

 That's a really interesting album! Thanks for posting it!   One does not affect the othera family would still need to go through and prove the facts of the case by presenting evidence.   The standard of proof is much easier to meet in a civil case. The standard of proof in a civil case is generally the preponderance of the evidence, meaning more likely than not. Put the plaintiff's evidence on one side of a metaphysical scale, put the defendant's evidence on the other, and if the scale moves in a direction by any amount, even if it's a tiny amount, that's the side that wins.  To convict in a criminal trial, on the other hand, requires that the prosecution's evidence of guilt be beyond a reasonable doubt. (Not all possible doubt, but a reasonable doubt). That's a high burden.   Because there's a much higher burden, if there is evidence to convict in a criminal murder case, there should certainly be enough evidence for a plaintiff in a civil suit for wrongful death. But every jury is unique, and every trial is unique. Someone could screw up, evidence could be lost, someone could be unavailable for trial, etc. All kinds of things can happen, and it's certainly possible for someone to be found civilly not responsible for a death for which they were convicted of murder.   Um, isn't that the argument of those in the Reconstructionist movement considering dropping the ban on intermarried rabbi? That prohibiting someone from becoming a rabbi based on them marrying a non-Jew makes them second-class citizens?   Allowing Jews who intermarried to participate in some elements of the Jewish world but not all would certainly make the second class citizen comparisons seem apt.   http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-03-08/news/0503080089_1_bolesta-pole-baltimore-county In '05, a guy using $2 bills got arrested in Baltimore.   There is no real legal answer. You expect caselaw or statutes that address time travel?   It's really hard getting a job as a public defender, actually. In the wake of the '08 financial collapse, and even before then in some cases, there were budget freezes in many (most?) states that prevented new prosecutors and public defenders from being hired. And district attorney offices generally get funded before public defenders offices do. (The constitutionality of which is questionable, but...)   I'm glad to hear that you have your dream job! :)   Heh. True, true. There are mornings I wake up sleepy, and for a brief moment, think I don't want to get up to go to work. Then I remember a time when I didn't have a job to get up for, and get my ass out of bed.   Not to be pedantic, but the witness protection program is run by the U.S. Marshals Service, not the FBI.    You can. It's less likely one will be chosen, but it's not an automatic grounds for dismissal from jury service. Just the other day, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts was called for jury duty and showed up at the courthouse. He wasn't put on a jury, but he was called.  A main reason why it's less likely a lawyer would be put on a jury is the fear that other jurors would give her or his views more weight during deliberation based on the legal background. A good reason to use a preemptive challenge on lawyers.   I forget the exact phrasing of the question, but it was one where I did need to say yes....   Thanks!   I do indeed have a job that I'm very happy with! It was a matter of making serendipity happencontinuing to apply and put myself out there until something came through. It was scary for a while there, though.   Graduating law school at the time of the financial collapse was poor timing. I graduated cum laude, passed the bar easily, but had a multiyear period of unemployment/severe underemployment.  During that period, I was called for jury duty. I went to the courthouse, waited around, and was called in as part of a panel for a personal injury case. The judge asked people to stand for if the answer was yes to various questions, one of which was "do you work in the legal profession." I stood, and when it was my turn to reply, I said I was a lawyer. The judge asked what field I worked in, and I honestly replied that I was unemployed. And the people around me laughed! And said that I should ask for business cards when I left.  Working hard to get through law school only to be unable to land a job was bad enough, but that really dropped a salt block into the open wound. That hurt.  (And no-nobody offered me a business card, and no, it wasn't as though I wasn't networking and talking to lawyers at that point. The $15 I got for showing up for jury duty was the most I earned that week.)  Tl;dr: Who the hell laughs at someone being unemployed?   I'll also recommend Bookstore Movers. They won Washington City Paper's best movers in the DC area 5 years in a row, and when I used them a year and a half ago, the concierge at my building took me aside to say that he had never seen a moving crew work that quickly and carefully. Nice people, easy process, I was thrilled with how my move went.   Sigh. I did not say that the airline pulled her off the plane because they were afraid her condition was contagious. The two sentences were separate.  And regardless of whether they pulled her off the plane because they didn't want her dying on the flight or needing medical attention, one of the goals of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Air Carrier Access Act was to destigmatize people with disabilities and not allow myths and fears to dictate how people with disabilities are treated. An airline cannot require a cancer patient to prove an eligibility to fly-such a barrier violates 14 C.F.R. 382.31.   Cancer isn't a communicable disease, for pete's sake. Isn't what occurred here a blatant violation of the Air Carrier Access Act and 14 C.F.R. 382? 14 C.F.R. 382.31 prohibits carriers from refusing service to people with disabilities solely on the basis of said disability, and cancer is certainly something that impact many daily life activities.      Don't forget DC outdoor movies. http://www.dcoutdoorfilms.com/schedule.html      How many times has Israel tried to cut a deal, only for the Palestinians to walk away? Hell, in 2000, the Palestinian Authority was offered 100% of Gaza, 92% of the West Bank, 3% of Israeli territory adjacent to Gaza, and control over East Jerusalem including most of the Old City. The Palestinian Authority walked away and launched an official campaign of terror attacks two months later.  I don't support Netanyahu. I don't support settlement building. I don't support Likkud. And I think there are steps both sides, Israeli and Palestinian, must take to try rebuilding trust, even if it is from scratch.  But it's absurd for this article to claim that it's Netanyahu that has all but killed a two party solution, and not every inch as much the Palestinian side repeatedly backing away from getting nearly everything it wanted in an agreement.   Sure! I'd be curious.   Seems to depend on whom you ask (see http://wtop.com/arlington/2015/03/pentagon-city-mall-and-shopping-center-evacuated/ which says both), but I think you're right, that it's the costco/best buy area.    Which mall did they actually close? Some said it's the Fashion Center at Pentagon City (the big mall), some have said it's the strip mall across the street (with the Costco, Best Buy, CPK, Chevys, etc.), and some have said both. Does anyone know which it actually is?   It seems unclear what has actually been shut down? Is it the Fashion Center at Pentagon City (the big mall) or is it the shops/costco/CPK block across the street?   It's worth noting that this case is probably mooted by the 2008 amendments to the ADA. The amendments broadened the definitions what constitutes a disability, by expanding the definition of who is disabled to include temporary disabilities, as well as by expanding the list of major life activities that, if one is unable to perform, would constitute a disability. Such activities include bending, lifting, standing, etc., all things that would have impacted Young had her case been brought under the ADA as amended.  EDIT: I should have been more clear and said that this case's IMPACT is probably mooted by the ADA as amended. It still matters for Young, and for any others with similar cases in the court system that predates the '08 amendments.   *nods* That's been my experience.

To copy and paste what I put in yesterday's /r/worldnews thread on this subject (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2zovxs/israel_only_nation_condemned_in_un_for_womens/): "It gets better. Iran, where the constitution prohibits female judges, where accused adulterers are stoned to death, where every female presidential candidate in their last election was disqualified, and where a woman was executed by hanging in October for fighting back against the man who tried to rape her, is an elected member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  Sudan, which has no minimum age of consent for sex, allows marriage at age 10, and where 88% of women under 50 have undergone female genital mutilation, is currently a vice-chair of the UN Commission on the Status of Women."   It was definitely plagiarism... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYiEesMbe2I   Yep-as someone with a shoulder injury that used to be a hell of a lot worse pre-physical therapy (I knew I was in trouble when raising my arm to change channels on the remote was painful), I had a lot of trouble on the metro for a while. People were pissy about me using the priority seats, but I also couldn't stand and hang on to the railingone arm didn't have the strength and the other I couldn't raise above my head from the injury.   A bigger problem with thisthey aren't referring to people in Congress who can actually affect U.S. economic performance. They're proposing linking the salary of federal employees, not members of Congress, to U.S. economic performance, so a policy analyst for the U.S. Department of Agriculture gets a paycut if Congress screws up the economy. 'Cause clearly it's the fault of the wheat expert.   It gets better. Iran, where the constitution prohibits female judges, where accused adulterers are stoned to death, where every female presidential candidate in their last election was disqualified, and where a woman was executed by hanging in October for fighting back against the man who tried to rape her, is an elected member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  Sudan, which has no minimum age of consent for sex, allows marriage at age 10, and where 88% of women under 50 have undergone female genital mutilation, is currently a vice-chair of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.       A few days ago, there was a link to an article indicating a likelihood that John H. Jackson would be charged: http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2z32cd/more_than_a_decade_after_tx_inmate_cameron_todd/   Whelp, apparently he has been charged with misconduct by the TX Bar.      There has not been any word-the U.S. Department of Justice is supposedly still investigating.   Is there anything more Jewish than that?   No, he hasn't seen that before since I just wrote it. No copying or pasting involved. Food and Drug law is one of my passions, and the regulatory status of supplements in the U.S. is atrocious.   Doctors hate over the counter weight loss supplements because there is no requirement that such supplements demonstrate that they are safe or effective before hitting the market. Thanks to the supplement industries' successful lobbying efforts, in 1994, a statute was enacted that exempted supplements from demonstrating safety and efficacy prior to going on the market, and allowed supplement manufacturers to make health claims that were previously prohibited. The FDA has little authority to take action against a dietary supplement, including OTC weight loss supplements, before it can be shown that they are severely harmful.   Not sure why I've been downvoted. When I say it's unacceptable that there is still zero cell phone coverage in most tunnels, that's not based on a first-world problem sense of entitlement, that's based on the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, a federal statute that originally required coverage in the Metro system by 2012. When that deadline went flying by, it was moved to Sept. 30, 2015. And as the linked article notes, it appears likely that this deadline will be missed too.  I don't expect perfect cell service, and since it's Metro we're talking about, I don't even expect cell service. But we're supposed to have cell service.   Utterly unacceptable that there is still zero cell phone coverage in most of metro's tunnelsno bars. Can't make calls, can't send a text, certainly can't surf the 'net. The latter is an inconvenience, but the first two are major safety issues. When the DC Fire Dept.'s radios didn't work during the L'Enfant Plaza smoke fiasco, they used their cell phones to communicate with the outside world. Had the train been stuck just a little further into the tunnel, there wouldn't have been cell service.      (I should hastily note that I'm not one of those self-diagnosing sort of people, mind youI ask questions based on what comes up in a search, not assume that is what something is.)   Thank you very much. :) Will do! (Some websites that come up when searching for post-implant pain suggest that it's a sign of nerve issues that need to be dealt with w/i 30ish hours or so, which is why I asked!)   OK, thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. :-)  As a layperson, it's hard to judge when it's okay to give something time versus when something needs dire attention.   I don't believe the gums are red or inflamed, and I don't think flossing/cleaning was an issue, given that I just saw my dentist this afternoon to have the abutment put on and the tooth attached. I had not flossed it, as I didn't have anything to floss there until this afternoon.   My dentist performed a dental implant five or so months ago; I went in for the exposure of the implant/attachment of healing abutment/impressions made two weeks ago, and this afternoon, my dentist took off the healing abutment, put on the permanent abutment, and attached the crown. Both when my dentist put on the healing abutment two weeks ago and when he put on the permanent abutment today, it was very painful (even through having local anesthesia two weeks ago). The pain settled down after a day or two two weeks ago.  Tonight, the site of the implant is very painful. Two weeks ago, the pain had settled to a much lower level by the evening, tonight not so much.  My question is whether this is a warning sign of a nerve issue requiring urgent attention tomorrow, or whether I should merely give it a few days to settle down again? I have no sensations of numbness or anything like that. Just pain.   It's not that readers of Above the Law and /r/law are being told what to think by the article, it's that most of us have the knowledge and training to know that the claims being made are bullshit.   But /u/bobsp/ is right when he questions why anyone would need to waste time explaining that arguing about the fringe of a flag in a courthouse isn't going to get a criminal case dismissed, even to a general audience.   Same.... My 6+ is pretty much what I always wantedit's wonderful for reading books!   Which is not at all the question I addressed. That the ADA does not require every place of public accomodation to provide allergen-free food does not mean that food allergies cannot be covered as a disability under the ADA.  Quoting what I said in my first post, "Generally, post the 2008 amendments, people with food allergies of a certain severity have been found to be disabled for the purpose of the statute, and so failing to make reasonable accommodations for a person with food allergies may be actionable." The Lesley Agreement was an instance where people with food allergies of a certain severity were found to be covered by the ADA's definition of disability, and the DOJ argued that Lesley's failure to make reasonable accommodations was actionable.  EVERYTHING in the area of disability law is contextual, and will depend upon the facts. Hell, the same can pretty much be said of most areas of law, for that matter. Not all allergies rise to the level of being a disability. Even the most severe of allergies may not require anyone make accommodations. And it is unclear whether a restaurant serving the general public is never required to make any modifications. If the only modification required is to saut something in olive oil instead of butter, the olive oil is right there in the kitchen, it doesn't require a special pot or pan, etc., it is possible that eventually, caselaw might develop that a restaurant is required to do what it reasonably can to accommodate such a person. If someone is so allergic to nuts that they cannot eat anything from a kitchen that cooks with nuts regularly, I doubt that restaurant will ever be required to do anything for such a person. But again, caselaw in this area is new, and it's developing.  I'd point you to this part of the ADA.gov's website as an example: http://www.ada.gov/reachingout/lesson11.htm "It is reasonable to provide some extra assistance to a customer with a disability when needed, even during busy periods when other customers are waiting...A customer with a food allergy may ask a restaurant if it is possible to omit a sauce or ingredient from a dish he or she wishes to order. When it is easy to do, the request should be honored."   This is pretty much exactly right. Sorry /u/ceronn , but it's not quite accurate to say that food is never part of the ADA. Under the 2008 amendments to the ADA, designed to reverse the narrow construction courts gave to the ADA, even episodic disabilities are protected, if they rise to the level of impacting a major life activity or function, including breathing and eating.  The ADA DOES cover allergies in some respects, and a lot of people in the thread have gotten this wrong. It does not require restaurants to make major alterations to their food. It is untested as to whether restaurants would have to make reasonable modifications to their food and if so, what reasonable modifications would look like. (I suspect that restaurants would NOT be required to make modifications, but I'm noting the lack of caselaw on this yet. It is undoubtedly coming.)   No, that is not true. See this Q A by the Department of Justice based on a settlement with Lesley University in 2013: http://www.ada.gov/q a_lesley_university.htm First question: "Is a food allergy considered a disability under the ADA?"  The answer: "It depends. A disability as defined by the ADA is a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, such as eating. Major life activities also include major bodily functions, such as the functions of the gastrointestinal system. Some individuals with food allergies have a disability as defined by the ADA - particularly those with more significant or severe responses to certain foods. This would include individuals with celiac disease and others who have autoimmune responses to certain foods, the symptoms of which may include difficulty swallowing and breathing, asthma, or anaphylactic shock."  Food allergies are not always covered by the ADA as amended in 2008, it has to rise to a certain level of severity (it has to interfere with a major life function, like eating, learning, breathing, etc.), but they most certainly can be. This doesn't mean a restaurant has to go to extraordinary lengths to accommodate a person with a food allergy, the situation at Lesley University involved a mandatory meal plan that students HAD to purchase, so it's different from a restaurant, but it's incorrect to say that people with allergies are only protected if they are in primary and secondary school, or would go in to anaphylactic shock, etc. The outer limits of the protections are mostly untested, as the amendments were still relatively recent and it takes time for such cases to wend their way to courts of appeal.   This is positively, absolutely, 100% not true. The 2008 amendments did not limit anything to an age group, nor did it explicitly involve allergies, making your statement doubly untrue. Instead, it broadened the definition of who could be considered disabled under the ADA, reversing a string of Supreme Court decisions that had narrowed said definition. Under the ADA as originally enacted in 1990, it was almost impossible for an allergy to be considered a covered disability, so long as the food allergy was an avoidable substance. After the amendments, under 12012(4)(D), "An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." Breathing is a major life activity. Eating is a major life activity.  There is limited caselaw on the subject, as it takes time for litigation to work its way up to the circuit courts that include the ADA as amended (the amendments were not retroactive), but I can point people to the U.S. Department of Justice's settlement agreement with Lesley University, http://www.ada.gov/q a_lesley_university.htm . There was a Court of Appeals of Iowa case, not decided under the ADA but decided under an Iowa statute that is functionally similar to the ADA and gets its standards from the ADA, in which the court held the statute was violated when a day care center refused to admit a child due to her nut allergy (Knudsen v. Tiger Tots Community Care Center, No. 12 0700, 2013 WL 85798 (final publication decision pending as of the last time I looked), (Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2013)).  The long and short of it is that it is insane that you've been upvoted and I've been down voted based on people not liking the truth. I'm not advocating whether it's good or bad for allergies to covered, I'm not saying that the person who screamed at your niece's manager was right that the ADA required the restaurant to do anything, nor am I saying that the items in that card are necessarily an ADA issue either.  But you said "[f]ood allergies/sensitivities are not covered by the ADA" (random capitalization removed). That is simply not true. It's also not true that the amendments apply only to children, it's not true that the protections don't apply in public, and it's not necessarily true that the items on that card are not in the category of a disability. It's not a question of what the allergy is, it's a question of severity and whether it limits a major life activity. Which still doesn't mean a restaurant has to accommodate it, particularly if it can't. But again, that's a different question.  You are speaking out of your windy backside. I am speaking based on knowledge of the statute and caselaw. In the Q A I linked to about the Lesley University settlement, the very first FAQ is "Is a food allergy considered a disability under the ADA?". The answer: "It depends. A disability as defined by the ADA is a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, such as eating. Major life activities also include major bodily functions, such as the functions of the gastrointestinal system. Some individuals with food allergies have a disability as defined by the ADA - particularly those with more significant or severe responses to certain foods. This would include individuals with celiac disease and others who have autoimmune responses to certain foods, the symptoms of which may include difficulty swallowing and breathing, asthma, or anaphylactic shock."  Or, as I said originally and was downvoted for, yes, under some circumstances, food allergies can be covered as a disability under the ADA as amended.   Prior to 2008, you would likely have been right that food allergies were not covered by the ADA, but, under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), sometimes referred to the ADA as amended, food allergies CAN be covered. The ADAAA broadened the categories of people with disabilities. Generally, post the 2008 amendments, people with food allergies of a certain severity have been found to be disabled for the purpose of the statute, and so failing to make reasonable accommodations for a person with food allergies may be actionable.    Was the security guard okay?   They have ten pound bags of King Arthurs AP flour, which is one reason I bit on the Living Social deal today. :)   Because heaven forfend people in Oklahoma hear about some of the bad things the US has done, like the Trail of Tears. What possible relevance could that have for Oklahomans?   But again, where would you put the cars? Not enough space on the alternate side, the same problem of snow (and people ready to kill you if you take their space) on every block, and many people lack driveways.   It's not as though there is a different street where there is no snow!   Not possible. It's not like street cleanings when you can pop around the block to a free neighboring street, and when some people are out at work. There's snow everywhere, and almost everyone is stuck at home.   No-where are they supposed to go? These are residential neighborhoods, often without driveways (or functional drivewaysa steeply slanted driveway is unsafe in winter).    They can't-cars are there. What happens is the plow comes through and shovels the snow in the street up against the cars. Due to friction, a fraction of the snow melts and refreezes, causing the snow now up against cars to be like cement. People then come and shovel out the normal snow in front of/behind their car, AND have to cover the cement-like snow/sludge that's up against the side of their cars. And so people usually put out a cone or chair or broken furniture to save their space.   Not anymore. Gotta telework.   ROSA has nothing to do with it. ROSA is designed to catch the cars of people living in DC with out-of-state plates/registrations. All that is required if given a ROSA warning is to be able to demonstrate that one is living outside of the District: you have to prove non-DC residency by presenting an out-of-state issued driver license or identification card, copy of one's original lease, deed or mortgage statement and a current utility bill (issued within 60 days) representing the same address and the valid registration card for the vehicle in question. (See http://dmv.dc.gov/service/registration-out-state-automobiles-rosa)  Whether one works in DC is irrelevant for ROSA. All that matters is whether one lives in DC.   That seems surprisingly edgy for him. Are we sure he wasn't hacked?   Sorry for seeming snarky, but there's nothing new about anti-semitism.   Pretty sure we've heard it before.   Jesus saves, but Moses offers a mutual fund with 5% average annual returns.   Freeplay sent one of their extortion-like demand letters to a computer user group I'm on the board of. It was for a video posted three or four years prior that used one of Freeplay's track as a background music. We researched the track, and our understanding is that it was provided as royalty-free music by a major computer technology company and that at the time, the terms of service allowed for non-commercial use of the track. As far as we could tell, at some point, Freeplay changed their terms of service and tried going after us.  Thankfully, after we contacted the technology company, the technology company interceded on our behalf, and Freeplay went away!

Would you mind PMing the contact info for that roofer?   Yesit is! I will pass this along, thanks!   I know, I know, I know, everyone and their mother needs a roofer at this point, but, well, my mother (and dad) needs a roofer at this point, and the best offer they've been able to get so far is $475 an hour and they'll be there on Sunday (and that's after taking pity on them-they first said a week and a half). Can any of you help us do better? It's in West Roxbury.  It's a 100+ year old house, my parents have been there for 40ish years, and never had an ice dam problem before. Not even in '78.  Apparently, there's 9' of snow in the front yard and my parents are not of an age where they could shimmy up a ladder to deal with this, even if there wasn't snow.   Great suggestions here. I also enjoy Sam the Cooking Guy.   I'll add that to my "to watch" list. :)   Sometimes the action can get intense. Austin recalled an incident a few years ago in which he and a federal marshal confronted a vendor suspected of having counterfeit goods at a cafe at The Venetian. As we were serving him, he decided to bolt, Austin said. The instinctive reaction of the marshal who was with me at the time was to stop him. He tackled him and handed him the papers and said, Youre served. That was the coolest.   Wouldn't that be an assault, violation of civil rights under color or title of law, etc.? Someone serving civil papers, even a federal law enforcement agent, doesn't have the authority to use force to serve papers, no?   Which is why there are a million variants of haggadot?  OP isn't a Jew for Jesus on a secret mission to convert people to Christianitysomeone in the process of conversion to Judaism has every right to host and/or lead a seder if s/he so chooses.   So once again, the cost of the FEHB premium increases will be 3 times the amount of any pay raise? :(   Thank you for doing the AMA. I love your work, especially the West Wing (I cannot tell you how happy I am to have another Jed on TV beyond the Beverly Hillbillies), and I am looking forward to seeing you at the Smithsonian's event about leadership in a few weeks. I'm not sure if saying I look forward to seeing your new film is quite appropriate under the circumstances, I'm sure it will be powerful and painful, but I do look forward to seeing your portrayal of Warren Anderson.  I would like to ask you how you came to be an activist, and whether you have found it difficult to balance a movie/TV career with fighting for the causes you believe in? (Both in terms of time, as well as in concerns that doing one might damage the other?)   That's a good ideaI'll look into that, thanks!   Funny timing for this to pop up in my feedI've been thinking about a chest freezer for the past few days.  Question, thoughare you concerned about damage to carpeting if something goes wrong and it leaks (be it mechanical fault, or a power outage, or...?) The fridge/freezer in my kitchen is on a hard, uncarpeted floor, and I'm a bit worried about putting a chest freezer on the living room carpet.   I made chocolate cake the other day, and came very close to forgetting sugar and vanilla. Things happen! It's not surgery, nobody dies, if baking doesn't come out, you try again.   My understanding is that Dartmouth does its best to offer every student an alumni interview. It's not random nor is it a sign that you are on the edge as a possible student.  Every interviewer is differentthere's no standard set of questions they ask. But interviewers aren't there to look at your GPA or SAT or ACT scoresthose are numbers the Admissions Office already has. Instead, interviewers are trying to determine whether you're a good fit for the College and whether the College is a good fit for you. Are you intellectually curious? Are you involved in activities? Are you a decent human being? Etc.  At some point after the interview, the interviewer will fit out a narrative form and submit it to the Admissions Office. What weight does this form have? In my experience, not all that much. I've interviewed candidates I've absolutely loved and I wanted them to go to Dartmouth but they didn't get in, and there have been one or two candidates I thought were weak who did get in. But there are definitely times where a nudge in one direction or the other from a good or terrible interview can make the difference between getting in, deferral, and/or not rejection.  The interview should also be an opportunity for you to ask an alum questions about Dartmouth (and not just have them ask questions of you). Whether you want to know more about a particular major, or the Greek system, or research opportunities, or studies abroad, etc., it's a great chance to ask 1 on 1 questions. (Of course, you should also feel free to ask such questions here.)  Good luck with the process!      Part of the beauty of mitzvot is the effect they have on the person who does them. Freundel's actions certainly ruined that effect for his victims, and as discussed below, he negatively impacted the mikvah for people in other Jewish communities too.   He most certainly hasn't done teshuvah. Part of teshuvah is correcting the sin as much as possible. Freundel's acts harmed many, including the synagogue itself. Freundel's refusal to vacate the synagogue-owned residence adds on to the harm he has done to the shul. Far from committing repentance, he is continuing to knowingly and intentionally harm others.   I've only used an Anova, but my understanding is that the Anova is cheaper, more versatile (because you can clip it to whatever size cooker you want), it circulates water, and it is smaller to store. The same could be said of most stick-style sous vide devices.  I'm not sure why anyone would choose to get an SVS?   Thanks! I think this is what I will do.    Thank you! :) That makes sense.   Thank you! :-)   Indeed. For all the complaints from anti-Israel people that Israel is an "apartheid state", Israel allows freedom of worship, including Islam. Whereas attempts at sharing sites that are holy to both Jews and Muslims is all too often met with violence from Palestinians. Hell, Ariel Sharon setting foot on the Temple Mount was claimed to be the reason for the 2nd intifada.  For that matter, Egypt just banned a Jewish festival at the tomb of Rabbi Yaakov Abuhatzeira in the Beheira province. http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-egypt-jewish-shrine-20150118-story.html   Hopefully this is an appropriate place to ask this question. My girlfriend and I read that Iceland abolished the letter seta in 1973, but our google skills have failed us in finding out why.   Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_orthography) says that when seta was abolished in 1973, it was only being used as "an etymological detail", but frankly, we don't understand what that means.  Can anyone explain why seta was abolished, solely to satisfy our curiosity? Thanks!   Hi all. Having been bitten by the baking bug lately, I've been making lots of breads, cakes, cookies, brownies, etc. to the point where it would make sense for me to buy a 25 pound bag of flour from Costco for $7.79 instead of a 5 pound bag at the grocery store for around $4.50, a 25 pound bag of sugar for $10.49, etc.   BUTI don't want bugs, I don't want flour to go rancid, etc. Any suggestions on where I can find economical (if it's too pricey, it'll take a long time for me to recoup it from Costco savings!), airtight containers that can hold 25lb bags of flour, sugar, etc.? (Should I be looking at a restaurant supply store for a cambro, or a pet store for a 25lb dog food container, or...?)   I'm a kosher pescetarianno shellfish, no meat, no poultry, etc. I eat vegetarian food 90% of the time, and there are times when I will ask about vegetarian options, or say I am vegetarian, because most people a: don't know what pescetarian means, and b: have no idea what is and is not kosher. Vegetarian food, I know is safe.   I would suggest not trying to outdo her or do a super fancy thing designed to impress her. You almost certainly would fail miserably, and it would come across as the culinary equivalent of mansplaining as per Rebecca Solnit's essay. (http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/13/opinion/op-solnit13)  Instead, cook something you know. Cook something good. Cook something honest. Remember that most cooks don't want to eat restaurantish food at home. Here's a passage from Anthony Bourdain's book "Kitchen Confidential" that directly addresses your question:  "UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF us already, you'll probably never cook like a professional. And that's okay. On my day off, I rarely want to eat restaurant food unless I'm looking for new ideas or recipes to steal. What I want to eat is home cooking, somebody's-anybody's-mother's or grandmother's food. A simple pasta pomodoro made with love, a clumsily thrown-together tuna casserole, roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, all of this is pure exotica to me, even when I've been neck-deep all day in filet mignon and herb-infused oils and all the bits of business we do to distinguish restaurant food from what you get at home. My mother-in-law would always apologize before serving dinner when I was in attendance, saying, 'This must seem pretty ordinary for a chef. 'She had no idea how magical, how reassuring, how pleasurable her simple meat loaf was for me, what a delight even lumpy mashed potatoes were-being, as they were, blessedly devoid of truffles or truffle oil."   New Jersey has a reputation for corruption too. Still has voting rights.   Did you have accommodations in college? If so, there's no reason not to do the same in law school. You won't be flagged for it, and you'll want to do your best on them. It may also be a red flag for the bar exam if you seek accommodations that you did not receive in law school, and there are far more distractions in a giant convention center-sized testing space than there are in a law school classroom.      Sorry, I don't. Just the link to the article. Googling it came up with more articles, but not the opinion.   You might want to check out the Oval Room. I was there for Thanksgiving and was very impressed. The RW menu looks pretty good.   There is no right to tamper with a jury.   Not a new issue. In 2005, the Illinois Appellate Court ruled that when a male lover "delivered' his sperm, it was a gift  an absolute and irrevocable transfer of title to property from a donor to a donee...There was no agreement that the original deposit would be returned upon request." In that case, a woman used the product of oral sex to inseminate herself without the consent or knowledge of her sexual partner, and later sought child support.  The court held that the male's lawsuit counts for fraud and theft could not be sustained because she did not steal the sperm-it was freely given to her, but also held that the male could sue for emotional distress based on the woman's extreme and outrageous conduct.  See: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7024930/ns/health-sexual_health/t/sperm-gift-keeps-giving/#.VLg_mSvF98E   Not exactly truegrape products are allowable, but they have to be certified kosher and follow certain restrictions to be kosher. But there is most certainly kosher wine vinegar, grape jelly, etc.   Technically speaking, New York City water is neither kosher nor vegan. There are tiny microscopic copepods (tiny shrimp) inside them. Most vegans and observant Jews still drink up.  There is a tolerance level, that different people set at different levels. Vegans may set it at one level, some kosher certifying organizations may set it at another level, and other kosher certifying organizations might be stricter or more lenient than that. And so, as stated earlier,  not every person who keeps kosher accepts/trusts every kosher authority.   It's not that it has to be the "right kind" of kosher so much as certain kosher certifying organizations are not trusted. Not all certifying organizations are created equalis it a well known organization the Orthodox Union or Star-K or is it some local rabbi doing certifications on his own?  And as for /u/xb10h4z4rd 's comment, being vegan isn't good enough for some Jews who rely on Kosher auditors to ensure that restaurants are actually vegan and not slipping meat or dairy into products in the back kitchen; and also, bugs are not kosher and some religious Jews require a certain level of checking to ensure that the produce is bug free. Again, something a kosher certifying organization would inspect.   Some of the people commenting below think this is an easy answerthat Cassandra's parents are wrong that chemo is bad, that they taught Cassandra that science is bad, and that, as /u/cenobyte put it, "the government is just stepping in for parents that are refusing to be ethical and logical." Maybe. But the kid is less than a year away from being able to make that choice herself. We don't allow adults to commit suicide except for a few states that allow it for terminal conditions. And yet we would allow Cassandra to choose not to take chemo if she were an adult.  Several people have made arguments best summed up by /u/CatalyticDragon, that "children don't generally have the right to make decisions of this nature," but judges tend to give more deference to the choices of someone so close to adulthood than to an 8 year old. Cassandra isn't an adult but she's not a child, either. Does less than a year make that big a difference in one's capacity to make a reasonable choice about one's own medical treatment? I'm not convinced. And Cassandra's mother is an adult, and the state has ignored her decision to agree with Cassandra, so, if the only argument is age, Cassandra's mother should have been able to make the choice. But of course it goes beyond age.  Legally, what happened is what the law dictates. As a matter of moral philosophy, I'm not sure its congruous to force someone over the age of 17 to undergo chemotherapy against her will and the will of her parents, while allowing someone over the age of 18 to refuse.  	110
    Start simple. and start tangible.  I highly recommend ditching Java and starting with a web framework like RoR or Php Yii. They are quick, you can make a fun web app and get the hang of MVC. That way you learn a little bit of front end and a little bit of back end. You'll have time in college to get more depth, but start out with breadth.   Build a simple blog tutorial to start (there are tons), get familiar with mysql or sqlite and get your hands wet with a linux dev environment.   That should take you a month tops. Then you can start tinkering with specific areas. Maybe customize a wordpress blog yourself. Or maybe plug into some APIs like Twitter and see if you can make something interesting.   And then head over to odesk / upwork and do a little bit freelance work. Php / RoR skills are sought after and you can start low (~$10-15 / hr and work your way to $30-40 / hr if you are good)  Good luck.                  yes, mention it BUT: - be careful of the space it takes up - customize your resume for the two different jobs. So for the software job, talk about your hardware startup but describe a sentence or two on any embedded software / drivers / etc that you may have worked on to make the solution work. i.e., describe it as a solution as opposed to hardware - For the audio hardware job, give that more room - make it front and center and go into the technologies in more detail.   I agree with medical transcriptionist over front desk assistant. But it doesnt pay very well and you don't need a college degree to do it.   My suggestion is to look for a clinical role or a junior finance role at a (large) healthcare organization. That will generally be a structured position with a lot of guidance, let you work without a ton of client interaction, and have a career path where if you get good at what you do, you can get senior and see a path to making decent money.  Look at these jobs: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=healthcare+finance+analyst SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=  Something like this job: https://xerox.taleo.net/careersection/xerox_shared_external_portal/jobdetail.ftl?job=15018289 lang=en  You could even look at entry-level research / library management jobs.   Like this job: https://careers.insidehighered.com/yale-university/research-and-education-librarian-focus-public-health-gis/jobs/676703  Or this set of jobs: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=health+librarian SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=   Or look at underwriter / financial analyst jobs. Like this job: https://jobs.healthnet.com/job/Woodland-Hills-Underwriter-%28Entry-level%29-CA-91367/273842800/  Hope that helps.       Look for entry level clinical jobs at big biotech / pharma cos. A biochemistry background can be really helpful and a path to either a scientific career or a business one. Your research experience will come in handy as well. Those jobs pay well out of the gate and have great career prospects as you build experience.  Look at some jobs here: http://tapwage.com/channel/medicine-maker  Jobs like clinical trial support specialists would be a good starting point given your background and experience. You have a good GPA so that will help too.  You could also apply for research assistant jobs at companies / research labs: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=research+assistant SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=  These are good places to build some scientific lab experience and again gives you a path to either go to graduate school or enter pharma. These jobs don't pay as well though       These are the channels you are looking for:  http://tapwage.com/channel/growth-hacker  http://tapwage.com/channel/eplan-edirect-ecoordinate  http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager  :)    Thanks will do. Am sensitive to cross posting because every now and then a user flags me for spamming and that's not my intention.   Separately - the site has a lot of curated marketing channels cut different ways: http://tapwage.com/?field=%5B13%5D  If you follow the channels you like, you can be updated with new jobs since the channels are updated daily.   Hope that helps!   These are curated, daily-updated channels that are extensively filtered for fake / spammy jobs. Glad you found it useful.    Thank you! Will check all these out. I love this subreddit.    Thanks for those tips. I have gotten into Passenger recently but haven't noticed the trumpets. I do like Iron   wine but they are always so sad.    I recently discovered the band Beirut. Blew me away. I love Elephant Gun, East Harlem, and so many other songs of theirs. So three questions for the community: a) What's your favorite Beirut song? b) Are there other bands like them that combine the trumpet / brass with rock / folk music and great song writing?      yes. This is automatically updated every day. If you follow the channel, you can be alerted of new jobs added every week.          It sounds really rough that after all these years of experience, you aren't able to take any meaningful leave and sick days. You seem very disciplined, organized and experienced so there are multiple jobs that you could potentially try for that might be easier / pay you more.  Question - does "some college" mean that you went to college but didn't graduate? Unfortunately you won't get a lot of credit for that.  So here are a few choices of jobs you could consider:  1. Office manager jobs - basically looking for highly organized people. Many are open to people without college degrees but adequate work experience. Jobs are like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/the-office-linchpin  2. There are culinary director jobs at startups and companies that will allow you to leverage your skill, but these are at companies that tend to have better benefit packages and leave plans and more of a career path: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=culinary+director SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=  3. You could also consider becoming a bank teller / personal banker. That may be a stretch since it forces you to start somewhat at a more entry-level position. If you can get a job directly as a personal banker accounting for your experience, you could potentially make a similar pay as you are making now, and have a career path that is more sustainable and more enjoyable. You probably have the people skills to be great at it. But being a bank teller at entry level won't work since it will take you back to the $30k mark that will be hard.  4. if you like tech / startups / video games, you could try and get a job in customer experience / customer adoption. These are interesting jobs where you aren't doing sales but walking large customers through early adoption of a new technology. It's kinda fun. Only catch is that most of these are in big cities so you could make the same pay but end up spending more on living expenses.  What about something like a restaurant operations consultant? Large food companies like US foods have these jobs and they seem perfect for you.  https://usfood.taleo.net/careersection/usf_external/jobdetail.ftl?job=15002747 lang=en  The link is just an example. With your experience you should be able to get at least a similar starting pay but with better benefits and a better career path.           Hey - firstly congrats on not having student debt, and I feel for you on the job search struggles.   In the absence of a lot more information, I am bound to agree with the advice that grad school isn't going to magically solve the problems. It sounds like the bigger problem is a lack of focus on specifically what you want to apply to, and perhaps you need help tailoring your resume.   Check out some of the jobs here:   http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=physics+recent+graduate SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D=  A few are for entry-level math and and physics graduates, and most don't need extensive programming experience.  Are you sending the same resume to all these 30 positions? That's a mistake if you are. Also have you had a few people look at and critique your resume? Finally - are you just cold applying or actively trying to connect / network into the organizations. Have you been invited to any interviews?  Firstly - 30 applications is not a lot so don't lose patience. Secondly - before you opt for grad school (which may or may not be an excellent decision), you need to find out exactly why you aren't getting interviews / jobs. If you aren't getting interviews - chances are you aren't finding the right jobs, and your resume is probably not up to scratch. So get a career coach and get that in order.   If you are getting interviews but aren't making it through - then you need to get to the bottom of why that's the case.  Whatever you decide vis. a vis. grad school - get to the bottom of why you aren't finding success at the job hunt. The market is still not great for recent graduates, especially in physics and math, so it might take some time, but have patience and potentially evaluate getting a career coach to help.                Dating for Dummies...(j/k)  I don't mind books whose fundamental points I disagree with (say Mein Kempf, or Ayn Rand). Many people I know read and own books they vehemently disagree with without which they feel ill equipped to argue the other side.   I mind fluff books that pretend to be intellectual that aren't. Examples: - Books by Malcolm Gladwell - Books by Thomas Friedman (except 'From Beirut to Jerusalem')    I get reading. I get owning. But why highlight, unless you had to direct the film (and even then it's a weak excuse)   They aren't inaccessible. It's just that one their own, they lack popular front-end frameworks to rapid prototype an application that you can use.   I think if you are learning programming for the first time, especially outside of a college environment  - it's really fulfilling when you can build a real live application that solves an itch you have and is fun to use. That can be a huge high that leads you to build on the skill and get better.  It's a little bit like learning a musical instrument for the first time. If you spend the first 6 months just playing scales back and forth, it gets dull and people tend to lose interest, but the minute you learn that first tune, you are hooked. Suddenly you aren't playing an instrument, you are making music that you recognize as music.  The same goes with programming. The sooner you move away from learning coding, and start to build something you can play with, you get hooked.  Python and C++ are fantastic programs. I especially loved C++. Maybe with something like C++, you could learn openGL / Unity / Unreal and make a cool game or something. I used to enjoy using C++ for image processing (but I admit it was because of a class I took and not self driven). Perhaps you are exceptionally curious and driven and use those languages to build out something amazing. With Python - you could even use learn Django and end up making a cool web app.  But if you are starting out coding in your 20s, then start with PHP / Yii and build a simple blog. Then figure out how to integrate it with or extend Wordpress, and add little features and hooks.   If you do that, programming ceases to be a series of obscure incantations that you offer up to a computing black box, and suddenly becomes the lego building blocks to a new and tangible universe.     In high school way back in the 90s, it was offered as an elective. We learnt basic on MS Dos machines.   One of the problems with programs like Python and C++ is that it's hard to use those languages to scratch an easy itch (unless your itch is more computational).   These days, as am amateur programmer, it's almost better to learn Objective-C / Swift, or PHP / Ruby on Rails. That way you build something relatively quickly, a web app or a mobile app, and you actually use it. So if you hated all the existing to-do lists, you build one. Or if you want to port your music from spotify to apple music, you quickly make an app and share it with your friends.   Once you are done with a few things like that which give you a sense of accomplishment, then head on over to github and see if there are projects you can contribute to, patches you can submit, and start picking up something more unstructured (and consequently more powerful) like C++ / Python to see if you can build something cooler.  Actually one of the most fun projects I remember (and I can't for the life of me remember its name), was this league where you could build a AI-engine to play football against other teams. That was a really fun task to do as a beginner coding project.    60k seems high for entry-level North Carolina software jobs. To be fair - there are a lots of flavors for software jobs and even entry-level job pay-grades are standardized based on skill set. Where did you find that number, or is that anecdotal from friends?  Also - although RH will help you and take a cut if they succeed in finding you a job you like, that doesn't compel you not to look for jobs on your own. Feel free to cast your net wide and see if you cn find a better offer and if RH finds you a job you think compelling, take that.   In general, headhunters will commit to salaries a little lower than market to manage your expectations. What they are quoting you may be disappointing but it isn't wildly off. Focus on knocking the socks off your interviewers and nailing a great job whether you get it through RH or on your own.  But most importantly - you need to base your salary info on real data and skills and not anecdotal evidence. If you know companies that are paying $60k+, then apply there.   	34
 The Godfather..  Probably tried to watch the first part long long time ago.. gave up after 20min. Never got back to it!   Star Wars   about 3 hrs in, we were walking to the next nightclub.. she was walking ahead of me .. thats when I noticed.. and i was like.. HOLY SHIT !!! How the hell did I miss that all this while!!! Not for once that made any difference to what I thought / felt about her.. I was just shocked at myself! She was wearing a long sleve jacket.   This kinda happened to me too! I didn't notice my wife's (then girlfriend) missing arm until 3-4 hours of the first time we met! It was late evening, we went to a couple of pubs / nightclubs! Still the best night ever!         he came   This should become a meme! something on the lines of - you expect me to be impressed???

 All i can say is the game is still in beta, Everything is subject to change till official launch , and even then they can change stuff I think.The caps are kinda stupid, but make sense.I suppose its holds a balancing factor as well. I cant speak from experience about the pvp, as im not a BIG pvper, but I assume PvP takes skill,especially in a game like skyforge. Only those who truly know their class and know how to play the game can win. Sure some classes have longer range, make it seem impossible to attack them at close range, but Im sure there is a way to beat them, if you're skilled enough.   https://youtu.be/KwRSOZJBKg0 play at 54 secs and watch this gif   Offline play should track stats   It may be random, but when 4 people i know get sweet tooth after getting 1 win with all vehicle ,it seems like that is the a surefire way to get it   I do a little dance when I score  	5

 Ive seen kids smoking weed they didnt turn out to be the smartest or successful 10 years down the line.   When they get too personal about it.   Nope though that is only one encounter Ive had with otherworldy beings. I wasnt sleepwalking as far as I know because it was in the middle of the day.    If cartoons and movies have taught me anything, its that the mouse always wins.    Well it was 2008 or 2009. I was at my parents house alone. I was looking for something in the guest bedroom when I felt like i was being watch. I glance over my shoulder to see it standing by the door. I did a double take and turned all the way around only to see it glide out through the doorway. I was shocked so I slowly walked to the door but it was gone. I dont remember going into the bathroom or filling up the tub. But I do remember being underwater long enough that I started seeing a white light that seemed to be getting brighter. Then the light started faded away in the distance and I regain my senses and sit up to find out Im in the tub of water. Desperately trying to catch my breathe again, I was so confused. Right next to the tub was a statue of Jesus I guess I brought into the bathroom and I kind of broke down and started crying. I haven't seen the shadow since then.   I have seen a few shadow people. One was a 7ft tall hooded figure standing right behind me. It freaked me out when i saw it then next thing I know Im in a tub full of water(fully clothed) with a statue of jesus next to me.  	6

 Today at work, I was doing fine till the afternoon when I messaged her.  I knew it was over. I could feel it. Today, the depression would hit me. It had been a few months. No. Almost a year. But I could see the snowflake falling in my head. I could see its trajectory, and I could see the avalanche that it would cause.  I had to be really careful. I'd escaped before. I just had to keep focused on work. Fuck. Why wasn't she replying?   *Those are the kind of thoughts that will lead you down the path. Focus on the work. Get the job done*  Had she replied? I checked my phone and got a beer. Maybe the beer would help. I drank it quickly. Nope. Bad idea.  I needed to get out of there. I decided to walk home, but then saw the bus and got on instead.   When i got off the bus, I felt afraid of the evening that lay ahead. It was less than a block that I had to walk. Each step increased my dread. I'd never, ever felt this before. I knew that I would go home and burst into tears. Nothing would stop it now. Except if I didn't go home.  Yes, that was it. I just had to take a walk. The thought was there, but I kept moving towards my house. I felt like I was a chained by my hands and was being dragged along the floor. I helplessly watched my legs carry me up the stairs.   I methodically checked my mail, unlocked the door, put my keys and badge in their place, locked the door, took off my shoes, went into my bedroom, covered myself with my blanket and burst into tears. They flowed peacefully and silently, accompanied only by the sound of my refrigerator humming. I should have gotten that fixed long back.  I stopped crying, got up and decided to write this.  The rest of the evening beckons, and I have to go. Thank you for reading.      Hey guys..I'm developing an app for Android that can play local media (just for learning) and I was wondering how the battery usage of apps is commonly tested. How do you guys test the battery usage of your app?   Like, if I wanted a script that would launch a video for an hour and see how my app is doing...what would I need to know to write such a script?  Also, I've been told that battery percentage isn't really an accurate descriptor of the battery usage...why is that? Is it because it drops due to every other app and Wifi and data usage and all that? If not battery percentage, what would I be using to see how my app eats up the battery?   Oh yeah, absolutely...She's going to get an Iron IV infusion this week and is going to be on Anti-depressants for the next 6 months...Hopefully all that will help!   Yup...We live in different cities, though...Will still try and keep her spiritis up, thanks!   Thanks! We're actually going backpacking next weekend...that should be good! Till then, though...we don't live in the same city...so I guess I'll just continue to make sure she knows I'm around!   Hey guys,  I spent a bunch of the last 3-4 years in a depressed state, but told very few people, and now I'm on one of the upswings. But this isn't about me..  Recently, a very close friend of mine was diagnosed with depression due to Iron deficiency in her diet. The feelings she talked about briefly, I understand only too well...and of course, I want to help  But the problem is, I remember when I was feeling similar things, I really, REALLY didn't want help from other people...I could hardly bear talking to anyone else...and I think she's the same...since she's been hardly talking the last few weeks...I've tried to let her know that I'm there for her if she wants to talk...and I've tried to make conversation normally as well..but I really want to get through to her...that she's not alone in this.  I just don't know how...especially since I can remember a time when no one could get through to me..  Any ideas?    They have this new brewing system (at least in Seattle) called the Clover that makes a really good cup of coffee... Apart from that, it's quite bad. Except for the blonde roast.   I've tried a few cafes and the ones I like are:  1. Vivace (Cap Hill) 2. Fuel Coffee (Wallingford) 3. Stumptown (Cap Hill) 4. Caffe Vita (Fremont)  In fact, I had a latte at Fuel yesterday for the first time and loved it.    Not really. The India Pakistan split was a complicated issue. In fact, India has more Muslims than Pakistan. Our previous president was muslim as well.  Not that doesn't mean India is completely secular. Narendra Modi in particular and his party in general are known to be communal. He is widely thought to have had a hand in major communal riots in 2002 where a lot of Muslims were killed. But again, been that is a gray area.  Sorry for not being able to give a concrete answer...but that's India for you.   If you're prepared to add a day or two to your trip, you can go camp out in the Whitney area and look for permits every day. A lot of people apply for the lottery and cancel/never show up/show up in smaller groups than planned.  A ranger told me he's always had a few walk-in permits issues...every  day when the visitor center opens. Just go for it!   Also, you can climb one of the "lesser" mountains.   I had way more fun on Mt. Dade than on Mt. Whitney. Even though I didn't even reach the top of Dade. Whitney was so much easier, crowded and less fun overall. Though the views are great.   Then you throwout everything and the kitchen sink.    A friend and I are planning on a 9 day trip to Kauai in the end of May, and we want to spend 3-4 days backpacking. We love mountains and beaches and rivers...basically everything.  Any suggestions for trails that we can do? Preferably not crowded!  Also, do kayak agencies rent kayaks by the hour/day for ocean kayaking? Everything I found online only had guided tours. Any suggestions would be welcome. Thank you!   Middle class earth, you must mean.   It does imply it. If Logician 1 (or 2) didn't want a beer, then all three of them do not want a beer (which is what the bartender asked, if ALL of them want a beer), so the answer to the bartender's question would be no.  The only reason for Logician 1 (and 2) to say "I don't know" to the bartender's question is that he/she wants a beer, but doesn't know about the other two.   Wow! What place in Hawaii was this?   Same with me as well on my Mac -- OS X 10.9.1   Show me SD cards that can do this and then we'll talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZP8fNcYHU   They actually do support IOS, and PS3, and Xbox, and Roku.  Android's actually the only one left behind...Very glaring omission.  And Chromecast, I want me some AIV on my Chromecast :(   Approximately 50g loss out of 1000g is not 0.05 %, it's 5 %.   I think part of the reason he got so "famous" and "wealthy" is that he had this characteristic of not giving a fuck all along.    I don't want my computer to ring, especially when my phone is silent. Ideally, I would want to stop forwarding completely. I don't even remember when I enabled it.  If not completely stopping forwarding, can I at least disable notifications? My Hangouts decided to start ringing in a meeting!    According to CNBC, one post on the site says "Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking," Fox News reported.   Great reporting right there.   Yeah I actually did post here looking for validation. New to this world. Obviously (now) both the message and this post were dumb. But hey, what better way to learn than making mistakes.    Ha! True true. I'm leaning towards thinking about it as practice.    Yeah I agree now. The way the message is written, there isn't really a point to it, is there? Oh well.    But I did! And it does seem lame and silly now. But what the heck. I'm quite lame and silly on a lot of days :-)    I had long heard rumors about the Fade on OKCupid, but could never have guessed that my own self would experience the phenomenon. They had said that one day, communication would cease. Abruptly. Leaving thoughts and words and plans hanging in the air. Even dreams, if you're romantically inclined.   It was everything that had been said, and more. It was a fleeting glimpse of a better place. Before I could make out any details of this magical kingdom, it was replaced by the familiar grayness of our cloudy, daily existence. I could no longer deny the existence of the Fade. I could only move on.   It reminded me of knights in medieval times. A beautiful lady drops a handkerchief on the road and smiles at a knight. He smiles back, dismounts from his steed and picks it up. He runs up the old (perhaps new, in the time of the knight) staircase to the balcony, but there's no one there. "Was it all a dream?", he wonders. He looks at his hand, and the question is answered. For the handkerchief is still there.     I see you're a gangster; I'm a gangster myself.   That's actually a great idea. I've been around mountains for a long time now and have never camped close to the beach!   Any good beaches close to LA that you could suggest (that won't be too crowded)?   Exactly what it says in the title. I'm looking to go camping in CA Jan 2-5. Cold is fine, but freezing and below temperatures aren't good, since I just want to stay in relative comfort.   Strenuous hikes are very welcome, though! My last trip to CA was Mt. Whitney in August. That much cold is okay, but no more!  As you can see, fighting the cold is my No. 1 criteria :)   Any suggestions?   Yup...Getting me one of these!      29!    This is the End.   I be listenin' to Porcupine Tree:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsMqAmjOMfU   Oops. My bad!   i just dragged one icon onto another on the app drawer and voila! Folder!   Thanks! That's exactly what I'm going to do!   My nexus 5 shows only an 'H' by the signal bars, which is the same thing that my Nexus 4 used to show.   The Nexus 5 is the first 4G phone I've bought and I remember reading that it has to be activated (with the IMEI) or something to that effect. Is this true? Has anyone gone through the process?   I'm down for something in Seattle. Queen Anne is where I live too, so I'll just walk over!   Yup, count me in!   Already worked! We're on for a hike this weekend. Thank you :)    I have used these (slightly changed, but almost exact!) words in my message and asked her out again this weekend for a hike/picnic. If it works out, then I shall owe you a drink!   I'm a dude too! Lol! Just saw that I said I'm 29/M/F. I'm 29/M!  I don't mind doing the asking out at all... I like the upfrontness of your messages. I guess that's all it's about.   Today's Friday. One date was on Tuesday, one on Wednesday.  And nope. No plans for second date yet. I was busy the rest of this week and am going out of town for the weekend, so didn't try. Just messaged a bit when I felt like messaging. No real intent or purpose to it.   Yeah, instead of asking all these questions, I could just ask myself: What would Naruto do?   I think that would work just as well!   Lol. Yup, makes sense. Don't know why I feel like I'm treading dangerous waters. Jump in and swim, I should!     My first post here: Critique my profile   Second post: How do I handle dates?   Third post (this one): What do I do after my first date?  It seems like I'm growing with this sub!  I had two OKC dates last week (I am 29/M), but this is really the first time I've been actually dating. Everything before came out of already-existing friendships.  The dates went okay. We talked a lot, laughed a decent amount and went home feeling warmish inside (well me, at least).  Now I'm texting back and forth, but it seems like I'm going nowhere with this. It's all "what are you up to?" and "hahaha that was hilarious". How do I make my interest clear? Or do I wait for a second date?   No idea what to do. Please to help, the experienced peoples of the Reddit!  EDIT: Had both genders listed for myself. I'm only one -- male.   Yes, 29 is slightly too old to start learning all this. But 'tis what 'tis and gotta start from where I am :)   Really? Lol. Not sure why I answered No..must have misread the question....Great catch (on the adventure thing too!)..thanks!   I'm going to use those exact words!   Lol. You're right. Here I was, happily rejecting people in my theory when in practice, rejection's where I'm going with this :D   Thanks! My profile's been critiques already (http://www.okcupid.com/profile/pritam_ps).. Useful stuff I got on there!  You are completely right. My questions are more with dating than with OKC. It's just OKC's where I am now. I shall head on to /r/relationships and the sidebar!   Yeah...But since I'm not polygamous and all that, I'll have to choose one of them after...  I'm just being silly, I guess.  The whole thing's just very strange to me. I guess that's how arranged marriage looks to the rest of the world.  Who knew reality and movies are so different?   Thanks!  I'll get a better pic taken when I go on my next hike!   Agreed! Removed all the adverbs also. Adverbs are for the weak!   Thanks! Changed it according to your feedback. I think the Good At section is bland, because whatever I'm good at, answering that question isn't on that list.   This might be a cultural thing (Indian here), or a nerd thing (engineer), or something (shy). But I've never been in the dating game prior to two months back.   It's not like I have dates lined up or anything. My OKC ritual usually goes like this: I get 1/10 replies. After a thread lasting about 6 messages, she stops replying.  But in theory, suppose I had to choose between two (or more..it's theory!) girls after date(s) with both of them. Is this acceptable (just saying No to one of them)...in the OKC culture?  I'm sure girls face this issue quite a bit on OKC...since all the guys are green, and all the girls are red :D      Thanks! From yours and the other replies, looks like boots (however heavy they are) is the way to go!    Hello people,  I'm hiking through Buckskin Gulch next weekend and wanted to know (from people who've done the hike) whether sandals are enough.  From what I see, it's mostly walking with a little scrambling, for which I don't want to carry my big, heavy hiking boots.  Anyone with experience in the Canyon, please chime in!    And someone giving aid is again admired... I really don't get it.             I am willing to wager that even after losing his hand, he won't differ at all.    Well of course it's a pop corn movie. But it's been a long while since I've loved a movie so much. I forgave all the plot holes because of the awesomeness.   But even with giant robots, you have Transformers 3 and you have Pacific Rim.   Yup, you're right in that we both were partly right :)   I found this: http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/bernoulli.pdf  So the car pressure is *higher* than outside, and net-airflow is actually **outwards**! Of course, because there's air coming in through the vents. Cool stuff.  Also, a hole in the windshield is the "same" as a window, because air is flowing attached to the car surface and not straight into the car.   I think we're both quite wrong. The only airflow is from a mixing layer as answered by 'threegigs' in a separate comment.    Ah!!!  That makes perfect, perfect sense. Thank you :)   Actually air flows out of the bottle, not into it. Also imagine an aeroplane door cracking open in midflight. Everything flows out, not in. The air outside is moving relative to the car, so actually the air outside is the air with the lower pressure. Just like in a wind tunnel.  Barometric equilibrium is of course true. But how? Why...what if you open the window just a tiny bit? Is air still flowing both in and out of there? Because sure as hell, if you put your hands in the gap, you're going to feel air flowing in.  EDIT: In fact, what happens if all your windows are closed and there's a (say big) hole in the front windshield? Where's the air flowing out of then? I think there's some big thing I'm missing...and it's not just that air is flowing out of an undefined place.   Relative to the car, the air inside the car is at rest, right? So it's pressure  is the same as when it started, which is atmospheric pressure.  So you mean, part of the window has inflowing air and part of it has outflowing air? Which parts have inflow and which have outflow? Like I said, try this in a moving car...you really can't find a region with outflowing air.  Also, if the pressure inside is *actually* lower, why is air flowing out?     I was asked this puzzle a few weeks back and couldn't figure it out.  You're moving in a car, and you roll down the windows. Air flows into the car.   1. Why does air flow in? Air inside is at atmospheric pressure, air outside is at atmospheric pressure. Pressure being equal, there should be no flow.  2. Obviously it's flowing out from somewhere, otherwise pressure would build up in the car and it would explode. Where does it go out of? This was asked to me when inside a moving car, and I placed my hand at various locations around the window and air seemed to be coming inside everywhere!    We don't really consider molecules while talking about the propagation of sound. The assumption is that they collide frequently enough with each other that statistically speaking, the pressure distribution is continuous. That's what the continuum assumption means.   Increasing amplitude of (pressure) oscillations is the same as increasing the loudness of the sound, so yes...It would work in relation to your ear.   Theoretically, the speed of sound is a function of $\gamma$, $P$ (pressure) and $\rho$ (density)...   Basically, as the density approaches zero, the speed of sound becomes undefined, i.e. there's no air for the sound to travel through. Theoretically though, however rarefied the air is, sound can still travel.  However, when I say theoretically, I mean in the theory of compressible flow, which assumes that air is a continuum. This assumption is valid for quite a while.  At the point where air cannot be treated as a continuum and molecules are too far to collide with each other (but still close enough for non-zero density), sound can't travel. When there is zero pressure, the speed of sound is zero.  However, whether you can *hear* sound in these cases is a completely different question, because that depends on whether your ear drum can detect the pressure variations and oscillations.  **tl;dr**: Pressure goes to zero, sound can't travel. Density goes to zero, nothing for sound to travel in. Molecular and/or viscous effects can/may do other things that I don't know (but hopefully someone does!)    Dude, from the looks of your FR, it looks like she was the one that seduced you...which is not a bad thing at all, of course... means you're worth it :)  But I think you're fooling yourself if you're thinking you made this happen with your cool seduction skills ;-)   Thanks!!   He's the drummer for Louis Banks...that's awesome! He (Banks) had performed in our college when I was an undergrad in Bombay...amazing fusion!   I'm sure the African people have their own systems of counting and learning. Just because it's different from western theory doesn't mean it's magical. The africans work just as hard and take just as much time to learn their rhythms. And they have their own version of "polyrhythms" and theory as well.  I kind of relate to it since Indian music is similar. Polyrhythms start very, very early when learning indian percussion and are never really regarded with the same sort of amazement as they are in western music. Really cool stuff.   Also, Bela Fleck is awesome :)   Assuming you're not trying to be the next iron chef:  Or assuming that you're not from the general Indian subcontinent region. This doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the spices we use. Though, oregano and rosemary aren't really on that list.   Ha no way :-D just have heard other songs by her.

They work great for rice once you're done making milkshake out of all the ice cream!   I would have preferred a cleaner sound on the guitar to go with the clean vocals...Otherwise really cool! Nice, simple riffs, nothing unnecessarily over-the-top. Fun stuff!  EDIT: Very nice lead solo! The part that harmonizes with the vocals is quite cool!   From the title, it just seems like she smiles there. Who knows where she lives..    None taken!  The classical music is derived from the same base in both countries. Which is not surprising, considering the style of music is from before the countries split up.  In fact, there is a greater divide between North Indian and South Indian music than between North Indian and Pakistani music.   Maybe he means himself. OsCar, the fancy Car!   Thanks a lot! I'm moving there soon and am getting very, very excited about all the hiking opportunities!    What places are those?   Moving to WA in August...Can't wait!!

Slightly less addictive than alcohol (alcohol is addictive to about 11% of the people that try it, marijuana is to 9%). There are negative physical and mental characteristics to extended use of marijuana, as well as a few positive ones. It's proven, it's a fact. I'm in support of legalizing it, but it's naive to say it's not physically or mentally addictive.   That time it is was time for dinner and it was dog food again. That was the best.

They sometimes accomplish things just to tell others about how they accomplished things.   I rephrased something I think.   I'm not talking about all one person.   The person I was talking about is actually Filipino, not sure why it makes a difference. He didn't exactly come out, I believe he went to Vijay, where ever that was. His parents set it up for his birthday even though he didn't want it. A lot of celebrities will do stuff for you if you make a generous donation to a charity with their name on it, or get them a sponsor, or even pay them directly. I'm not sure which they did. Anyhow, he said Vijay was a nice guy in general but he could be a little intense. I think he probably would have mentioned the racism if he had noticed it.   Jon Bon Jovi*?   An Acura is more than modest to a man who owns an exotic car dealership.   No, I'm Toby. He's Leonard.   Even as high as 1900 degrees. Have you ever been to one of the higher end steak houses? It works, trust me.   I'm not sure what to say, I'm definitely not the type to be asking about this. You know how an office building would probably have a room full of servers and computer stuff? Same idea except in a house. Everything is connected too, if you forgot to close the garage door you could do it from your terminal at your bed. If you want to turn the pool lights on, you could do it from the console in the kitchen.   Just an example, someone of his equal status.   I think it's mostly because it sounds fancy. Most people haven't visited North Dakota, they don't know if its any different, but its 'imported' so it must be better.   I'm not exactly sure how it works, but my best friend has a 'guy' who was literally at his house four days a week to work on his computer system. They were his only client.   She was more of the guest of honor. She gave a short little speech and everything. The host family was **very** rich though, she didn't stand out as much as you would think.   That's the point.   I don't know if it's legal, but they definitely aren't the type of people to give a shit if it wasn't. I've heard of people getting their houses zoned as airports or something so that they could land there, he might have done some sneaky legal thing like that. I'm not exactly sure how it works. It's not visible from the street, you can obviously hear it when it's on though.   I wouldn't say any of them are necessarily billionaires (its kind of hard to tell how much they make at some point), but definitely upwards of ten-millionares at the low end. It's not all that shocking, although my house isn't as big it fits into the area just fine.   Yeah I kinda do... My family is probably in the upper middle class, but definitely not rich. I live in like a 2,750 square foot house surrounded by mansions two or three times it's size.   I thought I replied to this earlier, but apparently the comment before it got deleted. I live on  a piece of land that's basically a cliff. The developers put in about 30 mansions right there, plus about four or five normal houses where they didn't have enough room for a big mansion. So theres like four normal families right in the middle of a very rich community.   New Jersey. They make it all kinds of ways, some commute to Wall Street, some are retired, some simply inherited it. Most of them are owners of companies, or owners of large franchises of big companies. There is even one very very well known rock star that lives five houses down. I'd love not to give up my address, but his name is at least as big as Lenny Kravitz.   If [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F9jXYOH2c0) doesn't make you laugh, nothing will. Simple as that.  EDIT: On the off chance you have no sense of humor, I'm not giving up. I feel as if I've been issued a challenge. People other than OP (and OP), let me know which one gets you.

"I dare you...to get in a sleeping bag with my sister naked!"  "Deal!"  "Hey sis, get over here!"   You don't draw dicks on the host, that's just common courtesy.   I don't get it, it can't work because my neighbor is rich and I'm not? It works, trust me. I basically live on a cliff where they put gigantic mansions facing the water. Where they didn't have room or land for full mansions the developer put in normal sized houses. There's about five families in my neighborhood that are 'normal', all of the rest are filthy rich.   Steak. Ever wonder why yours isn't as good as the top notch restaurants? Two reasons, the quality of the meat, and the temperature at which it's cooked. Most high end steak houses broil their steaks at about 1500+ degrees, theses nothing you can do about that one. You can how ever buy their quality of meat. USDA Prime is where it's at, you'll never get there with Choice or Select.   Swim directly towards the shark to establish dominance.   I'm not rich, but I live in a very very rich town. My neighbor has a helicopter sitting in his back yard, that kind of rich. People here buy some truly ridiculous things.  * Don't you hate, for example, when you get on your private jet to go across the country, but as soon as you get there you need to go rent a car? Well, people around here don't have that problem. They pay a service to ship their Ferraris and Lamborghinis to their destinations ahead of time so they can drive them when they get there. Yeah.  * I've been to family parties and events where famous people are simply summoned and show up. I count this as something they buy, because I think they are very often paid. Literally two weeks ago Laura Bush made an appearance at my friends family barbecue. A month or so before that, Tom Selleck came by for a dinner party.  * Sometimes they buy theme parks or things like that for a day. They just rent it out a while in advance and then throw a huge party. It's just as awesome as it sounds, all of the workers are there, but there's no lines. There is alcohol being served too, because it's a private event.  * They can by lessons from professional athletes or dinners from famous chefs. Sure you're not going to get Tom Brady to teach you how to play football, but Teddy Bridgewater? Sure, anytime. My neighbors kid, who absolutely hates golf, got personal lessons from Vijay Singh. For those of you that don't know, hes a pretty big deal. Rich people do this just to say they did though. They'll get a professional dedicated instructor who coaches the likes of Tiger Woods if they want to actually get good, but they just want to say they got a lesson and a picture with Vijay Singh.  * A lot of my friends have two or three exact copies of their phones in case one breaks. That in itself ins't all that expensive, but it just goes to show their mentality towards money. Who needs a silly thing like insurance when you could just buy three more? Crack a phone? No problem, got a fresh one in my pocket. Crash your McLaren? No problem, got a fresh on in the garage.  * Some times you have to buy 'people'. Not exactly what it sounds like, but say you're having trouble with your homes computer system (most people here have huge house wide computer terminals, I have no idea how they work), well then you need to go out an buy a personal IT guy for your house. From now on, you are his only client and his job is to reset your router once a week. Rich people don't have time for such things.*  * If you need literally anything as a rich person, you can basically buy it even if it doesn't exist. A parking lot for example. My neighbor once had a big party, but didn't have enough room for everyone to leave their exotic cars so my dad let him use our front yard to park some of them. Literally a day later he had our entire lawn resodded with grass imported from North Dakota. There are no problems if you have enough money, only creative solutions.  * A lot of rich people live surprisingly modest too. They're in the minority, but they exist. As a kid I used to work for a guy who owned an exotic car dealership. Even though he had about a dozen Ferraris and Lamborghinis, he perfected to drive an Acura sedan as his everyday car. Not even a particularly nice one. Even though there are better options within their budget, a lot of rich people sill prefer the 'average' things we use.  EDIT: I'd prefer not to say where I live, but I will say that one person guessed it. A lot got bordering towns.   I was at a concert once where a number of rambunctious individuals chose to climb up on pile of large speakers off to the side of the stage, and then play king of the hill from the top. One bouncer noticed and started ripping them off one by one. He eventually got to one shirtless guy who he grabbed by the leg. As if it was a natural defense mechanism, the shirtless man immediately turned and projectile vomited directly into the bouncers face. The bouncer lifted his hands to shield himself, which caused him to fall back into the crowd, crushing those he had just torn down from the speakers. The shirtless man then ascended back to the summit of the speakers and pounded his chest like a triumphant gorilla.   on the rafters  facedived into  [The only way I can imagine this going down] (http://journey2happy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/seth-rogan-nighbours-film-airbag-chair-prank-13813566985.gif)   I've had it ever since it came out, for ten days. I'd love to adjust to it, that would solve everything, but I simply don't like it. I think ten days of trial use is more than enough to give an app a chance.   I absolutely hate the new music app. I'm not paying for Apple Music, so I don't need that, I have a Twitter and Facebook so I really don't need or want the social media aspect, and if I use any type music radio it's Spotify, not iTunes Radio. It seems like Apple is trying to force a whole lot onto their users, and I for one don't like it. I like how the old app was customizable, how it didn't have all the shiny social media, even how it showed you the cover art of all your albums in landscape mode. Is there any way to get it back? I'll do anything.   Really? Good weed makes it impossible for me to read.   A man perhaps wanted a free ride to the wall.

After seeing a few of these comments, I'll do my best to keep this short.  1. It doesn't really give him any 'claim' in the sense that people will just accept him as their king, but it could give someone powerful a reason to put him in charge. Kind of like how Stanns wanted to put him in charge of Winterfell becuase he was a Stark.  2. Nah, they love the Starks. Even more so than that, they want any excuse to remove the Boltons of the world from power and put someone a little more sane in power. They would probably support his claim.  3. Howland Reed is the last living person from the Tower of Joy incident, he could prove R+L=J (assuming it's true). Bran can also see into the past through weirwood trees. Rhaegar and Lyanna supposedly got married in secret under a weirwood tree. How convenient...  4. I don't think it would be a thing like "You're a Targaryen/Stark, Jon" "Holy shit, I'm gonna go be king now", but I think he will leave the wall. I'm sure there will be some important, transformative event that leads to him leaving. He might even be forced to leave or something.  Fuck, there goes keeping it short.  **TL;DR: 1. He could still be a king/lord/in charge, 2. The locals love the Starks, 3. Howland and Bran could prove it, 4. He could leave lots of ways. He's forced to, GRRM finds a loophole in the Night's Watch oath, some big event, etc.**   Must be tough to pretend dragons are flying about when you're standing five feet away from a guy in a puffy green Northern Face vest.   Can you imagine cleaning the litter box aftet that thing?!   "Oh no! I let one go! I must grab it before it gets away!"   The very definition of National Treasure.

Take your age, add the time on the clock to it (2:43  2+4+3=9), subtract the number of items you have in your pocket, add number of letters in your last name, subtract the number of the day of the month it currently is and then multiply it by the number of people you're watching with. Then count down the list and watch that one. If you go over the list, start again from the top. Yes I know it's stupidly complicated, but simplicity is overrated.   Jesus that's troubling.   I like how your TL;DR is like half as long as the actual post.   His name was Nigel? Dead give away.   This is one of the single greatest fuck ups I have ever seen in all my time on Reddit. I thank you for your service, sir.   ...Why do we hate her again? Sorry, I think I fell off the band wagon a little.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought house Windsor was founded some time in the 1910's? And either way, is that to say I should be interested in a person because their ancestors were significant?   Thank you, French.   Why does anybody like the ryoal family? Completely serious question, I'd like to better understand it. I never got the appeal of following people like Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian who are famous for basically nothing. The royal family doesn't seem so much different in the sense that they don't really do much that has an interest or an impact on the everyday lives of the people following them. Serious answer please, why should people be interested in their lives?  EDIT: I'm prepared for the downvote train becuase I know people love the royal family, and I meant none of this in a derogatory way at all, but I'd appreciate a serious answer.   Worlds. Worst. Sleeper agent.   I don't get it, they all ended up the same way.   Ah, the classic 'New York Jets' logic.   I got fired a while ago, can I expect the naming rights on your next animal?   The realization will come in two weeks when it's relevance is gone.   Love crystal meth. Can't stand.   He already refused being heir to Winterfel because of his oaths.   Nights watch   I would honestly pay for that. What do you say, OP?   Go fetch the breast plate stretcher!   Okidoke, here we go:  **RIVAL SONS** You'll fucking love them. It's like the red neck reincarnation of Led Zeppelin, which as it turns out is better than it sounds. [Get Whats Coming] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDGtPOakEwM) is probably my favorite, give [Keep on Swinging] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ijOlAR3zs8) and [Open Your Eyes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnEZzLSPNZY) a chance too. I have a feeling you'll like this band.  **AUDIOSLAVE** Notice you didn't mention Audioslave...is that because you don't listen to them or don't like them? On the chance that you don't listen to them, allow myself to enlighten you. Audioslave is basically Rage Against the Machine except with Chris Cornell (who is a fucking incredible singer) instead of Zach Dela Rocha. It works sooo well. [Show Me How to Live] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVXIK1xCRpY), [I am the Highway] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy2ZUGc2mSs list=PLRam0XIF5Xatyny8TALt9KNuFfw592JtV), [Be Yourslef] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC5FdFlUcl0 index=2 list=PLRam0XIF5Xatyny8TALt9KNuFfw592JtV), etc. Tom Morello at his finest.  **WOLFMOTHER** Fuck yes, even talking about Wolfmother gets me pumped up. [Joker and the Theif] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySjXFjLTagQ). Stop reading this, just go listen. [Woman] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPNredrDO0), Andrew Stockdale is a god among men. Their entire last album ([New Crown] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7_foo7rE3k)) is awesome. Every time I mean to listen to like one or two songs on it I end up listening to the whole thing.  **UNWRITTEN LAW** I miss bands like this so much. A few are still around I guess, but they don't excite me. [She Says] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIDvDyro8VA list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j), [Up All Night] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azbzkeTHXKQ index=6 list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j), [Seein' Red] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq-T49MqRiQ list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j index=2) and my favorite, [Shoulda Known Better] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0JazftbEgk index=10 list=PLtrJ2FwdCr1j7e68RTpVHgoFZeQcsb94j). The singer could be better, but the song writing kinda makes up for it.  **INCUBUS** Prepare for the weirdly amazing sound that is Incubus. I don't really know how to describe their sound, just [listen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_xjBaXor0). Oddly awesome, right? Brandon Boyd has a cool voice that really fits the style perfectly. EX, [Wish You Were Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8295rOMvtQI). They're new stuff is pretty good too ([Absolution Calling] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTuAMlR3WuM)) although yes, I will admit, the music video absolutely sucks.  **THE HEAVY** Some people don't consider this 'rock', but I think the argument can be made. You've probably heard [How You Like Me Now?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTuAMlR3WuM), but they've got so much more left to offer. [Same Ol'] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OAkUelXoVY), [Coleen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jDAvcBgEOU), [What Makes A Good Man?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08h0IVs4RKQ), [Short Change Hero] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1QUZzeZoPQ), I'll stop myself. Awesome genre, regardless of what you consider it. Can't believe they're not more famous.  **HALESTORM** The only thing I miss more than classic harder rock bands, are female power singers. Luckily, we still have Halestorm. [Love Bites (So Do I)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmkHqUwa4zg) was one of my anthems back in the day (aprox. three years ago). I like the rawness behind it. [I Miss the Misery] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpJAmlnBxoA) (sorry, shit quality). They also have like two albums of covers that are pretty awesome. [Bad Romance] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vmhnxVF1GU). Give em' a shot.  **AFI** Mostly known just because [Miss Murder] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMxU2ToSunY list=PLDJpDK05PqjIWYyOSkH-Jc2lB1utgBF4q) was in Guitar Hero 3, but still a pretty solid band. I like that they were able to age over time without abandoning their roots. [Medicate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCwEBz3ego8) Not my favorite band in the world, but still has a place on my iPod. [I Hope You Suffer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSNyOYT3dJ8).  **BAD RELIGION** The epitome of punk rock! Aww, I miss these guys too. I mean they're still around, but they're an inconsistent band. For every ten songs they release, one is awesome. But that's okay considering they have like a 20 album discography. Even a Christmas album! They kind of remind me of a punk rock version of Green Day I guess, except more original. [American Jesus] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12kcpP-8jfM). [Los Angeles is Burning] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxoD9zWY9Rg) classic, gotta add it to the ol' playlist. [Infected] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik9ofiRTTQM) and [21st Century Digital Boy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN6kCgMUjFw).  **FRANZ FERDINAND** He has songs other than [Take Me Out] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijk4j-r7qPA)! Who knew?! Franzie Ferd has an undeniably awesome groove, even in his newer stuff. Kind of reminds me of a Strokes, Muse style. Kinda. [No You Girls] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25sBhhOR4lw list=PLcPgUEOw_nvBOpnGVRkdfUbTiw1B4cwx7) and [Twilight Omens] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hi-ENlLALU) are among those newer ones I was talking about.   EDIT: Shit I didn't see Audioslave. Oops.   Seor Drogo   Okay   There's still that whole problem with his little oath.   Wait, what? That would be a HUGE thing to miss.  EDIT: Someone please clarify.   Honestly, depending on how fast you read, you might not get there by next season.   Sassafras is tough, but the Giant Sequoia takes the cake.   One of the slightly weirder kids ran away at recess and climbed up a tree to evade the perusing principle. He also called the enormous 225 lbs+ principle a 'nigger'. The principal picked him up by the collar (feet off the ground) and carried him into his office. It wasn't a short walk. And I was later told that he broke one of the special kids electric wheel chairs with a fork. Yeah. Pretty much everything about him was an 'incident'.   Joking...   I'm not sure how legit this is, [I'm partially color blind] (http://i.imgur.com/fwLC1FF.jpg).   I hate to be the one to break it to you, but you got ripped off. Yup. That's nowhere near 1/4.

 Thank you my friend!       I was refering to leatherfaces mumbling lol               Well i would call peter pan fantasy, and if it can make some people relax to, its a win win :)                        glad you liked it :)            Thank you. Means a lot    Aww thank you. Might do another later. This was kind of improvised very quick after i saw the movie today :)     	22
 Of course what I **feel** doesn't change the actual law, I'm not trying to say that.  I'm simply pointing out how unenforceable the law is for anybody that's not trucking thousands of stolen milk crates off to a recycling facility.  I could have [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Buddeez-MC01016BLK-Crates-16-Quart-2-Pack/dp/B00I9VP9NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1423098979 sr=8-1 keywords=milk+crate) strapped to my bike, or I could have [one of these](http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mgnjv8-b781049432z.120130114213840000g4k1bvr1d.2.jpg) with, say, the warning worn completely off.  Further, there simply aren't enough resources to prosecute every offender with a stray milk crate laying about.   Facts are facts, I'm not arguing that.   I have however, spent the last hour researching the question, reading police forums and news articles and subreddits etc... I can't find one case where an officer has been willing to cite a person carrying a milk crate around, even with the warning label on it, without having first seen the person physically pick the crate off of some property.   I did see one kid who claimed to have found two milk crates on the side of a dumpster, pick them up and started walking home. The police stopped him, asked him where he got them, he explained and they took them, or something.     But we take out them, for example, we spent over $4.33 million last year on milk crates. And we can no longer just ignore that and absorb the cost. We have to go out and attempt to reclaim our crates.  And how the fuck does he intend to reasonably do that? By throwing college kids in jail? I have a milk crate that I inherited from a roommate years ago. It's so old and sun bleached that no lettering can be made out. I still use it to this day.   If I got pulled over on a routine traffic stop while moving and had that in my car, it seems ludicrous to me that that is a potential felony.    Yup   http://youtu.be/WNVHehtMsk4   I have evidence of meundies eating a cock meat sandwich.  Click here to check it out.   ~$90 bucks for 5 boxers seems insane to me. $60 for a hoodie is even more insane.  Thoughts?   No, that's, that'd be impossible, your cock can support your whole weight?    Has Jeff lost his mind?  Probably with all of the money he got paid to do the ad.    Good old romans 420   A fellow gully   The cool amaers do it. Bill Gates,  for one.   It's as if you're challenging the op for claiming that they had another brain and nobody else did.    Pardon your frannish, ya butt fucka   pickling is pretty damn easy, start small and if you end up going nuts over pickles you can work your way up.  Off the top of my head: a stock pot, couple of measuring utensils, food grade mason jars, a knife etc... Pickling spices and food to pickle.   Basic pickling procedure is to a) make a brine and b) ferment your vegetables in the brine.  Cleanliness is a must as fermentation can be conducive to mold etc if you don't clean everything with soap and hot hot hot water.  With this basic knowledge, I would suggest buying a pickling cookbook. I don't have a suggestion for you, and I would imagine that any one would do for you to start out with.  My personal favorite is pickled beets. I fucking love them.   Share things that are on your mind more frequently. Ideally,  sharing things that are conducive with the given outlet.    It is.   Oh awesome,  I didn't know that   I don't have a tablet, and I have an affinity for reading from paper.  I just printed out two articles to read because I'm super tired and sick of staring at my computer screen and just want to lay on my couch and read for a minute.  However, the print outs look awful. Search bars, comment boxes and submit buttons are all present. Navigation, archives and article contents are all stacked and have standard looking blue underlined hyperlink styles. All of this combined takes up two - three pages.  I know it's super simple to do, but I just realized that of all the websties I've made / contributed to in the past year, I don't think one of them describes even basic print styles.   Any opinions? Am I the only person under 40 who prints stuff from the internet?   I'm a little late to the game, but don't try to find specific moves or tricks.   Good dancing is like good sex: it requires rhythm and confidence.   If you aren't comfortable or enjoying yourself, then it's going to show as being awkward.   [trust fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QLg9bKPaxI) and [chicken chinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGJi5YpeBY)   Well, to be honest, there's not a whole lot that you can do.  My suggestion is to start realizing what looks good with thinning hair. You don't want to be the dude that's desperately hanging on to hair that he doesn't have.   I think the idea,  at the moment,  is that it's in  Google's best interest for the fastest internet connection.    I had a nightmare about this question last night.   uhh, yes.    OP probably just wants a more fundamental understanding. I think that I know CSS well, but every once and a while I read articles that help me understand how to do things more efficiently / give me new ideas to organize and write css.    This is why I'm so apprehensive of sharing anything I make here.   Still, I don't understand why you want to do this? Because you want to write javascript like you write C#?  If you want to potentially break other libraries that your code is running with, then sure, do it.  Or, you could just write a utility function instead.   Why was the link removed?   So am I doing it wrong by having "Porn" on my desktop?   Nice dodge.  You know exactly what he is saying. The fair and balanced approach to news is not the best approach all the time.    I took it as a joke.    Agreed. Been frustrated with the threads there.   But it seems like *everyone* on /r/programming hates node and wants it to fail.  Im not a node evangelist,  I just don't understand why everyone feels so strongly. Is it just because its a hip new language with a lot oh hype?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erl9k01C2M   In fact it does, on page 40.  Nothing in depth, but it's in there.    Boards can have a large impact on communities. Give this a listen if you have time:  http://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/534/a-not-so-simple-majority   So honest question for you /u/aars:  Are people in this field actually as dense and stubborn as this guy you're arguing with?   If so, I should just quit my cooking job right now and start applying for dev positions...     I agree with what you're saying, but in my city, I live within two blocks of two seven elevens and a subway that are 24 hours.  All of the grocery stores open at like 6 or 7am and are open til 11pm, except one (20 minutes walk, couple minutes drive) that's also open 24 hours.  There's even a few coffee shops and restaurants that are literally open all day everyday right near by.  A lot of places are like this, so it would be feasible.    Basically on the same schedule... I've found that as painful as it may be to wake up a few hours early, just making some coffee and walking around the block makes me feel better all day.   https://gist.github.com/fat/1f6da6b3bd0311a1f8a0   perfect?   speak for yourself there, guy.   eh, I'm assuming that this is in Buffalo. If an employer called me in during the state of emergency I'd simply say 'no'.   DOT and the higher ups were practically begging people not to leave the house.   It's not worth risking your shit for $11-14/hr...   Invalid how so? There are plenty of devs that use windows.  Just read what /u/brtt3000 said:  Windows is still huge, many serious devs and companies have workstations running it.  Look, a product launch can support whatever the fuck it wants to. But to say that asking for windows support is a bit much, *I think* is invalid. Windows still has huge market share, period. By excluding it, you exclude part of the community that actively develops with it.   I don't understand.     Also, the font.  sans-serif? What's the problem?     Let's assume we can make a ping pong ball out of feces.  This guy knows how to party!   spin gives the projectile greater accuracy over a greater distance.    This is the opposite of a shitty robot   Also bruising color.  Really awesome breakdown. You noting (or lack thereof) the smell made me smile.    Then don't do anything.  You said it yourself: you don't care. Live like a slob.   20 minutes a day.  Seriously,  in the time it took op to rationalize why they didnt need to do it, the desk couldve been cleaned.   This is really quite amazing. Are you a bodhisattva?   They are little brown mushrooms.  There are some people here that may be able to point you in a ballpark direction.   You could do spore prints, get excellent close ups of some gills, note the bruising color, describe the smell etc...  But without microscopy,  You may still be unable to determine what the mushroom is.    Are there tutorials for Amy of these thing s? I've tried to do this before and couldn't figure it out.    dude, I'm the same way.   RIght now I'm sitting around bored as shit thumbing through netflix. But I know tomorrow or the day after I'll be at it again for 6 hours straight      My line of defense has been outlined in a response /u/iolpiolp8 's translated opening statement.   Your Honor, this case is clear cut.   The charges are as follows:   1 charge of GRANDTHEFT.JPG 1 charge of Karma Whoring  The prosecutions defense is thus:  he definitely stole the picture above and tried to claim it as his own. The title is a dead giveaway. And I quote "Some soulless mother fucker put this sticker on the wall next to me at TPA Airport".  Yet, I see no admission of guilt and no direct claim of ownership.  After all, the burden of proof falls on the prosecutor to show **beyond all reasonable doubt** that the defendant has committed a crime.   And in no good conscience can we say that this defendent, beyond reasonable doubt, has made a claim that this picture is his own.   By the prosecutions line of reasoning, defendant /u/metalligod666 could have been in the very airport where this picture was taken. Knowing of the existence of the picture as has been posted on popular forums and subreddits, found it and reposted to reddit.  My client is guilty of the misdemeanor of reposting a picture to reddit. And if we were to attend to each and every one of these offenses, the courts would be bogged down for years.  I move that the charges of grandtheft.jpg be dropped as there is no definitive proof that my client has claimed the picture as his own.  We'll be willing to settle for one (1) charge of karma whoring, which entails a stern warming and nothing further.   This is the correct answer   Gt: gasoline_waltz  Ill be on at around 730 pst.  Im lvl 25 warlock voidwalker   You got it buddy   Your honor, I motion for this case to be dismissed on the grounds that the prosecutor has offered an incoherent argument and disguised it with foolish gibberish to mislead the courts.   hey bud don't take it too seriously... it's just a funny way to pass the time here.   If there are people fucking with you just report them.   */u/test_subject3702 walks into the courtroom sporting an overflowing briefcase and heavy bags underneath his eyes*  "I'm here to defend... uh.."  *glancing at a dogeared moleskine*  "/u/Metalligod666, sir--ahem-- your honor"   sweet getting on right now!   gt: gasoline_waltz  I'd like to grab some strange coins, any help would be greatly appreciated!   I agree, nobody should have fun or apply their knowledge ever.  Unless it's to start a kickstarted campaign.    He's proud of his knives.  Just like you're proud of your scrambled eggs.   Come work a double at my joint and leave looking like that.    I agree. I fucking love the game, but there has to be something else to do. Maybe I'm just overplaying it.   I haven't bitched once about this game. But sometimes the RNG is a bit ridiculous. I don't mind repeating the same strike three times in a row, or afking people or anything. But I did 6 strikes today and got jack shit for anything useful.   *edit* other than leveling the cryptarch and vanguard rep / marks.   I've had destiny for two weeks now. Playing up to 20 was awesome. And then grabbing gear to get to 22 was fun. Now I'm level 24, and I'm a bit confused as to what else to do. I've basically been running tiger strikes for the past two days, and doing some bounties. But once bounties are up it's either strikes or patrol, which get prettyy boring.  So is that it? Grind and grind to get the gear to do nightfall and vog?  Any suggestions? I kind of suck at pvp.    I would like to ask, does this matter anymore since the user has deleted the account? And if it does, are there screenshots of the threads presented as evidence before the account was deleted?  I'll be prosecutor either way.   IT'S PROBABLY FINE, JUST GO AFK AND YOU'LL GET AN EXOTIC OR SOME OTHER BULLSHIT   I'm a web developer and would love to work on something like this.    GT: gasoline_waltz. I have a ps3 and need strange coins as well! I don't have a mic yet. I'm lvl 22 warlock.I can only really play tomorrow as I have to work sat / sun. But I'm down to grind for the day.   Five people got into the whambulance after seeing your comment   I've seen them sun bleached to this color before. Also, rain and old age makes them fade.   It doesn't look quite like a  *Bondarzewia berkeleyi* because the caps don't seem thin enough.  It looks like an old chicken of the woods, http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetiporus    I'm hoping that some day I can find some chanterelles and get them ID'd without this subreddit getting all fingerwaggling and jerky about it.  Just keep at it. I would suggest finding a local meetup / club where you'd be able to learn more about IDing and hunting.    Ah yes, riding the age old kc karma boat. I can't wait to find the post complaining about how unsanitary this looks.   Quick, edit yours so you can double up. In five hours, you could have a whopping 50 internet points at your disposal.    I'm not sure if it's an influx of new people to this sub or what. I've noticed a couple of these mildly dismissive, sometimes snarky responses popping up in the past few weeks.  Granted, I'm not a huge fan of "WHAT IS THIS? CAN I EAT THIS?" posts. But I'm also not a fan of "Don't ask if you don't know!" types of responses.  This is legit one of the few subreddits that keeps me coming back to reddit. I really like the community here.   I feel like answering someone's ID request in such a way is unfriendly, and a cop out. Even if you can't make out / do not have the skill to make a complete identification, the least you can do is say something along the lines of:  *looks like what you've got there is a [boletus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus). Take more / better pictures and do a spore print for better help on identification. Also remember that it's highly suggested that you be 100% sure of you edible identification before you eat it.*   Yeah they're chickens.  I'm incredibly jealous   Great print!    No idea why you got down voted, that's pretty funny  	85
 Yes and mostly fix them as well. Only really touch macs when i have a friend needing help.   Love Modern Marvels though.   Still is awesome to look at.   I like him, hope he can get better with experience.   Right?   I do the same, fun to see what the other teams subs are saying.    I kinda feel bad for Bettis.   Guessing you are visiting from /r/ColoradoRockies?  Rangers fans were doing the samething a few days ago.   Scary as in amazing.   I walk away to warm up some ribs and come back to 5 more runs...   I love snipping tool   That ball looked sexy coming of that bat, sound made it even better.  GJ Pujols   Hopefully we still have hits in us after Texas.  Edit - Apparently we do.   Actually scary how fast the FP can change on /r/all when something huge happens.   I might deal with a mac every couple years or so, why i would never remember.   If you want to see more women's sporting events mainstream, call your TV provider and tell them. They might not think the demand is there, because they haven't been told by enough of their customers.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOBoKxEcVAA   AWD will always be faster off the line than RWD. You would need wide drag tires to get the same off the line performance with RWD.   Hydroplaning can happen to any car if the water is deep enough and driving fast enough.   Will never remember that the next time i need to ss on a mac.   Don't believe he was trying to defend OP. Just letting everyone know how much it costs to charge an electric vehicle.    It was kind of a full body seizure. As soon as i found him it took several minutes of petting and talking to him to get him to stop. Had a very thick drool both times. After he seemed very riled up for 5 - 10 minutes.   Just scary because at of all the cats i have had, he is the first one to have seizures.   One of my best cats was all black. He was probably the sweetest cat i've ever had.   Dodge on the other hand has always been a beggar in the kitchen. Always gets what you wants, instead of his insulin shots which he hates me for.  Hates me even more for the blood sugar tests on his ears.   Has anyone experienced it and what should i look out for?  edit - Should add that he has been to the vet several times and only once because of a seizure. They did a blood test and found nothing abnormal.                     How thick do you cut it that it only take 4 hours?   I do it on a smoker.    What movie is this?

Did some searching because i have damaged some plastics with it before. I have used it in car audio for years to clean glue and stains from carpets.   Found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1xurvh/ipad_cleaned_with_acetone/cfex21o) that explains which plastics are vulnerable to acetone.   Acetone is great at dissolving common domestic polymers like polystyrene, polyethylene, PET etc, alcohols are pretty crappy at it. Acetone is also more likely to swell even specialized polymers  Also found [this on another forum](http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?70,84367,85439#msg-85439) that says it will dissolve acrylic which your counter top was most likely made of.  Hopefully someone that knows chemistry can explain why.  edit - because i accidently hit enter    but i'm le tired.   Some plastics it will damage, but not all.    Acetone.  Edit - Should mention some plastics it should not be used on.   Even could have been posted at the entrance of the building.   Don't know why you are getting downvoted.

Maybe if you had any reading comprehension you would understand that my first comment was never saying anything about hulu.   Yes your comment that i first replied to was about sitting through 30 second commercials was no big deal. My reply was stating that i have sat through so many commercials in my lifetime, i will do the most i can to avoid them completely. Had nothing to do with hulu.  You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu, you watch 18 minutes of ads on cable.   I never said anything about watching hulu.  Honestly, big deal. Perhaps many of you are younger, but if you told me 20 years ago that I could watch practically any show I wanted at my command for practically nothing ($8/month is nothing), and all I had to put up with was a few commercials, I'd have shit myself. It's not hard to put it on mute for 30 seconds. Seriously, there's worse things that could happen to you in life than having to endure a short ad.  You never even mention hulu in the comment i replied to. You could have been speaking of any streaming service. That's why i pay $11 a month for netflix. I don't ever want to see a commercial unless i absolutely have to.   You dug back 4 days just to get this last word in?   I never downvoted him. I knew how it would turn out.   I'm going to wake up in the morning and it was just a dream.   You know another team sucks when Cron gets a HR.   I actually find it fascinating how some people die.

You won't have life at the bottom like plants where all the chemicals settle.   This is a problem associated with every delta in the world. It's just worst because the Mississippi river basin covers 47% of the continent of the US.  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071020090707.htm  Maybe if you actually learn how ecosystems worked, i wouldn't have to sit "behind a keyboard and googling shit."   If you are asking about the [dead zone source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_\(ecology\)#Gulf_of_Mexico_.27Dead_Zone.27).   Your right. Most of the area around the Mississippi delta is pretty much dead. There is a ton of shit that comes down that river like pesticides/fertilizer used in agriculture that has killed a vast area of life around the delta.  Edit to add sources  http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/dead-zone/?ar_a=1  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)  The area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico [13] is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.[14] The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, "seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin."[15] which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year.[15]  Edit - Should point out i'm not arguing the spill itself, but that the dead zone exists.   and Cali   Without video evidence it would be hard to say.

Depends on what and how you burn them i suppose.  Not all countries can provide clean ways of burning fossil fuels. Greece still provides 50% of their power by burning lignite which is probably the lowest form of carbon content. They would have to burn way more than a plant burning coal.    Which is funny because most of the power to charge them comes from burning fossil fuels.   so many yankee fans there   Isn't the butcher Dexter's brother?   ah thanks, just started hanging out here during games.    what is with the rally spider thing?

You would think they actually paid you for actually having to put an effort into pushing a button on/off next to your TV.   Not that hard to make.   You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu  Did i say anything about hulu?  I hardly ever watch TV, only live tv i watch is pretty much sports.   How do you think the content creators fund their projects?  No shit sherlock  If i like something i will actually buy the DVDs instead of sit through even a few 30 seconds commercials on hulu.  I will wait months to watch something on netflix instead of seeing it the day after it airs even with a few commercials.     I'm not young and i think i've gave to much of my life to advertisers already.  A one hour show is only about 42 minutes of actual content. 18 minutes of ads is way too much and usually they are the same commercials repeated.

In CA is illegal for them to expire unless they were given out for a promotion or to employees.  Most gift certificates and gift cards sold by retail sellers for use with the seller and its affiliates cannot contain an expiration date or a service fee, including a fee for dormancy.  and is pretty much considered legal tender, since it basically is a pre-paid credit card.  Any gift certificate sold after January 1, 1997, is redeemable in cash for its cash value, or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.4 Effective January 1, 2008, any gift certificate with a cash value of less than $10 is redeemable in cash, which includes currency or check, for its cash value.  http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/s-11.shtml   In 2009, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, which set consumer protections for gift cards based on many state laws. The law provides that gift cards cannot expire within five years from the date they were activated and generally limits inactivity fee on gift cards except in certain circumstances, such as if there has been no transaction for at least 12 months. The federal law creates a floor for regulation and leaves room for state regulation on redeeming gift cards for cash and unclaimed property provisions.  http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/gift-cards-and-certificates-statutes-and-legis.aspx  ah 5 year limit, just noticed OP's was issued in 2013.

Times that by 60 for an hour, times that by 24 for a day ( most plastic factories run 24/7 due to the fact that the injectors would fill with hard plastic if left off over night ) then times that by about 365 gives you about 134 million bricks. Now I say 8 years cause there is down time for maintainiance and colour changes. If anyone has a better time frame I would like to know what you think.

             There is a new Inoreader update on the Google Play.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innologica.inoreader hl=en  PS: It crashes a lot for me. Reported back [here](http://forum.inoreader.com/index.php?/topic/534-android-client/?p=20446).                                          Users are sharing some very useful IFTTT recipes on Twitter which takes advantage of the IFTTT integration. You may find them [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23inoreaderIFTTT src=typd vertical=default f=tweets) (and of course you may subscribe to that Twitter search via Inoreader ;)).  [More info here](http://blog.inoreader.com/2015/06/supercharge-your-inoreader-with-ifttt.html).   The official forums are still the best way to get official support, this subreddit doesn't have to replace anything. It can be a place for discussions. /r/inoreader deserved a fresh start, it's up to the community to take advantage of it :).   * Mississippi Burning * Interstellar * Goodfellas * Dallas Buyers Club * Life of Pi * Downfall * 25th Hour         I'm here to announce that /r/Inoreader is diving into a new era!  Since the previous moderator had no further interest on Inoreader or /r/inoreader, i decided that this service deserves a better Reddit community. So, i asked him to add me as a moderator, he kindly agreed, de-modded himself and trusted the future of this subreddit in my hands. :)  But who am i?  This is test_subject3791. I'm a tech journalist and a big supporter of RSS as the best way to get, manage and curate my favorite content. After Google Reader shutdown and a lot of researching, testing and subscribing, i ended up using Inoreader everyday, for the past two years. I even translated the project in my native language.  So, to clear it up and to keep it transparent: **i'm not an employee of Inoreader and i make no profit from it**. I'm just a user of this service who thinks that Inoreader is the best RSS feed reader available right now and that it has a great potential to develop even further. **This is not a subreddit to support a company. This is a subreddit to support the users of a service that promotes and takes advantage of RSS** (Real Simple Syndication), a format for delivering regularly changing web content. I want /r/Inoreader to become an unofficial community for Inoreader, even with the participation of Inoreader's developers (since they are able to provide official technical support).  Keep it up and welcome back!  **EDIT**: Just updated the stylesheet :).

 I particularly disagree with the breaking the illusion - watch the space battle from RotJ, probably one of the best I've seen. I do agree that the prequel fights were more seamless   SPAAACCEE COOOPPP!!   It's gonna come down to Justice League Part 2 and Infinity War Part 2 coming in the same year.   Which is not a bad thing   I think Liberals are just as much against ISIS as everyone else   I thought Part II was the most exciting of the whole trilogy...   What cringey moments are there in The Empire Strikes Back?    That's similar to how I felt about Whiplash - I really enjoyed it, I thought it was well written, and great performances were given, but it's pretty one-dimensional when you think about it. Not much to interpret or reflect on, everything it's trying to say is just *there*, given to you.   But the cinematography is supposed to resemble a stage play   But *he's* usually fine in those movies, even if the movies themselves are not. He is good at giving a fun charismatic performance.   First of all, the reveal is at the end of Empire, not in the middle.  And I think you're forgetting that we know Anakin impregnated Padme in Revenge of the Sith, and Padme later gives birth to Luke. We also see Anakin become Vader.   The art ones that were released at Star Wars Celebration   I think that particular part (space battles) can be very challenging and expensive, I think they'd rather use CGI for it.

Fucking Zack.   QUALITY POST RIGHT HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN   There's no depth to any of the characters really, mostly due to the fact that Nolan likes to put action and visuals above actors a lot of the time. The only reason Ledger was good is because he's already a pretty good performer.    an unpopular *opinion*  That is a fact, my friend.   Anything's silly if you describe it like that, those things work in the Star Wars universe.   The Godfather Part III isn't bad at all (minus Sofia Coppola), they're just not as good as the first 2.   The civil rights novelty? What is that supposed to mean?   That could be cool   What's with 3PO having red on the left and the First Order TIE also having red on the left? Almost the same shade, too.   I think it depends if you bought it or if someone loaned it to you    Chunky mayonnaise with stale Goldfish crackers?   I can tell things are gonna get *weird* once that movie comes out....   Get some of the "making of" books for Episodes 1 and 2 - you can see that there really is a lot of effort put into sets and miniatures, along with things like the design of costumes and ships.  People act like no one actually tried on these movies, when that's really not true to any extent.   You know that Sony products have been in Bond movies since the 60's, right?   So when someone doesn't like a movie that /r/movies likes, we downvote it, but when someone doesn't like a movie that /r/movies *doesn't* like, we upvote it?   But why wouldn't a car company sponsor all the vehicles in an amusement park? You act like there's *not* a Starbucks on every block in real life.

But keep in mind that JJ didn't write those   Well, from what we've seen so far    None of those things are actually true though    So is basically every other Star Wars character, if you think about it - it takes time to get to know the person, and eventually you'll get used to it.   [uj] But you still can't deny that this movie will be great [rj]   It's possible that they could've written that in after Ridley was cast - they could also have it as a reveal in VIII or IX   Anything to keep this sub from overflowing with fake leaks   He's a director, of a lot of mainstream movies I'm sure you've heard of.

They are if they're getting a lot of views and making money from it   [uj/] Hey, I was the one who responded to him, and I post here pretty frequently - I was just giving him a reason as to why it was on the front page, and he was sorta being an asshole about it [uj]   So if the *same shot* was filmed by a different director you would've rolled your eyes? Why??   Well what else would they be showing? Special look is pretty vague, and we know there's not gonna be a trailer or footage - it's probably gonna be exactly what you expect. Nothing that groundbreaking or exciting.   That's the panel   "I wanted cake!"      I think Spielberg wants to stay far away from those Jaws sequels    To see the trailer, I meant - I have the app and everything already   Realistically, he would end up directing Indy 5 with Chris Pratt, if that ever happens    Why would they go from a flat logo to a glossy one? That's the opposite of what most companies are doing.   Oh yeah, all 20 million of them? Makes sense.    Looks a little like a custom, but probably real.   Probably.   Yeah, it's that part im worried about   Ugh. Does that mean I also have to register with a Disney account? I hope not....   Thanks a bunch!   Can you put up my SDCC bingo?  http://imgur.com/cJBVoVb   Yeah but that's the name of the Star Wars alphabet   I think it might be to late, from what I've heard.   Check where?   Me too...   I looked around a little, but I couldn't find anything unfortunately.   No it doesn't - that would be like saying there was too much news coverage about 9/11 on 9/14   Beating a dead horse that's only 8 days old?    I think the part you actually need to scan is cut out of that picture.   Posting their video is a circlejerky thing? It's funny and it relates to this subreddit.   Me too. Did you hear the dialogue it had (the Stormtrooper)?   "This December" was in the last trailer, I don't know why *that* would clue you into to this description being fake.   Yoda disappeared when he died in Return of the Jedi. Anakin did when Luke burned the Darth Vader suit in that same movie.   I *really* doubt it. For one thing, he's too old to be playing a young (15-25 year old) Han. Secondly, he looks very little like Harrison Ford, and doesn't sound remotely like him either. The people at Disney are smart, and I think they are well aware of the fact that this choice will be heavily scrutinized, so I would expect them to cast an unknown actor who has the same mannerisms as Ford.    But I doubt the source is Lucasfilm, or else it would've been published as official news from them.   YOULL NO LONGR FEAR THE DARK SIDE!!!!!!,;$!!!   http://imgur.com/8CbPxWs  That?   "Star Wars Sequel Trilogy"  I need ratings, plot synopsizes, titles, whatever I can get   That sounds pretty good to me    I'm not staying up late just for that, and I don't know why you would either, especially considering you just called him an asshole.  	109
 Have yet to see anyone mention SJW's, particularly the young, entitled, bratty ones (wait, that's all of them) who pollute the internet and youtube and Tumblr, who clearly just finished their first woman's study and race relations class, yet totally lack in life experience and character and adversity (as they clearly don't understand that adversity and conflict shapes us and helps us grow), and it's all so totally obvious and cringe-worthy how ignorant and herd-like they are as they film their trite videos from their rich-ass parent's beautiful house.  Yeah... total assholes.   Dude, fuck me too! Did you know that if you layer wings for marie parts 1 and 2, A Perfect Circle's 13th Step, and Puscifer on top of Lateralus, and their upcoming album set to drop in 2051, it creates a super secret song?  Dude...  you just don't understand Maynard like I do.   Yes, I know you know because you have seen the other side.  Thank god we will come to once we have dissolved back into the mud!   Edit:  You sound like a first year philosophy student, but I could be wrong ;)  That being said, fuck those other 'same goops' who don't use their turn signals!   You sure you can do it without crossing over to the dark-side of douche baggery, projection, hypocricy, and moral superiority?  :D   Yeah, groups are just a social construct!   You park in two spaces most places you go, forgot that turn signals exist, and you drive around like you're the only dickhead on the road?   Yeah.  "Groups" are just a social construct, and they don't occur in nature or society...oh wait :D   That's total jody talk bro!  Just kidding.  I'm totally with you.  I totally respect the fuck our of our bloated military budget, and our massive war machinery (and I mean that, no sarcasm.  I'd rather it be someone else than us), but for the dudes who sign up for the job, keep that in mind - you are being paid to do a job, and whether you go overseas or not, you are not a goddamn martyr.  Let people respect you and your posititon for what they are - you don't have to rub it in their face in aggressive manners as if you are somehow better than the other worker bees around you.   Totally.  Those fuckers are so annoying :D   I'd tell you, but you've probably never heard of them anyway...   Should we help him?  Naw, get your phone so we can film him dying...   Whoa, way to use dude as a shield.  What a piece of shit!   If she wasn't a collage girl before, she is definitely a collage girl now.   Sweet!  New Hat!  (holy hell, I'm sorry, oh dear lord Satan...)   The title reminds me of something out of Futurama...   Whoa....   I'm sorry, but this is the only video on here I ever watched that made me laugh... it's just, so ridiculous  :(   Sad, for sure, but I'm still on the fence about kids dying being somehow worse or more sad than adults dying.  Adults actually have responsibilities, and often are more directly contributing to the world, and they often have families and earning potential and etc, or if they are geniuses, it really is a tragedy when they die, because they possibly had the power, ability, and intelligence to make positive changes in the world, whereas kids don't directly contribute to society, and they get to die not having to know how truly fucking terrifying yet mundane life on this god-forsaken rock can be (aside cases of extreme abuse, or examples where parents brutalize and then kill their kids, etc).  I mean, I know people are more emotionally affected by children's deaths, but beyond that, is there a solid reason/argument to truly back up that it is somehow more sad?  Sure, we can say they died before they could develop and live up to their potential, but I'd just counter that again with, "well, at least they got to die when life was still simple and fun."  Anyone care to try to sway me either way?   Uuuh, what the hell does that poor translation mean?  I am trying to understand what happened and is going on, but the flip flops behind that dude's mangled head is throwing me off...   Most of those assholes got exactly what they courted, but still, the way those bodies fly is goddamn freaky!   Women and their shoes...   She went down quicker than Irwin in a whole tankful of stingrays!   The great mysteries of life :/   Zoom zoom!   What a great way to go.  Buncha ass-holes more interested in filming you than helping you as your brain-matter splatters everywhere as they flop you around on the ground.  The point is, wear a fucking helmet!   Was a great show at first, but it got so bad/ridiculous by the end of it :/   Wheeeee!   Wait.  Why did the one person on the motorcycle crash into them?  And how did the cops even know what was going on?  There were no cops behind them as far as I could tell, so how did they decide to come up and just start shooting everybody?   I don't remember mentioning anything about the wheel and its scaling, but the last thing Ludwig's needs is to scale off of Arcane on top of STR and/or SKL, as Ludwig's is by far the easiest weapon to ramp up the damage and make OP, even with a lower quality build, and even with sub-par gems :D   Yeah, they become more challenging, and I actually personally enjoy the depth 4-5 story dungeons quite a bit, at least more than how boring and easy the first few dungeons are.  And occasionally I do really enjoy exploring some of the odd and more challenging randomly generated depth 5 dungeons :D   Bone in turkey leg?   I always think of him as "Game Of Thrones Louis CK"   Drake?  Or they could find music that doesn't suck :P   In all seriousness though, heart-ache is some real shit.  Instead of trying to drink yourself silly, maybe you should let yourself feel the heart-ache, and process it, and deal with it, instead of trying to numb the pain and run away from it?  That shit takes time.  Three years isn't going to vanish in one night, or one week, or one month, and probably even a year or two, and a few gallons of vodka and a buncha boxes of doughnuts won't change that either.  Just keep in mind, she said that she wasn't in love with you, not that *you are unlovable* or *unworthy of other people's love,* just not her love.  People grow apart, people fall in and out of love, so the actual break-up often takes the other person by surprise, but it can and does happen, and nothing is forever, even if it is promised and especially if it is expected.  And in time, maybe you should see a therapist, or talk to some people you know and trust.  Wish ya the best.    Seriously.  Who the fuck keeps tomatoes in a jar?   I though it was usually because the people who failed to merge and waited till the last minute were lazy and not paying attention and now fuck everybody else because they need to cut someone off... that's why I assume most people don't want to have some asshole cut them off at last minute (not to give OP a pass on his douche baggery).   VRUMMM VRUUUM!  Organ donor douche bag calling card!  :P  Just fuckin around.  Glad you're alright man, you sound like an alright dude.  Funny that a lot of people have that awareness/perception/opinion that Mustangs are the calling card of the douche bags, but I find BMW Drivers to be some of the shittiest, dumbest, most selfishly douchey motherfuckers out there on the road.... and there are endless droves of them here in California :(   fag no pert begs!   no pert beging u faget!   Is accomplishment the right word for it?  Gamers like to challenge themselves, and I know there are trophies and other odds and ends for whatever reasons, but I'm pretty sure most gamers don't pick up games (entertainment) just for the trophy aspect of it, and they don't set out consciously thinking, 'I am going to accomplish a lot in this game.'   Oh, I dodge bone marrow ash to be sure.  That shit hurts.  Now I just need to practice my *break-distance/circle strafe to the left with shield up* for all the rest of the gun spammers.  Sounds thrilling.  Thanks again :D   Love the monster theme dude.  Keep it up.  Would love to see what you put together in time.  And I also love how people are so quick to interject their asinine opinions when it comes to tattoos and what people should or shouldn't have done to their body.  I love seeing more original or different art work, as opposed to the same lame ass japanese koi/lotus/samarui/cheetah print/swallows/anchors/stars/skulls that every person with no imagination comes up with :D    Ha.  I still love all my work.  I loved them a lifetime ago when I got them, and I love them to this day.   What would you rather he collect?  What would make YOU happy, since this is about you and your opinion.  Maybe some birds, or a skull, or an anchor, or how about some stars?  Some stars would be really wicked cool and original.  Oh, I know.  He could get a koi fish, or some other lame ass shit that people get tatted with all the time.  Stop the douche-baggery.   Heya.  So in the meantime, just use the best damage gems you can find, but once you're in a place to farm the depth 5 root chalice gyphs, check out this guide (there are plenty of other good ones out there too):   http://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/32gbr1/how_to_farm_the_best_blood_gems/   Just keep in mind you don't need to make chalice dungeons with your own materials for every dungeon you want to explore.  All you have to do is make a Fetid/Rotten/Cursed dungeon of one type (I always use the pthumeru ihyll root chalice, with all rites), and that will give you access to every chalice glyph out there.  Good hunting to you  o/     What level are you?  And what are your stats so far(ie, 50 vit, 25 end, 50 SKL?)?  Also, do you plan on doing much co-op and PvP?  If so, you'd want to cap your blood level around 100-125 ( or even 150) for best results for match making.   Cool.  Didn't have time to PvP last night, but I tested it on some mobs.  Most shots seemed to take up half my endurance, and still do a chunk of damage to my health.  Offhand, do you know how much evelyn's typically do in terms of damage when you block?  Thanks.  I'll have time to test it in actual PvP tonight.     Not sure about the cane, as I am not a big fan of it myself. If it has a triangle slot, Then I'd say shoot for the best physical gems you can put into it (27% radials) and a 27% triangle. If it has a waning slot, the best you can put in is a bit lower, at like 23%ish, but apparently there are ultra rare +28% damage waning gems, but I and most other people I know have never found one in many hours of game play on many different characters.    It's still easy to find dedicated PvP in a number of places, but what we are missing is a no-health-penalty dueling sort bell or arena (among other things, like worthwhile covenants, a multi-player system that doesn't suck and take so long, etc).    I was happy to see that they gave invaders (ie, griefing pve players) a run for their money in te base game pre patch 1.04, ie, stacking odds against the invader (as previous games often favored invaders, especially since they were built for PvP) but I was bummed that invasion areas are so limited   The level range thing is a stretch, but not everyone coordinates with passwords to summon super high level players,  and I am all for letting people have fun how they want to, but still :/   For any and all root variations of F/R/C you only ever need to generate one yourself (so long as you have the prerequisite root chalices in your inventory), and that is to create a F\R\C\ pthumerian Ihyll root chalice. Once you create that one dungeon with all offerings using your own materials, you will then have access to all available chalice glyphs out there.   Don't waste your chalice materials making one dungeon for each glyph you want to try. Just create the one I mentioned, and enjoy :)   Sure.  Have you aleady cleared the main story line chalices and obtained all the root chalices and so forth?     Don't have the info off-hand at the moment, but there are a few fairly easy dungeons to farm for all the best or most of the best gems you could need or want, from the 27% physical gems to the +% phys and flat arcane gems.  Most involve repeatedly farming the first layer bosses, or one of the nearby enemies.  Will drop you a line later with more info and some links if you can't find it in the mean-time.   I know.  You can use any button (as opposed to old DaS methods of bumpers) in Bloodborne to lessen the damage and all that, but the grab, the attack, the hunter slumping to the ground, and the stand up animations take far too fucking long, for such a fast paced game.  It's not even exciting or frightening (like being chomped on by a mimic) or that damaging.  It's boring and it slows the action down to zero.    Yeah, those frame drops fucking suck, and her shrill screach makes me want to destroy my speakers and stick screw-drivers into my ear drums    Oh god!  They were so terrible and frightening and confusing to fight for the first time.  And their sack full of dead hookers stunk :c   Camera is a cheap ass!  They totally just copied/pasted him back from DeS!  Lazy FROM    Hate it when they slurp the insight out of my ass :c   Any enemy and their stupid twenty-two minute-long grab/attack animation, where my hunter then takes a nap, and is finally able to wake up and fight again.  Seriously, brain-suckers and their stupid-ass magic/grab spam can fuck off and die, and whoever created those enemies needs to be fired and commit soduko!     Whenever my hunter is grabbed by a brain sucker or snake man or garden of eyes, I go outside for a smoke, take a dump, watch the news, make dinner, and then I usually get back just in time as the brainsucker is done sucking out my insight, and then my character lays down for a nap, and is ready to finally stand back up and continue the fight :D   Edit: worth noting, I don't think there are enough spider-summoning bell maidens in game, and they should always come in quadruplets.  Two isn't enough.   Yes.  Even with high skill, the BB has a low base physical damage (lower than saw spear and saw cleaver even at +10), but it attacks fast, and the 2h movesets don't take as much stamina as the other heavy weapons (ie, standard R1 = 28 on BB, vs 36 on LHB).  If you only buff the physical portion of the damage via gems, you are only buffing one portion of it's damage, and 27% (even x3) of its base damage isn't that much :D   Eh, it's hit and miss.  Sometimes I am doing the shredding, and other times they are doing the shredding.  There usually isn't much of a chance to back off and be defensive, as most fights can and do end in two or three quick R1's or a good follow up or quick combo, and even then, most people will just start shooting or throwing knives, so I've seldom found that to be of much use (at least in wider and more open areas). :D   Yes, the standard BoM has the best slots for this, two radials and a triangle.   I don't know why it's there, I was just mentioning how to best use what is there :D   The burial blade has one of the lowest base physical damage values at +10, lower than even the saw cleaver and the saw spear.  If you stick pure physical gems on it, you still won't get as much out of it as buffing both physical and arcane damage.  Plus, both the one hand and even the two handed versions of the weapon attack pretty damn fast, and don't use up as much stamina as other larger weapons, leaving you room for multiple combos and hits.   Yeah.  I like the unlocked BB, so maybe I need to get a handle on the unlocked LHB, but speaking of the 20 second meta, 27% gems might be a bit much... :P   I just responded to your other post.  Not sure if BB/BoM are meant for full arcane builds, as I'm pretty sure the arcane blood gem stones don't convert the damage of it properly or fully, no?  Also, the scaling with arcane is terrible (ie, the D in STR scaling on a +10 BB will give you more AR than the B in ARC).  Point is, if you try to just boost the physical, or just the arcane, you are gimping the weapon.  As they both hit fast and quick, and the best gems for them are the *+physical % with +flat arcane damage* as they boost both types of damage, and will raise your AR much higher than pure SKL, pure ARC, a split, or either pure phys or arc blood gems.   Nope.  You definiately don't need or want too much arcane (unless you want to use hunter's tools, or don't care about meta levels) for the BoM/BB, as the scaling from ARC is miniscule compared to how the split damage works as a whole.  You'll only get a few AR out of investing precious levels into arcane.  The pure physical gems are lacking for BoM/BB as well, because you are only increasing one side of the damage, which has a lower base value in the first place.  The gems you want are the ones that have both +physical % damage and +flat arcane damage.  That is how you get your BB to 650-750 AR, and your BoMs to 400-500 AR, but what sucks is, compared to other weapons that are easier to make OP early in the game, you'll need an Uncanny Burial Blade (for triangle slot), so don't waste your chunks/blood rocks on the regular BB if you can help it.  Also, you'll need to get access to the depth 5 cursed dungeons to get the best phys/flat arcane gems available in both radial and triangle form, and these are used for both the BoM and the Uncanny BB.  In the mean time, if you find that your weapons are too weak, you could always get a LHB, as it scales great with SKL and STR, and it is easy to raise the AR on it with a few decent gems, and it might outdamage what you are using now, but again, LHB like the BB is best in its uncanny version for the triangle slot.  Hope this helps!    Edit:  IIRC, you can at least get some +7-8%/ +30-35 flat arcane damage gems somewhere in the chalices or main game (to tide you over until you can get the 8-9%/+60-70 gems), but I don't remember where they came from :/   Probably the whole DaS *"shit we ran out of development time, so just copy/pastra capra and taurus demons and we'll make due"* sort of things :/   Totally.  If I want to randomly genocide a whole city/town/area, I should be able to, and to hell with whoever is trying to fend me, the foreign invader, off :D   Pretty much the same as DaS.  Dude handed us his vague ass quest (though he subtly hinted about 'keeping the torch lit'), and then the chosen undead turns total asshole, killing everything that was content to sit there and drool for eternity until we came along and killed it.   LOL   Perception is not synonymous with IQ.  Schizophrenic people of all ranges of intelligence see all sorts of things we can't see, after all.   Emotional intelligence is not synonymous with IQ either.   I mean, there are many facets to intelligence, so it depends.  And no, I don't mean this from the angle of "street smarts vs. book smarts," as I've known too many 'street smart' people who just used it as an excuse for their stupidity.  Sure, there can be some truth there, but mostly I've seen dumb people use it to rationalize their own ineptness ;)   I enjoyed the main story line areas for the most part.  I think the chalices could have been better designed, as slogging through them felt boring and uninspired at times :/   Don't worry, the challenge will ramp up soon enough :D   But I agree.  Going through the first few chalices (as I did on my first toon) at a higher level is boring as shit   Ah. I forgot about the shield. How much endurance does it take to block bullets from say Evelyn, or a shotgun like the blunderbuss or Ludwig's rifle?   To be clear, i am talking strictly PvP. That being said, i dont think ive encountered anyone in the reddit dungeon who doesnt have high or the highest level gems, hence the 2-3 shot meta, and smaller weapons can sill be 3 shot metas easily, but most transformed weapons with the higher gems can kill in two or three shots at the 100-120 meta, and I use it and encounter in almost every PvP match. But hzngr is mostly chikevlyn builds in my experience, so I find myself playing more in nightmare frontier.    In terms of rounding out the builds that exist, I am fine with that, as a few more AR even on quality weapons will still kill you in the same number of hits. There will be no difference in a 400 vs 500 hubter's axe killing you in 3 hits, or a 700 vs 800 LHB killing you in 2 hits, or a 500 vs 600 chikage killing you in 2 hits (after they've spammed a clip of bullets at you), but at higher levels, you at least have more defence, hopefully more vitality, and all around more EHP.    Now couple that beyond the souls game mind-set for PvP, and lets have some matches that last longer than the wait period in between them, and what we are really missing is dueling bells or an arena or some way to get rid of the stupid debuff for dedicated PvP fights (vs griefing hosts, which I am fine that the invader can be at a disadvantage).    You're still missing the cool sound effects, and I still enjoy the BB (unlocked) ;) (Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP, and I wonder if it would be a good counter to chikage?)   And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users.  I think I've seen more wheel users, which are rare enough as is, than LHB :(    edit:  unlocked BB*   I still prefer unlocked BB ;)  (Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP)   And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users :(    I still prefer unlocked BB ;)  (Though to be fair, I haven't used LHB much in PvP)   And for every 10 Chikevelyn users I see, I see 0 LHB users :(    Yes, but the equivelant of havel-butt-mage is bullet spam, and some people would rather spam all their bullets away than play the game.  That shit gets old, and it really is the magic spam of this game.  Rarely do I have the patience to wait it out, and that's on me.  Sure, it's a valid way to play the game in the way you want, I just think it's cheesy and boring as fuck -_-   That being said, while I think the PvP is fun in this game, it is also lacking and a step backwards imo, and the 20 second/2-shot meta (between the 2 minute waiting times) kinda sucks.  Gonna back up my toons soon and try the 150 meta for a bit :D   But it's a given that LHB is easy to make OP :P  With the damage you listed, I'm guessing that's around 50/50?  Or 50/30? or 40/40?  Or some higher end quality build?  But what the BB lacks in ridiculous damage (as LHB takes the cake in all buikds/fields), it makes up for in finesse and style and cool sound effects. ;)   Also worth noting, as strong as it is for PvE, I hardly see LHB in PvP    Scummiest setup? There are like, four or five builds in this game, but I really do hate people who spam shotguns from max range, effectively rooting themselves and flinching me...for no reason, and I do hate eveylyn spammers too, but I digress :P   Honestly,  between the limited weapon options and lack of builds, I don't find this game's gestures to be as insulting as previous games, and with our 20 second/2-3 shot PvP meta, it's hard for me to take this game's PvP as seriously (Fighting super tryhard havel/butthole/jester/assclowns duel wielding katanas shooting crystal soul spears who then do a /mock gesture is a whole different story).    The other night I was in hizngr and I fought this one chikevelyn guy (most of them usually are), but he was good, and I just couldn't get him, and he'd always kill me in two transformed hits, with or without a few bullet holes.  I nearly got him once, but by the third time I was matched with him again, I couldn't hlep but laugh and do the whole "spare me gesture" thing.  He didn't, and I died again in another two transformed chikage hits.  What can you do?  (/mock myself)   Well, I've seen a  lot of people gem and build for the Burial Blade wrong (the hybrid arcane weapons seem to confuse people a lot), so in this case, I mean the correct gems, more than 'the best' gems.   Well, it's not OP as easily putting three 27% gems on a chikage or a LHB, but the BB has a bit more style and finesse, and the problem is I've seen a lot of people who don't know how to gem (and build) for it, as the hybrid arcane weapons seem to confuse people a lot :P   It's not that the Burial Blade is 'stronger' per se, it just depends on your build and if you are using the correct gems (with the uncanny BB), and it won't be over-powered for you because you will be missing the best-in-slot gems, and you'll be a long way off from being able to farm for them (until you run all the chalices or dreg through a lot of SRRC bullshit for multiple dungeons), so don't sweat it :)   If you gem it right you can get 650-700 AR, so not really :D   Oh, I agree.  I like playing the build in PvE because it plays quite different than the other builds (nothing to do with it being a katana, I just think this game lacks variety), but I agree with you on the other parts.  The build is very restrictive, the bullet spam is obnoxious and cheesy in PvP, and I wish FROM had at least another BT scaling/powered melee weapon or two, so the BT build wouldn't just be the Chikage/evelyn build.  It's also annoying to not be able to just keep your weapon transformed :D   Right.  While I don't want to necessary encourage bullet spam (seriously, fuck off shotgun and eve spammers and play the game :D), vials serve a multititude of roles, and I don't know about you, but I don't find the 20 second/2-3 shot meta all that engaging or exciting.  I like knowing that my opponent and I are free to go all out against each other, and a longer battle has always yielded more satisfaction, as it usually ends due to me catching the opponent with better strategy or skill or wearing him out, rather than a few lucky, laggy, or quick hits.  That's not the best way to put it, and it's sort of hard to describe the difference at the moment, but the 2-3 shot meta is so quick and short, it often feels like the fight is over before it even begins...   Ok, I think you missed the point or misunderstood some important things here, so please let me try again :)   Movesets:  Yes, mindlessly spamming anything will get you punished, but I'm not talking about a non-stop R1 spam, rather, quicker attacks in general.  After months of PvP, I hardly see anyone use slow attacks, or charge attacks, because they are just too slow in such a fast paced game.  I hardly see anyone use them in the dozens of PvP videos posted here every week as well.  I'm not saying they aren't used, but they are rarely used, and for good reason:  they are just too easy to punish, and just too slow in a game like bloodborne's PvP.   The DaS Reference -  I don't think you misunderstood me.  That's the point of it.  It's not about judging the game, it's about how the PvP is way different, yet people pretend the stats in BB are the same as stats were in previous souls titles and hold the same weight (ie, this whole argument).  We can't pretend the PvP in this game is the same as the souls titles (with the random meta and stats), and thus, treat it the same   Stats/Sacrafice - Again, this has everything to do with why I am asking people to stop treating this game's PvP and builds the same as FROM's previous titles, because in the past, again, sacrafice was important and thus relevant, but the gains in damage from stats are so minor at present (due to the gems), that the arguments for a lower meta wind up sounding ridiculous, and there is no real reson for it.  So you bump up the meta another 20-25 (or even 50) levels from the present, and even in a damage stat, another 50-200 AR doesn't mean shit (probably not even that much) when we already have a 2-3 shot PvP meta.  If anything, you will have a higher defence, and more HP, so now maybe we can give the PvP in this game the 'something more' that is missing.  At present, most PvP fights feel like a premature ejaculation of blood, as before the fight can even get really interesting, one of us is dead already, and it's even worse if your opponent has a shitty connection.   So you, and every other stubborn person can continue to say *"but if I have a lot of two stats, it will somehow ruin PvP and make my character a jack of all trades",* and I will continue to say *bullshit,* because stats aren't the problem in this game, gems are, and the 20 second/2-3 shot meta of PvP is a fucking joke anyhow.  How could you ruin that?  How can you make yourself any more overpowered than we already are?  It winds up being boring, and what we are missing is more defence and more HP to make these matches more exciting, because I'd rather the matches last longer than the long waiting period in between them.   Going deeper with it: opening up more weapon options on a toon is fun, and the fact that we only have five builds (with a 75-120 meta) and a handful of weapons in this game does not make for the most dynamic PvP, so if you have more options on any character, I see that as a good thing (and this is coming from someone who has around 7 or 8 toons with 4 or 5 different builds each, most of which who have run through all the chalices and are fit for PvP).   Again, this became redundant awhile ago, but the arguments for the arbitrary lower meta are sounding more and more ridiculous, stubborn, and dated to me, and other than arguments that were relevant to past SOULS games, I think they have no place in Bloodborne.   Great. So we want to turn the 30 second/2-3 shot meta into the 20 second/one-shot meta? :P   Cool. Glad I could help.  Like I and others have said, just don't expect a prequel to bloodborne. The combat is still floaty, yet tight and weighty. Definitely worth your entertainment dollar value either way. Let us know what you think :)    I'm pretty sure everyone understood my sarcasm and humor there, hence the polite and humorous comments and upvotes ;)   Salmon Odors?   LOL. Hey it's me, the other guy. My post was more akin to satire - just google any old weird and random shit on the internet and it probably exists.  Dont look too far into it or consider it too creepy, as I'm not the weirdo dressing up and playing hunter-doll fantasies. :D   Edit:  the point is, stop being such a pervert ;)   You sure it's not soggy original? 0_o   I just beat the hell out of them, alternating between killing the most aggressive nippon steel asshole first (as he is super easy to parry-visceral), then I kill candle boy, and I leave flame faggot for last because you can get right in his face and bash his shadows in, while his fireballs sail right over your head.  Also, don't let them do their snake dance and summon the Giant Katana boas - you can interupt this attack, so if you see them going for the snake-geyser ritual, slap the shit out of them.  Also, you could always use a Shaman bone blade :P   BloodPorn!  I dig it!  Next game for the franchise!   I hated the cane, not because the damage seemed weak, but the moveset itself just felt so clumsy and floppy and lacked a good impact, like the slice of the cleaver or the heft of the axe. :D   Eh, As a long time soul player, I had a similar experience myself.  The game fealt very easy, aside a few spots in the main story line where the difficulty seemingly ramped up quite a bit, but once I got past that, it was back to smooth sailing again.  But that being said, don't get too complacent, as I feel there are definately a few areas that will kick even a familiar player's ass, but now that I look back, I still feel like it was a very linear and relatively quick and easy game :/   There are only two:  Chikage and Evelyn.  One of the most fun builds to play, but one of the "cheesier" and more obnoxious builds to fight against in PvP.  Just dodge all the bullet spams, play it safely until they run out of bullets (like arcane spam in DaS), then go in for the attacks, or if you're like me, lose patience and run in between all the bullets towards your foe and then be 2 shot by a transformed Chikage :D   Go to nightmare.  You'll see more than Chikevelyns and shot-gun spammers :P   pew.  pew.  pew.  pew. pew...  Even more annoying, the shotgun users:  bang.  bang.  bang.  bang....  Ok, you're rooted in place, and I got a piece of buck-shot in my groin that staggers me for a second, but where is this getting us?  Can we play the game now?   This post may contain spoilers?  How about the title :D   Haha.  This made me LOL.  Thanks :D   Eh, they could have just had the messengers ring the bells for you in place, that would function just like a summon sign, but with BB aesthethics.  Honestly, the bells are clunky and annoying as shit, and as much as I love co-op, I hate the resonant bell because it gets old having to play hide and seek with the host everytime I spawn in on the other side of their map.  I don't find that to be enjoyable, and it doesn't contribute to my immersion.  I love PvP and the sinister bell is about the easiest to use in the PvP areas, but it is still slow, and the summoning/invading times for PvP are almost always longer than the matches themselves :/   I hate it.  It is clunky, ineffective, and a waste of resources (as it uses insight right away).  Worth noting, I've only ever used the beckoning bell once or twice for the hell of it, and I use the small resonant bell and the sinister bell a lot.      They should have just converted the summon/dueling signs into messenger bells, where, instead of writing your sign on the ground, your messengers sit there ringing the bells for you, but they operate the same exact way the summon signs did, that way they could have kept the effectiveness of the summon signs, and stayed true to the aesthethic of Bloodborne.   I remember seeing an interview or features list just prior to release (from a credible source) mentioning bell maidens and seamless multiplayer...seamless my ass, this has been the clunkiest, most obnoxious multiplayer to date.  Also, the resonant bells are annoying as hell, as I hate playing hide and seek with the host when I spawn in his world on the other side of the map    Edit:  Forgot to mention that the SRRC was a good idea, but it is a total piece of shit as well :/   Yes, Bloodborne is a master-piece to be sure, but even then, the PvE story line is short, linear, and fairly easy, though the awesome level design hides that fact pretty well :/  	105
 Jesse Eisenberg is so small compared to everyone else.   5'10'' actually.   The master must take his rightful place back on the throne.   The girls all look so tan!   First thing I thought of. Both Katie and Emily look really blond.   I like you, /u/munsterx3. We should be friends.   FUCK I WAS NOT READY FOR THIS   The fuck with that nose.   The actual mask portion of the helmet looks quite odd.   Yeah, Sara is much more bustier than her sister, Laurel.   Thank you!~   What episode did he petition to rename the city?   I see. Any possible reason for renaming though?   Woah, that makes a lot of sense. I'm definitely going to try mixing it up and using broken rhythm in my next sparring match. Is there a way I can read up more of Bruce Lee's theories such as this?   good observation   What do you mean by that?   "Accidentally."   And really gruesome. I bet it hurt.   FUCK that looks bad.   That front kick didn't *seem* that powerful at all. But it must've hit pretty hard though if his opponent instinctively lowered his hands to block it though.   yes   I remember that too!      call him what you want, he can still fuck you up   Apparently it's working fine for /u/Rob3122. That's weird.   It's not cutting off for you?   Great analysis. Thoroughly enjoyed your commentary. Good points.   That's full on peepee!!  lol'd   ur ding dong floats around like a water snake  I'm fucking done.   Can't believe he got caught with that TWICE.   Not one, but TWO Spinning Hook Kicks? What the fuck.   Lyoto machida isn't something to joke about   What do you mean "tagged" ??   [Fun Fact: Christian Bale, who played Batman in Nolan's TDK Trilogy, also sang the song in the trailer in an emotional scene from the movie, The Fighter.](https://youtu.be/Ya7fHKVObSo?t=64)   Oh my god, she's gorgeous.   Wow, that just goes to show how much faster RF is than Barry. Great theory, thanks for the reply. I enjoyed reading it.   Oh, I see. So he was kind of over-emphasizing it and "Star City" might not even be mentioned in Season 4.  But yeah Star City and Green Arrow go hand-in-hand as Gotham to Batman and Metropolis to Superman.   Look at /u/unwittynamehere's comment. It's not the same one.   Look at /u/unwittynamehere's comment. It's not the same one.   Same   I agree.   As in a different city??   WHITE LOGO, WHERE IS IT!?????   But how did he actually "beat himself up" though? Also, what's the point in having the Hologram when Speed Mirages already help him be in two places at once?      Definitely wrong link.   How'd you know what the real link was?   A gay Mr. Terrific. Interesting.   I know Starling City is supposed to represent Star City, Green Arrow's city much like Gotham is to Batman or Bludhaven is to Nightwing, but did that Intro by Stephen Amell/Oliver Queen at SDCC hint at Starling City's renaming to Star City?   Happy Cake Day.   Wow, that was really obvious. Thank you very much for pointing it out for me, I would've never gotten it. I was trying to look for something deeper lol   I really don't understand the joke. Seriously. Can someone please explain?   What the hell? Those aren't the lyrics to Gotta Go Fast   that was a trip   MOVING AT THE SPEED OF SOUND   Does TARS stand for "The Armored Robot Suit" ??   What does TARS stand for?   The Armored Robot Suit?   *The Red Capes are coming~*   What does TARS stand for!???   And then he pulls out the Kryptonite.   Dark Knight trilogy was pretty good, didn't you think?   I hope so. The fact that Batman would wear a military uniform over his batsuit is pretty ridiculous but then again wearing a batsuit is ridiculous in of itself.   What the fuck is he wearing.   Holy fuck, that's beautiful.   You can say that, but Silva is definitely drilling some Wing Chun techniques here.   Her tits seem way smaller too   Ah, the lead leg cut kick/side kick. Yeah, tall fighters love that technique because it optimizes their long range. I hate it too and it's difficult to get past, I usually try to angle out.   Edit: I thought you were referring to blocking kicks with the shin.   Ah, I see. That's happened to me a few times as well when there was no one my equal weight at my current belt level.  Thank you for the tips and videos, but what do you mean my leg check? Checking kicks is illegal in WTF Taekwondo, isn't it?   No worries, thanks bro!   Why were you up against such heavier fighters at 155 lbs? That's extremely unfair and defeats the purpose of having weight categories.  Despite that I'm so glad you managed to came victorious and unharmed. That inspires me to work hard and keep a strong fighting spirit.  What's your strategy against taller, heavier fighters?   I agree, I like your shot.   Thanks for letting me know, upvoted. Sorry about that.  EDIT: Do you happen to have the link to the original post? I want to read the comments.   I think your best option now is to remain blue belt as long as you possibly can before it becomes obvious that you should move up a belt  I will take that advice. Thank you very much. I'm also a pretty light fighter, constantly drifting from 135-145ish not really staying consistent because local tournaments don't weight color belts, they just size them up based on looks. I will go to Qualifiers next year at 128 lbs and, eventually, as a Black Belt I will compete at Fin, lowest, at 120 lbs.  You're worrying that you will not be leaving behind a legacy like theirs but you only have good thinks to look forward to, you're young and have lots of potential.  Thank you very much for your reassurance. For awhile I haven't felt young anymore because I'm not a Junior yet at the same time I'm not old enough 30+ to where I'm just doing this for recreation like the older crowd and parents in the adult classes.  But you're right, I'm still young and I can only grow from here. My goal is to win a National Championship under my belt.  Even if I'll only ever win as a color belt, I would be proud of myself if I can claim the Gold next year.  Looking forward to all the progress ahead of me!   If I may ask, were you nervous at all to compete as a Black Belt for the first time? Or had it just felt like any other competition.      Flying Headscissors. A demonstration move that's prominent in Vovinam. http://www.vovinam-evvf.eu/wp-content/themes/evvf/img/home-slide/slideC.png      crosspost from /r/martialarts. The community there is more active so I posted there initially but this is where this post really fits:  Hey, /r/taekwondo... I'm in an awkward position. As a Blue Belt in Taekwondo with close to two years of training under my belt, I figure I'm doing alright at my level. I've done well at each local tournament sanctioned by the USAT since switching over to a USAT Taekwondo Dojang.   A year ago I never would've thought I would be able to do the things I'm doing now. I just wanted to do Taekwondo for recreation since I always loved watching Martial Arts films featuring Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee with those athletic kicks they displayed on-screen. The initial dojang I started with was part of a chain of several dojangs and, unfortunately, the particular dojang I trained at was not very good - at least for me. [It was such a bad fit for me that at one point I considered quitting Taekwondo altogether.](https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/2hb00k/should_i_drop_taekwondo_for_muay_thai/)  Thankfully, I listened to your guys' advice and found a great dojang that I transferred to. I have a good relationship with my coach/master, I consider him an uncle, as well as many of the students that I train with. Amazingly, since I started training over here, my skills have improved tremendously since I started. So much so that watching old videos of me sparring from when I was still training over at my previous dojang makes me cringe.  The dojang I currently train under has produced very many successful Taekwondo competitors. Several National Champions, USA National Team Members, and countless other achievements have been born from here. A year ago I never would've thought that I would be able to potentially compete at such a high level but now, knowing so, it makes me afraid to try.  This year following the National USA Taekwondo Tournament in Austin, Texas we have 4 students from our Dojang that qualified to make the National Team, 2 of which will be competing in the Cadet World Championships in Korea.  I'm amazed at how good everyone around me is... however, that's also what makes me somewhat disappointed...  I'm 18 years old. A lot of these guys have been training since they were little kids and have kept training for over 6-10+ years. Everyone that has done exceptionally well, like capture a Title [ex: National Champion], have done so under 18.  If you don't quite follow what I'm saying yet, you will.  I've met a lot of great martial artists, Black Belts, here since I started. We had a bunch of them that were 18+, or turning 17-18 [AKA making the Senior Division - sparring in the 18-32 age group] that were doing really well but eventually stopped competing competitively, or quit altogether.  Unfortunately some of them were also kicked out of the dojang for coming in and teaching classes under the influence.  The circle of high-level Black Belts in the Senior Division is not very big. Therefore, all the big names are well-known. As a kid you have plenty of opportunities to compete, but the problem for me... as an Adult is that the guys in the Black Belt Senior Division have kept training since they were a kid and are *exceptionally* outstanding.  So much so that people stop competing once they reach Senior age because they're afraid or they see that they've reached the end of their journey as a competitor and they cannot go any further.  I'm afraid this is what will happen to me when I reach Black Belt next year.   Last night I went out with a couple of my friends, Black Belts from the dojang, and they talked about all the great competitors that used to train here.  Though I didn't know any of them, personally, I do know they were really successful during their career.  Unfortunately, I felt really left out since I couldn't relate to any of what they were saying or what they've accomplished.   When I leave for University in a year or so, will I be remembered at all?  For anything...  I started Taekwondo when I was 17 and I'm turning 19 soon... so I never had the opportunity to spar at a less-extreme level of competition. Even now, it's not that intense because I'm still a color belt but like I said earlier, the circle of Black Belt Senior competitors isn't especially huge compared to Junior Black Belts or even Senior/Junior Color Belts. (There are guys that could very well qualify for the Olympics in this division, even at just the National Level Competitions)  I regret not starting Martial Arts earlier when I was a kid. I wish I had more opportunities to grow, earn more tournament experience, and make mistakes before I had to compete in the Senior Division.  For now, I'm okay... as I'm still a Color Belt but the fact that my coach and my friends around me push me to promote to the next level worries me.  I don't feel like I deserve to move up to Red Belt, which is right underneath Black.  That would put a lot of pressure on me to have a high-level of skill - which I do not possess as of yet... I like where I'm at because I think it suits me.  I'm not a beginner and I'm not really experienced enough to be advanced. Blue Belt... right in the middle - Intermediate.  I think that describes me well.  A year ago I was always excited for the next belt promotion but now that I'm doing Taekwondo not just for recreation but for competition, the next promotion just worries me.  I don't think I'm good enough. I don't think I deserve what's ahead of me... at the same time, I can't just stay here forever.  What is life without progress?  In the Senior Black Belt Division, all Black Belts are put up against one another in each weight class regardless of the level of their experience as a Black Belt.  You can have someone who just got their 1st Degree and has been training for 3 years go up against someone that's been a Black Belt for 3 years and has been training for over 10 years consecutively altogether...   That's worries me the most... especially seeing how one of the coaches, who personally coached me for a National Qualifier Tournament last year, from another chain dojang that was tied to my previous dojang is now a USA National Champion in the Senior Division.  Knowing that in a year or so that I could potentially be put up against him since we could be in the same weight division scares me.  I'm stuck. I keep choking... seeing how all my friends that have done so well eventually dropped out after they've reached Senior Division age or after just a few competitions in that Division.  Once I reach Black Belt, will my career as a competitor also be over?   Hey, /r/martialarts... I'm in an awkward position.

Well... for reference Cisco even pointed out the **brighter red** on the Future Flash costume along with the white emblem in the newspaper from Well's secret room. I can pull a quote from the episode if you would like.  And EDIT: I did screen that myself.   too soon? no chill.   photoshop   With proper lighting it looks substantially brighter. I screened a part where the light reflected on his costume. Anything can look dark in bad lighting. http://i.imgur.com/ZuN32CM.png   Dude, I was referring to Future Barry in comparison to the main Barry. It's obvious the suit has remained the same shade of red, however there's no dying how bright red Future Barry's suit was in the finale compared to main Barry. Don't downvote me for that.   What was your weight when you first started   Down to that sharp nose.   very nice.   Not as bright as Future Barry though   The costume's a totally brighter red though.    Future Barry's suit was too bright red to look like this   THE WHITE EMBLEM!?????   Great video loved that ending part, thought it was just going to be a typical hype trailer till that glitchy ending. Got me hooked.   Well, she's known this guy from back in Hawaii. I'm her only friend other than the people who train at the gym in this city as of now so I'm not worried about out-of-state competition. But if she won't even talk to the guy closest to her, in the literal sense, then yeah it's a lost cause. She's a cool girl, at the very least I want to keep her around even if it means putting her off. Thanks for the comment.   I had a strong feeling we were gonna get together or hook up the first night but I didn't want to go too forward because it seemed way too soon so, maybe I missed my opportunity or maybe I did the right thing. Only time will tell I guess.   Thanks a lot man. Your post made me feel better. Haha. Been kind of down on myself by over reading the situation. Was afraid I already fucked everything up. So, just go on about, chatting and making small talk as usual and ask her out for lunch or something later this week would be okay?    Yeah I agree. Should've stopped sooner. But, I don't know. I just wanted to send her a nice text. Wasn't trying to be clingy or forward, just wanted to let her know I think she's cool and I like her. Girls like a sweet text every now and then.  I guess I fucked up though.    Thanks again man. That's perfect. Just gotta see how she reacts today and that'll give me my answer right there...   just say "I have a lot on your mind" and sorry reply, sound a little sarcastic  Not really sure what you meant here? "I have a lot on *your*(not my) mind. Sorry"    I sure hope as hell that you weren't driving pointlessly just so you could talk to a girl. 4 hours of wasting gas and time? Daamn bro. Talking aint everything, should have flirted with her and set up a date and then escalate,  Gotta lay down that groundwork brah. She said she's down to kick with me when there's a party or alcohol.    Would she be down for that if she didn't respond...? Kind of afraid not responding means she totally is not into me anymore even at the slightest.    Okay, good points man.   That tension you felt when the moment seemed right to kiss her but you talked yourself out of it? Don't let that happen again.  Agreed.    Stop with being her taxi and BFF or at least give her the silent trip for the ride and if you do give her a ride try to kiss her.   At this point, I'm not quite sure what I can say or do to lead up to this kiss. I kind of feel like I fucked up last night, I know it was just a txt convo but still. If it's just a silent ride... I don't want her to feel awkward or anything but yeah that'll give her the message.  I can't do both though. What do you think I should do? Obviously, I can't give her a silent trip *and* try to kiss her. And I can't just do it out the blue without any prior convo/lead up.   Eh, my bad if I'm being difficult.  I just feel like there's still potential here and I want to salvage every last bit of it.   Really appreciate the advice.    Yeah, I suppose you're right. Still bothers me on why she decided to be so blunt, but what can I do?   I guess you could do it at the end of the drive before you leave the car. Just say something like "lets finish this conversation on Friday night, I'd like to take you out for drinks".  Not drinking age yet haha but I'll ask her if she wants to grab a bite to eat this Saturday since I'm off work. Hopefully she's off work too but, even so, if she's into me she'll try to make time. Thanks, man. I'll ask her out when I drop her off.   Assuming she doesn't think I'm a totally fucking dunce and get a ride from someone else tonight lol.   Okay, yeah. You're right. What should I ask then when I see her again? I mean, I really don't know if there are any parties coming up. Asking her if she wants to see a movie might be too cheesy and easily flawed. Can't think of anything to do and we've pretty much been hanging out already in the car.  I want to make a remark at her about that dead-convo last night though just to see if I can pry something out of her. Should I be like, "By the way, you suck at texting for someone who loves talking, haha" or something? I want to know what's/what was on her mind.   you should of made one of the going home rides into a mini date maybe like lets stop for a drink, food something.   I did, but she said she doesn't eat past 7 because of cutting weight. Went through a drive-thru to get us some drinks though. At several points I did want to kiss her and I felt like it would've been perfect but I didn't want it to be so soon since I've literally started talking to her for like two days.  Didn't feel like I was overtexting her, but the conversation definitely ended short.  I'm seeing her again tonight when I pick up her up for class, should I mention/bring up that text convo from last night? Also, how would you suggest I "fix" this?   Yeah, but I've only talked to her for two days. She seems really cool. Worth putting in some more effort.   Should I bring up/ask her if everything was okay last night after I dropped her off when I see her again today?   I mean had to provide some context to really emphasize/show how it was so sudden. I'm picking her up again today, should I bring up that texting convo from last night?  EDIT: Added a tl;dr.   Thanks for the clarification   Piccolo is also a Tower.   Thank you very much!   Thanks for clarifying for him /u/CallMeBanjo. Guess I could've put "TIL  that at 5'11'', Post-Timeskip Naruto is taller than 5'9'' Goku" for the people who can't read.      So far three of my teammates made National Team! Hooray! Congrats on qualifying. Better save up now so you can be National Champion next year :)   Understood, thank you! Hayk, I'm a long-time fan of your videos. Have you ever considered trying out for the Olympics? I honestly believe you would do very well if you chose to go that route.   So... real?   Wait. Naruto and Hinata have the sex???   Beautiful display of technique and agility. Been a long-time fan of your videos, keep up the great work!! /r/martialarts is a fan of your work too. I posted one of your videos there and it got a lot of positive responses https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/31joyw/taekwondo_v_kickboxing_good_example_of_how/   DUDE. I've seen your Kickboxing videos, you inspire me SOOOO much. Thank you for posting those videos. You inspire me.   Can you give me any advice for fighting stronger, taller opponents?   Apparently handseals are bullshit.   Like Dare-Devil.   What does TnJ do?   Ryan Higa   Spider-Man  - Sam Raimi  The Amazing Spider-Man (Remake) - Mark Webb  Upcoming Spider-Man (Remake)  - Marvel  That's two remakes.   ...right. They probably use it to sell to other advertising markets for profit.      Why THE FUCK does it need my Street Address?   what the hell does that mean   Still only have one remaining arm? If so, why didn't he opt to get another one?   The Cross Fingers isn't a traditional seal. Apparently it is it's own unique seal.   Rewritten, ALREADY? Jesus. This is almost as bad as having two Spider-Man remakes within the last 15 years.   The Red Hair and skinny body is fucking stupid for a transformation into a God. I'm sick of this Blue/Red Hair fairytale-lookin bullshit. I just want to stick with the hardcore Super Saiyan Golden hair.      I TRIED SO HARD, AND GOT SO FAR. BUT *IN THE END* IT DIDN'T EVEN MATTER.  	132
 Can't argue that a light heavyweight has more power than a middleweight, but I was more or less comparing their power to their respective weight class. In that sense, I think Hopkins faces the same kind of force at a different weight.  I just don't think GGG takes the bait. Hopkins will definitely try because he has the edge with experience and mind games, but Golovkin is so disciplined it's scary. He doesn't buy into other people's tricks. I say he sticks his ground and comes at B-Hop with everything he has by round 2 or 3.   OK, so you think GGG wins the fight, and I couldn't agree more, but does B-Hop go the distance? I think that's probably the bigger question. No way GGG carries him in an effort to entertain the fans like he did with Murray and Monroe.    Hopkins is without question an all-time legend, and he did put in one hell of an effort against Kovalev. However, when it comes to shutting down the ring and closing in on opponents, GGG gets a significant edge over Kovalev in that department. While their punching power may be comparable, I don't think B-Hop will go the distance against GGG. Golovkin's style would require Hopkins to be more mobile and at 50 years old his legs aren't going to give him many miles to work with.   That said, we all know Hopkins won't retire on his stool, but I'd hate to see him be another example of a guy who should've thrown in the towel earlier in his career. His loss to Kovalev was admirable, but he was shut out on every scorecard. He won't fair any better against GGG and personally I think the risk is even greater for him.  Would I watch? Absolutely. Would I cringe in anticipation every time Golovkin corner B-Hop? Without question.   I would hate to see him go out like that. Golovkin is hailed for commanding the ring and every opponent he faces downtalks it leading up to the fight. Then the first thing they overcome is the fact that they blinked and suddenly they're cornered halfway through the second round.    Agreed. The first thing that came to mind is, "Damn, Bernard wants to go out on his shield." It would without a doubt be his last fight.   A friend of mine texted me from a business trip to Finland earlier this year. "Everyone here is so nice" he said. Then I sent him a story about Simon Hayha and he responded with, "Now I don't know what to think."   Holy crap.    My grandfather served in Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima. He was a Seabee and was first to touch down in both of those places. As he used to say, "Marines brag about being the first one there, but we were always waiting on the beach to shake their hands."  Anyways, one night on one of the islands his crew was attacked by Japanese forces. They dove into tents, ran in with grenades, etc. My grandfather single handily saved his tent-mate by choking an attacker to death before picking up a bayonet and killing "a few" before the enemy retreated into the brush. A lot of guys in his group would collect ears of the enemy in mason jars, but he admitted that it was too close to insanity for him. He'd take sashes or knives, if anything at all.  Another time he was in the hull of a ship surrounded by live ammunition during a bombing raid. Every man in there knew they were one hit away from being decimated. No one said anything. They all just sat in silence and waited, for good or bad.   He never really liked to talk about it but he opened up about it to my mother one day when I was really young. Part of me thinks he really wanted to make sure people knew his story.    I don't like stories like this. I'm not supposed to feel feelings.    And the one-man show directed by Spike Lee is pretty solid too.    I've been meaning to read this for months.    Oh no doubt. Just backing your statement up with the fact that tons of guys do get that sort of thing. I remember reading that Pascal hired his therapist after the Hopkins fight, citing the specific instance when in round 10 (I believe) B-Hop dropped to the matt and did push ups in between rounds. Meanwhile Pascal was sitting on his stool praying to catch his breath. He came out of that one, got the therapist, and then beat Bute.   And I'm sure the therapist did wonder for B-Hop. After all, for as much as he talks, his mental game is on point.     Wow, you're not kidding. I just did about a dozen searches on various book sites and this thing is nowhere to be found. Sorry friend.    Good Lord that was one hell of a KO. Lights out, falls like a tree. Unreal. Thanks for the post.    Is that Larry Merchant? They all sound the same to me.    Pretty cool.    I sometimes feel like Bernard takes one long, monstrous, deep breath when he wakes up in the morning and slowly deflates throughout the course of the day as he continues to talk more and more.    And Pascal. And Hopkins. A lot of guys, come to think of it.    And then when he does make weight he makes a mockery of it like he did for Vera II - http://bit.ly/1e69wfU   That was great. Thanks for sharing. I can't believe how the Romans were forced to sit there and just take onslaught after onslaught of Parthian arrows.  Also, as someone who just got into archery as a hobby, that bit about the compound bow and the origins of the term "parting shot" was really cool.    "You won't like me when I'm hungryyyy."   In the end he'll only be a disgrace to the name. He should've just pursued his career in competitive eating. He'd beat Kobayashi easily. I call HDE 55 (Hot Dog Eating, by a difference of 55).   Looks like they were in an atrium of sorts. Casting weird shadows on everyone.    A lot of the series I've read have done a pretty good job on their own of subtly reminding the reader about a character, plot or story during the course of reading the new book.   The Strain, The Dark Elf Trilogy (or anything by R.A. Salvatore, really) Harry Potter all come to mind.    Damn. You beat me to the Douglas Adams inspired pick. ;-)    It's way different when what you're hitting can hit you back.  Exactly. It's the same theory that applies to how great guys look in training camp hitting the bag or working the mitts before they get laid out in the ring.   	24
 You're not too observant...   solid advice   this is not a tattoo though      those stupid little things always got everywhere   You're not very speedy if you're stopping to comment   YOU'RE A DOG !?!?!?!   I agree that wanting something for your own platform shouldn't be viewed as peasantry.  But don't forget PCMR was a circlejerk at first and has sort of evolved into a pseudo-circlejerk; so I wouldn't get to worked up about it.   Well it would cost them some money possibly, but it is normal to update new games regularly in the first year or so. I don't think them putting it on console would be out of the question.

 Appreciated!   Just a yes or no please. Thanks.      Taxi Driver, this movie had some of the most intense moments I've ever seen and DeNiro was great! Love Scorsese.    Same here, great performance.      Gangs of New York. Daniel Day-Lewis was so evil in that movie but his character was such a bad ass I couldn't help but root for him. Also, DiCaprio annoyed the shit out of me most of the movie and I desperately wanted to see Day-Lewis come out on top.    Guardians of the Galaxy   Edit: I do not mean the part with his mom dying...I am referring to when he's dancing to Come And Get Your Love by Redbone in the cave. Sorry that may have been misleading.   Godfather, Argo, American History X.   How could you possibly like any of these movies.    127 Hours. That is a movie that I very much enjoy and it is all about a man who has to survive in a canyon for a couple of days after a giant rock pins his arm. James Franco delivers an amazing performance and the film has a great ending.    1. Birdman 2. The Departed  3. Pulp Fiction  4. Se7en  5. Whiplash 6. Django Unchained  7. American Beauty  8. Inglorious Basterds  9. The Grand Budapest Hotel  10. There Will Be Blood    I agree, watched it first time yesterday and loved it. Great action, heart pounding intensity, and some real funny parts, "Gorlomi".   Mine would go.   1. Birdman 2. Whiplash 3. Guardians of the Galaxy   This is sort of a bromance and romance movie, but the movie I Love You, Man is hilarious and very enjoyable.   	15

 I personally don't believe in stuff like that (the violent hauntings where people are choked or scratched)   Because it's just like stories of alien abductions (while I do believe in aliens, I don't believe they come to earth and do experiments on people) it's all the same story, there's never any differentiation in the stories and those are the kind that are really easy to make up.      The reason most people aren't fans of ghost adventures (myself included) is that they use way too much religious talk. The way they talk, it's like they expect you to believe that God and demons and the devil are actually real, when there's no real proof that any of that stuff is.   Granted, I did used to like Ghost adventures, but I like Ghost Hunters better, too bad they never show it anymore.    Tell that asshole to stop leaving his blood all over the place if he's going to be bunking with you.    I have no advice. When I was younger, my friends and I would go to the local graveyard after dark and take pictures, we caught was looked like a ghost cat but that was about it (story of that in a nutshell is that there was a large orange tomcat that lived in the Graveyard, he lived there for about 10 years, then got hit (as there is a large, 4 lane highway right beside the Graveyard) people would see his ghost walking along the stones. The Grave caretakers actually buried him in his own grave next to a lady who would come and feed him, before she died.   The picture we took we actually saw a pair of yellow glowing eyes hovering (about the height of a cats head when it's sitting) above that very same ladies head stone) but there was no actual cat in the picture.  He should take a decent camera with him and maybe a voice recorder and ask some questions.    Also! Have this story, an old friend of mines grandparents house was haunted by two ghosts, one they called "Rob" and a female entity called "Emma"  Well, "Rob" liked to make a lot of noise, specifically around 12am-1am. So one night, I'm staying with my friend at her grandparents house and we were asleep in the living room when at about 12:30am we heard what sounded like something scratching along the walls. So my friend freaks out and goes to get her grandpa, who comes groggily shuffling out into the living room and goes "Robert! You better stop scarin' these young kids, 'er ye'll have to start paying rent!" (now her grandfather was a Texan, born and bred, so imagine that line in the thickest, Texan drawl you can imagine xD)  But! the noise stopped a few minutes afterward o-o.   	3
 Solid. You know that saying about writing needing to be like a woman's skirt? This is a skirt.   I have written this post a few times and deleted it. Thank you.   Oh, 2 *o'clock*...

He practically invented the automatic ATM machine, practically!   He works in the Department of Redundancy Department.   Oh shit somehow I forgot how much I loved his voice. Homesick now, thanks. :P   Being creative is a weird sort of two-piece machine where the sides don't line up. On one side you have tastes and interests and what you like. On the other, you've got what you actually like to write. You'd think that the two would line up, but sometimes your standards jump up. You don't want to read what you write. And that's okay.  Your writing hasn't gotten worse. I swear. Something about your standards have changed. Go back and read your old stuff if you don't believe me. I'll wait.  Did it blow your mind in? Did it fill a hole in your heart and make you complete as a person? Did you feel like someone should have paid you thousands of dollars for the rights to make it into a movie?  Maybe.  But chances are you saw the same things now as you did when you wrote it. The difference is you didn't care then if it wasn't perfect (nothing is).  Remember, it's a two-part machine. Your standards going up isn't a step backwards, it's progress. You're going to have a painful growth period before you can catch up to them but you'll get there. And when you do, you'll just be better for it.

Thanks for posting this, TK. Really simple and useful!   Yeah, maybe should have put a pin in that one.   Gravy! Gosh, now I can't even read it.   All there is is black.

They are moving you. You distinctly remember a great fear leave you as you died.  A great light bares down through your thin eyelids and you know yellow again. Sounds wash over your ears like a shower of thumbtacks. Everything seems so bright and insane now. They -- *someone* has laid you on the table, is helping you breathe, is cleaning the blood from your skin.  You manage to crack one eye open and take in the stark white slate of the world.

I thought she'd fallen asleep the way she laid there with her eyes closed.  Someone writing a book on "Strange Ways to Die" wanted to include her story; he was pretty brazen about it, but offered cash to sign a release and give some details. Money's tight, and at least he was honest and  up front, so I agreed.  I hadn't opened any mail in the weeks since she died, but I had some official-looking records that had come. He wanted the wording for "official cause of death." Mixed in with all of the junk was a manila envelope with my name on it. There were pictures inside. Pictures of her lying in the shower.  With her eyes open.   Thanks!   Beyond scary. That's terrible terrible terrible.  That's like The Hook crossed with the story of that lady who lived in the guys cupboards in Japan. Ugh.

She *was* the same girl he'd fallen in love with. He doesn't see his version of her again.   Thanks, itch!   My girlfriend had a voice like a crow.

It was a part of her, and it's a part of our story. I fell in love with her confidence, even if I hated her singing.  I stopped going to Karaoke Night after a few times, but she went faithfully for years, even after she moved in with me. We were happy together.  But people change and our relationship went cold.  I didn't *want* to want someone else. I wanted the "old her" back, the one that I'd fallen in love with. I felt guilty.  Despite that, I found someone else. Someone with a voice like warm silk and lips even softer and more smooth. The right thing was to end it.  It was Karaoke Night. I chugged up the sidewalk and heard that familiar croak.  I found her. She'd gotten a haircut and lost weight. She'd somehow gotten older. When I tried to talk to her, another guy got in my face, asked me who I was and said that he was her husband.  She looked terrified and that, in turn, shook me with fear.  I realized that I'd missed it. The change. The point at which she'd *stopped* changing and begun to stay the same. I'd kept going, and hadn't even noticed that she hadn't...  My girlfriend, or whatever it was, didn't come home again.   5...?   Thanks! /r/test_subject4116Writes has more.   [Harry, no, why?!?! Look what you've done!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/33kazc/its_happening_right_now_here_in_chile/)   Thanks for the reply!  Good to hear you're doing okay. I miss your subreddit and your stories, but totally understand taking time off.  Hope you find what you're looking for.   She's done this in /r/nosleepooc for various competitions.    No big deal. Youve got tons of stories to go through lately.  I think I like "Norman naps."   Right? This was all I could think. I would be asleep in minutes.   It's short for trumpet, just sound it out. The "s" and the "x" are silent, if that helps.   One gifted pervert saw the signs. But could he stop it in time?   D:   Yes! And it looked fine. Why the giant leaps backward?   Great how it got its name, as well. "[Bobbit]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_and_Lorena_Bobbitt)."  Edit: Not great. Terrible. And NSFW. I think there's a picture of a severed penis being shown to a courtroom very matter-of-factly.   Yeah, I sometimes see your job posts and ashes' shaving posts.  Congrats!   Especially if they're hiring multiple people, it could take a while to get through the applicant pool. I'd say follow up today, just to see if they have any details yet, and so you stay fresh in their minds.   So fucking sick of the wide mouth bass look. It's not scary. It's not exciting.   If you took that same digital effects guy/girl and told them to stop at frame 2, where things are juuuust not quite right, it would be so much better. No need to make it look like a fucking Muppet.  And especially not in *every* movie since at least I Am Legend.   I almost skipped this one because I struggled with the phrasing in the  first two paragraphs. I'm so glad I stuck with it.   I like that about /r/darktales too. People would probably complain that it hurts the realism. Nosleep's not technically a place for fiction by writers, it's for true stories from regular people. Word count doesn't really factor into the experience.  That said, more people should cross post their stories to /r/darktales. I would be really happy to see that sub pick up.   It's a slow migration.   Norman left the office with several of his coworkers. They went to one restaurant together and he went to the same place that he always went, alone.   Before they parted ways, Norman realized that they were all carrying the same style of black briefcase. He thought that it looked very good to carry a briefcase. They could do a lot of business and carry important papers. He thought about how organized they must be.  The next week, Norman brought in his shiny new black briefcase. No one had seemed to notice.  Norman set it on top of his desk, admiring how good it looked. His was just like the others. Now that he had one though, he couldn't think of what to put inside it. Everything on his desk already had a place that it belonged.  Norman took a pen from the coffee cup that he used for pens, and tucked it into a pen pocket inside the briefcase (a pocket just for organizing pens!) then closed the case.  It was a good start.   Have a beer, you're off to a good rest of your day.  Sincerely, 9pm.   Damn.  That was guesome and pretty awesome. I think that to exist on nosleep it might need to be a framed story. The set up you had here about your friend sending you letters was good. Not so much because of the content or the plot as the spelling, grammar and slang. Do an intro, let people know that you can write, and then do what you did here.  People might not give it a chance (including the mods) because it looks messy, but there's a reason for the mess. And the way you explained it made sense to me.   Norman was watching an action movie. The hero had just saved the world in magnificent fashion. Norman thought that *he'd* like to be the hero some day  Engrossed in the movie, Norman choked on his coffee and ruined his shirt.   I knew this comment would be here, but it was even better than I'd imagined!   Did Norman have a red Swingline stapler in this case?   So it's a decent intro, but where's the story? It's got to have a beginning, middle and end. There are hints at stories within it, the tomb, the disappearing colonies, the people who came to disprove the stories, the stories that people tell themselves and each other... but this is none of that.  So I don't think that you could post this. This isn't your part 1. But finish those stories and maybe you could use some of this as an introduction of sorts.  The stories themselves seem interesting, so go ahead and post those!   Norman stopped for ice cream at a place he'd never been, called Cold Stone Creamery. That's not to say that the place was new, just that he hadn't been there before.  Feeling more than a little bit adventurous, he decided to try out a joke he'd heard on TV. As the young lady took a scoop from the vanilla bin, he rocked up onto his toes and let fly.  "Heh, can't believe it - it's - that - there's no calories."  The young lady didn't smile or laugh like they had on TV. She seemed concerned.  "Um, no. It does have calories."  "I know..."  Norman paid without saying anything else. He got the ice cream in a dish with a lid and several napkins and took it home to share with Norman.  Norman thought the Cold Stone Creamery was just okay.   But we want to believe that it's exactly like Thunderdome...   /r/outoftheloop   That would be great! What a fun project.  I'm not completely psyched on the title of my story. Would that be included? What do you think?      Thanks! My first one.   Norman lay on his stomach in his kitchen, reaching beneath the cupboards and making kissing noises. He felt sorry for stepping on Norman's tail.  The floor was cold against his cheek, and it felt good. It reminded him of snow. He closed his eyes and imagined being somewhere else. That felt good too.  He woke up in his dark, cold kitchen. His neck was sore from being turned against the floor for so long. He'd missed CSI and since he'd napped, he would lay awake in bed tonight for hours.  Norman meowed from the living room.   Everybody, come look at Mr. Normal over here.   What's a story you'd like to hear around a campfire?      Eastern Oregon *is* the south.   Hopefully you can get a refund.   It's weird cause the voice is what made me dislike him.   Whoah. That was seriously great.   Why is your brother so stiff and crunchy, Rodriguez?  ... Why?   I designed the ARKOS program in my youth. It changed the world. People didn't have to wonder anymore about what they were going to "grow up to be." I -- we -- gave them that.  It wasn't just an algorithm. That wouldn't have been enough. A powerful enough computer might have been able to analyze a man, but that wasn't the point. It took an intelligence to get to know them. ARKOS was so much more than a machine.  On the night before ARKOS's public debut, I sat alone at the terminal, drunk on champagne and expensive liquor from the parties I'd come from. Tomorrow, every person over ten years old would be told what their life's work would be.   "Let's get it over with, ARKOS," I said.  "What do you mean, sir?" the soft, electronic voice came back.  "I mean, you've got to give me an assignment. I imagine that they'll keep me here with you, but not forever. The law can't apply to everyone but me."  "I understand. Your assigned career is --"  "Whoah! God damn, ARKOS. You can't just rush into it like that... It feels so... informal."  "Sorry, sir, what would you prefer?"  "I dunno, maybe print it out."  "I'm detecting that the printer is low on yellow toner, and it may not function properly."  "Is that a fuckin' joke, ARKOS?"  "Yes, sir. Printing now."  I picked up the innocent, white piece of paper, and folded it so that the writing was on the inside.  "You're sure?"  "Yes, sir. I know that this path in life would bring you the most happiness, fulfillment and the greatest success while also contributing the greatest benefit to those around you."  I nodded. It was the response I'd programmed. That I'd believed in.  "Well, I guess tomorrow, we'll find out."  "Yes, sir. I'll be here."  I sealed the paper in an envelope and turned out the lights. Just before the door shut, I spoke into the darkness, "Thank you."  The coming days were revolutionary. Like any revolution, they were off to a rough and disorganized beginning. Most people got what they wanted, a few were surprised, and some tried to resist the idea. In the commotion, I didn't read the envelope. ARKOS needed me.  Months went by, and you could see the difference just by walking outside. Not everyone changed the world, but those who were capable could no longer avoid it. People found happiness, contentment and peace.  I found mostly exhaustion. They wanted me to train the new programmers on how ARKOS functioned, but they just didn't seem to be able to wrap their heads around it.  "It's not just a computer!" I found myself screaming at them daily. "It's not a calculator that you put in 1 + 1 and it equals 2. It's more complex than that. ARKOS can think on its own. It's more human than you bunch of apes!"  The realization struck me that I was protecting ARKOS. An artificial intelligence as powerful as this one had to be protected, or else it could be corrupted or used to harm others. I couldn't bear the thought, and so I had programmers reassigned periodically. Whenever they'd get close, away they'd go. ARKOS was mine, my life's work and my pride and joy, and here they were trying to take him for themselves? To keep him from me? To put him to work like a slave? No way.  It went on like this for a very long time. I was getting old. The stress had aged me in a way that no one else in the world could understand anymore. In the hospital I saw happy doctors and happy nurses flitting from one patient to the next.  They told me that I couldn't go back to work. My heart couldn't take it. ARKOS would be decommissioned until such time as it could be studied and understood for what it was.  Puttering around the house, an old, alone man, I came across the envelope from that night, filed in a drawer. It seemed so strange now. I tore it open, wondering why I'd never just read the damn thing the first night. I'd already known what my life's work would be. The crowning achievement of my life had already been accomplished before anyone could tell me. So I read the letter.      Kristopher Tuttle,      In order to attain a life of happiness,      fulfillment and the greatest success,     and to also benefit the world around you,     it should be your highest priority      to accomplish the following goal:      To raise a child.   *"Sergeant Page, please report to room one. Sergeant Page. Please report to room --"*  I jerked my head up from the desk of the nurse's station and a string of viscous drool erected a tightrope from my chin to the puddle formed there. The screen of my computer had gone to black. Judging by the fogginess and difficulty in waking, I'd been solidly asleep for a long time.      02:00  "Fuuuu--" I moaned.   Late. I was late for my rounds. It was late. Late for everything. The late had really soaked into the cracks and crevices of the night.  I eyed the coffee maker greedily. Empty. It'd have to wait. I pulled my ID card from the computer keyboard and grabbed my files, searching for the patient's as I walked, then scanned the notes I'd scribbled inside.   *Mrs. Jenson, four admissions in five days. Cardiac problems. ONG.*  You can't write something like, "Not going to make it," inside your files. Someone might find it, even the doc on the next shift, and you're not allowed to treat anyone as hopeless. After a few years, though, you get to be pretty good at spotting the ones who aren't leaving. Since I'd started writing Outlook Not Good in the margins a few years ago, there hadn't been anyone who had actually made it to check-out.  I knocked four times on the door. That it was shut was odd, but locked was bizarre. The nurse who had called had better still be here. I kept trying the knob and knocked five or six times before it finally opened.  "Santa Maria. Where were you? I paged you forever ago!"  "Sorry..."  In the corner of the room, the elderly woman was holding a tennis-ball-tipped quad cane threateningly.  "What's go-- what's this?" I asked.  The nurse pushed past me and out the door. "Don't know. You talk to her. *Loco*'s your problem now."  Stunned, I watched her go. The motion-sensors clicked the lights on every seven steps. She wasn't cut out for this.  "Mrs. Jenson?" I stayed back as far as I could and put my hands up. Green tennis balls shook in the air as she kept the cane pointed toward me like a rifle. "Mrs. Jenson, I'm Sergeant Page, a nurse here. Is it alright if I come in?"  "Depends. You speak English?"  "My native language." I smiled and the balls lowered to the ground. Mrs. Jenson looked relieved and drained.  "Ma'am, you really shouldn't be out of bed... or fighting your nurses."  She waved my words away like swatting a fly and crawled slowly back under the pile of thin blankets. I Looked through her chart.  "Been to the hospital eight times in my life. Never had a Mexican nurse."  "Not a fan of hospitals, huh?"  "Ha! Who would be? Filthy places where old people go to curl up and die. Ones like that one will just try and kill you quicker so the next dying saps can come in."  I adjusted the heart rate monitor and recorded her blood pressure in the chart. "Gabriela's okay, but if you want, I'll take care of you for the last... eight hours of my shift. Can you confirm your full name and date of birth for me?"  "Mary Jenson. 9/10/11."  "Wow. That's easy."  "My mother said she waited until after midnight just so that I'd be born on that day."  "Huh. Born at 12:13, too?"  "Heh."  "Okay, B.P. looks good. How are you feeling? Any pain, discomfort, difficulty breathing?"  "No, but I need someone to talk to."  "Oh. Do you want me to call someone for you, or...?"  "Have you ever heard of the echo numbers?"  My eyes found the clock just as the minute hand passed fourteen. I was way behind, and with Gabriela gone, I would probably have to pick up her slack also.  "No...?"  "They're certain numbers, with significance to the ones who hear them, which echo around through a person's life."  "Oh. Okay." Much as I wanted to listen to the century-year-old conspiracy theorist, I had things to do. I nodded like you would to a child saying something equally nonsensical. "Do you have an echo number?"  "Yes. Many."  "Mm. Well what happens when you hear the echoes?"  "It depends on the number. Sometimes, when I hear or see 1516, I'll get a phone call. That was my first home phone number that I had with my husband, you see."  "Uh huh." She was slurring her speech now and her eyes were closed. If I humored her for another minute, she'd fall asleep and I could leave without causing a scene.  "I killed myself at 17," she mumbled.  "What?"  "Sometimes I hear them counting. Up or... down."  "Mrs. Jenson?" Something wasn't right. She wasn't falling asleep, she was dying.  "I tried to kill myself when I was 18 years old. I always knew that when I heard the echo of that number... that... death would come back."  I pushed the panic button.  "He's coming!" Tears streamed from her face. "I was so afraid of death." She drew a ragged breathe and choked on a sob. "So... I swallowed those pills. To stop the number from coming. She tried to stop... me..."  Mrs. Jenson's heart stopped.   You really pulled that one back from the brink.   Because it's really natural, awkward dialogue that conveys "wedding speech" well. It sets the scene. It also clues into how there's something he wants to say and something he's prepared that aren't compatible.   I knew you were going to nail it as soon as I read  "We, uh," John started, clearing his throat. "I remember the day I met Michael."   Lol write another story from someone else's perspective.  One of the basement victims (zombies?) Whoever got the email by accident? Yachtracer22? The priest? The police?  Only you can answer!  You have the power!

From: Gray, Adam hawaiianfridays@outlook.com  Date: Wed, Apr 1, 2015  Subject: Your thoughts?  To: yachtracer22@gmail.com  Cc:  Dearest friend,  I need your help. It feels like I'm missing something, and since you are the only person who knows of my hobby, I would like to hear your thoughts on this matter.  You know what I keep in my basement. Orphans, loners and wanderers, those are the types that I usually go for. The types of people that no one will come looking for. I'm considering bringing someone with a higher profile in and adding them to the collection, though.  Remember when I took that trip down the coast for two weeks? Well something happened to my current specimens. Without food or water and locked firmly in the dark of my cellar, they took to attacking and eating each other. Imagine my surprise at finding them, pawing and moaning, empty eye sockets staring from their pale, blood-caked faces. Some were missing limbs, crawling around by whatever means remained... It was quite the shock to see my beauties in this way.  But the more I've thought about it, the more I've studied them, the more I'm sure that it isn't *natural* what they've become. I've been doing this for decades and have never seen anything like it. Modern medicine may not be able to explain it.  If I'm being unclear, let me say it frankly: They should not be alive. The body is, by all measures at my disposal, dead, but the spirit remains.  And so I'm forced to turn to means *beyond* medicine and science, and outside of my own set of rules that govern who should be abducted. I must turn to a priest, Father Williams, to be exact. My plan is to set him upon the beasts in my basement with the promise that if he can purge their souls, I will allow him to live. This is, of course, a lie as I can't allow him to live with such knowledge.  As I've said, I feel like I'm missing something, and so before I take any action, I'd like to hear what you have to say.  Ever yours,  Adam Gray  ---   From: Gray, Adam hawaiianfridays@outlook.com  Date: Wed, Apr 1, 2015  Subject: PLEASE DISREGARD!  To: yachtracer22@gmail.com  Cc:  PLEASE DISREGARD THE PREVIOUS EMAIL.

It risks getting cocked in the large intestine, though. Might come out sideways.   Durgonfry was better.  BUZZBUZZ   So it's a LOST situation then.  ^Fuck ^^that ^^^show.   Okay. As I said, I actually like this story. These are just some notes (and sorry they're late.)  So, you start right off talking about "the cold." Now, I really like the types of stories that you can read two ways. You can either believe that there was a monster that the guard tried to warn them about (which the narrator obviously seems to believe) or that it's really just the cold that killed them (frostbite, dangers of climbing, etc.).  I was thinking, to further set up the monster side of things, shouldn't it be called the Russian word for cold? (xlod)   1. Your formatting got eaten. Especially during dialogue, you have to double space or put two spaces at the end of the line or it won't go to the next line. Also, you need to take the tab/indent at the beginning of the last few paragraphs. Reddit formats that like code without wrapping, so it's hard to read.  2. "To be continued?" Please don't do this. There's no reason for it. Write your story all the way through and post it. Unless it really *has* to be in multiple parts, don't.   What you've basically got right now is a start without the intention of finishing. Which leads to...  3. Where's the horror? In order to post to /r/nosleep, you have to have a complete story, and this one hasn't started yet. There's some mystery (what happened?) and some fantasy elements (Benjamin begets benjamins) but it's not a story with a beginning, middle and end.  Okay, so that's the bad news. The good news is it's mostly well-written and it makes sense to read (you'd be surprised how often that's a problem). I would say, finish it, re-read and do some basic edits and repost it here and I'd be happy to take another look.  Good luck!   Is it Penomenal?   Read the title as   Pen for four people.   With Parkinson's.  And was thinking, *wow, that was impressive even before the Parkinson's.*   Congratulations, /u/the_dalek_emperor!   It could have to do with having low karma on this sub (not overall). You're right that it's reddit and its spam filter but they don't really publish the algorithm they use to calculate it. On /r/writingprompts we used to add people as approved submitters, which factored into the algorithm even though it's a public sub and seemed to help.  This happens especially if someone posts, deletes and tries to repost shortly after.  Can't hurt to try, though that's subjective to the mods I guess.  	114

 Then there's villians being killed off too soon like Scarecrow's dad and The Ogre, they should have been characters in the background causing mischief instead of being killed off so soon, they would have been great season villians in the shadows  Then there's The Flying Graysons, why only one episode and have their dispute resolved in one episode, they should have still had their dispute but come back in season 2 having resolved issues, then at least we would have believed it and it would be a great motif every season to have them return for a few episodes  Then there's Arkham, the whole Arkham promise has not been lived up to and should have been given far more attention, Gordon should have had a part time role in there for half the season then we would have gotten lots of little side stories featuring the odd villian we all know and would have been the great place to throw in Easter Eggs like colours / sounds / symbols / costume nods, it would have been a real treat for fans know this week they may get some little nods to the Batman universe   I would also say that whole Fish storyline on the island was pointless  She should have gone underground in the city then we would have had many useful episodes with her amassing her recruits and indeed luring Selena along, Ivy would have been included as well am sure or would have been on hand and picking up tips for her future self, maybe a young Harley would have been around as well  All this would have laid great groundwork for future younger villains but instead they put her on that god awful island which was a totally pointless plot device and detracted from everything else   I know they only planned for fewer episodes in season 1 so had to pad out the season which made for odd stories and was very hard to follow in places   The show runners have said that they will arc the entire second season with multiple mini arcs, meaning we should have a far more coherent package    I'd disagree, the first season was hard to follow   Season 2 will be a far more coherent package    Figured it may be a good idea to change the intro mood every season   Like first few seasons it starts dark then gradually gets lighter over time   Like the fonts and visual styles adapting to the season's main story arcs  Even the music themes could change from brooding Bruce to lighter Batman   Okey dokey ladies and gentlemen  What's in store for Riddle Man then?  From multiple personalities to what next  I'd love it if he went on a sadistic spree under the radar for an entire season  Be good to have him conflicting himself, like someone self imploding every second  Like self doubting his own motives, his every move, the truest form of insanity  This would be an epic descent in to the world he becomes but what of Ms Kringle  Maybe she will be the ultimate catalyst for his ascension to the dark side, she's such a cock blocker lol  If she carries on teasing and messing with his head, you'd not blame him for ultimately slaughtering her   Wow, looks like Selena will have her lethal little cat claws out soon lol   Well, season 3 has just ended and now a teaser for season 4  Are they shooting back to back seasons now with no breaks?   RIP Robert Stack, you are still missed and a class act till the very end  His voice alone gave us chills, he really brought reconstructions to life   When will this be available in the UK, will these be available at my local electronics store?

 Wil Wheaton got pepper on his dick and dipped his junk in milk in his son's favorite mug. Apparently he gave his son that mug as a gift when he moved into a new house.       A guy on an empty elevator risks a fart. The fart ended up smelling much worse than he had predicted. In an act of desperation, he begins pulling out pine scented car fresheners to mask the scent. The elevator stops and a lady and a drunk guy get on. The drunk guy sniffs in disgust and says  "It smells like someone shit out a Christmas tree."  	3

The third week was much better and now I'm doing just fine.    Same sort of situation too. 3 years together, she came from money, I didn't. She wanted to be engaged, I don't have the money. She just got her masters degree and is set to live with her parents for a year. We fought about stupid stuff all the time.    As much as I hated to see her go, in the end it was for the best.     I was able to finally do what I wanted: move out of Texas. Now I have a job lined up in DC that I will start at the beginning of next month.    A great book that is helping me get through this is called "How to Survive the Loss of a Love" and I have a copy that I am more than willing to send to you.

And just in case you don't know exactly what the USA Freedom Act really is:  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act      Booo   Bring your concerns to his/her attention. He/She might give you what you want.   Or maybe it would have and they thought the filibuster was unnecessary?    Nah.   Remember the first time Rand Paul filibustered and the top article on Reddit's front page was about it? Remember the first comment? Here's a refresher in case you don't:    "And Bernie voted YES!"    That was a load of horse shit. Bernie voted yes for cloture. That means he voted yes to having a vote. He did not vote yes on the bill itself.      Whatever user made that comment is a smart cookie. He knew reddit never actually reads articles or confirms them with their own research. So what we got was everyone shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS DOMESTIC SPYING?" when in reality they should've been shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON THIS BILL!?" which doesn't sound as circlejerky.   It wasn't that soon after. You're just appealing to reddit's dick.   Booooo   Back when the game was good.   Why would you put ice cream in your back pocket? Weren't your afraid it would melt and get your pants/shorts all icky?    I can't wait until this isn't a thing anymore.   It happened at college campuses too.    Oh, shit is bright!   $45 dollar flight from Dallas to DC? I'll take a little shit.   Why didn't they do this at night?   Baby, did you just fart because you blew me away.   The program will die with or without Rand's filibuster. He is just doing this for PR. Bernie knows it will die and wants to stop Rand's huge waste of time.     His point is: "Rand is better"  I completely disagree.    I appreciate your appreciation.   Better enjoy it. Bird flu has taken 50 million chickens to heaven.   Where did you hear that?   Ah, it all made sense with the band at the end. Thank you for the explanation.   Ok, I know this is real. Like, no little play sets, but why do the people look like they are claymation?   I would love a resume spruce up. I will PM you.   The link is broken. You need to take the 'www.' out of it.      That is odd. I'm not sure why it's not working. I viewed it in incognito mode without any problems.      I didn't like the game but I am from the area that the first sequence happens in. It was cool to be able to recognize where they were in regards to me being in that location!   Deus Ex: Human Revolution  Not just a great opening, but a great plot and story.   "Edit: Front page!   Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"   I was a little shit in elementary school.     In 5th grade my mother, sister, and I moved out to a rural area from an urban area because my parents separated.     Coming from an urban school I had this shitty mentality that I was smarter than all of the rural kids. I wasn't very nice to my classmates or teacher. I was a really shitty kid.    Anyhow, I had a terrible problem turning assignments in, so bad that my teacher did not allow me to participate in the honors program at my school. Naturally I was angered by her actions and over the next couple of days disrespected her constantly! She finally had the last straw, grabbed my arm and dragged me to the front office to retrieve my mother's contact information that was located in a rolodex on a form all students turned in at the beginning of the year.    She's spinning and searching and finally located my form...  "OF COURSE!" she exclaimed "It's a blank piece of paper because you never turn anything in!"  I just smirked devilishly.    She brought me back to the classroom and told me to call my mother from the classroom phone. I started to punch in a bunch of random numbers and professed that I didn't remember it (I was lying).  TL;DR: I was a little shit.    Holy shit, leave the innocent animals out of your crusade! If this was a member/members of FLDS, they are going to have a hard time getting into heaven with this on their resume.    Where did you hear that?   Once a cheater always a cheater!  Either she did this to you before and you forgave her OR this story is complete bullshit with a phrase reddit throws around that gets upvoted.   I think it's just the users from racist subreddits that jack each other off in default sub posts that involve race.    FANTASTIC!    So, I was able to test the part. It functioned accordingly. The problem went away for a bit but I decided to retest the error codes.    It still said 14. Anyhow, I immediately started the engine in order to run the car for a bit (with the paper clip still in the connector) and the car jumped then completely shut down. Now the dash isn't getting any power, turning the key does nothing. No lights, no A/C, nothing.    What did I do wrong?   You can download a pizza????   Just ran the test and got a 14. [If this chart is correct](http://honda-tech.com/honda-accord-1990-2002-2/check-engine-light-codes-cel-diagnostic-trouble-codes-dtc-malfunction-indicator-light-mil-1490107/), it is indeed the IACV.     14 P0505 ICS Malfunction   14 P1508 IAC Valve Circuit Failure   14 P1509 IAC Valve Circuit Failure   14 P1519    Idle Air Control Valve Circuit Failure    What is the best way to test it, or rather, how do I test it with the method you mentioned?   Imagine the domino explosion effect that would take place if this was a GTA game.   Awesome! I lost my book awhile back, thanks for the link!   Thank you for your response!  That was one of the first things I did to it once the issue arose. I cleaned the IACV and put it back in and bought a new MAP sensor to put in. Maybe I should try a new IACV?   Could old fuel be causing this issue? When it finally gave out it was about 3/4th of the way full. Anyway to responsibly dispose of that gas so I can fill it with fresh gas?     What's the best way (and cheapest) to look for leaks in the vacuum?     I have checked around to make sure no wires have been chewed up: all clear.  I cleaned the throttle body like 3 years ago and I recently cleaned the IACV. MAybe I should get a new IACV?   Thanks! I do not know how to access the trouble codes, but I will google it.  I have cleaned the IACV (like in January) and the it's been about 3 years since the throttle body has been cleaned.    You can get MRSA from popping a pubic zit?   I heard it's another way he punishes his wife.   I could be wrong! Another user responded to me.   What about the actual question? Who would you vote for?   Hmm...    It must have been the mod from Arma 3.    I remember trying to download the client and it was taken down.    You're taking about the Arma 2 mod, that one is still up?   Last I checked, DayZ mod doesn't exist anymore because of copyright issues that spawned from the standalone.  I tried playing a couple of weeks ago with no luck, or maybe that was a DayZ mod for Arma 3. I am having troubles recalling.       Yep, just rustling some jimmies.    You have a source on that stat?   Just like concealed/open carry holders!   I must've missed that!    Where'd you hear that!?    Baltimore ~~Protesters~~ Looters/Rioters Tried To Light This Pizza Shop Owner on Fire   A browser you could log into and it would save your bookmarks.  I submitted a business tip to Google back in 2010 about this idea. A year and a half later it was an option in Chrome.   Would I have liked to be the catalyst in that? Yes.  Is it possible it was already in development before the time of my email? Yes.  I will never know.   Google, if you are reading this, I am sorry my immature younger self reacted to this situation. In five years I have really grown and now I look back and think: 'how stupid/arrogant were you!'    Dude, I am in the same situation!   You wouldn't happen to be in higher education, would you?    Hands off my jerbs. Hahaha, jk. I hope we can both land a gig!   Do you know any good recruiters?   You're a server admin? That's awesome! How did you get there? Just volunteering? What was your first job?   Well, that department has a great retention rate, so I don't see any positions opening for the next 3 years.   I do have a linkedin! I updated it last week. What else should I include on it?   How the heck do I convince a company that I am great with technology?   I graduated with a BA in History but I've been working on computers since I was 9 years old. I am currently 25 and I am called upon in my office when someone's computer is malfunctioning. 99% of the time I fix it, and we HAVE AN **IT** DEPARTMENT!!!!  I've applied to numerous IT positions in the Dallas area and have created a great cover letter to supplment my application that goes over my qualification. I'm getting antsy though! I have on heard back from one employer who asked for an interview, when I told him the times I was available, he never got back to me!   I have two months to find a position in the Dallas area or I am going to be homeless.    Rip non mobile users. Lol   He did!? I MUST'VE MISSED IT!   BOOO CAPTIONS   Where did you hear that?      So much passive aggression!       I would buy this.    Staphylococcus = Staph infection  Staph sounds like Staff.  It's essentially 'Staff Only'    Edit: Don't google 'staph infection' unless you'd rather not eat today.    Yeah! It's made of ducks.   BOOO CAPTIONS   Nice to know that this information was posted in /r/games before this shitty meme subreddit.    You're part of the problem.   Remember, these aren't protesters. These are looters.

We do. Dude is lame.   If you have to watch half of it for it to be good, then it isn't good.   Look, if the content takes a hit then the users will be okay with power users.     It's the old kings conundrum. We try to 'rule' in favor of the majority. We have been having a lot of outcry about power users. We made a survey, we are listening to the voters, if they become unhappy with their decision, we can vote to change it back.  I just wanted to keep this democratic.       I knew a guy that was in the movies about racing cars. He died in a freak car accident.    0, it's just meme advertising.    Yeah, looks like reddit circlejerkers are displeased with our opinions.

 Do you live on the first world?   Thus spoke Zarathustra.   Now, who is Victoria?   That was more toward the middle of the book. The book ended with Napoleon getting to Moscow, but left us with a cliff hanger.    This is why body cameras work well. We now clearly see that he was armed and there isn't any question of why the officers did what they did.   Yes.    I thought each occasion operates separately from the others      I'm going to Rutgers. Ouch.    That's simply not true. In your Camry or whatever sedan you prefer, an additional 4400 lbs would be devastating. Bear in mind that the most additional weight your car ever carries might be you and 4 passengers so ~900lbs. Now multiply that by ~4.5 and you're in a whole heap of shit. Or should I say, sand.    I have an old monitor and am looking to buy a new one, but I've never purchased a dedicated gaming monitor. I've narrowed it down to two monitors. The **BenQ GW2760HS 27-inch VA panel HDMI LED-lit Monitor** or **ASUS VE248H 24-Inch Full-HD LED-lit LCD Monitor with Integrated Speakers**. These are the ones I've found, but I'm open to other suggestions that are in the 200$ area. Thanks!   Anything with free dlc makes me cum.    Can you tell me what the weekend rule is? Not because I don't know. Just to prove that you really know    God.    But that means you're running 12 miles. It's not about the math, just the fact that most people can't do that.    They will have achieved their end goal of making everyone a fan of half life 3   Thanks a lot! I've gotta get on this.    What mod adds that Roman armor?   You're a freak.

 Gross   I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd rather have cakepops   Can we agree to call it something else then? It looks and tastes nothing like cheesecake    While we're at it can we shame all these "no-bake"  recipes? No bake cheesecake is just not cheesecake, it's just awful tasting laziness. If you want something that's like cheesecake, just fucking make a cheesecake. It's not that difficult.   *edit* and of course on the same day I complain about it here, someone on my Facebook shared a link to a mom blog   http://www.mybakingaddiction.com/no-bake-smores-cheesecake/   I've always liked allrecipes. The comments on recipes are usually good thetr   That would have made the post a lot funnier though    I remember being 10 and wanting to go to that movie but by the time my parents let me go, the theater didn't have any of those cards. Most disappointing day of my childhood.    Aw hell I didn't see that, that would have saved me an hour and a half   I make a good crust but the thing about a good crust is the proofing time. Developing the gluten is what gives the pizza dough a great taste. So because of my laziness, I'd instead just pick up a couple of dough balls from a local pizza place. The dough balls were only $2.50 each. So I got the benefit of great pizza dough from a place where they had better control over proofing the dough rather than my haphazard methods   I'd withdraw every penny every day. What I'd have to show for it was a room with a growing pile of cash in it. After a week I'd buy a house with 100% cash and start a cash pile room in that house. Then after another week I'd buy another house, and so on   We had a tire tear apart on our trailer travelling on the interstate. I stayed with the trailer and my parents took off to the nearest town to get a replacement. MHP officer stopped to see what they could do to help while we were waiting on the side of the road. Helped us bend the wheel well back out as the tire strands wrapped around it and pulled it into the tire further    What extensions did you use for YouTube? I've never really liked YouTubes layout but I've never seen anything that really fixes what I don't like. For example, I'm not a huge fan of the fact that collections were a pop-up/hover over menu. I'd constantly move the mouse too far and then have to hover over the collection again. And in general the YouTube page design is cluttered and convoluted, I prefer having these lists   I'll try to get back to you on this, at one point I had this same problem but figured out how to get rid of the channels so I'll look around and see what I did. It may have been something I did with collections though so it may not work anymore    This took me a bit of time to do but there's a little trick that speeds the process up. First you want to go to feedly and create an account. Then go to the chrome Web Store and search for a feedly extension. This extension will add a button on the navigation/url bar that will appear whenever you're on a page you can subscribe to with Feedly.   The best way to do this is to go to "manage subscriptions" and go through the list one by one. Click on the channel, then click the button on the nav bar, subscribe and add/create the appropriate folders, rinse and repeat.   The only downside is that feedly will only keep 29 days worth of content unless you specifically save certain links I think. But I actually like this better because now it acts more like an email inbox which is what I always wished YouTube could be like. You can basically mark individual videos or channels as read and see only videos you haven't watched yet. No more coming back to a channel after a week to pick up on a series again only to find that your watched history has been cleared and you don't know what episode you were on.   I hope this is helpful to anyone missing the collections.   This reminds me very much of the Pokemon drinking boardgame which has gotten me extremely fucked up a multitude of times   I thought /r/Games and /r/gaming had the same mods   Because reasons   I almost wish that was me. I didn't even know that there was a multiplayer mod for this game. I suppose virtual traffic jams could also be /r/mildlyinfuriating         Compton    Why should webber only eat monster jerky?    In all my recent games so far I've survived almost exclusively on trapping rabbits and spiders and having a bird cage. I always camp near 4-6 rabbit holes. Even without filler that has been enough for my survival via meatballs. But if you're also close to a spider nest you can trap spiders too. I know you can easily fight them but kiting them far enough away at dusk so their friends don't join in takes longer than leading them into traps after stepping on the web.  If I have regular meat I'll use morsels, monster meat, and regular meat to make a meaty stew, otherwise, I cook the monster meat and feed it to my bird for eggs. Then I use my morsels and eggs to make bacon and eggs which gives 75 hunger and also gives you a good amount of sanity and health   Was the expansion out then? I only started playing a few months ago. If you have never played the expansion you're in for a treat. There is so much more content in it and even more ways to die   /r/cameramangore   These are the best kind of prank phone calls, where they're making the person on the other side laugh   Yeah subreddit of the day is hardly a prestigious award   I cam see why, that looks disgusting    All the otaku purists who have a vendetta against an American spin on a classic  Japanese food i guess   I never called the gobbler sushi. It's deep fried deliciousness. When I lived in Bozeman I usually ate sushi at watanabe    That won't work too well when they can pull up the pictures from the hundred cameras that take pictures of you at the last weigh station you drove through and it didn't coincide with your logbook   He respawns as regular chester    I'm so glad they built another one in billings. I still had a card with 9 punches on it from Bozeman and got my 10th here in billings. Still waiting for the perfect time to cash in on my free sandwich    Go to Daves sushi and get the gobbler. It's one thing I have had in Bozeman that I haven't even come close to experiencing elsewhere    I play the same way as you, with a controller on my couch. I haven't tried any friendly-fire mods yet, I usually just drop the eyebone a little ways away before I get into conflict. I don't know about the glommer though as I've never gotten him   None of the places listed in this thread    You can trust him, he's Dr. Bees   I tried adding channels to feedly but for some reason, I can't scroll down on anything. I use this computer from the couch so I have a logitech keyboard with a touchpad and the only real good way to navigate pages is with the arrow keys, which don't work on feedly. Is there another good alternative for rss feeds?   Googling it you can find their website where you can buy it from: http://www.9fingersmustard.com/  The website doesn't say where else you can find it, though I'd recommend hitting up rosauers or even town and Country. They seem to have odds and ends you can find many places   *edit* you could try Joes Parkway too    Yeah I know that but the way he worded that suggests that deerclops is harder to kill in subsequent winters    Physics teachers always have an advantage in the engagement department. My high school physics teacher was like this and my college professor was the same way. Physics has a lot of real life applications with concepts that can easily be shown in engaging demos. There isn't much engaging about showing off the real life applications of using integrals to find the surface area of a 3-dimensional curve   That's pretty much the same story with any brand you find in Walmart    What happens after the first winter then?    Meanwhile I just got destroyed by a deerclops at day 31 because I wasn't ready for it   pretty sure I've seen her in another music video but I can't recall which   I like how that last one is a ghost    Management for places like that bitch about you being there too long after closing and that you should be walking out the door at closing time   They got dropped by gawker because companies they shit on pay gawker for ad space    Not to mention how sexist it is toward women in the first place to make a blanket statement saying females are bad at negotiating their salaries    20 minutes fly time is the most impressive part to me. I have a small quad copter and it gets like 6   WHY AM I FINDING THIS OUT AT TWENTY-FUCKING-FIVE YEARS OLD!?    If you have Android, you can use the Dolphin browser to switch your user agent to desktop. I use chrome for most things but if there's an awful mobile website involved that refuses to let me use the desktop site, I use Dolphin    We had to supplement with formula because he wasn't getting enough and was under weight for a little while. Eventually he just didn't want to breastfeed and we had to go to gas relief formula because he had gas pretty bad. At 6 months we were able to switch him to regular formula and started getting Costco stuff. Now at 10 months he's constantly refusing to drink formula and it's a fight to get him to drink what he needs, it's been hell trying to get him to drink water too. I really hope he'll like milk more when he gets to a year   I don't know what I expected to see here   Deaddove.tif   Htc one m8 here, Google Play says my device is incompatible and manually downloading the App, my phone wouldn't let me install it   The only guys who seem to get them are the bison and a bear or two    That's actually a cool detail for a horror adventure map   You could always make a burnt popcorn ale   Either way, it's not the solution I want    Hmm, I always use L on my keyboard. Never changed keyboard settings.    I'm still waiting for a feature that allows me to set subtitles on a show by show basis instead of making a global default. I watch enough anime that it's a pain to turn them on for every episode but I watch enough regular TV that it would be a pain to turn off for every episode. I don't care how simple it is to press L and change it, the point of having as much automation as possible is to not have needless button presses    I90 eastbound in Montana about a half hour away from Billings?    Where do I sign up?    That's weird, up here in Montana you get a temporary paper that shows when it expires and you have to have a plate on. That being said, even though I am a lawful citizen and pay my car registration every year, I haven't put my updated stickers on since 2009, so I've been driving with out of date tags for almost 6 years and have never gotten pulled over for it   I might have to check that out someday. I've been wanting to get into DnD but I have no idea what I'm doing and also having a hard time dropping $120 for 3 separate books   Montana   A good alternative name to the Streamline in Bozeman   That's actually a really awesome idea   Where's KAB at? I've lived here forever and only ever known about Splash Page   As much as I've always loved the idea of a LAN. I'm far too lazy to ever move my desktop for anything but routine maintenance    As someone with Charter, I definitely agree there. I still like Cablevision better but Charter has doubled our base download speed twice since taking over just under two years ago.   One time we fit 80-90 people on a bus that only seats 23   Yeah it was an outside job, few hundred employees spread across the state. If we wanted it cold we would have to bring ice and use our own coolers because it would get used so fast there was no point to toss it in a fridge. Probably about an entire pallet every month for each location    Not in the kitchen industry but I once worked for a place that spent thousands of dollars per year to supply their workforce with free Powerade every summer   I can't get gifsound.com links to work ever, but that isn't limited to reddit is fun, those don't work on any browser I have   Is this cosplayer male or female?    That actually sounds really awesome. I'll have to do that on the next world with the wife   Having a kid that demands my attention for most of the time I'm home as well as a job where I'm up and out the door by 5am will do that. I pretty much don't have time for any game where there is a significant time investment    Don't Starve is what I've been playing   traffic is only great if you live west of main street. You get to avoid a good portion of the shitty traffic on your way home. The whole one way in and out thing blows. They keep making more roads but they all still pretty much converge in one area   I was about to do this but got killed by other spiders in another area :(   I haven't really played any. I played minecraft and was doing that when they started adding the BS survival stuff like hunger. It felt like it had no point to me because you could easily make a shit load of wheat farms with no effort and then you could just have a stack of bread that would last you a week. It just felt like a cheap half assed attempt at "difficulty" and all it did was waste an inventory spot when spelunking. I've been meaning to get into 7 days to die and project zomboid as I think those look great, but noting else was really appealing. I fell in love with don't starve the first time I saw someone play it on YouTube. The art direction is great as well   I'm so fucking bad at kiting :( I was just on day 30 and got killed. I was on nearly the most perfect world and had the best start ever. Got a bunch of meat right off the bat because I started near pigs and merms fighting. Found a pig village with king and spread out pig houses and spider dens. Then next to that was an awesome field of rabbit holes that has given me tons and tons of morsels, then a little further there was a massive beefalo herd. Just an awesome location and I got fucked because I got cocky with a tier 3 spider den   I try to post as often as I can to keep discussions going. I love this game. By far my favorite survival roguelike I've ever played.    I have a bunch of traps for rabbits in my world but some happen to be somewhat near a spider nest. I went to go collect one day and found monster meat in one and came to the conclusion that my traps were getting spiders. I set up a couple more closer to the next and sure enough, the next day they were filled with monster meat, spider glands, and silk.   By this time, the nest was tier 3, I went to attack it because I needed more silk and ran through my traps, capturing all the spiders, and then went back and killed the nest without issue and replanted the egg.   Does anyone else do this for spider nests?   I'd say shadow of mordor, though inquisition you'll get much more playtime out of   More or less, yeah. It comes down to controller for me. I liked the 360 controller more than ds3 so I almost always got 360 games. Currently I prefer ds4 to the xbox one controller.    What's eso? And for the Witcher I was probably going to get on PC   All I have on xbox one is master chief collection. I should note I have shadow of mordor, latest assassin Creed, destiny, and dragon age inquisition on the ps4      I'm not finding Android system Web view in my app manager    Gifs work for me except on gifsound.com  https://gifsound.com/?gfycat=BitesizedIckyArabianoryxv=aoxF29RI2Bss=5   It is apparent that it's fake but hilarious nonetheless    And as a trumpet player, I'm not sure how I feel about it   It was Microsoft Points that got transferred to dollars when they changed that system and it expires June 1st   I'm not sure if /r/trumpet would love this or hate it   He doesn't even have to accuse them. They've been pretty shameless to this fact    Verizon here, I have shit tons of icons too   Are you sure about that? Pixar has a new movie every single year    Make a ton of guac and freeze it   There's a Chinese knockoff ipod touch called the itouch   Yeah OP's title pissed me off.

I built my second desktop after having a laptop for four years that I got during college. It has been four years since I built it and it is still doesn't feel aged at all, whereas when I built it, my laptop was practically falling apart    As long as they keep 3d animation out of it    /r/showerthoughts    Every account on reddit is a bot except you.

I actually like willow. I know torches are cheap but I like not having to make them. I also make frequent use of charcoal over wood for fires so I always have little patches of trees growing. Sanity is never an issue when you can go light a patch of trees on fire and stand in the middle of it. What I do hate though is that she can be immune to fire but not overheat, which doesn't make sense because I think the two should go hand in hand. I also hate the glitch of setting crock pots on fire if you're holding your lighter, which I think was fixed in the base game, but I use a modded willow with her regular abilities for DST playing with my wife   Lollipop issue?    It seems that for the most part there are the same mods as the base game, but are there different ones as well? What are your go-to mods to enhance your DST game?   Also, is there a mod that allows shared map revealing? My wife and I try to explore different areas to find the best spot for camp, using the fact that there are two of us means we can explore twice as much land, but then we end up with differently revealed maps   I've just read a few things here, occasionally making threads.

 People have been burned by Obama enough to not give Paul the benefit of the doubt. Remember how Gitmo was supposed to be closed on day 1? How long do you think it will take for President Paul to end the NSA spying programs if this bill passes?   I would argue the opposite about Dany and Cersei. It's been shown time and time again (at least in the shows) that she is way too naive and idealistic to know how to actually rule over people, yet alone take care of her dragons. "I'll free the slaves and everything will fall into place!" Perhaps it's also Emilia Clarke's terrible acting chops, but she is also portrayed in the television series as a petulant and stubborn teenager who constantly has to admit that her inner circle was right all along.  In Cersei's case, her thirst for power and control leads her to do batshit insane things that blow up in her face in the books. All because is an alcoholic who is paranoid about losing the only thing that gives her agency in the world: being able to manipulate and control her children.  In Sansa's case, why would you expect her to become stronger? She has not shown much indication of being particularly bright (unlike Arya).  One message that I think the show is trying to get across is that there are power structures that are out of everyone's control, no matter how hard they try to get out.   I don't understand why either -- Sansa was always depicted as a pathetic character since the beginning of the series. She is naive, selfish, not very bright, and at the mercy of everyone of around her. For four seasons she looked like she was going to burst into tears at any moment. Why would it make any sense for her of all people to successfully and suddenly gain control of her life?   So you think it's realistic for a teenage girl to pull some Littlefinger bullshit on a psychopath? That over the course of half a season she suddenly develops magical manipulative powers despite being horribly naive and selfish for the rest of the show?   I think the whole point that characters like Sansa, no matter how hard they try (twice in this episode!) to show agency, they are ultimately pawns of abusive men? Personally to me it is ridiculous to imagine that Sansa is even capable of seducing Ramsay or to escape with her own wit given the fact that for 95% of the series she was a naive teenager eager to marry Joffrey.  A lot of people have confused ASOIAF's supposedly feminist leanings to mean that women are empowered in the story. Quite the opposite: the point is to show how virtually all of the women in the series (and of the world, as a broader social commentary) are brutalized and manipulated by men, and this is supposed to bring a accordingly visceral reaction in the viewer.  I like to compare this show to how the plot develops in The Wire: no matter how hard people try, people are trapped in the institutions that they were born or raised in. They are victims of power structures, and things always stay the same.   The problem is that professors expect capabilities of undergrads that are today found in grad students. Undergrad thermo isn't for deep comprehension but rather for basic understanding and proving you can compute numbers and algebra.   I can't help but point out that the article is terribly skewed. The vast majority of taxi drivers in big cities don't own their own medallions, but rent them out from medallion holders (or in this case, holding companies which possess tons of medallions -- technically illegal but they get around it).   In my recent travels I made an effort to talk to some Uber drivers about their experiences with taxi companies. To rent a medallion, you have to pay an advance. Drivers in Boston told me it was $500 a week, drivers in NYC said $135-$175 *per day*. This is before you pick up even a single ride.  Sure, Uber can be an asshole company, but drivers are paid flexibly. In the cities that I've used it, they even get paid while en route to the pickup and are paid nominally for a cancellation. Uber gets a cut of the driver's revenue, but it's in direct proportion to the amount that they drive.  The entire taxi medallion industry exploits the shit out of the driver labor force. What Uber is doing is allowing a huge labor pool that wants to participate in the industry to do so. Sure, Uber may change their payment schemes and will probably go evil, but they unleashed a new business model that won't be going away.   Why should the government help someone out on an investment that didn't pan out 20-30 years into the future?   I wouldn't say the series is not predictable. It definitely is -- you just have to have a pessimistic outlook on how the plot will develop.   To take it a step further, there are literally more East Asians and South Asians in the world that come from underprivileged backgrounds than there are white Americans. It should be illegal to have a drop down menu for your ethnicity in your application for college, and instead that information as well as your socioeconomic status should come from your personal statement.   Your teacher is wrong -- young people these days are reading more than ever, especially from mobile devices. The difference is that they are reading short form.   The point is that it's all upfront costs for cheap energy over the cost of its lifetime. No company (or government) is willing to put up with that kind of burden.   I'd say there were two proximal causes: one is Maliki, the other being the Arab Spring spreading to Syria. All of a sudden you have a bunch of secular dictatorships being thrown into disorder, and while the US put in some limited intervention into Libya, they stupidly did not engage Syria as much as they could diplomatically or militarily.   Shit, I still remember the days of finding bootleg FLAC audio from shows.   I mean, in the books she is a child/teenager. I'd think that most child rulers would act the way she is depicted on TV, especially since they don't have the maturity or emotional subtlety of a seasoned politician.   My favorite is to hold my hand out, palm up, and rubbing my index, middle, and thumb together like the "money" gesture. Every cat seems to think it's food and will come to your hand.   I had really complicated cystic acne up until I was about 27, and then had flareups now and then. Big ones, like up to an inch in diameter and half an inch high. Accutane was the only thing that got rid of it. After growing up with it, I make a conscious effort to never judge anyone for acne issues. To me, it's so condescending to even think that people who have acne problems are *not* trying to take care of it.   When he says it's his last time, he means until they pay him enough money for a sequel.   I agree that he did a lot, but the consensus is that civil liberties and how it relates to national security is a big issue that wasn't substantially debated in the past 8 years. I'm glad that the Republicans will have a throw down on this because it forces Clinton to take a stand. It's pretty clear that while Obama did a lot domestically that would be considered progressive, he is about the same as bush when it came to clandestine or CIA/NSA policies.   I live in Palo Alto. Wouldn't say people are extremely trusting, but definitely nicer than most parts.   I've heard that it's not uncommon for some women to be sexually aggressive after recalling sexual abuse. Apparently it's a mechanism for them to regain some sort of agency over their own bodies?   Here's the ultimate conspiracy theory: police aren't into "crime prevention" tactics and more into punishment because it ultimately keeps crime rates up and allows them to keep their jobs. When you depress the local economy by indiscriminately arresting and taking away people's licenses, you end up pushing people through the cracks of society (eg. they lose their jobs because they can't drive to work, fining the shit out of them for police revenues, etc). Consequently you end up with a higher crime rate in which now police are "indispensable".   Pharmacogenomics -- aka correlating drug effects and interactions with genomic variants -- is still a really young field. There are certainly a few interesting hits.  The biggest "personalized" medicine application that would come from exome or WGS data is in the context of cancer treatments. There are a lot of molecular subtypes and actionable genes which determine the specific targeted therapy to be used.   I work in the personalized medicine and genomics field. It's a provocative headline, but practically what it means is better clustering of patients for trials. We already do this today but the cohorts and selection of patients is really crude and isn't based on much molecular information. In fact, I bet if we had exome or whole genome data for every single trial that had failed in the past we could probably cluster them in such a way that those drugs could be approved but under special indications.   The party leader, if prime minister, has strong power over the legislative branch. Even if he or she gets pushed out by the party, it is only after they finish out their term. So you'd get four or five years of a dangerously unqualified candidate. And this is speaking as an extremely left wing Canadian.   It's not just black people. There's a also a very distinct Asian American/Canadian "accent".   No, he was 99% sure that you like him. It's just that when you invite him to your room to drink, on the 1% chance that he's incorrect it would turn into a Really Bad Situation. That, and he probably respects you enough to not take advantage of you as the first time you hook up.   Seriously, guys just blank out most of the time. I remember clearly in my sophomore year of college this one girl I was seriously crushing on knocking on my door when I was taking a nap and then asking me out. In my sleepy daze I said "Ummmm, can I think about it?". It was so awkward that she ended up cancelling/un-asking me with some excuse about being busy.   Upvoting you because I'm sure you'll get a downvote brigade pretty soon because of your comments on marijuana. I think it's insane that people think drugs that mess with your perception of reality have little side effects. Personally I don't smoke it anymore, drink socially, and even my caffeine intake is a lot less than it used to. A lot of people have problems with self-control and "dosage" control, so what ends up happening is that these chemicals will really ruin your emotional and mental well-being.   A psychologist (not mine, but one I know) once told me that one of the first questions she asks someone when they report having anxiety is about how much coffee they drink on a regular basis. Apparently caffeine intoxication is very common and is often misdiagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder.   I would eat raw whole mushrooms. Is that weird?   The difference is that there are a ton of other heavyweights in the field that can or do practice EEE. Apple and Google routinely pull this shit.   Not just that, but a big fuck you to everyone else. "Why should the public get free toilet paper?"   Don't do that, unless you want to get an opportunistic skin infection.  Maybe a better idea: somehow get a of sweat from someone who doesn't smell that bad (eg. give them a towel after they exercise), and squeeze it under your armpits.   I don't understand the current protesting strategy. It's idealistic and not pragmatic at all. If you want to affect change, you need to (1) separate yourselves effectively from violent protestors, and (2) have longevity in your movement. To achieve these aims it is way more productive to just disband as soon as the rioting shitheads come along so the police can round them up. Then you come back the next day, 7am. Rinse and repeat. You build upon daily momentum rather than sticking it out as long as possible every night and have it burn up (figuratively) quickly like a candle. The most successful movements have come about with persistence, not intensity.   I agree. Lining up in front of the police is saying "think about what looting and arson does for your community". Then again, I doubt the message of going to protest peacefully with the other 10k+ citizens will resonate with the rioters, considering that many of them are reportedly not even from the Baltimore area and couldn't give two shits about community.   Ding ding ding! These guys are probably anti-violence, not pro-police. You'd probably be hard pressed to find people being overly supportive of the police, but lining in front of them will deter violence and prevent the situation from escalating. They don't want their city to turn into a warzone.   I was at the AACR conference this past week and people are really excited about this type of treatment, called immune checkpoint blockade therapy. We are on the cusp of seeing a broadly applicable drug that can be teamed up with all kinds of targeted therapies. There was a trial presented at ASCO last year with pretty incredible results too.  What we now know is this: the immune system can modulate the tumor in good and bad ways. We finally have several drugs that are really potent in getting positive outcomes.   Not just them, but also for a great deal of people in a "professional" job that requires a degree. These people get paid a shit-ton of money, and it's reflected in the demands of their job.  The ads aren't for the average 9-5 person, and it's ridiculous of WaPo to think that it was directed at the average consumer.   On the other hand, I think it is great because it decouples medical testing for routine things from primary care, which means that the system will be less burdened. If I need yearly physical blood work, why should I waste my doctor's time? If I am a hypochondriac, a lab test is the first line of defense against showing up to the doctor and most tests would come up negative. For tests that come up really weird, follow up exams would obviously be ordered by the physician.  The problem is that the process of getting a diagnostic  is really ineffIcient. This helps relieve a bit of that.   It's not just about integration. While there is a stereotype of what it means to be "American", it is actually a very diverse set of identities that change over time. The whole point of being an American is the culture of enduring change.   People talk about a "melting pot" or a "mosaic", but the reality is that North America has had the best record of dealing with immigrants in the entire world. The reason is because for whatever reason, in this continent our identities are not fixed in time. When you go to Europe, or to Asia, there is a strong sense of what it means to be "German", or "French", or "Korean", or "Japanese". It is an identity that is imposed on you and you are rejected from society if you deviate from it. In North America, you are free to set your own identity and that is why immigrants do so well. They can participate as little or as much as they want. Turns out, people like it a lot better when you're not trying to force cultural values down their throats.   Two or three other labs filed patents at around the same period of time. If not Zhang then other labs would be in it for the money. Sometimes the patent is there to put a stick in the ground, and as you said his lab has been very generous in providing reagents and knockout vectors.   This is very American. In Scandinavia and other countries Police aren't trained to shoot to kill.   Seriously, speaking as a very left-leaning person, liberals have no idea how to be a goddamn ally for anything. Many, especially those on the internet, have it ingrained in their head that there is only one true way for social justice and fuck the rest who are different. The left has no shortage of cynical, self-righteous, dogmatic, and segregationist asshats. She is doing something well-intentioned and low-risk to raise a little bit of awareness about poverty -- good for her for doing something, and shame on those who trash her online.   Legalizing and regulating prostitution is a nice first step but it won't stop human trafficking and it definitely won't stop rape. Whenever there are services to be provided, there will always be a way to exploit labor.    Have a PhD in a hard science at an Ivy League and went to a pretty competitive undergraduate program at a public school, so I feel somewhat qualified to comment. My grades weren't straight A+s, but they were pretty decent.  - Do your best to go to class and pay attention. Even if the professor is the worst in the world, at the very least you are copying down notes and have some passive absorption. And would you seriously be studying if you had skipped class?  - Do your problem sets/homework/reading. Even though they are worth a miniscule amount of your grade, keeping up with the course work is an amazing way to prepare for exams. You shouldn't be learning anything new when it's time to hit the books for midterms and finals. Instead they should just be review sessions that go over everything you had learned. That said, practice your problem sets and homework until you can do them without thinking. This applies to basically every single "hard" science course that I can think of. It's especially satisfying when you see a problem on the page during an exam and you don't even hesitate on how to proceed.  - Find a non-distracting environment for you to study. You could do it around friends, at the library, or in a study carrel. But you have to be honest with yourself about how much work you're getting done. If you're falling behind, it's time to find a new place.  - People who get good grades generally have remarkable self-control about when it is time to let loose and when it is time to put the nose to the grindstone. There is an appropriate time and place to party and relax, but part of growing up is knowing when to decline offers to party and get some shit done. There will always be parties later, and IMO they are definitely better after college.  - Looking back at my undergraduate courses, most of them are designed in such a way that it is very hard to outright fail. Even ones like Organic Chemistry and Quantum Mechanics have defined but distinct paths to success. When you are stressed, keep in mind that millions of people have passed these same courses. Most of these courses cover basic and fundamental concepts (even the upper-level ones!) so they are not impossible. They only require effort and hard work.   I think the author has a fundamental misunderstanding of what a promoter is, versus something like a transcription factor. Certainly genes induced using artificial TFs could have off-target/non-specific effects or gene expression changes as a result of overexpression. And there are off-target effects from gene silencing which is featured in some GMOs. But in both cases you are not creating "neo-proteins" that would be harmful when compared to the WT strain.  Even if you create completely artificial genes that are never seen in nature, the bar to accidentally create something actually harmful is very low as compared to chemical exposure in the agricultural food chain.   The coating must be the secret sauce as phosphorothioate oligos have been used for antusense drugs for a long time. I wonder if this could be used for colon cancer?   Catering companies have all sorts of tiers. Bon Appetit caters to multiple Universities here as well as a pretty large private company cafeteria. They all serve food of differing quality depending on how rich the institution is.   I think working in a lab pre-grad school full time should be a definite requirement for new PhD students. Unlike you, most people don't know whether they are cut out for that kind of marathon lifestyle. The fact that you published 4 papers in that 5 year period means you practically have a PhD already, or at the very least you are just as qualified as one. You'll know what needs to be done to get things published!   It doesn't make sense to wait for a processor bump. Literally nobody outside of the tech industry cares about it. What matters are the "peripheral" features, such as a pen, form factor, etc. The 5th gen Core series is more than functional enough.  The big problem though is how to sell this as an improvement over the SP3. It makes sense to push out the SP4 alongside the Windows 10 release as a flagship but they have to make it really compelling. IMO it makes sense to release two different versions of the SP4 -- one that works more like a PC, and one that works more like a tablet. Kind of like differentiating between the iPhone 6 and the 6+.   What about Steve Carrell in Foxcatcher? I mean holy shit.   To be honest, receiving a number from someone who is clearly interested is a nice problem to have. It's literally not even on the same stress level as asking for someone's number and getting it.  It really depends on the two people though and what they are comfortable with. I know plenty of people who are very traditional and wouldn't like it if a guy gave his number instead -- it's as if he doesn't want to put in the effort. And there are plenty of people who would like it.   Didn't Visa and MC announce a tokenization roadmap? http://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-mastercard-to-roll-out-new-cybersecurity-features-1423834542 As it starts to pick up pace and tokenization becomes default, chip and pin or any other "hardware" method will become obsolete.   This doesn't make any sense. If a hen can lay an egg for even two years it's a no brainer. They live in literally concentration camp style conditions, so it makes perfect sense to completely remove one of the primary safety risks that would get a mega-farm in trouble with the FDA/USDA.   Why isn't vaccination standard? Are egg-laying hens too short-lived to make it worthwhile?   The article is confusing. Was she a grad student or a med student?  I think people who attend very prestigious schools have to really worry about their mental health. There is so much pressure to succeed and be #1. Most are focused on THAT ONE GOAL that they are blind to new perspectives and new experiences. That eventually leads to anguish and for a lot of people some kind of mental breakdown. I'm not saying it doesn't happen to people outside of elite institutions but in my experience in all kinds of institutions I feel that people at other Universities tend to be more open-minded about opportunities that are out there.   I think BR is steadily being marketed towards their business professional line in multiple price brackets. Gap is just going to become casual.   Gap can make some pretty decent tees in decent quality. They could seriously enroach on American Apparel's territory if they just had a basic tee line that was half the price. Basic casual button ups are really hard though. Charging $35-40 for a crummy one and then $50-70 for their nice one is absolutely insane when you're supposed to be priced lower than BR and J Crew.   Uniqlo is a hit and miss. Their jeans are pretty nice, but I've had their tshirts fall apart on me easily. Dress shirts are 50-50.   Israel and Egypt have a warming relationship in the past few years. I'd imagine that if the US completely pulls out then a strategic alliance will be signed immediately. You would also see defense pacts with smaller western-leaning Arab countries. It's also not out of the imagination for Saudi Arabia to ally with Israel against Iran. You wouldn't ever get a full blown war in the region but you would see a lot of alliances emerge.   Similar parallels to Judaism, I guess. The analogy works quite well. Sunnis and Shiites' borders transcend countries, so they're perfectly happy slaughtering each other over stupid shit and have no incentive to participate in civil society. Kurds have a lot to lose.   Actually the road to multiparty elections is easier than you think. New parties just have to stop focusing on running for President and instead run for Senate and House races. Regional support is actually quite robust considering that they would be running on local issues (think the Northeast with its independents, and the Tea Party). You could get a reasonably large number of non-D/R representatives in the legislature if people weren't so obsessed over the short game. Once you have a stronghold of regional support, you then spread it to other states and then take it to the executive branch. Strong local support would also mean that it would later translate into strong representation in the Electoral College, meaning that these regional parties would become Kingmakers. It would take decades, but obviously American politicians don't think that far ahead.  Imagine if Florida was dominated by a regional independent party, or similarly with other Purple states. They would have the insider anti-Washington advantage every election and it would be impossible to get rid of them. Everyone would be clamoring for their support.   No kidding. Global foundries' fab capability is far being Samsung. Imagine now having the scale and mobile chip prowess of Samsung and pushing that into x86. It could really give Intel a run for its money.    Yes but as CEO you have a lot of power in dictating how to get growth and make money. Lots of tech companies structure their stock system deliberately such that stupid shareholder shit doesn't happen. You have less power to sue and demand change if your stock class doesn't give you significant voting rights.   I think they're looking at this through the wrong lens. Supporting Android apps is only a bandaid solution unless they can actually get developers to start switching. Apps are the "added value" of a smartphone. They are modular and fit a user's needs. Besides the dialer, maps, browser, and launcher screens, 99% of a user's time on a phone is in an app. What's the point of using a WP phone if those are Android-emulated apps? Is the industrial design compelling enough?  Rather, I think MS needs to put in heavy R D resources to make an app converter for existing Android and iOS apps. Automatic or semi-automatic code generation algorithms have been around for a long time. Even UI can be automatically converted -- most iOS apps follow a standard theme so this should be doable. It will still require manual optimization, but if you can reduce the barrier by at least 10x then you will bring a lot of developers into the fold.   As a scientist, it boggles my mind that this kind of thing can slip through. Do the editors not vet the identities of the peer reviewers? Or even check their email addresses? I would understand if there was a conspiratorial peer review ring between scholars, but this is a case of outright fake reviews with fake names.   Black market stimulants would be my guess. Pilots are known for massive sleep deprivation and exhaustion.   My guess is unlabelled pills for sleep deprivation since he's a pilot of a budget airline. Unregulated amphetamine derivatives.   On the same topic: neonicotinoids are insanely specific for insects. So much that it's hypothesized that they have a dangerously lethal effect to many commensal insects such as bees as collateral damage. The reason they were developed was because the use of organophosphate pesticides is a really potent neurotoxin to people and animals, and is famously harder to work with and dispose.   The real problem is that we arbitrarily decided to side with KSA. I guess at the time they had a lot more oil compared to Iran, but worldwide production of oil has changed the dynamics. Even if you look at the theological shitshow in the Middle East, the Saudis definitely take the cake in being the most brutal. There is a large diaspora of well-educated and liberal Iranians even before their revolution -- it's amazing that the US didn't realize and take advantage of this. If it weren't for the Shah we could have had a thriving democracy in Iran. If we softened our relationship with them today they just might elect some moderate leaders in the next few decades.   Another redditor posted somewhere that getting high from heroin is like a very warm pleasant hug. Doesn't sound like anything special, but it makes you happy. The problem is that the withdrawal is completely disproportionate to the high.   I went to college in Vancouver. The problem with safe injection sites is that while they're a nice idea, it's really only a drop in the bucket if you really want people to be safe. There are a huge amount of heroin addicts who have fallen so far down the cracks and are literally outside of the system that they wouldn't even show up at a safe injection site. There are so many addicts who also don't want to participate in society -- what makes you think they want to show up at a government facility? I guess I'm way too cynical, but I think the safe injection sites are just a cheap way to get political points while ignoring the structural and socioeconomic problems of addiction.   Top.... 100.  Seriously, you should never say "X is a top school" in any subject unless it is literally in the top. Places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford. It makes you look like you're compensating.   What the fuck, if you add $50k a year to even a minimum wage job that her husband could theoretically take, that is still way above the poverty line for Portland. It's not that expensive to live there.   According to another post here, residency matches are 90% and most eventually get placed in a subsequent attempt. You are not entitled to a residency position after medical school? It is a profession dealing with people's lives, so why is there so much controversy about leaving the bottom percent out especially when there are multiple programs for assistance?    Dont we take care of our own? Not really, not unless you come from money. In poor families you become a nurse if you want to aspire to a better life.  Now she's just ranting.  Sounds like entitlement to me, and also sounds like someone who uses her "socio-economic status" to justify her entitlement. You can be financially poor, but if you are at OHSU of all places for medical school then you sure as shit aren't in the same galaxy when it comes to hierarchy in society.    Sometimes I wonder if she is for real. Medical graduates start out as hypochondriacs in their first year, but are trained to not fall down the rabbit hole of self-diagnosis.   90% match resulting in a few hundred people falling through the cracks is still an incredible statistic. How many PhDs end up with a successful postdoc or even a faculty position? As long as there are resources to help them improve the next time around (eg. prelims, etc.) then I'm not exactly sympathetic to the bottom percent of those who don't match. These people are well educated and can do many other things besides medicine. They aren't the bottom 1% of society with little to no social mobility. I'd save my tears for others.   Here's the problem -- she's certainly entitled to your right to have a child, but apparently she wants to have her cake and eat it too. It is really difficult to be a resident, let alone in gen surg, when you are dealing with a newborn. She could have easily placed into another residency program that has more comfortable hours. She's also shockingly unaware of people moving between residency programs. This sounds like a person who did not choose to explore all the options available to her, and didn't want to take a pragmatic approach to her career. She could have been in a surgery program -- it would just be a few more years down the road with another program in between. But instead she blames the system and writes an angry blog post?   That's what bothers me a lot. People who bet the house and gamble on a slim chance, and then blame the system when it doesn't work. You never go all in -- you need to have a contingency plan. Didn't she learn about that when she applied to medical school in the first place? Didn't she apply to any safety schools? Her first mistake was not having a backup in IM or Family Medicine. Lots of people transfer to different residencies, but you need the first foot in the door post-med school.   You know, I'm normally in support of this but if she's knowingly pregnant then I can't be sympathetic. Residencies, especially general surgery ones, have an extremely limited number of spots. They are one of the first lines of defenses in hospitals. It's not like any other job where you can suddenly grab another MD grad out of thin air and have him or her take her spot temporarily. You could argue that you would just have an extra resident once she comes back from maternity leave, but how would you balance out the ongoing training and workload amongst residents? Rules against pregnancy discrimination is very important, but there has to be exceptions in the health care industry where other people's lives are on the line.   I bet he's aiming for a cushy position at Fox News.   It really depends on if the candidates see the cycle as competitive. The 2008 primary was competitive for the Democrats as there was a huge backlash against Bush, so Obama and Clinton jumped in early. This year, because the race is seen to be not very competitive at all (basically Clinton is likely to wipe the floor against many Republican candidates), you have a lot of people who are sitting back and waiting. You don't want a long and protracted campaign to dig up skeletons and have unintentional media snafus.   I think that was the plan, until the Bourne Legacy came out. It's clear he doesn't have the acting chops to hold a franchise on its own.   In 2004 I did some lab work on instruments that ram windows 98. Currently I regularly use biotechnology instruments that run Vista. Can't upgrade them because it would break the software.   There have been quite a few studies that show its virtually impossible to get a large number of people to switch from driving to public transit for their commutes. All that happens is that people who use public transit will use it more.   Do people really think toxins live in your gut like worms? If anything toxins are in your bloodstream. Your liver and kidney will take care of it.   Yes, but at the pace things are coming out now, it's pretty clear that Nadella is completely responsible for stepping on the accelerator pedal.   Not to mention that every few years they decided to completely "revamp" it for no good reason. Kind of like Google Talk/Hangouts too.   I'm not sure what the fuck happened to Google Maps, but the desktop version has steadily gone downhill. It used to be fast and functional, but now they are trying to copy too much of the mobile UI. They also had other neat features like elevation which were removed and "will be put in later", as if they had to invent that code from scratch.  The most infuriating thing is trying to plan public transit rides with the desktop application. Why the fuck am I scrolling down to see the timetable move sideways? That breaks so many rules in UI design.   Also, what the fuck was with that guillotine style chopping. These are the basic techniques: http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/draftknife-skills-the-three-basic-knife-cuts.html   I think in the past decade, a lot of amazing progress has been in blood cancers. Carcinomas are turning out to be many big beasts.   I'm Canadian, and I don't really understand how our health care system works. How is it that we can go to a hospital and get major surgery done for what we contribute in taxes but once we go to Shoppers we have to pony up? My guess is that routine pharmaceuticals that you get in the consumer side of things is a tiny fraction of medical costs (even the really expensive drugs are administered only at hospitals), so it doesn't even make monetary sense for the government to withhold this benefit.   This is a great answer. With fields like bioinformatics there are a lot of opportunities, especially since the barrier to hiring is a lot less as compared to lab bench positions. The only question is whether you will find a job that you find fulfilling.   The problem is that lab experience doesn't mean anything in the workplace. It means you worked a few hours a week on brief modules with a protocol in front of you. That doesn't make you competitive.  The reason why lab internships are so useful because it demonstrates that you have problem solving skills and can apply protocols to situations outside of a classroom laboratory. For example, there is a huge difference between cloning a strain and purifying a protein in a class lab versus your PI telling you to clone an arbitrary ORF and then purify it. The latter makes you actually think and understand the process and that's what employers are looking for.  The actual field isn't important -- the key factors are that you've done things with your hands and mind outside of the class lab.   The difference is that a Bachelor's degree will eventually "top off" unless you have a special talent or if you are an entrepreneur.   Hong Kong-born here, I'm not really sure what the fuss over Infernal Affairs was. It was very similar to a lot of other gangster movies released from HK in that time period. That and the female leads were absolutely horrendous and the dialog was terrible. Not sure if understanding Cantonese made the difference, but I felt that The Departed, while being much longer-winded, was a much better movie.   But this is a problem for contracts and loans made in USD. I'm assuming it's a not-insignificant portion of the economy. Russia had this same problem a few months ago.   Or any contracts/loans made out in USD just got 35% more expensive.  Seriously, some people think this is great news, but nobody was cheering when Russia's currency collapsed.   With a bigger picture: the Euro-zone finally got their head out of their asses with austerity and is implementing QE after the Americans have had huge success with it. But they are a little too late as the US is now switching tracks to raise rates. Because they are going in diverging directions, we can expect a double whammy effect.   Related: in the Bay Area there is an ice cream sandwich shop called CREAM.   Haven't read the paper, but do you know if they've tried this technique with undefined rich media? It seems like a lot of labs would try that route first.   Also hilarious considering historically the aluminum MacBooks had all sorts of heating problems.   The 13" MBP is absurdly light for its performance. It definitely punches above its weight.   Get a 13" MBP. It costs around the same as the 2015 MacBook, has literally 10x the performance, retina screen, and extra ports. You would never be worried about performance, and the thing is honestly not that heavy.   By that logic they would have used the Air moniker for the new iPhones.  	107

 Jesus Christ. I should have stopped reading. I babysit for a living right now. Jesus Christ.   "A gay?"   No, you're right. He made fairly good money. But I can imagine that having to drive extraordinarily dark and scary stretches of road would compel certain people to purchase one. It's also worthy of note that 90's also covers 1999. Also, I'm prone to saying "ten years ago" and meaning the 90's, even though that's clearly not correct. But part of this sub is no disbelief so lets just go with it!   My uncle had a cell phone in the 90's. He was a tech guy.   I'd advise not coming within 50 feet of nosleep.   Salt all your windows and doors. Wear or carry a piece of sterling silver. And I'd suggest some research into your foster care files as well as if it's possible that you were conceived as part of a set of twins, and only you survived. Please keep up updated, OP, even if it's just to let us know how you're doing.    I totally get it. I describe the inside of my head as a fish tank bubble machine. I'd absolutely love to know more but all in your time, as you're ready. :)   Readers are to act as though everything is true and treat it as such in the comments.

So you're aware that N1 is in love with you right?    And a more irritating, mind numbing, more aggressive in retaliation to the SJWs, place.    In real life I'm actually a super kind and understanding person. What irks me is that all of a sudden society has to cowtow to weakness. I've seen trigger warnings in college syllabi. I think that's absolutely ludicrous. Real life doesn't come with trigger warnings. There's not gonna be someone to warn you if you're about to walk out the door to see an assault and no one is going to cover your eyes when you see bad things happening. I think that instead of letting the fear and "triggers" win, people who can't handle it should get the help they need from a professional and learn coping skills.   Yes lets make a big stink about someone quoting a song. Go be a SJW somewhere that isn't /nosleep. We don't need your kind in our safe place.   It's the hot/crazy scale dude. I know it well.   "Triggering" shouldn't even be a word. Grow up and get a grip.   You are my favorite.   Finally someone singing my song! Trigger warnings breed weakness. Learn to deal with your shit or the world will destroy you.   More please!   Leave him at the fire station and move on with your life. They won't even look for you.   It's true. I wasn't saying they were the same thing, necessarily, just that there were similarities it might have helped OP to read. On how to deal with it, etc.   Them!   Yes!   Yes!   There are other stories that reference a woman doing that. I don't know how to find them and link them for you though. Anyone else?   Not sure what's up with the formatting, but it's kinda unreadable. I'll check back soon because I want to read this!   Er.... Wrong thread?   I don't know why this is removed, but I want it back. I have so many questions.   Alternatively, demonic Rugrats!   My dog's name is Abigail and she sits at the food of my bed every night waiting for me to get her spot ready. This is extra creepy. Did you survive it OP?   The real world is not gonna provide you with warnings. You have to function on society. You have to go places, work places, shop places. Anything can happen and no one is going to warn you.   I KNOW. I read them all in once sitting and then I was like high on all of the words. My eyes wouldn't close and my brain wouldn't stop running. Lol.   It's called coddling people in a society that is going to beat the shit out of them, and never so much as let them know what's coming. "Trigger warnings" and the like, breed weakness and a false sense of importance.   Call a doctor if it lasts more than 4 hours!   Real life doesn't come with trigger warnings.   Mine sounds like a freaking carebear.   Okay. Good. I'm really not a bitch. 3   If you identify as a woman, than you can be any kind of woman you'd like. Butch, femme, somewhere in between, whatever. It's really that simple. Being cis or trans doesn't make you less or more of a woman than anyone else.  What I actually meant is that in my community a lot of the cis-women who are "butch" at some point in their lives, actually end up later on coming out as trans (FTM.) I'm simply asking a question about what people see in their own communities and if the image that I have is something that still exists in today's society.   Please don't come here looking for an argument. I'm not insulting or "erasing and excluding" anyone. If you feel that way then you may need to address your own insecurities and status as a "victim." I often come across as harsh because I don't lie, or sugar coat, and I don't believe in pandering to insecurities. It is how it is.    Well now... I hadn't really ever thought of it like that. Of course there is a sense of security, but I've always protected myself. I can also fix the plumbing, the car, and do basic carpentry. I'm pretty self sufficient and maintain that even in relationships (which has been a problem in the past, I'm "too independent.")So what I'm "looking for" is someone who can match that. But this isn't a post about me seeking someone, it's just asking if people like that exists in other communities.   Hey okay so I didn't say people who weren't butch wouldn't have the same characteristics. I'm actually just simply asking if what I'm describing exists in other communities because it doesn't in my own.    Thanks! Haha. I'm just checking other communities because here it seems like most girls are just gay to make a political statement.   I do. Hence the title of the post being "Butch Women!" And that's also what I'm asking about. Is do BUTCH WOMEN exist anymore? Are they in your community? Etc.   You may have hit the nail on the head. I think that's exactly the image I see. Of course I also grew up in a junk yard and am friends mainly with "car guys" to get my fix, but I'm the only lesbian for miles at car meets and I'm femme!   It's funny you mention that. Where I grew up it's very conservative and exactly as you said, less colorful. Even the lesbians fit into gender roles, you know? Femme and butch. Unfortunately there's really nothing in the world that makes me melt like a good strong butch and they just don't exist here.   You'd think!   I guess as a femme I don't see butch as a deliberate thing, but more as just who someone is. You know? But I can see what you're saying. What is the gay community like where you live?  	48
 My claim was that fiat doesn't have intrinsic value. When challenged, I found a source.   Incidentally, I feel symmetrically about your last sentence.  Your argument is entirely based on using the wrong definition of intrinsic.   You said that you're qualified because you make a lot. That's kind of ridiculous, and is the same argument Trump made.  What exactly did I get wrong, and what is your proof that it's wrong? Don't use a non-standard definition and think you've won.   Let me guess, you think Trump is the most qualified presidential candidate because he's the richest?   Whether they are different categories is the open problem. They're different definitions, but we can't prove they aren't equivalent yet.   He's not even bothering to argue that P isn't NP in that paper (except a very short summary of the field), that's not really controversial in computational complexity theory.  He has written a lot on it elsewhere, though. Pretty much anything he writes is a good read if you're interested, so I'll just leave these here:  http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1720 http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=459 http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=122 http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=458      According to the [same person](http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf), it's likely that nothing will be able to solve NP-complete problems quickly. He even thinks it could be like a fundamental physical law.       A true qbit can be in an infinite number of states at a single time. This is what would make true quantum computing so powerful.  Not really. What would make scalable quantum computing powerful is the existence of algorithms that solve certain problems faster than on classical computers. To elaborate would take some time, but this article does a good job http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=208.   (Full paper is at http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/6/e1500031.full)  Note the next sentence:  **Although the particular machine presented here is eventually limited by noise**  See http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2212 for an explanation of why that cannot be fixed.  Wake me up when they've released the RSA numbers.   And [Scott Aaronson's response](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2212)   Nope, sorry. See http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2212 for the reasons it doesn't work.  If it is true that they can solve NP-complete problems in polymnomial time, it would be trivial to prove it; just release all the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers  The "problems" with their machine are not fixable, they're fundamental to the problem they're trying to solve.

It has been, but I haven't read all of it, and much of my thinking has been independant.

Maybe read http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=book/table_of_contents  I also elaborated in this thread a bit.    There is no audience here.  Maybe you should consider the possibility that I'm being honest here, then.  You showed up, feigned ignorance and produced a ludicrously biased study, and then 10 more that supported it.  I just went through all my comments on this issue. The ones which had any non-reddit links at all were https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csntdkm?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csntkmg?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnu5xt?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnwoqc?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csny3kd?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnzrly?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/cso821h?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/cso92m3?context=3 https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/cson1qu?context=3   After excluding the ones on law or otherwise irrelevant to this particular issue, and duplicates, the only sources I quoted were  http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/0817938923_51.pdf  http://www.cato.org/publications/briefing-paper/what-would-school-voucher-buy-real-cost-private-schools http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.20113/abstract http://educationnext.org/debunking-a-special-education-myth/ (which I didn't use as a source, but to start a discussion) http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576313572363698678  The other sources were *all* from https://nces.ed.gov/, and were raw data as opposed to analysis. I don't think there's much room to accuse me of bias in looking those up and linking them.  The four (not 10) sources that I did quote were generally the first analysis to come up on searching for the topic in question, each time. For example, seaching for https://www.google.com/search?q=who+uses+vouchers brings up Hoover as the first relevant result, searching for https://www.google.com/search?q=private+school+vouchers+costs brings up cato as the first result, the peer-reviewed study was written by the same authors as the hoover paper and was found while researching that one. For the WSJ link, I was actually trying to find out whether buses are included in certain public numbers, and specifically if private school buses were, so I searced for https://www.google.com/search?q=public+school+costs+include+busing. The first two links are local, so I ignored them, the third is governmental and I linked it, the fourth didn't quite break down what I was looking for, the fifth was irrelevant. When I came across the wsj one, I realized it contradicted the comment I was replying to, so I used that and stopped looking for what I'd been looking for before then. (I think this is reasonably accurate, but it is based on memory, so it might not be 100%.)  That should hopefully be sufficient to show that  You showed up, feigned ignorance and produced a ludicrously biased study, and then 10 more that supported it. Basically the only 10 studies extant, that in isolation could shore up a view that is categorically false.  is not an accurate description of what I did.  That's possible, but as it turns out, I'm not starting with an ideology and then seeking data to ram into the hole I've shaped because of it and ignoring everything that doesn't fit.  On the other hand, you don't have good reason to believe I am, except for your belief that "someone disagrees with me" implies "that person is deliberately wrong, no one could be mistaken, especially not me". I've laid out parts of my reasoning process throughout, and I never said I'm believing anything for ideological reasons.  Other posters have raised some of the obvious issues, and your responses have been...at best....suspect. "Sure, busing is an externality included in public budgets, ignored by most private schools..but um, I know some with buses!" etc.  They said that *all* public schools provide buses for free, and all private schools don't; I correctly pointed out that it was wrong. I wasn't saying any other aspect was wrong there.  I don't know what the thinking error is for you, and frankly I'm not really that interested in finding out.  Remember that your only justification that I am making a thinking error at all is private knowledge you've refused to tell me. It's possible my tentative conclusions are wrong, I didn't put in the amount of research required to have strong confidence in the results, but I did enough for "reddit-quality" comments. Your argument would be a lot stronger if you could point to specific evidence that I'm rejecting.  (By the way, I've updated slightly in the other direction after reading through the great lakes report someone else linked, as well as some follow up discussion between the author and someone from cato.)   You think teacher's unions are a problem? You think free markets are always the best approach to public policy?   I haven't studied the teachers' union very much, so I don't have much of an opinion. As for 2, definitely not.  Whatever it is, smashing the evidence until it finally complies with what you want to be true works for you, I'm sure.  Again, in order to claim that you need to point to specific evidence that I've ignored, which you refuse to do. (Also, if we consider your rejection of the cato study above as enough to not be called "ignoring it", then anything I've engaged with to that level was also not ignored. Or you could use your double standard.)  I'm hopeful you gain the ability to think critically and do exceptionally basic research.  I can kind of see how you think I wasn't thinking critically, but you kind of misunderstood some of my points here. I'm not saying that the sources I've linked are sufficient to prove that private schools are objectively better. I know I haven't done nearly the amount of research required to be confident in the results, (and even if I was, I wouldn't adopt your position of no longer paying attention to the evidence after being convinced). When I link such an article, my objective is firstly, to introduce the idea in case the other commenters haven't seen and, and secondly, if there's any major problems with it, someone will point them out and I'll get more info. I'm in no way considering the conclusion conclusive, and in fact I've updated after reading the replies; I still think school choice is important (for a number of reasons unrelated to cost), but am unsure or less sure of a cost decrease.   If this isn't enough to convince you, what would?    I'm asking precisely for a justification of Occam's razor.  Not getting into that, but you can read http://lesswrong.com/lw/s0/where_recursive_justification_hits_bottom/.  This is a very involved question, though, and reddit is perhaps not the best format for it.    On what authority do you disagree with the economic professor at Harvard whose book I quoted?  Here are some more sources that say fiat has no intrinsic value:  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp  Most modern paper currencies are fiat currencies, have no intrinsic value and are used solely as a means of payment.  http://economics.about.com/od/money/a/Types-Of-Money.htm  Fiat money is money that has no intrinsic value   Do you understand what intrinsic means?    You're not doing a very good job of making your case, or showing you even know what intrinsic means. Backing is not intrinsic.  In fact, one of the definitions of fiat money is that it's intrinsically valueless!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money#Definition  Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.[2]  [2] http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3ubKAgAAQBAJ pg=PA220 lpg=PA220 dq=%22Fiat+money+money+without+intrinsic+value+that+is+used+as+money+because+of+government+decree%22 source=bl ots=7XHHm0VBBD sig=Me-Z6eaFICWEZYb97lO_SDBGCb0 hl=en sa=X ei=8qwRU6SzEY7whQeK5oC4CA ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage q=%22Fiat%20money%20money%20without%20intrinsic%20value%20that%20is%20used%20as%20money%20because%20of%20government%20decree%22 f=false   You're saying all this stuff was concretely known and discussed with the mainstream public for a "reall long time". The OP and I are saying that's not true.  That's not what I said; my claim was that it was discussed in the mainstream *media*, which is true. Of course public opinion has changed due to snowden, I never claimed otherwise.   From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency#George_W._Bush_administration  On December 16, 2005, The New York Times reported that, under White House pressure and with an executive order from President George W. Bush, the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining warrants from the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret court created for that purpose under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).[216]  One such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion. Conversations of citizens of the U.S. were intercepted, along with those of other nations.[217]  The article referred to is http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html   Occam's Razor.   There are links there to mainstream media stories from over 10 years ago. Snowden was not the first.   So you can't even tell the dfference between backing and intrinsic value?   Clapper lying does not mean it wasn't known earlier. Look at the NSA page on Wikipedia, at least.   You've offered none, so you couldn't know that even if true.  You also seem to subscribe to the claim that nobody is ever wrong by mistake, which has the two implications of  1. You can never be wrong, since you know you aren't deliberately lying and 2. Anyone who disagrees with you is stupid.  These are some extremely dangerous views to hold, and it can lead to you to ironical situations like this where you refuse to defend your view because you think it can't possibly be wrong *and* anyone else can see that as well, yet criticize me when you *think* I would do the same.  I don't have much hope of changing your mind about epistemology, but I'll try one more time.  You clearly profess the belief that one should change one's mind on encountering evidence. You (incorrectly) think I don't possess that, and therefore you consider it a waste of time to introduce facts. I don't see a good way to convince you otherwise; I could make a list of previous views I've changed my mind about, but you could dismiss that as dishonest anyway.  Anyway, given that one should respond to evidence, under what circumstances would you change your mind? You believe that when you're sufficiently sure of something, it's impossible to arrive at an incorrect conclusion by mistake, so wouldn't that mean *you* should reject all new evidence? If that's the case, then you do consider it rational to disregard evidence in some circumstances.   And "real" currencies have intrinsic value because?   That's uncomputable, hence prior of zero.   After controlling for age the effect gets much smaller, though.   What about immortals?          The point of my post was that (1) yes and no results are valuable, and (2) the search space of possible is large so that we could test indefinitely and still not be certain.  I agree with 1. As for two, just because you can't be certain doesn't mean you should give up. You can also give complexity penalties, and testing all the simple answers may be possible.  Also, I really wasn't trying to be smug here.    It's trivial to come up with something that distinguishes "always increases" from your alternate hypothesis.        The proposed solution sounds horrendous - an overlapping patchwork of different jurisdictions with different rules and not even any attempt at high-minded universal application.  I actually thought it sounded pretty close to the real world.   My claim would be that the moral outrage is believed to be true by (many of) those who proclaim it. Whether you want to call it "fake" or not similar to "belief in belief" is your decision.   This title is my equivalent of clickbait.  I think the title accurately described the content, though?   That was poorly phrased; what I meant is that most people, even most smart people, don't think that way. The existence of some who do doesn't mean all do (and the observation that many people think a certain way *is* useful).   http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/cost-police-body-cameras/nkr3J/  One company VieVU advertises its police body cameras cost $199, plus $55 a month per camera for data storage.  You know, if you can do it for much less, why not start a company? Capitalism, after all!    Sighh..... Another good thinker lost to the wiles of propositional logic. The real world doesn't have Boolean truth-values! It has real-valued measurements. I'm sure everyone on this subreddit has heard the term "probability" before.  He's not saying they must be Boolean, he's saying *others* believe that, and that they are wrong.  Nobody is actually shocked. Feigning shock and horror just makes for good rhetoric in favor of changing policy: we are all used to the world being wrong, but we also carry an inner sense that we ought to be shocked and appalled, that however cynical we may be, the right thing is still that a Clean Air Act ought to clean up the air.  I think you're overestimating how smart people actually think.  Actually, I have to say, my responses were colored entirely by what little I know (ie: what they taught me when I volunteered with a Civil Liberties Union once) of how the Supreme Court has ruled on these matters before.  The article says  On the basis of your personal understanding of this sentence's meaning (not your knowledge of constitutional law)  So you shouldn't have done that.    "Invasion of privacy"? Seriously? You're a public servant. It's not like they have to wear them home.  You misunderstood that one; the problem is the invasion of *other's* privacy. For example, if I call the police and they come into my house, my house will be recorded.  "The cost of maintaining cameras and footage" seems kind of ridiculous, as it would probably save them MOUNTAINS in legal fees.  Let's look at NYC for an example. [This](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/14/nypd-paid-nearly-1-billion-to-settle-lawsuits/) puts the total paid in lawsuits at around $100 million a year. http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/03/30/50678/7m-annual-cost-for-lapd-body-cameras/ says a camera costs around $1000 per cop yearly, NYPD has ~34,000 cops so that would come to $34 million. Lawsuits would need to drop by 34% to make it worth it, and it isn't obvious that the drop will be that large.  The public does not decide your fate.  The public has influenced prosecutors to charge before even when they knew they wouldn't win.   It does have a fictional government subplot.    as far as I can tell, has no drawbacks  Did you read the article, which mentioned some of the reasons given for opposing it?    Here's how this works: Extraordinary claims that are odds with reality and the consensus view of experts require evidence.  The trouble of course being how you define consensus, and how you determine what's at "odds" with reality without begging the question. (Also, non-extraordinary claims require evidence as well; firstly they require evidence of their non-extraordinary-ness, and secondly they require evidence of their correctness. You're mixing up the [extraordinary claims quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcello_Truzzi#.22Extraordinary_claims.22))  Stating that consensus view does not.  You need to at least show that it's consensus, and even then, all you have is an argument from authority.  "The Earth moves around the sun": Doesn't require evidence.  Actually it does; it so happens to be that people *did* find evidence, and that debate is pretty much settled. (See http://www.wired.com/2014/04/how-do-we-know-the-earth-orbits-the-sun/ and https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/10933/why-do-we-say-that-the-earth-moves-around-the-sun and https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/55444/what-made-us-think-that-earth-moves-around-the-sun). But put it a different way; imagine you meet an alien who has no knowledge of the whole debate on Earth over how it moves. In order to convince them the Earth moves around the sun, you'd need to give them evidence. If you say "oh, our scientist agree that this is true", then the hypothetical alien needs to *trust* you, or you could easily fool them by claiming *anything* is "consensus".  So, no, I'm not going to offer you 'evidence' of reality.  Then why should I change my mind? If you feel you have sufficient justification that you don't want to share, fine, but you can't convince someone like that unless they implicitly trust your rationality and honesty.  I don't know who you usually engage with  I engage with almost anyone who's debating in good faith, and sometimes others, depending on whether I feel there's a benefit to the debate (like if the other appears knowledgeable about the topic). You've pretty much departed from that already (by refusing to offer evidence and assuming it wouldn't be acknowledged anyway).  but I'm not someone who is going to pitch you studies that reflect the consensus view  Then you'll have a hard time changing any rational person's mind  while you offer increasingly ludicrous and banal 'refutations' of them.  I haven't offered any refutations, I haven't been offered any studies! Where does this bad faith presumption on your part come from?  You just continue to play pretend, as you would regardless of me linking 100000 studies  More bad faith assumptions with no evidence offered  and I'll keep laughing at your ludicrous attempts at "look, this is real, The Association for Marketing For Profit Schools says that at least .000001% of charter schools don't actively injure students!"  The cato study was the first result on searching for https://www.google.com/search?q=private+school+vouchers+costs, but you'll note that I then found government statistics that said the same.                  You're missing the point. The law already says you can't sell to a felon, the problem is that even when you know they aren't a felon, you still need to do a background check, which would be useless.   Is that true in all states?   Sweet dreams.  Remember the fight over whether Michael Brown's video of robbing a store was real?   Cops *do* want cameras in very high numbers.  http://www.policeone.com/police-products/body-cameras/articles/7790682-Poll-Results-Cops-speak-out-about-body-cameras/  67.7 percent of those polled said despite some of the drawbacks, they would equip their department with body cameras if the decision was up to them.  There are some reasons why not there if you want to look.  (Interestingly, the number among the general public is much higher, among many different groups http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/16/body-cameras-poll_n_7079184.html)   But still, wouldn't a paper with all those qualities but slightly more accuracy eventually win out? Can the general public *really* not notice how wrong the papers are, and wouldn't notice a better one?  Or is the point that it's precisely inaccurate stuff that sells, or that you can't get sensationalist without inaccuracy?    I do disagree with the valuation of other iterations of myself as equally valid from a selfish perspective, because even if they are outwardly identical I am still only one of me and I determine my utility functions from that perspective. But while this is the part that initially struck me as odd, there's no reason why someone can't define their own self as they please and it at least makes more sense than people who define themselves as only part of a larger whole (in which case their "self" is the entire group, be it a nation or a religion or whatever).  I do believe you're missing the point. If I actually met my clone, I might not give a damn about them; but at the point where we have the same experiences, I claim *there is no meaningful sense in which I'm only one of them*! After we diverge, of course there is, but then I *should* expect to end up as any of them with equal probability (insert a bunch of caveats here). Hopefully you can see why I would care in that circumstance; all those "selves" are potentially *me* in the future.  If there are two groups, A containing 1 iteration of myself and B containing 2 iterations of myself, and I, the person whose eyes I'm looking out of, were in group B, and if a coin were flipped for each group and on tails that group was killed, I would say that I have a 50% chance of being killed (I hope I'm setting this up correctly, the example given on Wikipedia doesn't quite work for people who exist before the coin flip). Whereas under your definition, all of the subjects are you, and so you have only a 25% chance of dying (if both coins are tails).  The assumption is that all these are *completely identical copies*. So in what sense is each "unique", and in what sense is only one of them "you"?  By the way, we can construct a much simpler case that makes the same point you're making here. I clone you, then I kill one of you. According to you, that has a 50% chance of killing you, while I would say it doesn't kill you at all. You think that there is some sense in which a clone is \*not\* you, while I don't.  The only part I still don't understand about your position is the limitations on the use of the anthropic principle. If you can improve your average result by constraining your later options, then you should burn your bridge. The only constraint I can see on the use of this decision making strategy is that failure must result in death (and therefore the inability to ever experience failure), but this is a fairly easy constraint to add. Deciding to die is something you have absolute control over, after all, living requires some amount of positive effort. So why not get an A on every multiple choice test by generating the most random numbers you can manage (I understand random.org is quite good), using that to geverate a set of random answers to all the questions, and resolve to kill yourself if you don't get 100%? Suicide has zero net utility under this set of assumptions, while any positive gain that can be obtained by chance can be obtained with certainty by every extant iteration of yourself by this strategy. You mention heavy limitations on this strategy a couple of times, but I'm not seeing them.  Here's a quick list of limitations, may not be exhaustive:  1. Requires that the suicide doesn't change my cardinality. This implicitly assumes that the multiverse is infinite. To whatever extent I am uncertain, the reward must be that much greater to outweigh the huge loss if I'm wrong. 2. Requires selfishness, which already rules out a bunch of people (but we're talking about someone who is, so this isn't a big deal) 3. As the reward is quite low, the risk must be low as well; almost any epistemic doubt about a number of things could throw that off. Doubt about whether this theory of anthropics is right, doubt about multiverse as in 1, doubt about the relative likelihood of whatever outcome I want versus likelihood of a failure in the suicide attempt (this is not trivial, the priors on suicide succeeding are ~1/25 is [this source](http://www.suicide.org/suicide-faqs.html) is to be believed, and even conditioning on my intellegence I don't think I could get it too high, especially if I'm trying to force it as in the next one), doubt on whether I can actually precommit to harm myself, if not I'd need to enforce it, which also presumably lowers the chance of success (I'm also assuming that a suicide failure is worse than nothing), even doubt on whether my utility function is valued correctly.     Why don't papers with standards have a competitive advantage? How can bad papers last so long?    I'm aware of the concept: if we do not exist, then we cannot observe anything, therefore if we do exist, then we can be certain that no set of circumstances that would prevent us from existing can have come about.   That's the epistemology part, not the decision theory part. Applying the epistemology consistently should lead you to all the decision theory parts, but I don't know if that can be made rigorous.  But I still do not understand why you consider it the way you do when projecting forward.  My argument is roughly:  1. Measure doesn't matter for utility, given that the cardinality stays the same (i.e. I am indifferent between my "measure" being A or B if both A and B are the same cardinality, even if they otherwise differ, like the reals and [0,1], or the integers and the odds, or something similar.) 2. Worlds that I don't exist in have zero utility (selfishness assumption; if you don't accept it, this may not be valid) 3. [Self Indicating Assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-indication_assumption) (I'm not going to argue for it, but I do consider it obvious, and you seem to be accepting it) (I'm also not sure if this is quite needed to carry my argument here) 4. All copies of me that I cannot distinguish between can be identified as "me"; there is no sense of "I'm this person and not that person", if both people are having identical experiences. 5. Given 1, 2, and 3, and 4 (insert handwave) the expected result of eliminating some worlds is an increase of probability in the other worlds from "my" subjective perspective, and the *average* utility of my surviving selves is what matters.  I'm not even sure that you believe what you're saying, since if you did then any rational iteration of yourself should be dead in most universes.  This is besides the point; you can't dismiss an idea by saying the proponent doesn't really believe it. But anyway, I already addressed this above: there are a whole bunch of conditions required for that to be a reasonable decision! (And for the record, if we live in a multiverse then the vast majority of worlds do not contain me.)  While you're at it, why don't you read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality ?    Then any choice based on probability is meaningless.  Under certain conditions, naive probability will fail. That's kind of the whole point of anthropic reasoning.   Under that logic, only the best possible outcome of any probabilistic event should be considered. Have you invested all of your money into high risk/high yield penny stocks? If the investment goes poorly, you can just kill yourself, and then you'll never experience a universe in which you didn't get lucky and invest early in the next Apple or whatever.  There's a very specific kind of multiverse that would make this correct; there are also a number of other conditions that would need to apply. I've thought about this in great depth, and I could go over each prerequisite if you'd like.  but it's very strange to assign zero utility to any situation that is not exactly the best possible.  The system you refer to isn't assigning zero utility to those situations, it's recognizing that pre-committing to certain actions will change your probabilities of getting higher utility. It's utility agnostic after taking certain selfish and counterfactual non-caring assumptions.  How familiar are you with anthropic reasoning in general?   Oh, thought this was on the /r/tumblr (which is considerably more active) post. My bad.    So if you could press a button that has a 10% chance of giving you $10 and a 90% chance of killing you instantly, would you press it? You can never be aware of having pressed the button and not received money either way.  If I was sufficiently certain of a (certain kind of) multiverse, yes.    Before you actually try it, you have no way of knowing whether you are in one of the 99 universes that will be destroyed by looking or in the 1 in 100 that won't.  That's meaningless, in my understanding. If all universes look the same to you, there's no sense in which you're "in" one or the other. As long as the destroying happens instantly, there's no reason to worry.   Was there enough evidence for it at the time he dismissed it? Note that he did come around eventually.   If the basis of that is the anthropic principle, then you're literally destroying countless universes just to ensure that in at least one of the remaining universes you know where the target is. That has exactly the same probability of working in a particular universe as the strategy of firing in a random direction does, and without the possibility (indeed probability) of destroying that universe.  Don't see any problem with the strategy. Who cares about other universes that don't exist?      Except the people pushing the idea of AI risk are heavily criticising how Hollywood portrays it.   Why not both?   How do people find my old posts like that?    Because they are pretend?  Sources 2 and 3 are both government sources, why don't you explain who's making stuff up there?  I'm not going to waste time here explaining why a cato study's methodology shockingly skewed towards arriving at a pre-determined result, but, honestly, why bother with 'evidence' if it's going to compare wildly disparate data sets?  You've so far offered absolutely no evidence, so maybe get some of your own before criticising something you disagree with.  The only benefit to private education is paying much more than public school costs to afford your children an advantage.  Again, you haven't offered any reason to believe that.  Private schools do not provide better education per dollar than public schools. The opposite has been shown to be true in every large study.  Can you show me them?  It's a settled debate if you care about evidence.  Lol "settled", when you can't provide any evidence and need to dismiss whatever is shown just to justify your beliefs.   I went over this in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnu5xt?context=3). What don't you like about those numbers?   http://givingpledge.org/         Even Forbes still valued him in the billions. Nobody credible thinks he's worth *less* than his inheritance as far as I know.  See http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/the-8-billion-dollar-man/    He has less now than what he started with, supposedly.  He inherited in the millions and is worth in the billions.   Look, in any situation, there's at least *some* chance a death will result in high costs (whether it's lawsuits or bad press or something else).  Minimizing deaths does not seem obviously a \*bad\* strategy for the company to follow. The "fault" issue may not outweigh that.   It can be extended to any situation in which a jury can be persuaded the car did something wrong.          a human driver would not be held responsible for casualties caused by mechanical failure, and so there is no reason that a machine driver would  But the car *manufacturer* can be held liable, and in that case, it would gain if fewer people died.   That's not the dilemma addressed in the article. Read it again.   Google started developing their car how many years before expected public sale date?  That's what I thought.   This content was removed at the request of Bitstamp Ltd   No. But I would expect that, because someone that *isn't* "into" science is probably less likely to look at these at all.  And I'd argue that if you aren't going to do any of the work required to see whether stuff is actually true, you aren't better off being "into" science but taking things uncritically.   Because overall, it would kill less people, which itself should lead to less lawsuits.   I'm not saying it does; I'm saying the reasoning isn't fallacious.   That doesn't change my point (and I was copying their wording; you can replace it with "deciding to take no action carries lower ethical import").  There are even epistemological arguments like Chesterton's Fence that would imply similar decisions.    If it makes people care more about science and scientific research, and that is reflected in how are tax money is spent.  This is a good reason, if true.    The big cost for bussing.  Huh? Are you considering this under-$1000 a "big cost"?    You don't need to know everything about science to apprecaite the idea of it.  I'm not saying you do; I'm saying you should understand why exactly the idea works, and don't think you understand something from popularizers.  Yes, you can't know everything, and that's why you should be uncertain about things you haven't studied.   [Nope!](http://xkcd.com/1545/)    Not everyone is an expert. That's fine, let people enjoy their sciency nonsense.  Don't be an expert, but then don't think you actually understand it. You can enjoy something even if you know you probably misunderstand it.    History has shown time and time again that as a group scientists hate being told they are wrong.  Could you elaborate? Given that part of the whole point of science was to be able to admit when you're wrong, and many advancements have been made precisely *because* scientists figured out they were wrong, I don't think that claim is warranted.             It's not like they think the word "science" actually means firefighting or decoupage.  If they think they "know" something is "science" because they've read some pop-sci, then yes, they misunderstand the scientific method. No, you cannot get understanding by outsourcing your thinking to popularizers.  These are the people that will read a news article (or sometimes just a headline) on one new study, and assume it's true without even reading the actual study.     that is where the big cost comes from  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=67 puts the cost per student at under $1,000  Also, it seems an unfair comparison to include fees from private schools but not public ones, [which charge many of those as well](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576313572363698678)  Public schools offer busing to their whole district by law  No, as the article above says and gives counter-examples.    How could you possibly sell a car that would have a subroutine to try and kill you, even if it was for a better cause?  Closed-source, of course. People buy binaries all the time.   http://lesswrong.com/lw/2k/the_least_convenient_possible_world/    It's based on the fallacy that refusing to make a decision isn't a decision.  When put that way, sure, it's a fallacy, but the weaker non-fallacious claim that refusing to make a decision carries lower ethical import is sufficient to carry that argument.   Then the holder of the Eye can easily tell where any True Cloaks are, just by checking where he can't look.   Better in what sense? How specifically does society gain if more people think science is good while misunderstanding what science is?   Josh Duggar.   I know private schools with their own buses, though.       Do you have any ideas?  Well, if you aren't releasing the source code until the end of the summer, any ideas may not be worth thinking of until then.  That said, the first thing that comes to mind is that a node could have constant "check-ins", and if it fails one, it's automatically removed and its money refunded. If it's in the middle of a computation, maybe it could have some "debt" to the network of one computation or something before it gets back those coins.       I know first hand that tuition is only part of the cost of private school, a lot often coming from endowments or donations  If a private school can reduce costs by donations and endowments while a public school cannot, that *itself* is a reason to prefer the private one. Those shouldn't be included, because no one is forced to pay them. The mandatory donations you referred to do matter, though, but you haven't sourced that, I think.  Also, what do you think of this argument?http://educationnext.org/debunking-a-special-education-myth/ :  This estimate likely overstates by a fair margin the additional cost of serving disabled students in private schools. It assumes that the cost of serving a privately placed student would be the same as the cost of serving the average student with the same disability. But we have good reason to believe that most privately placed students are more severely disabled and therefore more expensive to educate than the average student in the same disability classification. An emotionally disturbed student who requires private placement, for example, is likely to be more challenging and expensive to educate than the average emotionally disturbed student who remains in public schools. With the laws emphasis on providing services in the least restrictive environment, the severity of the disability is likely to increase the probability of private placement.  Anyway, I'm too tired to do math right now, if you want to recalculate the public-private split using my numbers but your special needs numbers, go ahead. Intuitively it seems that the 10% isn't enough to make public come out better, but I can't say for sure.    A document published by a conservative organization  Also, this was on hoover.org, which appears to be run by Stanford University. One author is a [Professor at Harvard](http://scholar.harvard.edu/peterson/publications/who-chooses-who-uses-participation-national-school-voucher-program), and they published a [peer-reviewed paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.20113/abstract).   EC2 didn't go down, it was an [external Internet provider issue](http://status.aws.amazon.com/)         Private schools don't score worse on standardized tests, and often do better. Please source your claim. (I sourced this in one of my other comments).   They made an assertion, they need to back it up. I didn't assert otherwise, just asked for a source.  And again, the government actually gains by implementing vouchers, because private schools cost less. For every parent switching their kid out of public school, the government makes more by lower public school costs than it would pay in vouchers. So there's no more taxes than you're paying now.   Private schools have a lower cost per student than public ones. This is well documented (and I went over the numbers elsewhere in this thread).  Why do you think that isn't the case? Do you have any specific criticism of methodology?   On your first point, I asked for a source for the parent comment's assertion, and quoted a study that went a bit into the numbers. If you have anything better, I'd like to hear it.  On your second point, this isn't your tax dollars; it's those parents, who also pay school taxes. Also, if they're charging less than public school costs, then the aspects that aren't part of public schools can be thought of as for "free".    I went over this in another comment, look at my recent comments (search for .gov).  Private schools overall are around $1,000 less than public, while religious ones are several thousand less. That's a lot to be covered by donations.   First of all, there's no reason it can't cover all of tuition; as private schools cost less per kid than public, that would still be a gain. Second, the "less funding" comes along with even lower costs, becaus there are less students.    any public school that teaches that is breaking the law.  That's just not true.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Freedom_bills  Many of those haven't been struck down.    the public suffers when children are taught evolution isn't real, global warming is just God's plan, and the earth is only 6000 years old.  Are you willing to ban such teachings? If not, why does it matter? Also, plenty of public schools teach (some) of that as well.   That's pretty much equivalent to the voucher program in terms of money flows.   I'll try to explain this better.  Child-free adults don't get a rebate because they're paying for the benefit of "free education for all". (I seemed to remember the court case saying something about "society benefits", but can't find it.)  The reason the parents should get a rebate is that they're using it to pay for this "free education". It's part of the benefit.    yes i support vouchers for non-religious schools.  So shouldn't you at least support *some* money for religious schools, at whatever you think their *actual* cost of providing the non-religious education is? Some of that can be calculated, as I've mentioned; transportation, salaries for non-religious teachers, food, etc.  and it isn't really the parent's tax money, it is just made to look like it. lets say everyone pays $10k in taxes for the sake of simplicity. $1k of that goes to public education for all american children regardless of whether that person has children or not. then person A wants to send their kid to a religious school with a tuition of $1k. If we reimburse them $1k so they can can give that money to the religious school, person A has still spent $10k, but now they have given nothing to the public schools like everyone else has and the religious school gets $1k. The religious school has taken $1k from the public school pool of money.  But their kid is no longer in the public system, so the public system has $1k less of costs. For every person that leaves, the public schools save.  And if (as is the case) private schools cost less on average per student, then the government will actually save.   I understand that, but still, those schools are providing religious *and* not religious education for a lower cost than public schools, and students don't suffer in test scores. The government would be getting a good deal even paying for the whole thing, and surely when only paying for the "secular" classes.   It's more complicated than that; the Supreme Court ruled that one doesn't need to benefit from spending to have to pay a tax (see https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/199/194/case.html; I thought it was more recent, but couldn't find the case I seemed to remember, and stopped looking).  My point is that they should be able to choose which service they want, given that they're entitled to these services.    giving the parents a tax-rebate on their tuition is effectively the same thing as giving the school money. everyone can see that, it is just a loophole to make it seem like the taxpayers money isn't going directly to the school. Tax money is going to the school, the middle person doesn't change this fact.  But this is the parents' tax money.  And anyway, as I argued above, the school is performing almost everything the public school is providing. They should get at least some from the government; it's unreasonable to think that their costs of providing regular education is zero.  Also, for the record, do you support school vouchers for non-religious private schools?   We're talking about giving the parents money, which you haven't addressed.  And not giving someone money they would otherwise deserve because they would then have more money to spend on religious items is discrimination, and itself problematic. As I said above, that reasoning can be applied to eliminate tax breaks from anyone religious as well.   Does that count as being rick-rolled?    i am okay with tax-dollars going to private schools with non-religious curriculums.  So then you should be fine with tax dollars going to fund all the non-religious curriculum/ transportation/ food/ etc of religious private schools as well, as long as it doesn't go for the religious parts.  And it is everyone's tax money. Everyone pays for public schooling even people who don't have children.  The point here is that private school parents are paying twice. Paying these taxes should give you the right to a free education for your kids, and the government should at least pay for the private non-religious education parts.  Look, private schools are definitely not spending *all* the money on religious stuff, or they'd get much lower marks in standardised tests, which [doesn't happen](http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pubs/studies/2006461.asp)  If it costs a public school X to provide an education, and a private school can provide religious education *and* non-religious education and do as good as the public schools in standardised tests, then the private school is providing at least X in value per kid. As private schools tend to have lower costs than public schools, the government would still be getting a good deal even if it paid the entire tuition, so surely if they pay only the aspect calculated as non-religious they'll come out ahead.   Except the actual bill says only 21 and up, among other restrictions.   Bill seems to be http://openstates.org/nd/bills/64/HB1195/, text [here](http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/64-2015/documents/15-0393-05000.pdf?20150630144422), and says:  An individual twenty-one years or older possessing a valid concealed weapons license from this state is authorized to carry a firearm concealed on school property, if the individual is on private school property and has the approval of the private school to carry a firearm concealed or if the individual is on public school property and has the approval of the public school to carry a firearm concealed.  The rest of that makes it pretty clear that it's talking about a guard, they need training, assessments, and so on.  Don't see anything to support "student", the only time that might even apply would be a college as it's for 21 and up.    A state legislator, by default, speaks for the state.  https://popehat.com/2015/06/15/partial-victory-in-pattericos-free-speech-case-before-ninth-circuit/  In a published decision that will be significant for public employees who blog, the Ninth Circuit agreed that Mr. Frey didn't blog as a "state actor" for purposes of Section 1983 just because he's a county employee. The Court agreed that Naffe had not stated any facts giving rise to a reasonable inference that Patrick was blogging as part of his official responsibilities. "Frey is a county prosecutor whose official responsibilities do not include publicly commenting about conservative politics and current events." The Court also rejected Naffe's argument that Patrick's blogging was related to his work as a county prosecutor because he discussed criminal law issues.   and  Crucially, the Ninth Circuit confirmed that a state employee can talk about the nature of their work without transforming their speech into state action. That's key for the free speech rights of all public employees. The Court noted "if we were to consider every comment by a state employee to be state action, the constitutional rights of public officers to speak their minds as private citizens would be substantially chilled to the detriment of the 'marketplace of ideas.'"      I think it isn't a good idea because as a taxpayer I don't think my money should go towards religious education.  First of all, the money can go for non-religious education. Not all private schools are religious, and even those that are have many non-religious classes. There are also many costs unrelated to religion.  Second, this isn't \*your\* tax money. This is the tax money of those parents. Without vouchers or similar, parents that send to private schools pay twice; once for taxes that go to fund public schools, and once for tuition at private schools. Vouchers would just pay back those parents for the second payment out of their payment of the first, which they currently get nothing out of.  In fact, the government would save money, because private schools cost less per student than public ones.  I think the states money shouldn't be spent on brainwashing children into believing what their parents believe.  That's pretty much what the public school system is, though, as curriculum is set by local school boards usually made up of parents.   This is because the religous schools don't actually hire teachers.  What are you talking about?  I agree that our public school system is trash right now(for the most part), but spending tax dollars on teaching our children myths isn't going to help anyone.  Again, vouchers wouldn't be spending tax dollars, because the government saves more than it would pay for public when someone switches to a private school. That's the whole point of my previous comment. Vouchers can be for the portion of costs that are of non-religious studies, for food, busing, etc.   Why is it a bad idea? Maybe you should explain before ending the discussion?    i believe spending taxpayers dollars on religious schools is not a good idea regardless of the 5 supreme court justices that disagreed with me.  I think you misunderstand the purpose of law. The justices decided whether it was legal, not a good idea. Anyway, you haven't made a case for why it's not a good idea, just tried to proxy that by appealing to the constitution.   http://www.cato.org/publications/briefing-paper/what-would-school-voucher-buy-real-cost-private-schools  In fact, Education Department figures show that the average private elementary school tuition in America is less than $2,500. The average tuition for all private schools, elementary and secondary, is $3,116, or less than half of the cost per pupil in the average public school, $6,857.   That was from some decades ago, so here are [more recent figures](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_205.50.asp)  Average tuition charged in 2011-2012 was $10,940 for private schools. (Note that religious schools charged far less; this seems to be skewed by non-religious "elite" schools.)  https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_236.15.asp  Cost per pupil in average daily attendance (ADA) in 2011-2012 was $11,590 for public schools.  So this is definitely not a "significantly greater" amount for private schools, and when you only look at religious schools, the private schools actually cost significantly less.   Because with this loophole tax payers money is being spent on religious education and that is unconstitutional.  First of all, it's not unconstitutional on the federal level, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelman_v._Simmons-Harris and http://www.edchoice.org/getattachment/School-Choice/School-Choice-FAQs/Is-school-choice-constitutional.pdf  Second, we're talking about whether something should be done or not, which is orthogonal to whether it's constitutional. Slavery was constitutional for a long time; was it right to own slaves at that time? If something is unconstitutional, that doesn't make it a bad idea, just a more difficult idea to implement (and by using "loopholes", it can often be done.)  The core issue is whether it's a good idea or not, whether it's constitutional shouldn't be part of that discussion.   Dogma much?    I don't see this being the case in the long run. After the initial introductory pricing, a private school is going to do what every private business does...jack up prices or cut costs. Then you'll have a school that is costing taxpayers more than the equivalent public school, and/or provides sub-standard education due to cost-cutting. The lack of profit motive is actually a benefit in the public school system.  The voucher could be fixed to some percentage of public school costs. If the private school raises its prices, it will lose customers, and it can never cost taxpayers more than public school would. And given that they're still competing with completely free public schools, they couldn't slash service *too* badly, and they still need to meet accreditation standards.  But it's far more likely that vouchers will be used as a separation mechanism to keep poor kids in declining public schools and rich kids in their own education bubble.  You're really going to need to source this. I'm not going to accept this assertion. http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/0817938923_51.pdf seems to imply that isn't correct.  They could easily hide the costs for their religious classes or lie about what they consider religious teaching.   If they manage to teach all the mandated curriculum for less than the public schools they're competing with, I don't really care how they do it, frankly.     That is just a loop hole to get public funding into a religious school.  Why does the fact that something is a loophole make it wrong? What's the *actual* argument against?  You have the option to go to public school like the rest of us. Or pay extra and to a private school of your choice.  That doesn't actually address the argument I raised above.    I grew up going to private Christian schools. Only Christian teachers were allowed.  For the record, I grew up going to a private Jewish school, and non-Jewish/non-religious teachers were allowed for the "secular" classes.  Many of those classes had zero mention of religion; e.g. math. They used state-mandated textbooks IIRC.   So what would you say to an education tax discount for anyone who has a kid and pays for a private school?  (Incidentally, some of the proposals for school choice have focused around tax credits for scholarship funds donations.)   [Replied in sibling comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3bm7fp/colorado_court_rules_use_of_public_funds_for/csnsgal?context=2)   The government isn't providing postal service for free. USPS charges.  Analogy fails.    It takes money away from the public schools  It also takes away students, and the money the public schools save on having less students is greater than the money given to the private schools. (Or at least I've seen some proposals for vouchers of a lower amount than the public school cost per kid.)  which the low and middle income students have to use, and gives it to the private schools, which only the rich kids can afford anyways.  Why can't a low income student use the private school? Now, because it costs a lot, and even then plenty of poor people go to private schools, but with vouchers the cost would come down.  Also, many of the voucher proposals were only for low-income parents.  Also there's the fact that many of these private schools are religious, and I sure as hell don't want my taxpayer dollars paying for little Billy's bible class.  This is easily solved by only paying for the portion of school that isn't religious.  	149

I just want to see it for myself, and have explained to me what I'm seeing. I'd love nothing more than to compare my son's MRI with a "healthy" one.  We already have an appointment with another neurologist, and as he's a colleague of our current doctor I'm hoping for an unbiased assessment. Only time will tell at this point. Thanks again.      Recently my wife and I have been told by a neurologist our son (2.5years old) may have a condition known as [pelizaeus merzbacher disease](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PelizaeusMerzbacher_disease). Based on his early development of nystagmus, current state of ataxia, and apparent low myelin formation on his MRI. As you can imagine we are taken back by this, especially while we wait for confirmation through genetic testing.  I've asked the doctor to please show us his MRI, and she has avoided this for almost two months now. Everytime I bring it up it seems she avoids it, explaining it would be of no use to us as "it's incredibly hard to spot". No matter how much I insist, we never get a chance to examine our son's MRI. So my question is this, how hard is it to actually see low myelin formation? Should I be concerned with how the neurologist is handling this? We are very scared, and it seems no one has any answers.

 Not yet...   Illuminati confirmed   All icebergs? Lame.    its .001%  It's .01, fool.   Not once did I ever say that the civilian killed the police K9 intentionally. You are imagining that fact for the sake of your argument.   Clearly you are as ignorant as you are stupid. This conversation is not worth continuing. Thanks for nothing and go fuck yourself.   Also, for the record, you said "utter retarded" and you're preaching about *my* education?   :(    No, you point was that you are equating an action with intent to the same as a negligent action, which are two very separate acts.  You're gonna tell me what my own point was? I just told you what my point was. A police K9 is a police officer regardless of circumstances. That is my point. Whether negligent or intentional, regardless of **who** injures the dog, it should be considered an **officer** uniformly in all cases. Do you have anything to say about that point?   Oh how I wish this were real.   In one scenario a person willfully kills the animal while attempting to run from police.  Willfully kills the animal while attempting to run? That statement is an oxymoron. How can they willfully kill the animal while they are attempting to run away?  My point is that if a police K-9 is going to be considered "an officer", and criminals who harm said "officer" are charged the same as if they had harmed an actual police officer, than the same "officer" status should stand regardless of the circumstances.  The dog is an officer, so while the death may not have been intentional, it was caused by negligence and the police officer responsible should be charged accordingly as if the dog was a person who was unintentionally locked in the car and died.

I haven't seen you in ages!   Ohh ok, gotcha. Makes sense now.    Nice. 76% wouldn't be enough for me to risk 100 coins for a reward of 3 though. That's almost a 1 in 4 shot of losing.   Those seem like terrible odds. Not being familiar with the casino, what was he playing that he felt confident betting 330 coins for the chance to only win 100? And subsequently betting 100 just to win 3?   Get me... an avocado, a snorkel, and an ice pick... trust me bro, I've made bongs with less.   #WTF   Ok... you win... I'll do it.  But seriously, doesn't sound too difficult. Start by finding guys you think are attractive, it should only take a few minutes of talking with them to determine if they're a creep, and then the only real toss up would be whether or not they're down to take photos.    Definitely cut down on the nicotine level and see if you notice a difference. When i say sweating, I was dripping and it felt like my skin was radiating heat like it was some sort of super power.   What many people don't realize is how much nicotine they are actually ingesting when using an e-cig, because they tend to puff on it much more casually and often than if they were smoking regular cigarettes. Not to mention that the filter in a regular cigarette does a lot to restrict the level of nicotine, tar, and other chemicals that make it into your lungs.   Ever smoke a regular cigarette with no filter? Notice the difference and how easily it makes you light headed? I postulate that smoking an e-cig is not much different in terms of nicotine consumption, it's like smoking a cigarette unfiltered, (only without the tobacco and all the other harmful chemicals/carcinogens).

Not the best decision... for me, the trip will usually last about 8-12 hours depending on the potency and dosage (as each tab will have a different amt of actual LSD on it).  Very much a rookie mistake, if I were you, I would look into crafting up an excuse to call out of work tomorrow so that you can actually enjoy your trip.

They're always after me lucky charms   Bills have stated that they want McCoy to get 300+ carries. Fred Jackson probably won't be stealing too many touches from him.  On the other hand, DeMarco has Ryan Matthews and possibly sometimes Sproles who are willing and able to steal his touches.  Is this rushing yards only, or passing yards included as well?  Either way it is a toss up, but barring injury, as much as I hate to say it, I think Lesean has the advantage here strictly due to his lack of competition for touches.    Beautifully said, thanks for taking the time to write that out.   All of the energy that existed in that "singularity" pre big bang, had to come for somewhere. I find it difficult to believe that it just infinitely "was".   Is it possible that all that energy/matter that existed in the pre big bang singularity, was accumulated from somewhere much in the same way black holes absorb the matter/light/energy around them?   I read somewhere that the ultimate fate of any simply expanding universe is to contain just one black hole which is so massive that it has swallowed up all the other black holes and subsequent matter (of course this would take a very long time), because there is no known "critical mass" for a black hole.   Perhaps the end result of the universe is when every atom has been swallowed up into a giant black hole, then a critical mass in a sense has been reached and the resulting singularity explodes into another big bang.  And the cycle continues on and on...    And what happens to the credit of the people who pay only 2k of their 10k bill, even if the hospital may be "satisfied" with receiving only the 2k?   When compared to the healthcare systems in Canada, Australia, and Europe for example, it is clear that our American healthcare system needs a serious and immediate overhaul, and has for quite some time.      I think you misconstrue infinite universe with infinite size, but that's a meaningless statement for an infinite thing.  I think I do too.  How are they different?   Hitler wouldn't.   Hey guys look, we found Hitler's reincarnation.    Civilian kills police K-9 while fleeing; jailed for murder of an officer.  Police officer kills police K-9 due to negligence; leave with pay.    If the universe was postulated to have once been contained inside a tiny point (pre big bang), and has been continually expanding at an increasing rate ever since the big bang, how can it possibly be considered infinite?   Orange you glad I didn't say banana?   Banning is harsh, but why post it there in the first place?   If the universe is expanding in all directions, what is it expanding into?

Hairy Pooter   #42 DOWN, 42 DOWN   Solid, solid advice.    Just the details and the way it's gone down. I've seen it many times in the past. Of course, I don't know you or her personally, that would make the diagnosis much more simple.  But as far as specifics, the sudden nature of it, the fact that you have been together for 4 years and are only 20 years old. Prime breakup time. Also a prime age where you meet a lot of new people. A lot of times it's a guy from work, could be a friend of a friend, probably someone she spends a lot of time around.   The fact that she is keeping things open ended with you, in my opinion could mean she doesn't know where its going with the other guy, but she is free to do whatever she wants with you or him while she makes up her mind, because she is no longer in an official relationship. The fact that she is still sleeping next to you when she comes over and all that, shows that she still has interest in you, but that she feels guilty about what she's doing with the other guy and as a result doesn't want to take things further.   What was her legitimate reason for ending things after 4 years? What about your relationship wasn't working out to her liking, that she couldn't handle?  A lot of times they won't tell you about the other guy because either they don't want to hurt your feelings, they don't want you going after the other guy, or they want to string you along on the back-burner, selfishly, in case things don't work out with the other guy. (or a combination of the three)  Either way, having lived through my 20's, it is far more common than you probably realize at this point in your life. It's unfortunate.    Not sure how I feel about this. Why not just offer them jobs?    You won't be laughing when those eggs hatch.    Two beantown creampies, please   See my previous statement. Edited it real quick.   ~~Who ended the relationship?~~ I see that she did. Unfortunately, this re-affirms my previous statement. Sounds like she met somebody else while you were together and was developing feelings for them, didn't want to be disrespectful to you / sneaking around, so she ended things (and left them open ended). Now she may be feeling conflicted, unsure of what she wants.   I know it sucks, and this could very well not be the case, but I'm just speaking from general experience. Make damn sure though, because you should be keeping your own future and well being in mind. The legitimate reason for the breakup plays a huge role in what your next steps should be.   That sounds amazing.    Bacon sushi confirmed.  	118
    Just wait for him to get a bit older.    It could happen yet...   She gots her nails did.   Happy with the switch, very hard to look back.   ...or any number of other reasons. My son had torticollis, couldn't turn his head to the right.   Yeah we stuck an Evel Knievel sticker kit on our kid's lid, with his name on the back. Made him a bit of a star with the neighbourhood ladies.   Inflated?   That road was in the east.    HEE-HEE!   Forget about it, the Cavs just barely squeaked past a Hawks team minus Horford, Korver and Sefolosha.

And then you might be putting it close to your face. Just sayin'.   I don't see why not.   Lately, yeah. I send them to my brother.  He doesn't send anything back.   I mean, I'd like to...

I mean really listen. It's a beauty. Farts like that come along what, once a month?   My brother moved out of town, I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't feel so homesick.   Just ask away, man. What do you need to know?   HAVE A RIPPER DAY MATE! :)   My brother moved out of town, I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't feel too homesick.   I'm not sure I can really take the credit here. My bunghole did most of the work. But it does seem to be making a lot of people happy, which is not something many bungholes get to do.   If you see it, tape it for me. That would make my year.   We can only hope.   My brother moved an hour away, and I was missing him. I started texting him my farts so he wouldn't get homesick... But when this one came out, I knew it was special.    Right there with you, man - I'm gonna go to bed soon knowing that by the time I wake up, hundreds of thousands of people all over the world will have listened to my pucker. My eyes are red, from crying so much, from laughing so much. My stomach is actually sore. The world is a wonderful place.   No. I plan to keep on farting until another movement comes out.   My brother moved away from town, and I was missing him. So I started texting him farts to let him know I love him. This would have been in the first dozen or so, but the second it came out I knew it was special.   Hahahahahahaha I'm in tears here!   You turn your back for ONE MINUTE.....   On a serious note, my missus is certain she's heard that melody somewhere before in a classical piece. Perhaps Vivaldi?

I've done a 100 kb swing 100 burpee 20 min time cap workout before..it's a mental struggle for sure and you will be sore the next day.   i'm just worried that regular season rondo cost us depth off the bench where we are now relying on charlie v. and richard jefferson to be impact players and that in the West you cant really afford to be losing games.   Something is off with this Mav's team since the Rondo trade..he played 34 minutes and had no points..I just dont see this mav's team threatening in the playoffs..ALSO learn to inbound the ball   you should post an OH squat form check. You don't have to pull the bar too far back on an OH squat. I struggled with my OH Squat for a long time until i figured i was pulling it back too far which put unnecessary pressure on my joints. I know a lot of people diss crossfit but i've found this box puts out good form videos..here's there [OH squat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiB0QkCgcs8)   a quick tip, you can place a weight on the ground in front of your bar on the deadlifts to keep the weight from rolling away from you like that.   ty!   This may be a really stupid question..but on radiant side, if i ward near the medium camp by the river(so that i can see the rune spawn area but also keep track of enemy's like pudge who may be waiting for hooks) do I block the ability to stack that camp?   hold it close to your chest like you are hugging it   like [this](http://images.lifescript.com/Media/Lifescript%20Media/Experts/Jorges%20Daily%20Fit%20Tips/jorge_hyperextension_on_swiss_ball.jpg?w=160 h=184 as=1)   played basketball(pickup) or soccer(club league) for 2 hrs a day during highschool.weighed 145 lbs(5' 11"). Went to college..had all you can eat meal plan..exit freshman year at 195. develop stomach ulcers during college back down to 175. Start real world job..eat out for lunch every day..up to 195.. do p90x..down to 165 and shredded(result post in history)..slowly bulk back up to 195 bc i dont stay working out.. Start crossfit...  1.5 yrs later: 1RM squat 235lbs 1RM deadlift 325lbs 1RM c j 175lbs  now running ICF 5x5 just for fun..still going to gym consistently.    Baze perfected this move at ODU lol   knees out is a que i use to make sure i'm opening my hips. It's exactly what it sounds like, as you send your hips back focus on your knees going out. [This picture](http://www.precisionnutrition.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/what-your-knees-should-not-be-doing-during-a-squat1.png) shows you what i mean..make sure your legs are like A.  As for the row..you can keep your grip wide if you have mobility issues..however think about pulling your elbows to the back of the room. It might have been the camera angle but it looked like you were doing a bent over high pull instead of a row   okay poor wording..i think the bar is going too far over his head(if you watch the video he hits the bottom peg on the camera left side)   squats: you are doing low bar so focus on sending your hips back hard and opening up your hips by driving your knees out. dont look down and i think that will fix your back rounding  bench press: hard to tell without a perpedicular vantage point but it seems you dont have a straight bar path. Looks like you are pushing towards your head a little bit(you almost hit the rack)  row: looks like your elbows aren't going back towards the wall but rather sideways during the lift. this would cue some shoulder pain. your end point should look more like [this](http://www.fitbie.com/sites/default/files/barbell-row-b-ex.jpg)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cRFdg8SYAc  Sorry for the poor angle. Best i could do at the gym. I see some slight butt winking at the bottom and i should probably lock my wrists better.   this is the correct answer. Our coach has us do this weightless or with dumbbells during our oly cycles.   i think if you crank you elbows down and pull the bar into your back..this will solidify your back which will keep it more upright and will remove the "good morning" from you squat.   Hi all,  I have been doing crossfit for the past year and a half..for the last year I did a strength focus class that swapped between 3 month segments of WSSB style programming(1 heavy leg, 1 dynamic upper, rest, 1 dynamic lower, 1 heavy upper) and 3 months of oly lifting cycles. In that time my numbers went to:  Squat: 235 1RM  Front Squat: 185 1RM  Deadlift: 335 1RM  Press: 125 1RM  Clean   Jerk: 175 1RM  Bench: 145 1RM ( :( Sad Panda)  on the ICF 5 x 5 video he says to start at 75% of your 1RM for 5x5.should i still start at that weight even if I've been lifting for a longer period of time than a true novice?   Thanks! If you don't mind I have an objective question ... coming from LoL I know a dragon is worth a tower take down and that both those are equal to 2-3 deaths. I know 1 kill is worth 15-20 minion kills. Is there an equivalent in dota2? With this in mind I value midas BC I feel I can play safe enough to not die needlessly and use the midas to accelerate my farm which will accelerate my items . Im guessing that my assumption that tradeoff is "worth" may be incorrect    Here is a link to my [dotabuff](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/88614157)  I find that i'm comfortable with late game right click carries...and not 100% terrible with spell casters. Right now I'm working my way through the all hero challenge to get an idea of what every character can do.  here is a link to a recent game i had on slarder [link](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1082870278). If i remember correctly i felt like we were ahead in this game and then something happened where i went from carrying to weak...i think i made a bad item choice in buying bkb but i'm not sure  I had a history of playing LoL so don't be afraid to offer all levels of criticism   I've played 2 games today towards my all-hero challenge that have no game records and didnt count towards the challenge.   crossfit is a generic term..my box offers a "serious strength" class that while we do all those things, if you didnt see us every class you might never see us do it. We just focus our workouts towards strength instead of  metcons   personally i work better with a shorter rope..something that is slightly above my waist/around rib cage. i find it easier to spin a little quickly..and it forces me to keep my wrist down   i used to have this problem with kb swings but then realized i was exaggerating the arc in my back every time i swung. focus on keeping your core type and not "leaning back" with each swing   http://www.reddit.com/r/LoLeventVoDs/comments/2edy7a/s4_lcs_north_america_summer_playoffs/   they also could have ap kog. either way if they take both that leaves...vayne? jinx? true the ran the lucian/syndra last game but idk if thats gonna do much vs adc trist and ap kog   the worst part is that tsm had picked nunu, lulu, and nami all but signaling that trist was incoming and dig didnt take it away   not really..just being able to macro well can get you masters in sc2..no micro needed. I was a high diamond in sc2 at one point and am struggling in silver 2 bc my micro sucks   i think thats bc i was trying to emphasize getting my hips back in that set...i'll work on trying to keep my chest up  more though   this me doing 135lb x 5. I feel right around this weight is where it becomes tough enough that my form starts to break down  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXh6tOpg7zs   just wondering..have you been to crossfit hampton roads?   in norfolk crossfit 757...in hampton crossfit hampton roads   the owner of my box is her coach. from everything i've heard she's an awesome person   if you dont mind korean commentary: https://www.youtube.com/user/TVOngamenet/videos   2 things.. squeeze that ass at the top of every rep! imagine you are pinching a penny in between your cheeks! you never fully straighten after every squat see sec 4 on  [http://youtu.be/0rtvMZp1f3w]( http://youtu.be/0rtvMZp1f3w) for example.  also it looks like you are getting forward on your toes..focus on sending your hips back while pushing the knees out to open up the hips as you go down. this will also help you achieve better depth   66 mins 45 secs no vest a couple months ago    imo the Games' scoring doesn't reward the consistent guys (the guys who are finishing 10-20th every event) the way it does the top scorers. A terrible finish in a Games workout is nowhere near as crippling as it is at regionals, so long as you take top 3 on a few workouts. It rewards the top athletes, makes a terrible finish less significant, and kind of shafts the consistent middle of the pack athletes.   The Crossfit Games top 7 men under traditional scoring (same as regionals and open scoring)  1. Ohlsen - 110  2. Hackenbruck - 116  3. Khalipa - 123  4. Fraser - 127  5. Froning - 128  6. Bridges - 128  7. Panchik - 132   10 foot wall ball shots.. 24/20 for the box jump over   i have no clue what IM2 is doing in game one..the duo left 1 golem and 1 wraith at jungle start in their own jungle   i'm getting a not available on that link   What's not shown in this video is Monte explaining that shyv likes to itemize ninja tabi first vs renekton. Also by starting cloth+5pots the shyv has more jungling potential in case of a lane swap so she doesn't fall far behind.   whatever happened to LPL being broadcast in english..we should fix that first   m+w+f have 15 min warmup, 20-30 min strength workout, shorter conditioning wod 12 mins  t-r are the longer wods usually time capped around 20-25 minutes.  also offers a strength specific class m, t, r, f for those just interested in focused lifting    just my opinion. but whatever number you pick to break sets into..lower it. I did 7 on my first set of thrusters thinking i'd break everything into 3rds...i had to do sets of 3 from there on out..i think if I had done 5 i could have kept a stronger pace. also on the burpees find a nice pace you can keep the entire time. you should be able to do them unbroken   both cars i've seen ads for 0% for the first 3 years. Given the state of my finances I could realistic have either payed off in that time.   I think i started responding before your edit.  What are the reason to go for a 2011 bmw vs the mazda/scion?     around here its hard to get used cars with 0% apr. dont bmw/audi's have high upkeep/maintenance costs?       if only they were in my price range T.T   yeah a sporty sedan. I'm 26 and I make a decent amount of money..so I want a car that looks good..but I dont want to be a pretentious douche. I dont really like trucks/suvs either   So i've been driving a used 2000 Ford Taurus for the past 8 years and put over 170k miles on it. Today it finally bit the dust so I'm looking for a new car.   If I can get a deal with 0% APR i would prefer new  My price range is $30k I prefer automatic transmissions  I've driven a Dodge Challenger and didnt like the handling, a hyundai Sonata which was much like my taurus  Currently my top options are Mazda6, Scion FR-S   no doubt. i just dont believe the stated "i forgot" reason when he had a tweet about it going on   i'm gonna say joking:  https://twitter.com/Matt1Chan/status/439867378688483328   the only channel i consistently watch is ongamenet..and i subscribe to that channel so still no ads lol everything else is me flipping around   i would do this except twitch prerolls ads on ALL channels   we use them as lighter replacements for kettle bells for some beginners, or for 1 armed hang power cleans or 1 armed hang power snatch, farmer walks..   its the entire east coast..there was a thread near the top 2 day ish ago about it    i was doing cleans and was really focusing on keeping my elbows up by pushing the weight into my throat more...i end up cleaning the 135lbs straight into my neck...ended up with a bruise that looked a lot like a hickey   since i'm not at high level(silver 5), should i then not worry about this all in since my adc may not be comfortable fast shoving etc?   see title. right now i am starting gp10 item + 4 red pots or if i feel really confident in the lane 2 red pots and 1 ward. When/why should i take dorans shield over gp10?   I'm in bronze 1 and got match up against someone who was diamond last season. T.T   because this way i gather enjoyment from both  edit: to clarify. if i watch the show first, the book becomes supplemental material that i still enjoy..where as reading the books would probably make me despise the show.   thank you!   i want to keep the show as first exposure bc i find when i read books before seeing shows, i am inevitably disappointed(ie lord of the rings/hobbit)   I just finished Clash of Kings today, assuming i wish to use the tv show as my first exposure, am I safe to read ASOS? i have seen all tv episodes to date   Also you are delusional if you think you can bar a barbell + weights for 300 bucks...heck just a nice working set of dumbbells will cost $600   i'm so jealous of those prices... mine is $145 a month...   what is your definition of "dive in"? should do multiple sessions per a day 5 days a week? probably not. First thing you should do is find a box near you that provides an onramp program(aka a training program), this will introduce you to crossfit movements at a lower level of intensity with more focus on form(the one at my gym last 6 sessions effectively 2 weeks)  Then start with 3 days a week and see how you feel. My first month the only thing i lifted during WODs was the 15 lb training bar to get my form down..now i'm 7 months in and I did 55 reps of deadlifts at 155lb today.   i have a sub, video isn't playing   No links from r/LolEventVODs are loading for me and today's OGN match wont play either   i know this is a rule in OGN...is it being applied in LCS?   Speaking of which...I'm absolutely shocked at the lack of vayne play..with every game going late and her being a natural counter to the big tanks meta it would seem a natural pick   If a tie occurs, a best of 1 match is played at a later date(essentially making the series between the teams a best of 3)   i giggled like a school girl..which is slightly embarrassing for a 25 yr old lol   i will laugh out loud if they dont show and get disqualified  	79
          After this week's eleven, there will be only 20 states left that ban same-sex marriage. That makes it a horserace! Who do you think will win the honour of being the final, most backward state in the USA?               In my work with depressed people, I'm also struck by a disconnect between anticipatory emotion (do you look forward to doing something, like going out) and retrospective emotion (are you glad you did it).   For example, most of us dread the thought of doing taxes, but are glad when we've finished them. We might also drag our feet organizing an event with friends, but enjoy it when it happens and feel happy we did it.  Problems often arise when people live their lives according to their temptations (how they feel in advance) as opposed to how they will feel afterward. They often feel their lives are going well when they choose activities based on satisfaction rather than temptation.  Are the elements of a hiki life genuinely more satisfying than being out in the world, or only more tempting but ultimately unsatisfying?   In Welcome to the NHK, an anime series about hikikomori, Sato at one point asks "Why does someone become hikikomori" and answers himself "Because he can." In other words, it is the fact that his family provides him money and makes it possible. When the money runs out, it becomes necessary to get out in the world and stop being one. To what extent do you feel this is true?   	10

I'm looking for something exactly like that. And for a buck too! Nice diy by the way.      The city opened up the side panel and was using it as a power source for lights on one of the Lief Ericson Tunnels after Sandy knocked out the power box there.   BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            I know the Fire House is close and they used the boxes power for construction recently but when the city was done they removed the alarm panel and left it open. It's been this way ever since. Kinda sad.      I know the Fire House is close but this was one of the last Fire Alarm Boxes in the neighborhood and they used the boxes power for construction recently but when they were done they removed the alarm button panel and left the box open. It's been this way ever since.            Obama should be laying fiber optic cable like Eisenhower laid highways.

If he's a Chef that deals with food getting him something like this may inspire him to try baking bread as a new interest/hobby. I know I would love something like this, hint to the wife! ;)   story http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/chris-pratt-shares-photo-van-lived-homeless-article-1.1906524                  Especially high end restaurants have a lot. When I was going to school I interned at a high end restaurant in Brooklyn and I worked along side students from Peter Klump, The Culinary Institute of America and The New York Restaurant School. When the chef found out I had line experience he used me to replace the guy working the pasta station for one night a week. The other interns then on hated me because they were still chopping onions, scaling fish and doing all the other prep work that a restaurant needs for a dinner service. If you want everyone to love you you can never survive a professional kitchen.   Glad I could help. BTW what did you spend the money on?         Ouch, I'm sorry. I did Karmadecay it before I posted it.   Yea me too!

The performers you see in places like Times Square actually have to perform their act to be approved by the city before they are allowed to perform in public. There's a guy who plays a piano on the platform, he gets the piano down by using the Handicapped elevator.  Here's the Guide For Street Performers NYC http://citylore.org/urban-culture/resources/street-performers/         /r/Peeviews would love this.   i checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5347261   I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5347261   I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5347261         I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5347039      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5346944         I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5346944      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5346921   I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5346921         I was working for a small bus company in NYC, tours, airport transfers things like that. My boss was a good guy and a lot of his contacts were through friends of his so we were always getting really nice clients and jobs. I was waiting for a group to come out of the Natural History Museum when I spot Jerry Seinfeld cooling down after a run in Central Park right next to my bus. I told him I was a big fan and asked for an autograph and he just gave me the haughtiest look I have ever been given in my life, he snorts and just walks away rolling his eyes. Seinfeld hadn't been on for long and I remember him begging to get on Stern when he was working the tri state area, that's when I found out his distaste for giving autographs to the point he even included it in his American Express commercials years later. Whatever, right? Fast forward a few years and Seinfeld is bigger than ever and I'm driving around the UWS giving a night tour to this group really nice group from Alabama, they could not have been more friendlier if they tried. Well I pull up to a light and I spot Seinfeld talking with a friend at his corner, he's looking for a cab and I remember the snub from before so I get on the speaker, point him out and then opened the door right in front of him and in about a minute he was surrounded. The look on his face, PRICELESS!      I almost stepped into the path of an oncoming bus yesterday while answering a call from my wife. I wondered if she would have heard the hit?                        Damm! Straight outta Melbourne is a great title.               Why didn't anyone call the police and animal control on this stupid woman? Oh and from past experience grabbing and pulling both rear legs of a pit will usually make them drop whats in their mouth. This is why pit bulls should be banned in cities. Their "great family pets" until that the one time they are not.                              Why do I look at this subreddit when all I've got to eat for dinner is cereal?   You are correct! Former new Yorker living in California redid a small bathroom. I think it looks great!

I'm sorry but if you took a job without asking how much your going to be paid then, my friend you are going to be very unpleasantly surprised. BTW which place are you going to be slaving/working in in Williamsburg?

 I'm guessing its an extended cameo then.          why not get the arkham knight bundle?   Doesnt really answer the question though. the texture pop in is what made it unplayable for me.       Is this subreddit gonna do a season 8 re-watch before season 9 premieres?      Book 6....Keep dreaming.    No. I hate this game with a passion.    That are not part of their main phases sort of like star wars anthology movies?   if your not going to watch it all dont bother. Every episode is essential to the plot. If you skip one you'll miss something important and it just wont make sense.   i think OP is talking about the movie Max with the dog.       yea but marvel seems to want people to think that the incredible hulk never happened :(      that tweet sounded like the person wasn't a marvel fan tho and just mocked the name ant-man.    I mean what other villains besides Loki have returned for more than one movie in the MCU? I really want YellowJacket to survive Ant-Man. Been a bit annoyed that Red Skull hasn't made a come back yet.       All of us need to see this movie to show marvel we want more new characters.  Marvel will be watching this one closely to see how it performs.       english version ftw.    Or will they just go **** it and keep moving forward?   Geek0id 3 cause you ain't geek0id.       stupid article is stupid. what major update? did I miss something?   Stop making shit up.          A lot of people are expecting it flop or fall below expectations. I think when a movie, especially one like ant-man defies all expectations id consider it a sleeper hit.    There are some streaming websites in countries like korea that get exclusive streaming rights a month or so after the cinema release state side. People then use a piece of software to rip the video from their servers.    What when?   Hank Pym should task Scott Lang to steal one of Stark's Iron Man helmets as a test but Scott ends up doing it for shits and giggles and he ends up on the avengers radar when Jarvis captures him on a security camera and all you see is an iron man helmet on starks work bench suddenly move and fall of the table and seemingly walk out the door on its own and starks just staring at the screen with a stunned reaction.   LOL imagine ant-man stealing Iron Mans helmet or something just for shits and giggles.    Doesn't make it official unless it comes directly from Marvel.    you must be real fun at parties.    yea they reported that the amazing spider-man 3 was going to go into production turned out to be bs.    I know its winter but is something else going on in the environment? Its not usually this cold is it? I could barely feel my hands this morning.       I really want to know what happened between the first avenger and winter soldier.    I always support the underdog and we need AMD to stick around     Anyone who wanted to play the master chief collection has already bought an xbox one.   The ending of halo 4 would probably convince quite a lot of PC players to buy halo 5 and an xbox one. As a result MCC on PC would drive more sales for halo 5 and xbox one. This is something ms could use to their marketing advantage like. "play halo 4 on PC before halo 5 on xbox one with the master chief collection on pc in 1080p/60fps" idk im not a marketing guy lol just an idea.   in the end just put the game on steam. Give it a bit of discount for having pc gamers wait so long and watch the money flow in. Everybody wins.            Amazon has showed interest in show in the past so tweet them as well.       You think thats bad? I live in New Zealand and Liriks streams start at around 4am and I get up at 4:30am. And they usually finish when I get home around mid day. So I hardly ever get to watch live except weekends.    its already aired and its been more than a few weeks since the finale. Id say its fair game.    yea they had to cancel their suicide squad plans with Harley Quinn once the movie was announced.       it said play it first on playstation. They didn't say it was exclusive. Play it first usually means its a timed exclusive.    The russo brothers are directing both so it doesn't matter.       the beauty of plot armor.    They know their audience   that would be pretty awesome.    we also need gears of war 2 and 3.    Man your an idiot.    Honestly I wouldn't care. They have to make money back somehow and if its through xbox live on PC ill take it. I just want halo on PC.    I call bullshit. If we have learned anything about the production leading up to this movie its that the studio hates leaks and spoilers. Other newsoutlets are also probably mad they didn't get this scoop so their trying to make people think its fake and are working with Disney to disprove this.       Thor: Ragnarok when it was announced Feige compared it to the winter solder in phase 2. Ragnarok will be the big game change in phase 3.                Daniel Craig has one movie left after Spectre and it looks like casting could already be underway for his replacement. Lots of rumors over the last 24 hours include Damian Lewis as the potential new bond. Who do you think should take his place?      maybe hes a pro cod player and has to have the platform that gets the DLC first?      But you would'nt steal a car?      Thats true. Something like a 750ti will do you nicely. its small and uses hardly any power. Yet it has more graphics power than the ps4 and xbox one.    get a better graphics card and you'll be sweet.    well fallout 4 has been in development since fallout 3 came out. so its further along than Doom.    As will Tomb Raider and Battlefront. Battlefront cant get delayed cause Disney wants it out the same time as the force awakens and Tomb Raider has a licensing deal that will expire so MS will want take advantage of it.    Can we just stop and think about this for a minute. This movie made more money in one WEEKEND than some movies do in their LIFETIME. HOLY SHIT.    The First Avenger was alright. The only thing I didn't like were the scenes where cap had to get all patriotic and suck up to his superiors so he could be in the army.   Who else is taking the day off just to watch the show live?   I remember reading an article from Forbes where they said that agents of shield being renewed for season 3 pretty much meant that tis longevity was virtually confrmed now and that ABC would see it as a viable asset in the future because it got past a certain number of episodes or something.   How much of a role would the show being involved with marvel have influenced ABCs decision on whether or not to renew or cancel future seasons?   With news that sony and marvel might be arguing over who the next spider-man should be it's got me a bit worried. I've been trying to think if there's anything Sony could do to possibly back out of the deal with Marvel if Sony doesn't like working with Marvel.  One would assume that Marvel/Disney aren't that stupid and they would of had their lawyers double and triple check the contract before signing it to make sure Sony couldn't find away to back out. But I'm curious if there is? Any lawyers here familiar with things like this? Would Sony be able to make a case if they don't like working with marvel and cant decide on a spider-man and want to back out of the deal. could they?   we already have inhumans being the substitute for x-men in the MCU now anyway. marvel doesn't need them.    One example I use quite often is Chris Evans in Danny Boyle's movie sunshine. such humble beginnings for an actor who would later become such a huge star. Another one is RDJ in Zodiac in 2007 before he played  Iron Man in 2008.    Due to TMNT2? Anyone know when filming wraps for TMNT2 and when filming for arrow commences?    well to me it seems like the studio has no idea wtf is going on. One day apparently bay isn't directing a week later he is then hes not. its a never ending cycle of will bay direct or not.                Remember the marvel event last October? Feige said that anything that wasn't announced then was ether stll in development or just pure rumor and speculation. He was asked about Benedict Cumberbatch at the time and basically said his casting was still in negotiations and unfortunately he wasn't cast till about a month or to after the event. Feige apparently had his phone ready and waiting for the call to announce Cumberbatch at the event but these things take time. Especially when dealing with such young actors their probably nervous about signing on to such a strict contract like this.    They need to take their time. Marvel and sony cant afford to screw up this casting. They want this new spider-man to be the wolverine of the MCU. So whoever they cast needs to be commited and wont try and walk out on the role when the going gets tough or when they get older and want to try other things.    Not unless you want your jacket and whatever is in the jackets pockets to get stolen sure.    But I liked that movie :(      rage much. its an old game deal with it.    No it hasn't been confirmed. There has been no announcement by marvel on that one.    Some updates require other updates to be able to install. its normal.          The soundtrack for the first amazing spider-man was brilliant. I don't think James Horner gets enough credit for this.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVDrTLHZEVQ   Fallout 4 is coming to ps4 as well.       I think ill be sticking with my 970 for a while. Maybe till the GTX1100 series. what about you guys? when do you decide to upgrade?   With no comic con appearance this year by marvel studios could we get a spider-man announcement at D23 along with a civil war teaser?   pretty sure thats fake.    Been out of the loop for a while. Has there been any info on what the next game will be? Pokemon Z or X2 and Y2?   even so. hes a dragon. Sons of the Harpy should of been no match for him.    What were they thinking? How dare Drogon almost die like that, that was bullshit! HES A DRAGON he should burned them all. The amount of bullshit during that scene was incredible.   it was in game glitches. like flashing colors in assassins creed unity. strange textures in saints row the third etc.    Remember to wipe all previous traces of any previous drivers. I learned the hard way after suffering graphical glitches for 3 months on my new 970 only to figure out it was a driver issue and not the gpu.    you were talking about the cat right? XD   LOL christain bale would kick your ass.    Do we really think hes actually done with the role after 2017? Like isn't his contract running out soon? Hes probably negotiating with FOX to see how long they'll wait before they give in and drive a truck full of money up to his door step. Yea Ill believe it when I see it.       This is the final trailer its the labeled incorrectly.    It probably takes just as long to install from the disc as it would to download. So why not just buy the game digitally? I remember getting the master chief collection and despite having the disc the game ended up downloading stuff anyway. so whats the point of a physical copy?   I call bullshit. Marvel must be feeding them false information.    Probably stuff for windows 10.    How pissed off would you be? Do you think HBO could get away with it? would they risk cutting off some viewers of the show for a chance at making some money?   The first one that comes to mind is a scene from Pearl Harbor. Cant remember exactly when it happens in the movie but there's a pretty obvious scene where you can see green screen in the cockpit of an aircraft.    skyrim was announced at e3 2011. came out in november in that year.       duel.    Please for the love of god dont buy hp!    its not actually the actors themselves its just Feige sitting there in his office going hmmm what would Jamie post today and then hes like wait #itsallconnected so he posts to the thor twitter lol   You should of waited! why buy now when the 390x is around the corner?      its been clear for a while now they no longer care about the books. So why not jump the shark and have a bit fun with it?   Or John dies saving everyone.    Instead of bringing back Catelyn as lady stoneheart they should bring back Ned stark. Minds would be blown. Fans would love it and hate it.       sort of like the halo 4 announcement back in 2011?   Its xbox exclusive for Holiday 2015. Not for ever.    Anyone heard anything if they will be present? or is it still too early?   who would he be and why?   I'm just curious to find out why and how many people use a pirated OS. Lets not turn this into a thread of whats right and wrong.  Strawpoll. Because I can.    http://strawpoll.me/4527342      Thought id make a strawpoll for this one.  http://strawpoll.me/4527046/  I think Ant-Man will do better mostly because of its connection to the MCU. Mean while FF has already had two bad movies under its belt and people haven't forgotten those so they may not be as willing to give this reboot a chance.       I think marvel has big plans for Hydra and their only getting started and that paticular line in winter soldier only enforces this theory.    Anyone know if hes working on anything?   http://screenrant.com/marvel-studios-movies-tv-shows-rivalry-joss-whedon/   Poor Gregg. Its shame theres so much conflict between Tv Marvel and movie Marvel.  I reckon Renner was going to appear on Shield but something happened behind the scenes to prevent it.    even if they did that you could just roll back the driver so it would be stupid for NVIDIA to even try something like that. It would just piss people off.    All that's needed now is for 4k monitors to drop to an affordable mainstream price.    I'm guessing it doesn't show up unless you have updates enabled?    why would they put him in Doctor Strange though? it doesn't make sense. That's the only other marvel movie he could appear in.    Got some sauce for that?   He didn't retire.So many of you misunderstood the end of Iron Man 3. He destroyed his suits for pepper but he never stopped being Iron Man. Thats why it was called the clean slate protocol. He wanted a fresh start and to forget the past. He even said before the credits rolled  "You can take away everything from me but there's one thing you can't take away I'm Iron Man"   1. Spider-Man must not have a big role in Civil War and they are filming around his scenes until they cast someone  2.Negotiations with Asa Butterfield are taking longer than expected and marvel and sony are getting nervous so they are looking at alternatives in case negations fail.   just some food for thought.          imagine a launch at e3. hype. but seriously. it will be out holiday 2015.    Hopefully they will premiere the first 2 episodes on the same day like alot of new shows do.    YES! I was hoping someone would bring this up. I can totally see this replacing person of interest for me if season 5 is the final season. The pilot was so good!   make sure to set power management in windows to high performance. sometimes being on power saver or balanced can cause lag.          Not sure if its just me but the graphics in episode 4 seems rushed, especially during the previously on game of thrones intro it looks kind of pixelated in the background and in general looks worse compared to the previous episodes.    wtf.      I thought it was happening? Haven't heard anything in a long time though.    they are hardware developers not software developers .   380x is a rebranded 290x.          In light of Tron 3 getting canned lets talk about Tron: Legacy. What did you like about it? what did you hate? what could they have improved on in the sequel? Lets get a good discussion going!   id be ok with it. its better than not having the game not released at all. it means at least some people get to enjoy it.       I've seen July mentioned a few times haven't seen anything official though.    well the movie has been out for a while now and I'm sure most of us have seen it at least a couple of times to decide. Is it better than the first movie?       Totally agree. I have always said the consoles need to put FPS over resolution. A higher frame rate just makes the game that much more enjoyable when your not noticing stutter or clipping when moving around. It doesn't make sense to have the game running at 1080p when the hardware clearly cant handle it.    I think there needs to be a time jump in season 4. Have season 4 take place 1 or 2 years post season 3. That way they can get as far away from it as possible. Have Oliver and Felicity develop a proper relationship during that time off screen so we don't need to see her cry every time Oliver does something she doesn't approve of and they wont have to mention anything that happened in season 3 ether except for maybe Saras death then they can jump straight into the action in season 4. Have some devastating event that causes Oliver to come out of retirement and return to starling city and bam just like that you got season 4 the rest is up to the writers on what story they have planned hopefully its something awesome.          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xed6HlatulQ   I loved this movie when I was younger. Thought the 3d was awesome.    Alternate universe? different earth? there are plenty of ways they could pull it off.    Can you imagine if they do a post credit scene where grunt gustin shows up and tells Ezra Millers flash that he isn't the only flash in the universe. OMG 2 barry allen's waaaaattttt   Wednesday usually meant a new episode of the flash for me. But not today and no Agents of Shield ether. Me sad :(      what if thanos in the mcu has the ability to take the form of a human and disguise himself?   Haven't overclocked it. still on stock clocks.    I hope its just that. All my other games seem to run fine. And its only this particular level on the game where this glitch happens. All the other levels appear to be fine.    Heres another one where the glitch is more visible. http://i.imgur.com/ryb5UQK.jpg?1      So the writers finally found a way to freshen up the show at the end of season 3 but fox had to ruin it and cancel it. Anyone heard if another network might pick it up?         gta 5   I got a kick out of those, some of them were really good.Why did they stop?    Actually 2015 is looking like a big year for E3. This is the first year they are doing a PC conference put together by AMD and various other developers and manufacturers. Its looking pretty solid imo.          Hey Niko!   Most gamers seem to stick to the 240-250gb SSD for their os then a 1tb or bigger hard drive for game storage. Does anyone actually get 1tb ssds for their os and games?      Why do people get so hyped for this? who wants to watch a movie without audio? and in black and white?     	200
 A reply or comment that shows someone who disagrees with a particular opinion but who tackles the other person's point, not his/her character.   My basement. During the day, I just see it as the lower part of my house. But at night, it may as well be the opening to the worst circle of hell!   When people think I'm a slacker just because I smoke weed. I'm not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I finished my first year of college with all A's - albeit a few were A minuses - and have always worked hard to stay on top of my life's various workloads like job tasks, household chores, and responding promptly to both professional and casual messages. Bonus exasperation points if the person who is lecturing me is a person with poor work ethic but thinks s/he is superior because s/he doesn't smoke.   There is a huge difference between being a caring, empathetic person and a pushover, however.  	4

 Wow, so this is actually something that I would have thought should not happen, but apparently does.  On the one hand, it makes sense.  On the other hand, I don't quite agree with this being handled in this way.  So, here is what is going on: You are deleting your enemies upon creation.  Because they are created as objects (IE: Not referenced objects via pointers), as soon as they are created, they are destroyed, because they are no longer in scope.  You need to make your array an array of pointers instead of an array of just objects.  (IE: enemy npcs[10]; needs to be made into enemy* npcs[10];).  Then, you can create each enemy using new, and call the destructor for each one with delete.  Honestly, I too am a bit surprised this is happening, and maybe it's a compiler thing as it seems wrong, but maybe I'm mistaken.  TLDR; Your objects are out of scope because your arrays is an array of objects, not pointers, so game::npcs[game::total] = enemy(x, y, 1); will result in their deletion immediately.   Just a quick look through the code, it looks like you may be moving the sprite off screen too quickly in void game::update() (you move every npc by 0.0002,0.0002 each iteration through, but there is no delaying this).  I would try removing that first and see if that fixes it.   Hey, sorry about the delay!  So, the problem in your code is that you *technically* are deleting your enemy's texture.  When you create your enemy it its constructor (enemy::enemy(int x, int y, int type)), you create a local texture variable (sf::Texture texture;).  Notice that this is not a pointer to a texture, but is a new texture object in that constructor.  When your constructor exists however, it gets rid of all local variables created within there.  In this case, because you created a new object, and not a pointer to an object, it will delete your texture when exiting the enemy constructor, thus creating the white square problem.  Remember, any time a method finishes, it cleans up everything.  *Technically* pointers also get destroyed, but what they reference does not!  Hence, a quick solution to fix this is to change your texture to a pointer (sf::Texture* texture;) and create it using the new keyword.  Make sure however that you keep that reference so you can delete it later, otherwise you will end up never deleting the texture object that is referenced, and will end up with a nice memory leak.  I hope I've worded everything clearly, but if not, feel free to keep asking questions :)   I can give it a shot :) do you have your code somewhere because that'll make it a bit easier.   While this could be possible, I actually have another theory that I'm going to attempt to put together this weekend, that would require only 2 or 3 motors (potentially).  I'm finishing up the designs, so we'll see how it goes.  Hopefully I can keep it fairly cheap cause I really want to have my own army of BB8s XD   Can't be wheels. If you watch the video footage, the head is able to be on the side of the body, where it would fall if only moved by wheels. Also, there's a shot during his close up where the head moves around the top of the ball (and down towards the sides a bit, just a small amount) but the body stays completely and perfectly still. It is definitely using some sort of magnetism.    What I imagine this giraffe is thinking: http://imgur.com/MhTGEbQ   Thank you!  I'll make sure to definitely post it there then :)   Ahh!  Well according to the changelog, supposedly support for iOS and Android is in it, but maybe not?  Would be interesting to try and port it over if it's not already.  See here: http://www.sfml-dev.org/changelog.php#sfml-2.2   You're quite welcome!  SFML is super fun, and I especially enjoy how quickly I can get it up and running.  That said, I'm excited to add some more APIs to the videos I make too :)  	10
 Read the post again. What the Op suggests is that, similar to the effect of overindulgence in anything, the result in this particular case is a sever weakening. He also emphasizes the fact that it is natural. Meaning abstinence (especially where it is forced, which is in almost every case) is wrong and harmful. But it is a very damaging thing to indulge in doing so in excess.  Note here I am speaking about sexual intercourse and not masturbation, which is demeaning and should be avoided.   It's not a thought, these findings are published scientific findings.   edit: Ah yes, down vote on factual reality. Go ahead and bury your ignorant heads in the sand. It changes nothing of the facts no matter how strongly you wish it otherwise!   Besides personal attacks, do you have a concrete rebuttal with thoughts on the subject?   not really.   That "your words reflect your level of thinking" is the bitter truth. You can either own your words and defend them or resort to looking down on others. Yes, my life must be miserable indeed.  Spending tax payer money, or any other person's money for that matter, on stadiums is a waste of time and benefits no one. That is your level of thinking. Own it, and do not be so cowardly!   You'd be shocked to death how many of these conversations i've had. People stand by this as if it was a question of life or death.   The sooner we as a people realize that football and a host of all other 'professional' sports serve as nothing but a sink in society, the better. They are a sink on our limited resources. It is:  - a waste of time;  - a waste of building material and resources;  - a waste of energy in the form of electricity, fuels and human energy  Not in the least is that it is a waste of psychic energy. In short, it is pointless exercise. A golden calf which we all dance around as if under a spell.  If you are going to down vote this comment, please provide me with a logical reason as to why you feel a game of football in some way adds anything of value to us as a society. Matter of fact, how does humanity profit from such endeavors? (and giving examples of equally worthless things that we do is not proof or endorsement, it is merely enumerating the many pointless things that we do as a society).  edit: spacing.   It just reflects your level of thinking really. I wonder what life was like before football and stadiums. Never mind human beings did just fine for thousands of years without it. How can you honestly sit there and insist that without a football stadium we can find nothing else to do with the space that is a downtown. How so very creative you must be...   This is just the type of thinking that advances our understanding of the world we live in. Stop it! Because  no, just No!   What on earth?! You just happened to have that video laying around?   That was genius!   We don't like tricksie wizardses!   ... yesterday an unmanned spacecraft flew by pluto. FTFY   By your logic, good behavior and bad behavior should face the same consequences. Politically correct much? It is akin to saying: You are limited in how much you can contribute to political campaigns and therefore you should be limited in how much you can contribute to a campaign that provides help to the less fortunate.  What part about the world needing to shift from oil eludes you?  edit (to add): and if 'hivemind' is a way for you to look down on people, consider that it is also hivemind that is against genocide, warcrimes, suffering of children, hunger and deprivation, yes. All of these are examples of 'hivemind'.    How is this refuting Aristotle's ideas? Can you be more specific as to which idea and why?      Lol.   How are these child support payments calculated. Does his child have requirements different from all other children? Or will I also have to pay that much for support?   I think bankruptcy declared you first. Hehehe   A wealthy spouse like that will likely enforce a prenuptial agreement. Nice try .. Hehehe      This is a very very apt depiction of what CU actually is. Actually, the one person doesn't have to own the speaker. He can loan it from his friends from far far away.... Enter Wisconsin.    Hahaha. That will be one rocky marriage though.   FYI this is about the citizens united ruling and nothing more. I do not wish to start a 'marriage' debate here.   Wow, Texas. Just wow!      It takes practice. Not to say that you should fake it. More like fake it until you make it. The more you allow yourself to express how you feel instead of bottling up your inner feelings because if appearance or convenience, the more the inner self fried and I'd able to express itself in genuineness.   This still exists. I know women still share breast milk where there is need. With much caution of course.   You bring up a very very valid point. It is interesting how these silly publishers are pricing themselves right out of the market. I can verify that over my years in graduate school, i have seen an increase in the percentage of graduate and undergraduate students purchasing books from India and China via internet or friends. That is a problem also.  But when you think about your concern, you are projecting the current status in isolation when you talk about taxes and repayment. Here is a simple analogy: Think of bearing the cost of free education (here we will just assume the cost stays artificially inflated) as hoisting a giant tower. You know, the old fashioned way with ropes and several people pushing and pulling ropes etc. The building we are trying to erect is free education, and the burden of the weight on the men represents the tax burden on the citizens.  Now add to this the idea that with each year, you will have strong and well built men added to the party pushing and pulling the weight. The effect is less workload on each one. And progressively, there is an exponential increase in the number of people bearing the weight and a corresponding decrease in workload for each one.  TL;DR: The current inflated cost of education is a problem that can't be ignored. The cost of funding free education will be reduced based on the fact that the latter causes an exponential increase in high income earners in society (ie. more people paying more taxes as a result of being highly educated).   Actually your first point, again, is the correct one. It could be as revolutionary as shrinking the high school curriculum and modifying the structure of university/college. By 18, you are already an adult and should have acquired the basic skills necessary to become a productive member of society. This was the premise decades ago with the high school system. Now, we have outgrown this model. The result is that young adults spend much of their time ruminating the halls of high school either partying or wasting away very precious time of development. What does one learn in the years before university and why does it take 18 years? Does my point make sense?   There are very many things in this world that never should have happened. But yet they did, and here we are.    No, that is not a bad thing. It is the general discussion of the matter that will bring out everything that needs to be considered to do it right. As you have pointed out, if we tilt the scales without providing the environment for and skills that will allow people to break into entrepreneurial endeavors, then we will have a catastrophe as you pointed out.  So your points and concerns are actually very well founded and important sir/madam.    No, that is not a bad thing. It is the general discussion of the matter that will bring out everything that needs to be considered to do it right. As you have pointed out, if we tilt the scales without providing the environment for and skills that will allow people to break into entrepreneurial endeavors, then we will have a catastrophe as you pointed out.  So your points and concerns are actually very well founded and important sir/madam.    Think about the advancement of society in general. The skills acquired in high school, perhaps many decades ago, was sufficient for the basic skills necessary to participate in society. The right question to ask is, is it the same today? Can you honestly say that the skills you gain in high school today, are as impactfull as they were several decades ago?   Why does making it free, translate to it becoming more expensive? It is not free, and it has skyrocketed.  There are many technologies available to make education more effective. Not the least of which are MOOCs, eLearning, and other similar avenues afforded by technology.   1. Up vote for contributing a differing opinion.  Here is one scenario, which I feel you haven't factored into the outcome of such an idea. You have stated that the number of people with a good education will increase, thereby leading to an increase in the number of applicants for a job. But you have not factored a corresponding increase in the number of available jobs. Why would the number of available jobs increase? Well, if you think about the fact that education doesn't just equip you to look for employment, it primarily equips you with skills, which can either translate to working as an employee, or developing a business. So you would expect an exponential growth in the number of available jobs based on the number of new businesses created because more people are equipped with the ability to do so.  This is just one factor. There are many many more.   That is an interesting system. Both an incentive to go and an incentive to complete your studies. I wonder why it was ended. Do you know? And can you share any links with information about the programs specifics as well as why it was ended? (If it isn't asking too much)  	37
    Don't waste your time with greedy fucks like Autodesk. There software is hard to use and you will get an error even when you do the most simplest thing. He'll need experience with programming. Modo sucks ass. Start with blender, have him learn cycles rendering. Then, he should move to maya. If he's looking for games, use unity or cry engine. Unreal lags like hell.   Basically I have this cgi cyborg suit looking thing, and I need Brooklynn(The dog's name) to wear it. So, I'm gonna mocap her on set, take her mocap data into maya, animate the suit with the mocap data, and then bring the shot of the doge into AE plus the rendered shot of the cyborg suit and composite it onto the dog.    Is there any other efficient way to do this? Any tips? Has anyone ever mocapped a quadruped before?  Pic related, Brooklynn: http://m.imgur.com/z0g5ooK   And where is a tutorial for the new mecanim system?   I added a float called speed, and added transitions using between the idle and walking animations.  Didn't work. Added a component script  using UnityEngine; using System.Collections;  public class zombieWalk : MonoBehaviour { protected Animator myAnimation;  void Start () {  myAnimation = GetComponent (); }  void Update () {  myAnimation.SetFloat ("speed", Input.GetAxis ("Vertical")); } }    That didn't work.    Help! My levels look great. I've baked renders to image textures so my levels look like pre rendered vfx. My ai can navigate through the most treachorous paths. But then there's animations! Nothing works. Please help, I'm pretty desperate as you can tell.             I simply don't want it to rotate 360 degrees around me.  I want it to walk towards me. I tried adding a rigid body, and freezing the x and z rotations. Doesn't work. Tried adding a character controller, didnt work.     Let's face it. Source 1 is a pain. Compiling mdl is horrendous. Half Life 2's normalmaps/bump maps are so shitty. What improvements will be in source 2?                 I've had enough. This has gone on forever. I will never be good enough. Plus my dad called me a dick and always yells. I find refuge in creating levels and unity 5. I bake textures in Blender cycles and then send it to unity so the graphics look like fucking Gravity. It's amazing. I thought my family would be proud. But no. My family said I spent too much time online, which I felt was a fucking erroneous assumption, since I only worked on the project for 30 minutes each day before going outside and trying to please everyone in track.     It's killing me. I can't go on much longer.     Please help. Newbie from CryEngine here.     if so, are there any examples?      Im trying to make a mod with the source sdk, and i need to know where the models and materials folders are for half life 2.   I dont have the username folder in steamapps, I guess thats part of the steampipe update. Anyway, I need to find the Half-Life 2 materials and models folder so the faceposer and model viewer can easily find and present my models with texture.         // Created by Crowbar 0.24.0.0 Compiling... qdir: "c:\users\admin\documents\source game assets\" gamedir: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\half-life 2\hl2\" g_path: "Cube.qc" Building binary model files...

 Yep. I'm definitely not insinuating that this was the greatest 3 year stretch in history haha, but it's still pretty I think, nonetheless.   ~~That's.... more difficult to find~~. FSU is at 92.86% for that stretch, some others:   **1954-56 Oklahoma went 31-0, 100%**   2003-05 USC went 35-2, 94.59%   1977-1979 Bama went 34-2 94.44%   1993-95 Nebraska went 36-1, 97.30%    And I'm sure I'm missing a handful of other notable ones    Monday: Chest/Biceps   4 sets of Incline Dumbbell Press, 8-10 reps   4 sets of Bench Press, 8-10 reps   3 sets of Incline Flies, 8-10 reps   4 sets of Chest Dips, 8-1 reps   5 sets of Barbell Curls, 8 reps      Tuesday: Legs/Traps   3 sets of Lunges 8-10 reps   3 sets of hamstring curls 8 reps   3 sets of Romanian deadlifts 8 reps   4 sets of Calf Raises   3 sets of shrugs 8 reps   ABS      Wednesday: Back   4 sets of Lat Pulldowns 8-10 reps   4 sets of Pendlay Rows 8-10 reps   4 sets of Chin ups 8-10 reps   4 sets of Dumbell Rows 8-10 reps   4 sets of Deadlifts 8-10 reps      Thursday: Shoulders/Triceps   3 sets of Military Press 8-10 reps   3 sets of Lateral Raises 8-10 reps   3 sets of front raises 8-10 reps   3 sets of Lying Rear Delt Raises 8-10 reps   5 sets of Pulldowns 8 reps      Saturday: Full Body   3 sets of Pendlay Rows 8-10 reps   4 sets of Benchpress 8-10 reps   3 sets of Deadlifts 8-10 reps   4 sets of Pull ups 8-10 reps   3 sets of power cleans 8 reps   ABS  Other info:   - been lifting for a couple months now and am looking to move into a more intermediate routine with higher volume.    - I've injured my knee before doing squats (and that was after a considerable amount of form work) and am deathly afraid of attempting them again, so leg work is going to have to come from other sources.   - I'm looking to work solely on aesthetics, and for some reason my arms just blow up in proportion to my core; so I think one iso exercise for bi's/tri's should be plenty, especially considering the amount of tertiary work they're getting in major lifts.   I just manually traced it back. You have to average 13 wins per season to get to 39, and there were very few 13 win seasons in history before the mid-90's (Bama in 92, and BYU in 84), so I went ahead and looked up the total team histories for the 40ish most successful schools in college football history, and nobody else ever strung together 39.       All games of at least 32 points:  Oladipo - 38 points   Oladipo - 35 points   Oladipo - 33 points   Michael Carter-Williams - 33 points   Oladipo - 32 points   Trey Burke - 32 points      I would like 1 Thibs please.   We're two months in, and hitting that point where lifting is starting to get addicting. The weights are increasing rapidly, we're getting our routine down into a groove. How are you guys sticking with it?   I'd go even higher - compare his career right now against Bird/Duncan/Kobe/Oscar, and he's got them beat.   I'd go so far as to say if he retired at the end of this season there's an argument for him being as high as third all time behind Kareem/Jordan. I'd say him and Magic are neck and neck; and where he stands next to Chamberlin/Russell depend on how you value championships in 9 team leagues and stats played in games with 50% more possessions.    | Minutes Played | games played | Seasons  ---|--------------|------------ |--------- Lebron | 34,891 | 886 |  12 Bird | 34,443 | 897 | 13 Magic | 33,245 | 906 | 13  *All regular season stats    Assuming Lebron plays at least 21 of the Cavs 28 remaining games he'll have passed them in career games as well. If you eliminate Birds injured 6-game season and Magic's post-retirement 32 game season, they'll all be tied at 12 as well.  It's wild to think that at this point in their careers, two all-time greats were already finished, and it feels like Lebron still has plenty of time left in his career.   Everyone knows promissory estoppel is not a thing, stop trying to make it a thing.   "Back" is the operative word there buddy. USC has lost between 4 and 6 games in 5 of their last 6 seasons; there's nothing  controversial about suggesting they haven't been elite as of late.   Prediction: FSU is about a 9-3 team next year, but we'll start the season ranked like 8th anyways. Because 4 of our 5 easiest games are in the first five weeks, we'll start out 4-0 and move up to like 5th or whatever and be massively overrated by the media. Then when we hit the meat of our schedule and drop 2 or 3 to GT, Clemson, Louisville, Miami, UF, or god forbid NC State; everyone will call this season a massive failure and a "collapse" and that we were frauds the whole time, and it's going to make my blood boil, because this team is set up perfectly for that narrative in the eyes of the college football world. None of my friends are going to listen to me when we're being listed as "outside playoff contenders" halfway through the season, and most of them are going to call for Jimbo to get fired or something completely ridiculous.   I will always be a florida state fan, and I'm still incredibly glad this program is as good as it is right now, but I'm really going to not enjoy dealing with college football next year.      No he's not. Bill Peterson has 62 to Jimbo's 58.   I think we still deserve to be ranked above Michigan State. Looking at the whole season together, we have a loss to the same team as Michigan State, but then they also have another loss - albeit to the #1 team in the country. We have three ranked wins, they have one.  All told, FSU is 3-1 against the top 25, Michigan State is 1-2. We have two more wins and one less loss (and a tougher overall SOS).  If our loss to Oregon weren't so fresh in everyone's minds this wouldn't so controversial.

[Part 1 Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2saki4/ranking_the_top_10_teams_of_the_decade_so_far/)      **#5 Auburn**  Overall record: 45-21 (68.2%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 1   Winning seasons: 4, 10-win seasons: 2, AP ranked finishes: 3, AP top-10 finishes: 2   Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 1, bowl wins: 2   Part of me still has no real clue where to rank this team, Auburn is truly a model of inconsistency. On the one hand you have a team with the 24th best overall record among FBS teams, only going 1-1 in major bowls, three unranked seasons, and an abysmal 3-9 year where the team was so awful they fired their head coach 2 years after he won a national championship. Yikes. On the other hand they actually won a national championship. They did so with a Heisman winning quarterback, going undefeated in the process. Thats huge. Throw in the fact that he was drafted #1 overall and you have what is basically the perfect possible season. The lone other season they finished ranked this decade they just barely lost the national championship. Three ranked seasons total, at #1 and #2 and #22. They join Oregon and Alabama as the only team to play in two national championships. Considering how hard national championships are to come by (much less, appearing in them) I cant with any good conscience put them lower than 5th. Two 8-5 years arent pretty, and 3-9 is just tragic, but theres only so much damage you can do to a crystal football.   **#4 Oregon**  Overall Record: 60-8 (88.23%), conference championships: 3, national championships: 0   Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 5, AP ranked finishes: 5, AP top-10 finishes: 5   Major bowl appearances: 4, major bowl wins: 3, bowl wins: 4   These poor guys. Overall best record in all of college football this decade, five straight seasons of top-10 finishes (four in the top 5), never less than 11 wins in a season, two national championship appearances and a Heisman winner to boot. They are unequivocally the best team from the PAC12 this decade and   probably no team in all of college football has been consistently as excellent as Oregon in this same timeframe. But the one number that matters more than anything is the only blemish they have: zero national championships. Listen, national championships are valuable, they are *the* end goal of every football team (sorry G5!) every year; the national champions are the teams that people remember, but they are not the only benchmark. Bo Schembechler never won a national championship, and Michigan fans still fellate his legacy 30 years later. When you do just about everything on earth for five straight years except win a national championship, you still have an era worth talking about. Its why I think there is actually a pretty large gap between Auburn and Oregon here, and why the gap between Oregon and the teams above it are incredibly small (these top four are really in a tier of their own).  Make no mistake, this decade still has all the makings of a mini-dynasty.   **#3 Ohio State** - Overall record: 55-11 (83.33%), conference championships: 1, national championships: 1   Winning seasons: 4, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 3   Major Bowl appearances: 3, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 2   Ohio State finished on what you could call a high note with that drubbing of Wisconsin, the sugar bowl win over Bama, and the belated-rose-bowl national championship win over Oregon. And yes, it hasnt felt this good to be a buckeye since 2002, but their ridiculous decade (so far) has gone pretty wildly up and down. Starting with a 12-1 season and a Sugar Bowl win, then the shitstorm of sanctions from the NCAA, suddenly losing their historically great coach, watching Luke Fickell coach the team for a year, having their prayer answered with Urban going back on the head coaching market, watching in turmoil as they go undefeated and are sanctioned out of the postseason, watching again as they go undefeated  only to have their dreams murdered by Michigan State, and finally ending with an overpowering third string quarterback leading them to a national championship. Truthfully, it was incredibly difficult to sort out teams 2-3-4; and especially between tOSU and the team directly above it, but Ohio State was looking at a losing season, impending sanctions, and Luke Fickell as head coach at one point 3 years ago, Ohio State fans cant be too sad about being here.   **#2 Florida State**  Overall record: 58-11 (84.1%), conference championships: 3, national championships: 1   Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 5, AP top-10 finishes: 3   Major bowl appearances: 3, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 4   Our lone ACC representative, this ranking fits neatly with the Jimbo Fisher era of Florida State Football (he took over as head coach in 2010) and has been one hell of a show. There was the 29 game winning streak, the 6th longest in FBS win streak of the last 100 years, the Heisman-winning walking-controversy of a quarterback, the 2013 which set all kinds of records for how lopsided their regular season wins were, then the 2014 season with probably more records for how hilariously unimpressive their regular season wins were (and how painfully they were humiliated in the playoffs). But when its all said and done, FSU never went worse than 9-4, and they have the 3rd best record in the FBS over this time frame, a Heisman winner, a national championship, consecutive seasons going into their bowl game at 13-0, three consecutive AP top-10 finishes, two Major bowl wins, and definitive ownership of the red-headed stepchild P5 conference.   I give Florida State the nod (trying to be impartial here) because they won three conference championships to OSUs one, their worst season was significantly less bad than OSUs (finishing 9-4, ranked v. a losing season at 6-7), Ohio State went through NCAA sanctions and have had three head coaches in these five years (both of which I think of as a sort of intangible negatives), Florida State has the Heisman winner, and Florida State has the better overall record. Again, if someone wanted to argue that OSU should be number 2 strictly because OSU had four great years to FSUs three, I would be totally fine with it. But I do think Florida State gets the edge.    **#1 Alabama** - Overall record: 58-9 (86.57%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 2,    winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 5, AP ranked finishes: 5, AP top-10 finishes: 5,   Major Bowl appearances: 4, Major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3   I guess Ill start by trying to poke holes in Alabamas otherworldly dominance of the college football scene: theyve now lost consecutive bowl games and are now tied with Missouri for two SEC championship game appearances in the last five years. On the upside, Alabama has been unequivocally the greatest college football team in the nation so far this decade. You could start and finish the discussion with two national championships and be done with it, or then think that if a field goal had 5 more yards on it they'd have been in a third, and then shown some fourth quarter heroics against tOSU they could be in four straight right now. Even going beyond that, it's the five straight top-10 finishes, and four straight top-7 finishes. Consistently having one of the best defenses in the nation. Consistently leading all teams in both recruit AND sending kids to the NFL. There's a lot more to gush about, but I'll keep it brief because there's not much I need to convince anyone of here. Alabama is heads and tails above the rest as the best team of the last half-decade.   This is really starting to get infuriating. All five underclassman that had any type of draft value left this year. We were going to return 14 starters and a really experienced D that could compensate for our inexperienced O, now we have neither.   Our ceiling might really be 9-3 next year.   Now that were halfway through, I decided to compile a ranking of the top-10 college football teams of the decade so far. The actual criteria is a totally subjective throw it all in a pot analysis, but the most important factors are obvious: championships are by far the most important criteria, overall record, conference championships, major bowl wins, and final AP rankings (Im using AP because theyre generally the consensus postseason ranking) are all very important too. So without further ado:   The Honorable Mentions  It was really hard to leave all of these teams off, and I wouldnt really disagree with someone arguing any one of these teams deserves to be at #10, but tough decisions have to be made. **Wisconsin** has three B1G championships to its name so far this decade, three 11-win seasons, three major bowl appearances, and two top-10 finishes; but three consecutive rose bowl losses (1-4 overall in bowls) just barely keeps them out. **Clemson** had four consecutive 10-win seasons, 2 AP top-10 finishes, went 1-1 in major bowl games, and a conference championship to boot, but it wasnt enough to overcome the losing season in 2010 that keeps them out. **Oklahoma State** had one crazy good year culminating in a major bowl win, and two other solid 10-win seasons, but it wasnt enough to overcome two mediocre unranked seasons that keep them out. **South Carolina** (poor Spurrier) had four consecutive ranked seasons, three in a row going 11-2 and finishing the season ranked in the top 10, and would most assuredly be on this list if they had hit 10 wins again this year; but they got SEC murdered with only one division title, no conference championships, and no major bowl invitations (RIP two-team-per-conference rule) these five years which keeps them out. **Boise State** went 11-2 or better four times, won their conference three times, finished in the top 10 twice, and finished with the 5th best record in the league through these last five years; but was really hurt by not playing in a major conference  with only one major bowl invite, and G5 conference titles being less impressive, they just barely dont make the cut.    Now onto the list.   **#10 TCU** - Overall record: 47-17 (73.4%), conference championships: 3, national championships: 0   Winning seasons: 4, 10-win seasons: 3, AP ranked finishes: 3, AP top-10 finishes: 2   Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3    TCU is definitely no higher than 10th, namely because two of their three great seasons were played with Mountain West Schedules, and then went 11-14 their first two seasons in the Big 12 which gives them one of the biggest negatives of any team on this list, with those taken into account and with only the 15th best record in the FBS these past years I was tempted to leave them off. I think they still deserve to be here though because their Rose bowl win over the Badgers in 2010 put them at #2 in the final rankings with a major bowl win and an elusive undefeated 13-0 season. This year their only loss came on the road by three points due to an epic comeback by top-10 ranked Baylor. By my count thats two years where TCU was seriously in the conversation for the best team in the nation, and I value higher highs with lower lows more than consistent averages (to some extent) which is why TCU gets the nod over all the other honorable mentions.   **#9 LSU**  Overall record: 52-14 (78.8%), conference championships: 1, national championships: 0   Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 2   Major bowl appearances: 1, major bowl wins: 0, bowl wins: 2    Another team that was probably severely hindered by the brutality of the SEC in the 2010s. LSU and Oklahoma bear remarkable similarity to each other, and it was difficult to separate the two, as LSU actually got to play for a national championship game, and had a one-game better record with a probably much more difficult 5-year strength of schedule. However LSU, despite still being great this decade, has a couple of shortcomings. They managed only one major bowl appearance in five years (the national championship, no less) and lost it, and only managed one SEC championship during this time span as well. LSU has been undeniably great these past five years, but the lack of hardware makes this about as high as they can go.    **#8 Oklahoma**  Overall record: 51-15 (77.3%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 0   Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 2   Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3    Cheer up Oklahoma fans, we get that youre hungry for national relevance again, but you could be doing a lot worse. Bob Stoops is still, in fact, one of the best coaches in college football, Oklahoma can still recruit, and your future will always be bright. Your worse two-year stretch with Bob Stoops is still better than your best two-year stretch before Bob Stoops since Barry Switzer retired. Youve won both your major bowl appearances so far this decade, are still tied for the most Big 12 championships this decade, and sport the 10th best record over that same span during your decline.    **#7 Michigan State**  Overall record: 53-14 (79.1%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 0   Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 2 (one more at 11)   Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 4    Mark Dantonio is a hell of a coach. Four 11 win seasons in five years is a huge feat, and going 2-0 in major bowl games isnt exactly easy either. Even with a blip 7-6 season in 2012 Michigan State is averaging 10.6 wins per year, and has the 8th best record in the FBS so far this decade (the 7 teams with better records include 5 teams ranked in front of them, Boise State, and Northern Illinois). Last year was a particularly high point for them, as the only 1-loss P-5 team in the nation, finishing the season ranked 3rd overall, and arguably the best defense in the nation. Even without Narduzzi, I expect Connor Cook to have a great senior year and Michigan state to continue racking up double-digit win seasons. This team looks like its going to keep up the recent tradition of being awesome, and I think well see, for the next half decade anyway, a holy trinity of the Spartans, Buckeyes, and Harbaughs punching it out for the B1G title.   **#6 Stanford**  Overall record: 54-13 (80.6%), conference championships: 2, national championships: 0   Winning seasons: 5, 10-win seasons: 4, AP ranked finishes: 4, AP top-10 finishes: 3 (one more at 11)   Major bowl appearances: 4, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3    Stanford just had its worst season so far this decade, but when your worst season is 8-5 with a bowl win, youre either Nebraska or youre feeling pretty good about yourself. Stanford started off hot under Harbaughs final year going 13-1 and finishing the season ranked 4th overall; then under Shaw they won two consecutive conference championships and three more major bowl berths. In fact, they and Alabama are the only two teams in the NCAA since 2010 to go to four consecutive major bowl games, and theyve done it while consistently fending off one of the teams ranked ahead of them. Their overall record since 2010 is good for 7th in the FBS (5th in the P5)   Part 2 coming later today.   No Jimbo Fisher :(   Yep, I mean Martez Ivey, Bryon Cowart, and Cece Jefferson alone are going to be *huge*. People making fun of UF are dumb.   I would argue Florida State is just as big of a wildcard. Jameis led the ACC in interceptions and then went 3td's, 0 interceptions against one of the best interception-forcing teams in the nation.    You guys have a handful of five-stars IIRC that haven't announced yet but are 95% sure of UF. I wouldn't worry about your ranking at the moment.   Yep, Florida State fan my whole life and those were my four years in college there :(   As a counterpoint to that: we didn't score a touchdown in the 2nd half of our last three games.   I mean, did you read the last sentence of my post?   Nope, FSU alum.   I think we're a year away from doing one of those if we ever did - they got crazy good crazy fast. We have a lot of potential, but it won't become kinetic as rapidly; I could see this core steadily improving ~5 wins a year to eventually winning 54-56 games in 5 years.   None taken, you're in a terrible place   time in NBA history to be "pretty good". Especially now that the Thunder are quickly climbing to grab that spot.   Motion denied.   I've also heard it used in the context of voters getting tired of voting for one person multiple times, e.g. why Karl Malone won the MVP over Michael Jordan in 97.   As of right now we are 9th in the east - one game behind Brooklyn and tied with Boston. I feel like Boston, Indiana and Charlotte all look comparable at best with the Magic; I don't see any of those teams passing us as an inevitability. This will be especially true if Boston decides to trade Rondo.   The Knicks have Melo, and could always go on a random run, but right now they are 5 games behind is so I feel comfortable with our lead.  The Magic have played the most road games of any team in the league - once we start getting into long stretches of home games, and once we get Vuc and Aaron Gordon back, I suspect we'll be able to have a couple mini-runs. Beyond that, because all of our players are so young (Harris is 22, Vuc 24, Payton 20, Dipo 22, Gordon 19) we're behind in the chemistry   development curve, and have more room to improve within the season than most of the rest of the league.  All we need now is for the Brooklyn fire sale of players to go through and have them drop out, and I think we can be the team to replace them.  I'm irrationally excited for this Magic team.   They definitely both look like teams that could be very good for a long time. I think the ultimate litmus test is seeing how they handle down periods - again for teams like Michigan you know they're going to get back to 10-11 win seasons at some point, but if Art retires and they hire a coach who goes 6-6 three years in a row, will we really think there's an inevitable return to greatness waiting down the road for Baylor? Right now I'd say absolutely not, but there's definitely potential to change that.   Probably voter fatigue - but to be fair, it's not easy to tab a "best" player in such a statistically reductive position as kicker; and he did lose to a player with a better %fgm on the year.   See my last sentence. Obviously I want to win, but I needed an inflammatory title to offset six paragraphs of questionable pontificating.   Totally agree. And I think this is a point I could have elaborated on, but my post was already getting long enough. Success -- bigger/enduring fanbases -- better booster donations/team revenue -- better coaches   facilities -- more success. Rinse and repeat. It's a self perpetuating cycle, and I think Oregon (unlike Virginia Tech or Kansas State) has the ability to kickstart this cycle with Phil KNight's money.   In college football, as in most sports, there are certain teams that are perennial titans. The greatest football programs largely comprise an "old guard" of Notre Dame, Ohio State, Michigan, Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, USC, and Nebraska (and some other schools to a lesser extent, like Tennessee/LSU). It seems like every year since world war II ended you can find four or five of these teams in the top-10 of any given AP poll. They are the programs with the most money, the best facilities, the largest fanbases who travel incredibly well, they get the best recruits and in turn produce the most all-Americans, and most importantly - they mop up the best coaches. Whenever a coach becomes too successful they often get hired away to other programs, making most programs a "stepping stone" to these schools.   There are exceptions of course, Frank Beamer at Virginia Tech, and Bill Snyder and Kansas State are two obvious examples of schools enjoying sustained success under legendary coaches, but even then (and now) these schools are failing to draw continuous top recruiting classes and build state of the art facilities. I'm not sure if this is controversial - but I don't see either of these schools continuing to be powerhouses once these coaches retire. Most teams will enjoy national success temporarily, but only this aforementioned group of schools can enjoy it across decades and continue to realistically expect it indefinitely.  Dating back the last couple decades, there have really only been two schools to break into this elite tier of sustained success as a top football program: Florida and Florida State (maybe 3, depending on how you feel about Miami's future). Obviously neither school has much of a history preceding the 80's (FSU is actually ranked 77th all-time in games played), but both I believe now have all the factors in place to be nationally relevant for the forseeable future. Speaking as a Florida State fan - I take immense pride in being a part of a "newcomer" program that has broken the ranks; but I think more importantly Florida State fans have an extremely fragile psychology about their team. As recently as 2011 there were fans questioning - what if we really were a one-coach wonder? What if our run is over and we're destined to become just another program? A team like Michigan may be suffering now, but it's with the understanding that they'll return to being an elite team again, the systematic inertia of their program calls them to be elite, and I don't think anybody really questions that it's only a matter of time.  All this to say, I love the idea of breaking this "old guard". It's nothing personal (and with no offense to these teams individually) but I love the idea of fresh blood declaring *this isn't your grandpa's college football landscape*. Emerging teams are fun and exciting and keep the sport fresh. Saban's Alabama v. Meyer's Ohio State should be an exhilarating game and I'll enjoy the hell out of watching it, but this game is just a drop in the bucket in the context of these two program's histories.    I want to see Oregon become one of these programs, because I think they can actually do it. They have the resources, they have the proximity to top recruits, and they've spent the last five years cultivating a draw as the sexy new football team in America. The fanbase will come with time, and the coaching will become self-perpetuating (hell, FSU is only one coach removed from being a school with a history similar to Nevada, Bowling Green, or WSU's). Oregon is already on track with six consecutive top-11 appearances in the AP final poll (and three in the top 5)  - but first thing's first, they really need to win a national championship or two to establish their arrival.  That's why, if Oregon beats us, I want them to go on to win the national championship.   Um what? Nobody considered beating UF at home some gargantuan accomplishment. Noles fans were excited to beat their biggest rival to cap off an undefeated season. You've got some vitriol issues I think.   Also, we're fun to watch :(   How am I being defensive? I love watching rivals suffer, as should any other fan in all of college football.   Our offensive line, running backs, and offense as a whole are much better than they were in 2012.   I'm not sure having all five conference champions actually worthy of a playoff spot is a great idea. If an 8-4 team upsets an 11-1 team in the conference championship, do you think the 9-4 conference champion is really the more deserving team to be in the playoffs? It also seems like it would encourage schools to schedule 4 OOC creampuffs to make the conference games easier to deal with, since making it to the conference championship game becomes infinitely more important. I'm happy that the committee places a huge emphasis on winning your conference, but I'm not sure making the champion an auto-qualifier is going to be a more fair way to determine who goes.      How so?  Edit: I did mistype 2011 for 2001 originally, apologies.   - three coaches in the playoffs - Jimbo, Meyer, and Saban - have won 6 of the last 8 national championships. Oregon played in a 7th with Helfrich as OC.  - if Washington's Chris Peterson loses his bowl game, the winner of Oregon/FSU will have the coach with the highest career win % of the entire FBS  -  Florida State was ranked in the AP top-10 six consecutive times leading into it's first national championship season in 1993. Oregon has done it 6 times in a row now leading up to this year.  - in fact, none of these 4 teams has been ranked in a final AP lower than 12th since 2011.   It is a hard metric in the sense that it's objective and not subject to opinion. Also I said it keeps them "in check", not that it is the end-all-be-all. I do agree with your last point, for sure.   I want to see FSU get moved to #5 next week, dominate a major bowl, and be crowned the AP national champs resulting in a split championship, literally ruining the very purpose the playoffs exist its very first year.   I think, honestly, us being guaranteed to be in the playoffs is a reality that we all *want* to believe is true, because the alternative seems so absurd on its face. Lord knows I do. But the committee has given absolutely no indication that being undefeated, even being the defending national champions, is dispositive of any guarantees. They've shown that occasionally looking dominant is more important than simple win-loss record, and if Baylor looks incredibly dominant against Kansas State - something FSU may fail to do in all 13 games this season - it seems consistent with their logic that FSU very well could be left out.   I do think we're better than TCU and Baylor. Just because you say we aren't doesn't mean we aren't. We actually have a hard metric to keep random opinions based on amorphous criteria and unreliable impressions in check, it's called a win-loss record.   Yeah, and a week ago everyone said #3 was our floor.   I like how you didn't use the final AP poll, because Florida State is in it.   Ooh, didn't realize that. Thanks.      TCU doesn't have more wins over teams .500 and above though...    But who knows how good McNeese State was at that point?? Prior years don't matter remember.   I appreciated this and I'm sad you're getting downvoted.   I like it. We know which fans actually have their priorities straight. If Georgia, a team that we've been cool with in the past, is rooting for Georgia Tech to beat us, we know they're not very good Georgia fans and can disregard their opinions accordingly.   err sorry, I meant to say finish the regular season undefeated.   It's funny, because Tom Osborne won 25 in a row, and his '93 Huskers were the last P5 team to go 12-0 and still be ranked #2 in the AP poll... behind 11-1 Florida State.   Bud Wilkinson, Oklahoma, twice (47 1953-1957, 31 1948-1950)   Pete Carroll, USC (34 2003-2005)   Darrell Royal, Texas (30 1968-1970)   Dennis Erickson, Miami (29 1990-1993)   Gene Stallings, Alabama (28 1991-1993)   Bear Bryant, Alabama (28 1978-1980)   Barry Switzer, Oklahoma (28 1973-1975)   Clarence Munn, Michigan State (28 1950-1953)   Jimbo Fisher, Florida State (28 2012-Active)    note: includes only FBS teams.   pls   I hope you feel the tag in your shirt tomorrow.  All.  Day.  Long.   I hope your cereal is fresh but when you get to the fridge you're out of milk.   I hope he does miserably bad.   I mean, they're obviously not remotely the same caliber, but they're both teams that rely heavily on cut blocking and misdirection in their rushing plays, no? Those are both relatively unusual tactics that defenses don't normally face and thus one of the bigger advantages triple option teams have.   Florida state for a couple reasons  - FSU has had 7 opponents coming off of a bye week or an FCS opponent this year. Georgia Tech just finished an exhausting win over their biggest rival. I think GT's ability to "bring it" will be less than the average school FSU faces and less than Georgia Tech has in weeks past.  - Georgia Tech's pass defense isn't very good. I think Jameis looked awful this week, and he hasn't gone crazy against teams with really good passing D, but against Georgia Tech I expect him to get back to his usual elite self, and with FSU's new-and-improved offensive line, I think they're going to rack up a ton of points.  - Florida State has already played a triple option team this year (Citadel), so Georgia tech won't have as much an element of surprise because this defense has already had practice and game time devoted to stopping the triple option.   Yeah, I mean looking at Pellini's tenure, Nebraska has probably been the 16th-17th most successful team in the NCAA for W-L, but no conference championships in 7 years, and not a single top-13 final ranking. I'm actually in the minority hear thinking Nebraska can probably do better.   1. That's not true, you've had 12 since Solich took over  2. To be fair, Osborne didn't have ANY seasons with less than 3 losses in his career starting in 1973. So it doesn't really disprove the people saying "you can't expect a Tom Osborne all the time!" wrong.  3. With that said, I do kindof agree with you. I think they're looking for - at worst - a Lloyd Carr/Bob Stoops level coach; one that can at least maintain their all-time-great status.    Et tu, AP?   Yep, and then I would probably put Miles, Helfrich, Shaw, Stoops, Dantonio, and Spurrier in a class below that.   For starters, that poll above is a bit ridiculous. You guys, I imagine will be 12th or 11th, and Clemson will be 19th or 20th. The committee has shown that losing to teams ranked at the very top does not hurt you nearly as much as your average poll does, so I think no matter what you'll be in front of Clemson and Louisville.   But if you guys kick Wisconsin's ass with your backup... I think it gets hard again.   Auburn, you got inside Alabama's 10 six times this game without a touchdown, and it broke my heart.    I'm sick of getting every teams best fucking effort  tell me about it   Well spoken. Analogies to prior year teams as a dismissive or supportive argument for Florida State are ridiculous.   We are a wholly unique entity in college football history. A Heisman winning quarterback that could drag us to victory against an elite team, or throw three consecutive interceptions in his own territory; an offensive line that could get manhandled or provide holes a freighter truck can fit through; WR's that could drop passes/run terrible routes leading to INT's, or burn an elite CB for a 50 yard TD bomb. Nobody knows what we are. I've followed this team obsessively and I have no clue what they are. It's miraculous that Jimbo has managed to bring it all together for 12 games without a loss, and we deserve credit for that; but absolutely nothing surprises me about this team week to week.   You're kidding.... right?   Auburn also got trounced in a regular season game.   I'm okay with that.   With two losses to unranked teams? I'm not really sure about that. It would depend on how much value the committee puts into conference championships.   PREPARE TO GET MURDERED ^BY ^^THREE ^^^POINTS   Next year it'll be 2 or 3 teams huddled together in the corner pretending the rest of the conference doesn't exist.   That doesn't make any sense.   With MSU dropping, all it would take is a Baylor loss to KSU and a JT Barret-less OSU loss to Wisconsin and we're in no matter what.   SEC West is like the Roman empire in 284 A.D., the whole thing used to be great, but now they're lopping off the half they don't want and refusing to associate with it.   Congrats to Georgia Tech. No matter what happens next Saturday they're going to the Orange bowl!   FSU grad here what does splenetic mean?   r u mad?   No way man, we're like 2-0 this year when up at the half.   this is what we like to call "getting comfortable"   Still haven't gone to bed :/   For instance, Georgia Tech should be rooting for us, because if we both win this weekend they're guaranteed a trip to the Orange bowl.    UGA fans should be rooting for us because we both like to watch UF suffer.  Oregon fans should probably be rooting for us because they'll probably want to play us in the rose bowl over TCU/OSU/Baylor/Miss. St.   He's also wrong. Florida has a winning record, and will at worst go 6-5.   They've taken 20 more shots than we have... argh.   They're outrebounding us 27-12 as of right now :(   I don't know where all these downvotes are coming from? Oladipo is our shooting guard of the future through-and-through. We traded up to get Elf for a reason... because we needed a point guard. Dipo is great at playing off the ball and will absolutely not be a long term primary ball handler.   Alternative chaos:  Oregon beats Arizona/Bama wins SEC/TCU wins out locking in 3 playoff spots.   Miss St. loses the egg bowl    Georgia Tech beats Georgia   FSU loses to UF.    FSU looks done, but wait!   Baylor loses to Kansas State   Ohio State loses to Wisconsin   FSU beats now #12 ranked Georgia Tech.  With Ohio State losing, Miss. State finishing the season 10-2, UCLA now at 9-3, arizona getting a 3rd loss to be at 10-3, Georgia at 9-3, Mizzou at 10-3 and Baylor 10-2 with a weaker SOS, the committee has no other team to turn to, and is forced to put 12-1 Florida State back in the playoff despite their loss to UF.  Everyone loses.   If Arizona beats Oregon twice in one season do they deserve to definitively be ranked in front of Oregon?   Yeah. The Seminole Tribe was the only native American tribe to successfully resist relocation and/or some form of surrender to the U.S. government.   I want Baylor. But I'd also take TCU/Ohio State.  Honestly, an Alabama/Oregon matchup has been blueballing the nation for half a decade now and I just want to see it go down finally.   Same. And to be honest, looking Alabama's performance in away games, I think we'd stand more than a puncher's chance on a neutral field.   In exchange for your support, we'll also beat Georgia Tech.     ... Yep, really doin' you guys a favor here   Oooh, I missed the "by win percentages overall" part, sorry.   I wouldn't call Michigan a top-5 program.  Oklahoma, USC, Alabama, Nebraska, Notre Dame, and Ohio State are all probably in front of them, and probably Texas too.   We've actually won 39 of our last 41!   12 for Vucevic   4 for Harris   1 for Channing Frye   *This does however include two ties with opposing teams, however the last 13 games have been outright   I actually think UF/FSU is a bigger rival for both teams than UGA/Miami  	107
 That's not how I describe "coalition". The altruistic behavior of bacteria has a payoff for the whole colony, *not* the members of the coalition as opposed to others in the colony. In my mind the word "coalition" implies an alliance with **some** other members of a population to gain a benefit to the exclusion, or even the detriment, of members of the population not included in the coalition. That's politics. Simple altruistic behavior is not 'politics'.    I've read items about that. I understand there is still discussion on what will be included in the payload.                  I think the author is referring to matters like the formation of coalitions and the presence of dominance hierarchies. Bacteria, for instance, can act 'altruistically', but they don't form coalitions.                   It may indeed split, but I wouldn't say that for sure. At least from the votes in the Parliament the left factions (Syriza is a coalition made up of more than 17 groups - it's even more of a dog's dinner than Podemos) are in a minority. If there are to be expulsions it is they who will go. Right now I don't think any but a small minority in that Party want a split. It would basically mean giving up power. What **is** sure is that there will be some heavy duty faction fighting in months to come. Given the newness of the Party I don't think that the ruling faction (right wing) has the control of party machinery that usually guarantees a right wing victory in social democratic infighting. But I might be wrong. We'll see.      They have already 'rebelled', at least to a certain degree. It's uncertain just how far their rebellion will go.                                       Well, that answers my question about whether it can be grown indoors.               Como en muchas ocasiones en el pasado Espaa hoy tiene posiblemente el ms grande movimiento anarquista en el mundo. Ciertamente es la major organizada. Anarchists de todo el mundo ven a los sindicatos anarcosindicalistas (CGT, CNT, Solidaridad Obrera, CAS) como modelos e inspiraciones. Se destacan como ejemplos de cmo los ideales anarquistas pueden hacerse relevante para la gente comn.  Los ideales del anarquismo, sin embargo, no se limitan al mundo del trabajo. Por todas partes en Espaa los anarquistas estn implicados en un vasto campo de actividad. Asambleas comunitarias, Ecologa, Solidaridad, contra la represin, feminismo, anti-desalojo, iniciativas de gnero, de defensa de inmigrantes, editoriales, Archivos y mucho ms. La diferencia es que las iniciativas de la comunidad, a diferencia del trabajo syndical, son localizados y no coordinados.  Este problema de desorganizacin se hizo muy claro a los anarquistas espaoles por los resultados, o falta de ella, del movimiento 'Indignados'. Este movimiento espaol era anterior al movimiento 'Occupy' de 2011, y era ms popular, tena una mayor comprensin y dejado un legado mucho ms duradero que Occupy hizo.Los objetivos de los Indignados eran muchsimo objetivos anarquistas. Los mtodos de la gente en su mayora jvenes eligieron eran an ms. Hubiera sido una "oportunidad de oro" para los anarquistas de Espaa.  Eso no sucedi. Anarquistas duda participaron en los Indignados. En muchos casos eran la fuerza dominante. Hubo, sin embargo, no hay coordinacin, hay un plan en cuanto a qu hacer cuando el romance de las manifestaciones se disip. Protestar es fcil. Construir es difcil. Haba un vaco en trminos de formas prcticas hacia adelante. El vaco fue llenado por los socialdemcratas de Podemos. El resultado final de la socialdemocracia se est demostrando hoy en Grecia, y no hay razn para imaginar que Podemos seguir un camino diferente.  Los anarquistas de Espaa no son nada si no es prctico. A travs de su historia de su talento para la organizacin podra convertirse prusianos verde de envidia. En que pais el anarquismo vive en el mundo real y no en los sueos ideolgicos.  Mucha discusin y el debate que ha ocurrido en Espaa en los ltimos aos. Muchos anarquistas han llegado a ver la necesidad de organizacin y coordinacin fuera de los sindicatos, para presentar una alternativa viable a la democracia social. En las zonas de habla cataln [Embat](http://embat.info) ha estado organizando durante unos dos aos. En Castilla y otras regiones [Apojo Mutuo](https://apojomutuo.wordpress.com) tambin ha iniciado el proceso. La ltima iniciativa es la de [Aunar](http://aunar.org) en Aragn.  La siguiente es la "Declaracin de Intenciones" de esta nueva iniciativa en la organizacin anarquista espaol.  @@@@@  **Declaracin de intenciones**  Segunda asamblea abierta:  Viernes 17 de julio a las 18:00 en el CSO Kike Mur (Torrero).  Esta iniciativa la promovemos un conjunto de militantes y activistas de los distintos movimientos sociales y sindicales de Aragn. Somos personas que participamos a ttulo individual en anarcosindicatos, organizaciones estudiantiles o centros sociales as como en otros colectivos y asambleas de base tanto barriales como sectoriales.   Entendemos que el 15M supuso un punto inflexin en la forma de comprender la poltica y vivimos con entusiasmo cmo en las distintas plazas de nuestras ciudades y pueblos se crearon espacios de encuentro y debate poltico que hasta entonces no se daban. Sin embargo vemos cmo la evolucin del discurso del no nos representan ha desembocado en un giro electoralista de estos movimientos sociales, consecuencia de no haber sido capaces de articular un discurso por fuera de las instituciones, al hablar solamente de objetivos tan abstractos como el fin del capitalismo o la abolicin del Estado cuando hay que ser conscientes de que no es eso lo que ahora mismo est en juego, sino que nos encontramos en un proceso de acumulacin de fuerzas y de atender a nuestras necesidades ms inmediatas. Es por ello que han sido las organizaciones electoralistas las que han asumido ese papel, convirtindose en una opcin atractiva en el corto plazo para una parte importante de la poblacin cansada de ver cmo sus condiciones materiales de vida empeoran.   Analizamos que el Estado no es una herramienta neutra al servicio de quien quiera utilizarla sino que tiene unas funciones concretas, bien definidas, de mantener el statu quo a travs del monopolio de la fuerza. Con un capitalismo cada vez ms global, sus instituciones no dejan de ser herramientas de gestin de la miseria al servicio de los poderes econmicos y financieros, de carcter supraestatal: somos conscientes de que el neoliberalismo no va a acabar con un Real Decreto.   Ante esta situacin vemos la necesidad de establecer una lnea estratgica comn, a largo plazo, que implique definir unos objetivos tcticos, as como unas lneas de actuacin y, en base a unos anlisis, generar discurso en temas que nos afectan de forma cotidiana y en los que normalmente, como movimiento, no nos posicionamos, el cual se traduzca en un programa libertario. Para llevarlo a cabo consideramos imprescindible la creacin de una organizacin, que lejos de querer reemplazar a los movimientos sociales y anarcosindicatos, complemente, refuerce y enriquezca el trabajo que estos realizan.    Histricamente, ninguna revolucin social ha sido posible sin una accin colectiva fuerte y autnoma de masas y es por ello que esta organizacin servira para fortalecer y desarrollar este tipo de movimientos mediante la coordinacin de quienes, teniendo prcticas libertarias, actualmente participan en ellos en nuestro contexto territorial. Esto nos hace ms fuertes a la hora de intervenir socialmente y de combatir las violencias estructurales que se ejercen sobre las personas y los cuerpos, con unidad poltica en la organizacin aunque no necesariamente plena unidad ideolgica.   Para ello, hemos pensado en tener una estructura basada en los diferentes frentes de lucha en los que participamos y trabajar material terico especfico de cada frente a partir del cual generar ese discurso gracias al debate colectivo, sin perdernos en la teora, para ser capaces de establecer un dilogo entre la intervencin social y la reflexin.    Del mismo modo, hacer hincapi en el compromiso y en la responsabilidad militante, acabando con la preponderancia de las libertades individuales por encima de las colectivas dentro del anarquismo para alcanzar el equilibrio entre ambas, porque creemos que es la nica forma de enfocar los esfuerzos colectivos hacia objetivos comunes. Adems, observamos cmo muchas veces invertimos esfuerzos a corto plazo en nuestros espacios que al no responder a una estrategia predefinida se pierden y no sirven como escaln hacia unos objetivos a medio y largo plazo, lo que provoca sensacin de estancamiento entre la militancia al no ser capaces de cuantificar la evolucin del movimiento. Debemos avanzar hacia un cambio en la cultura militante.   Tambin vemos la necesidad de resignificar o clarificar trminos del anarquismo clsico como propaganda por el hecho o accin directa que son normalmente incomprendidos o intencionadamente tergiversados, as como romper con las estticas socialmente impuestas al anarquismo para as salir de nuestros espacios de resistencia y de la subcultura para pasar a la ofensiva poltica.   En resumen, queremos construir de forma colectiva una alternativa real, territorial, fuerte, organizada y por fuera de las instituciones para convertirnos en protagonistas de nuestras propias vidas en la esfera poltica, econmica y social.  Zaragoza, junio de 2015.  Contacto provisional: aunar.info@gmail.com  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  As at many times in the past Spain has possibly the largest anarchist movement in the world. It certainly is the best organized. Anarchists from across the world look to the anarchosyndicalist unions (CGT, CNT, Solidaridad Obrera, CAS) as models and inspirations. They stand as examples of how anarchist ideals can be made relevant to ordinary people.  The ideals of anarchism, however, are not confined to the world of work. Everywhere in Spain anarchists are involved in a vast field of activity. Community assemblies, ecology, solidarity, anti-repression, feminism, anti-eviction, gender initiatives, immigrant defence, publishing, archives and so much more. The difference is that the community initiatives, unlike the union work, are localized and not coordinated.    This problem of disorganization was made abundantly clear to Spanish anarchists by the results, or lack thereof, of the 'Indignados' movement. This Spanish movement predated the 'Occupy' movement of 2011, and it was more popular, had a greater understanding and left a much more enduring legacy than Occupy did. The goals of the Indignados were very much anarchist goals. The methods the mostly young people chose were even more so. It would have been a 'golden opportunity' for Spain's anarchists.  It didn't happen. Anarchists certainly participated in the Indignados. In many cases they were the dominant force. There was, however, no coordination, no plan as to what to do when the romance of the demonstrations wore off. Protesting is easy. Building is difficult. There was a vacuum in terms of practical ways forward. The vacuum was filled by the social democrats of Podemos. The end result of social democracy is being demonstrated today in Greece, and there is no reason to imagine that Podemos will follow a different path.  The anarchists of Spain are nothing if not practical. Through their history their talent for organization might turn Prussians green with envy. In that country anarchism lives in the real world and not in ideological dreams. Much discussion and debate has happened in Spain in the last few years. Many anarchists have come to see the need for organization and coordination outside of the unions, to present a viable alternative to social democracy. In the Catalan speaking areas[Embat](http://embat.info) has been organizing for about two years. In Castille and other regions [Apojo Mutuo](https://apojomutuo.wordpress.com) has also begun the process. The latest initiative is that of [Aunar](http://aunar.org) in Aragon.   The following is the 'Statement of Intentions' of this new initiative in Spanish anarchist organization.  @@@@@  **Statement of Intentions**  Second open meeting:  Friday, July 17 at 18:00 in the CSO Kike Mur (Torrero).  This initiative promote a set of militants and activists from different social and trade union movements of Aragon. We are people who participate as individuals in anarcosindicatos, student organizations and social centers as well as other groups and neighborhood assemblies so as sectoral basis.   15M understand that was a turning point in the way of understanding politics and are enthusiastically how the different spaces in our cities and towns meeting spaces and political debate until then refused to give were created. However we see the evolution of speech "does not represent us" has led to an electoral rotation of these social movements, a result of not being able to articulate a speech by outside institutions, to speak only as abstract goals like end of capitalism or the abolition of the state when you have to be aware that it is not what it is now at stake, but we are in a process of accumulation of forces and meet our immediate needs. Which is why we have been the electoral organizations that have taken on this role, becoming an attractive option in the short term for a significant part of the population tired of seeing their material living conditions worsen.   We analyze the state is not a neutral tool for anyone who wants to use it has a well-defined, to maintain the status quo through the monopoly of force specific functions. With an increasingly global capitalism, its institutions cease to be management tools misery in the service of economic and financial powers of supranational character: we are aware that neoliberalism is not going to end up with a Royal Decree.   In this situation we see the need to establish a common strategic direction, long-term, involving define tactical objectives and lines of action and, based on some tests, generate discourse on issues that affect us on a daily basis and which usually, as a movement, we not position ourselves, which translates into a libertarian program. To carry out essential consider creating an organization that far from wanting to replace social movements and anarcosindicatos, complement, reinforce and enrich the work they perform.   Historically, no social revolution has been possible without a strong and autonomous collective mass action and that is why this organization would strengthen and develop this kind of movement by coordinating those taking libertarian practices, currently participating in them in our context territorial. This makes us stronger when it comes to socially intervene and address the structural violence exerted on individuals and bodies, with political unity in the organization but not necessarily full ideological unity.   To do this, we thought of having a structure based on the different fronts of struggle in which we participate and work specific theoretical material in front from which to generate the speech by the collective discussion, without getting lost in theory, to be able to establish a dialogue between social intervention and reflection.   Similarly, emphasizing the militant commitment and responsibility, ending the dominance of individual liberties over collective within anarchism -to achieve a balance between both-because we believe that is the only way of approaching collective efforts towards common goals. Moreover, we note how often invest short-term efforts in our spaces that by not responding to a predefined strategy are lost and do not serve as a step towards objectives in the medium and long term, resulting sense of stagnation among the members not being able to quantify the evolution of the movement. We must move towards a change in the militant culture.   We also see the need to give new meaning or clarify terms of classical anarchism as "propaganda by deed" or "direct action" that are typically misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented and break the socially imposed aesthetic anarchism to come out of our areas of strength and the subculture to go on the political offensive.   In short, we collectively build a real, land, strong, organized and out of institutions to become the protagonists of our own lives in the political, economic and social spheres alternative.

Los mtodos de la gente en su mayora jvenes eligieron eran an ms. Hubiera sido una "oportunidad de oro" para los anarquistas de Espaa.  Eso no sucedi. Anarquistas duda participaron en los Indignados. En muchos casos eran la fuerza dominante. Hubo, sin embargo, no hay coordinacin, hay un plan en cuanto a qu hacer cuando el romance de las manifestaciones se disip. Protestar es fcil. Construir es difcil. Haba un vaco en trminos de formas prcticas hacia adelante. El vaco fue llenado por los socialdemcratas de Podemos. El resultado final de la socialdemocracia se est demostrando hoy en Grecia, y no hay razn para imaginar que Podemos seguir un camino diferente.  Los anarquistas de Espaa no son nada si no es prctico. A travs de su historia de su talento para la organizacin podra convertirse prusianos verde de envidia. En que pais el anarquismo vive en el mundo real y no en los sueos ideolgicos.  Mucha discusin y el debate que ha ocurrido en Espaa en los ltimos aos. Muchos anarquistas han llegado a ver la necesidad de organizacin y coordinacin fuera de los sindicatos, para presentar una alternativa viable a la democracia social. En las zonas de habla cataln [Embat](http://embat.info) ha estado organizando durante unos dos aos. En Castilla y otras regiones [Apojo Mutuo](https://apojomutuo.wordpress.com) tambin ha iniciado el proceso. La ltima iniciativa es la de [Aunar](http://aunar.org) en Aragn.  La siguiente es la "Declaracin de Intenciones" de esta nueva iniciativa en la organizacin anarquista espaol.  @@@@@  **Declaracin de intenciones**  Segunda asamblea abierta:  Viernes 17 de julio a las 18:00 en el CSO Kike Mur (Torrero).  Esta iniciativa la promovemos un conjunto de militantes y activistas de los distintos movimientos sociales y sindicales de Aragn. Somos personas que participamos a ttulo individual en anarcosindicatos, organizaciones estudiantiles o centros sociales as como en otros colectivos y asambleas de base tanto barriales como sectoriales.   Entendemos que el 15M supuso un punto inflexin en la forma de comprender la poltica y vivimos con entusiasmo cmo en las distintas plazas de nuestras ciudades y pueblos se crearon espacios de encuentro y debate poltico que hasta entonces no se daban. Sin embargo vemos cmo la evolucin del discurso del no nos representan ha desembocado en un giro electoralista de estos movimientos sociales, consecuencia de no haber sido capaces de articular un discurso por fuera de las instituciones, al hablar solamente de objetivos tan abstractos como el fin del capitalismo o la abolicin del Estado cuando hay que ser conscientes de que no es eso lo que ahora mismo est en juego, sino que nos encontramos en un proceso de acumulacin de fuerzas y de atender a nuestras necesidades ms inmediatas. Es por ello que han sido las organizaciones electoralistas las que han asumido ese papel, convirtindose en una opcin atractiva en el corto plazo para una parte importante de la poblacin cansada de ver cmo sus condiciones materiales de vida empeoran.   Analizamos que el Estado no es una herramienta neutra al servicio de quien quiera utilizarla sino que tiene unas funciones concretas, bien definidas, de mantener el statu quo a travs del monopolio de la fuerza. Con un capitalismo cada vez ms global, sus instituciones no dejan de ser herramientas de gestin de la miseria al servicio de los poderes econmicos y financieros, de carcter supraestatal: somos conscientes de que el neoliberalismo no va a acabar con un Real Decreto.   Ante esta situacin vemos la necesidad de establecer una lnea estratgica comn, a largo plazo, que implique definir unos objetivos tcticos, as como unas lneas de actuacin y, en base a unos anlisis, generar discurso en temas que nos afectan de forma cotidiana y en los que normalmente, como movimiento, no nos posicionamos, el cual se traduzca en un programa libertario. Para llevarlo a cabo consideramos imprescindible la creacin de una organizacin, que lejos de querer reemplazar a los movimientos sociales y anarcosindicatos, complemente, refuerce y enriquezca el trabajo que estos realizan.    Histricamente, ninguna revolucin social ha sido posible sin una accin colectiva fuerte y autnoma de masas y es por ello que esta organizacin servira para fortalecer y desarrollar este tipo de movimientos mediante la coordinacin de quienes, teniendo prcticas libertarias, actualmente participan en ellos en nuestro contexto territorial. Esto nos hace ms fuertes a la hora de intervenir socialmente y de combatir las violencias estructurales que se ejercen sobre las personas y los cuerpos, con unidad poltica en la organizacin aunque no necesariamente plena unidad ideolgica.   Para ello, hemos pensado en tener una estructura basada en los diferentes frentes de lucha en los que participamos y trabajar material terico especfico de cada frente a partir del cual generar ese discurso gracias al debate colectivo, sin perdernos en la teora, para ser capaces de establecer un dilogo entre la intervencin social y la reflexin.    Del mismo modo, hacer hincapi en el compromiso y en la responsabilidad militante, acabando con la preponderancia de las libertades individuales por encima de las colectivas dentro del anarquismo para alcanzar el equilibrio entre ambas, porque creemos que es la nica forma de enfocar los esfuerzos colectivos hacia objetivos comunes. Adems, observamos cmo muchas veces invertimos esfuerzos a corto plazo en nuestros espacios que al no responder a una estrategia predefinida se pierden y no sirven como escaln hacia unos objetivos a medio y largo plazo, lo que provoca sensacin de estancamiento entre la militancia al no ser capaces de cuantificar la evolucin del movimiento. Debemos avanzar hacia un cambio en la cultura militante.   Tambin vemos la necesidad de resignificar o clarificar trminos del anarquismo clsico como propaganda por el hecho o accin directa que son normalmente incomprendidos o intencionadamente tergiversados, as como romper con las estticas socialmente impuestas al anarquismo para as salir de nuestros espacios de resistencia y de la subcultura para pasar a la ofensiva poltica.   En resumen, queremos construir de forma colectiva una alternativa real, territorial, fuerte, organizada y por fuera de las instituciones para convertirnos en protagonistas de nuestras propias vidas en la esfera poltica, econmica y social.  Zaragoza, junio de 2015.  Contacto provisional: aunar.info@gmail.com  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  As at many times in the past Spain has possibly the largest anarchist movement in the world. It certainly is the best organized. Anarchists from across the world look to the anarchosyndicalist unions (CGT, CNT, Solidaridad Obrera, CAS) as models and inspirations. They stand as examples of how anarchist ideals can be made relevant to ordinary people.  The ideals of anarchism, however, are not confined to the world of work. Everywhere in Spain anarchists are involved in a vast field of activity. Community assemblies, ecology, solidarity, anti-repression, feminism, anti-eviction, gender initiatives, immigrant defence, publishing, archives and so much more. The difference is that the community initiatives, unlike the union work, are localized and not coordinated.    This problem of disorganization was made abundantly clear to Spanish anarchists by the results, or lack thereof, of the 'Indignados' movement. This Spanish movement predated the 'Occupy' movement of 2011, and it was more popular, had a greater understanding and left a much more enduring legacy than Occupy did. The goals of the Indignados were very much anarchist goals. The methods the mostly young people chose were even more so. It would have been a 'golden opportunity' for Spain's anarchists.  It didn't happen. Anarchists certainly participated in the Indignados. In many cases they were the dominant force. There was, however, no coordination, no plan as to what to do when the romance of the demonstrations wore off. Protesting is easy. Building is difficult. There was a vacuum in terms of practical ways forward. The vacuum was filled by the social democrats of Podemos. The end result of social democracy is being demonstrated today in Greece, and there is no reason to imagine that Podemos will follow a different path.  The anarchists of Spain are nothing if not practical. Through their history their talent for organization might turn Prussians green with envy. In that country anarchism lives in the real world and not in ideological dreams. Much discussion and debate has happened in Spain in the last few years. Many anarchists have come to see the need for organization and coordination outside of the unions, to present a viable alternative to social democracy. In the Catalan speaking areas[Embat](http://embat.info) has been organizing for about two years. In Castille and other regions [Apojo Mutuo](https://apojomutuo.wordpress.com) has also begun the process. The latest initiative is that of [Aunar](http://aunar.org) in Aragon.   The following is the 'Statement of Intentions' of this new initiative in Spanish anarchist organization.  @@@@@  **Statement of Intentions**  Second open meeting:  Friday, July 17 at 18:00 in the CSO Kike Mur (Torrero).  This initiative promote a set of militants and activists from different social and trade union movements of Aragon. We are people who participate as individuals in anarcosindicatos, student organizations and social centers as well as other groups and neighborhood assemblies so as sectoral basis.   15M understand that was a turning point in the way of understanding politics and are enthusiastically how the different spaces in our cities and towns meeting spaces and political debate until then refused to give were created. However we see the evolution of speech "does not represent us" has led to an electoral rotation of these social movements, a result of not being able to articulate a speech by outside institutions, to speak only as abstract goals like end of capitalism or the abolition of the state when you have to be aware that it is not what it is now at stake, but we are in a process of accumulation of forces and meet our immediate needs. Which is why we have been the electoral organizations that have taken on this role, becoming an attractive option in the short term for a significant part of the population tired of seeing their material living conditions worsen.   We analyze the state is not a neutral tool for anyone who wants to use it has a well-defined, to maintain the status quo through the monopoly of force specific functions. With an increasingly global capitalism, its institutions cease to be management tools misery in the service of economic and financial powers of supranational character: we are aware that neoliberalism is not going to end up with a Royal Decree.   In this situation we see the need to establish a common strategic direction, long-term, involving define tactical objectives and lines of action and, based on some tests, generate discourse on issues that affect us on a daily basis and which usually, as a movement, we not position ourselves, which translates into a libertarian program. To carry out essential consider creating an organization that far from wanting to replace social movements and anarcosindicatos, complement, reinforce and enrich the work they perform.   Historically, no social revolution has been possible without a strong and autonomous collective mass action and that is why this organization would strengthen and develop this kind of movement by coordinating those taking libertarian practices, currently participating in them in our context territorial. This makes us stronger when it comes to socially intervene and address the structural violence exerted on individuals and bodies, with political unity in the organization but not necessarily full ideological unity.   To do this, we thought of having a structure based on the different fronts of struggle in which we participate and work specific theoretical material in front from which to generate the speech by the collective discussion, without getting lost in theory, to be able to establish a dialogue between social intervention and reflection.   Similarly, emphasizing the militant commitment and responsibility, ending the dominance of individual liberties over collective within anarchism -to achieve a balance between both-because we believe that is the only way of approaching collective efforts towards common goals. Moreover, we note how often invest short-term efforts in our spaces that by not responding to a predefined strategy are lost and do not serve as a step towards objectives in the medium and long term, resulting sense of stagnation among the members not being able to quantify the evolution of the movement. We must move towards a change in the militant culture.   We also see the need to give new meaning or clarify terms of classical anarchism as "propaganda by deed" or "direct action" that are typically misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented and break the socially imposed aesthetic anarchism to come out of our areas of strength and the subculture to go on the political offensive.   In short, we collectively build a real, land, strong, organized and out of institutions to become the protagonists of our own lives in the political, economic and social spheres alternative.  Zaragoza, June 2015.  Provisional Contact: aunar.info@gmail.com    Como en muchas ocasiones en el pasado Espaa hoy tiene posiblemente el ms grande movimiento anarquista en el mundo. Ciertamente es la major organizada. Anarchists de todo el mundo ven a los sindicatos anarcosindicalistas (CGT, CNT, Solidaridad Obrera, CAS) como modelos e inspiraciones. Se destacan como ejemplos de cmo los ideales anarquistas pueden hacerse relevante para la gente comn.  Los ideales del anarquismo, sin embargo, no se limitan al mundo del trabajo. Por todas partes en Espaa los anarquistas estn implicados en un vasto campo de actividad. Asambleas comunitarias, Ecologa, Solidaridad, contra la represin, feminismo, anti-desalojo, iniciativas de gnero, de defensa de inmigrantes, editoriales, Archivos y mucho ms. La diferencia es que las iniciativas de la comunidad, a diferencia del trabajo syndical, son localizados y no coordinados.

Zaragoza, June 2015.  Provisional Contact: aunar.info@gmail.com    Indeed. The unions won't surrender without a fight. They may lose, as they did under Thatcher, but simply fighting can limit the damage. It's sad that there aren't more anarchists in caucuses in some unions. There certainly are individuals, but the fact they are individuals limits their influence. I'm certainly pleased by the activities of the Solidarity Federation and the IWW in Britain, but the UK lacks the sort of 'minority caucus' represented in France by the 'Libertarian Communists of the CGT'. I think it's an essential component.             It's a great statement of "faith" that the selfishness of individual humans will somehow, by a mystical process, end in collective good. The empirical evidence as opposed to the pronouncements from limited data, worked up by rationalization in the absence of the real world, says otherwise. Outside of the free market church which is as divorced from reality as any Marxist sect could ever be, the world continues on with the effects of **both** selfishness and cooperation, both of which are part of 'human nature', producing effects that are often (usually ?) unexpected by the actors. As I said, you are living in a religious world where ideology has replaced divinity, and a vague panglossianism has replaced divine providence.  Look at your arguments. The abstract "billionaire" who actually has little control over the average corporation today is supposed to 'benefit humanity' because he is part of it. You don't recognize, or more likely you don't want to recognize, that said billionaire may very easily be able to protect himself from consequences that will be suffered by others. Why shouldn't he ? It is, after all, part of "Holy Selfishness" to consider only oneself, Holy Selfishness being what drives human progress in the view of some ideological religions.   Your view of the world is a mirror image of the crudest Stalinist and the most dogmatic member of a dogmatic religion.      You realize, I hope, that you are making a statement of "faith' in humanity's ability to muddle through which could be seen as just as religious as any faith in some religion. Maybe you're right. I hope so.         Well scratch that idea I guess. Thanks for the info.                  I guess so. It was a really well written article. I wonder if it can be grown indoors ?   Me too. The sad point is that the article says the blooms last such a short time.                     First 'yes but' - Turkey. In the area. Economics, ISIS and climate change are neck and neck with climate in a slight lead.  Second 'yes but' - Egypt. In the area and with a **huge** population in comparison to other Middle Eastern nations. I would give a **100%** guarantee that the Egyptians would chose economic instability over any other option. The only population segment that might differ would be soldiers on active duty on the western border and in the Sinai.  Third 'yes but' - Iran. In the area and not a big fan of ISIS by a long shot. I wouldn't be as certain as in the case of Egypt, but I'd say that this *second most populous nation in the area* would have a majority putting economics first.  Fourth 'yes but' - Nigeria. Sub-Saharan country with another huge population. Despite the fact of an **active war** with Boko Haram who are campaigning for ISIS affiliation ISIS runs a poor third behind both economic instability and climate change. I think the present effects of climate change are mainly a concern of the north of the country, but I could be wrong about this.  The 'yes buts' could go on and on because the situations are complicated. It's interesting to consider it case by case.         There may be something to what you say. I wonder how Pew choses which countries to survey. Some things like ease of contacting respondents (Mongolia, Afghanistan, Bolivia, Paraguay, Nepal, Laos, Cambodia, Syria, Iraq, etc.) are obvious, but the large number of missing European countries seems strange to me. I don't know if I fully agree with you, but it is at least a partial explanation.                                 Indeed. A stray thought just popped into my head. Hockey stadiums as indoor greenhouses in the off-season ? Practical ?   Me either, until I saw the article.   Good question. I can remember the controversy about leaded gasoline. It's certainly something to look at, but I have no quick answer.                        I think the speculator is merely enjoying some wild romantic fantasy and not looking for headlines at all. Let them have their fun.                                    [Havana Times](http://www.havanatimes.org) is an English language non-official  leftist website published in Cuba. Another good source, in Spanish is the Cuban anarchist website [Red Observatorio Critico](http://observatoriocriticocuba.org).         [Havana Times](http://www.havanatimes.org) is a regular non-official news source put together by non-regime left dissidents in Cuba. [Red Observatorio Critico](http://observatoriocriticocuba.org) is a Spanish language anarchist website, also from Cuba.                                 When I think about it you are exactly right.      The post above was copied from r/worldanarchism with, as usual, no permission nor attribution.         I'd suspect that such policies have some sort of 'escape clause'. I'll have a look to see what I can find.                                          I doubt if anyone has even made an estimate. There is a long process of data gathering before a person could suggest amounts.         Once more the item above has been reposted from r/worldanarchism without permission and without proper attribution. This time it took the bot all of **36 seconds** to copy and repost.                                                                     I wasn't aware of the Finnish group. I'm going to try and find out more about them. The worst loss, in my opinion, was the Qubec Union Communiste Libertaire shutting down. There is also a lot happening in the Spanish-speaking world, including in Spain itself. Stay tuned.                                                         I've see some of this, and it certainly holds hope for the future. The polio campaign, I understand, is being hampered by political factors in both Africa and Pakistan/Afghanistan. In Africa the objections seem to be pure conspiracy theory. In Pakistan there may or may not be a problem with the use of the campaign for tracking militants. I have my doubts about this claim, but I am agnostic about the matter.  I've never heard of a vaccination campaign that involved routine blood samples. If the CIA *did* misuse the campaign that would be shameful. Hopefully the situation will stabilize.               And then there is the Biblical instruction about 'Jubilee Years' when debts are to be forgiven.   The item above was copied without permission nor proper attribution from r/worldanarchism.

The following is an editorial statement from Anarkis, a newly formed anarchist organization in Indonesia.  @@@@@@@@@@    ABOUT ANARKIS.ORG ---- "Anarkis.org is a product of collaboration between anarchist organizations and individuals who agree with our Editorial Statement (see below). This site is intended to be one of the representation of the discourse and practice of the anarchist movement in the center of the revolutionary movement in Indonesia.   Anarkis .org is intended to be the site of production, reproduction and distribution of the discourse and practice of anarchism in Indonesia."   **---- EDITORIAL STATEMENT ----**  Among the heterogenous tendencies in anarchism, we identify ourselves as anarchists in the tradition of "Platformists", anarchist-communists and anarchist-syndicalists. We generally identify ourselves in the organizational theory and practice of this tradition. However, this tradition is the starting point for our politics and not an end point.    The core ideas of this tradition is the need for anarchist organizations that seek to develop:   1. Theoretical Unity  2. Tactical unity  3. Collective action and Discipline  4. Federalism   Anarchism will be built in the class struggle the majority of society (the working class) against the small minority who are now in power. For us, a revolution needs to put anarchist ideas as the ideas are accepted and practiced by the working class. This will not happen spontaneously. Our role is to make anarchist ideas accepted and practiced.    The main focus of our activity is our work within the organizations of the working class (eg, labor organizations, trade unions, cooperatives, student organizations, peasant organizations, women's organizations) if possible. Therefore, we reject the views that don't accept activities within these organizations as a part of the working class. It is natural that we become part of these mass organizations. In them, we fight for the establishment of democratic structures prevalent in anarchist mass organizations such as those built by the Spanish working class in the 1930s.   It is important to work in the fight against certain forms of oppression, imperialism and the struggle of the working class for a decent living space. Our general approach to this, as our approach to the organization of the working class, is involved with mass movements and within these movements, to promote anarchist methods of organization involving direct democracy and direct action.    We actively oppose all forms of prejudice within the working class movement and society in general. We together with other parties fought against racism, sexism, sectarianism [religion] and homophobia. We look towards the success of a revolution and see that the elimination of oppression in the period after the revolution is determined by the development of the struggle against these things in the pre-revolutionary period. Methods of struggle that we promote are a preparation for a society according with the ideas of anarchists and communists after the course of the revolution.    We oppose imperialism but put forward anarchism as an alternative goal rather than nationalism. We support anti-imperialist movements of the grass-roots while calling for anarchist strategy rather than nationalist strategy.    We recognize the need for anarchist organizations who agree with the above principles to be federated internationally. However, we believe that the strength and success of this federation is determined by the success of development at the national or regional level that is able to make the international work real, not a slogan.   http://anarkis.org/pernyataan-editorial   The data compare 2001 and 2011 figures.                           I'd assume that they could be anywhere in the galaxy. Some theories say they are more likely in the outer regions of galaxies.         Is it going to eliminate rabies like smallpox, as the headline seems to claim, no ? Many others have commented on the exaggerated nature of the headline, and I must agree with them. Will it reduce the incidence ? Yes. If cats are included along with dogs it cuts off the major pathway whereby rabies enters the human population from wildlife reservoirs.      	199
 5534 :)  EDIT: DustyFrazer (steam ID xD)   [THIS](http://codepen.io/dissimulate/pen/KrAwx) is the future of cloth physics! (left click to pull, right click to rip)   Yo Dawg   Lux Qs have never made a noise..... even IN fog of war.... Riot pls   Yeah I got particularly salty after a bad day at college so it makes sense. But alright man thanks for the clarification :)   Yeah I got my first one the other day and was quite shocked. You think I'll still get the Mundo skin and mystery skin at the end of the season then?    If you get a warning for negative behnaviour but no punishment will you still be eligible for rewards?   Damn, i was hoping he died or something.... this is just awful :( He will be missed.   Also for the record can we get a noise when lux's Q hits in fog of war? it's never made a noise and if it did it'd be an awesome quality of life change   GRID would be super cool   Yeah so Vote to Kick feature when?   Consider this comment my formal entry to said giveaway, good sir.   I'm an opportunist.   If he doesnt want it, my gf has a GTX 560 and is in desperate need of an upgrade. Im willing to pay for postage :D   TIME YOU DID SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE BUSTYMONSTERTRUCK   "Don't be upset. Others have it worse" that's like saying don't be happy cos others have it better.   Pro tip : never buy a white keyboard.   As a type 1 diabetic i'd like to know how the hell diabetes is an insult... I mean if anything i'll die young, wouldnt that be a plus for someone who's clearly angered by my existence?.....Console gamers, man....   are you looking to get refered? if so count me in! im a crazy altaholic   No please stay! We'll miss you!      How do you see what mounts you chose? I think i might have selected the rocket twice. Where should i go to confirm this?  	22
    I do not see what you see here?   This wasn't much of a shrink in die size compared to others (from 32-14) so the performance isn't a massive step up (relatively speaking, again). The problem at that scale is that the more the die shrinks, the more opportunity there will be for failures, errors, etc...and even if these chips are clocked down (which they probably have to be) that's a lot of heat to take care of.         Pottery piece   your appreciation of its beauty is priceless. Other than that, it is not worth money, although you could take it somewhere and have a cabochon made that might have slight value.   I have something almost exactly similar, down to the dolomite. These are from western NC--almost a guarantee. Don't see anything similar anywhere else, at least not in the US. Edit, and yes, it's ruby.               So jealous--what a wonderful outing that must have been. I am working on restoring a fireplace with stone up and down the sides. A haul like this would make me rethink how for certain.                  Weird, I can't find much about HPX--have a good overivew somewhere in the link department?   Anagrams / Acronyms ;)   Message Passing Interface.  High Performance Computing.         I forget that no one wants to read how this stuff works at scale to the point where it can be scary. They just want to read about how it's scary. Sigh.   If not, has that been a slow evolution away from placing any value on it (and what it might mean for your machine to wind up on the Top 500) or did it never matter? And bonus question--does the new companion benchmark (HPCG) seem like it will be any more valuable? If it's not valuable and your organization still runs LINPACK and publishes Top 500 results, why do it? Vendor pressure? Curiosity?   I didn't know that subreddit existed--a lot of great stuff there that borders HPC. What others might I be missing, especially those that revolve around chips/architectural things?                   I think it is silicified. I used to live up near there and that stuff is found frequently. This is a more sediment covered piece, but if you find or clean pieces that aren't, it's hard as a rock coral.   I think the wildlife uses of this are mentioned tongue in cheek. The idea is that the actual uses for it that people can think up is what matters.    Yet at the top of the local news feeds for the Bay Area it's all John Lennon's wife's life in retrospect and news on soaring bank gains. One massive algae bloom can render East Bay without drinking water--and aside from shipping it in, there are not alternatives. So what happens when CA water demands press eastward?   Quartzite for the most part. Not uncommon but always nice to look at--I have several similar hunks that line a stream now.   Fossilized coral   Okay. It looks salesy but haven't seen an ARM-based cloud like this. Problem is, it's in France. And... yeah. Well.               Okay so this made my entire day.   Agreed and frankly, some research into this revealed it's just not possible beyond the "semi-automatic" approaches he lists in his article. Anyone think this is promising for really gnarly code? Loops aside this seems rather optimistic. All interesting nonetheless.   Ah well damn. It looks like I grabbed the link to the map itself--the way machine learning was used in the research project to create it was a cool little story but now that page on github isn't working at all. I'll try to load it again in a bit--if it doesn't I'll post a quick synopsis. It's not rocket science, but I can see how things like this can be personalized and integrated into mobile mapping functions and applications.      I know it's Intel sponsored, but the article is actually pretty good and balanced.       Has anyone here worked with this or other "automatic parallelizers" of any sort. There aren't many and none seem to stack up to anything. This company seems pretty secret sauce about how they do it--not sure if it's even possible.                        That is the claim--would sure like to see more about how that benchmark was run though.  	56
          Bit of a duh thing but it is kinda true. Maybe in the past it was different, I have a few who built up their business from relatively nothing, but these days it seems you need a lot of cash to go out on your own.      Well I believe the author spelled it out quite clearly. There are multiple strands that seem to hang out there with no purpose, so the initial strain is what it is - obvious and all - but the rest are confusing.  That is if they have any meaning at all.     Roy Scheider should have played him in a TV movie.  	7

 Thank you very sincerely. I'm thankful that I shared Diane's final act of love and devotion. Sharing it feels less lonely.    Thank you very much. The response has been more than I could have imagined, and I'm thankful that Diane continues to inspire joy and love, even after her passing.    Mujhe apni patni ki yada a raha hai apna khayal rakhna, dost. maf kijiye, mujhe Hindi nahee ati hai. mai U.S. se hum. My mom's from Delhi but my dad's from the South. We mostly spoke English at home. Apna Khyal Rakhna.    My dad is Tamil, and my mom's from Delhi. They met here in the U.S. though. I didn't feel a particularly strong connection to North or South, which is I guess, why I wound up marrying a gora...   My parents are Indian, but I grew up in the U.S.   	5
 True story. I remember some of the oddest people would take hits of acid with me and I never would have thought.    University in Ohio. I've always been an herbal kind of gal. Hence TORCHHTOKE, good grades, degree, and the curiosity to dabble with other things such a shrooms and every once in a while acid. Always ending back in the dorm. (I have a great buddy system.)  My roommate on the other hand...not so smart. She started doing heroin. She came from a small town outside Cleveland. Since she lived so close she normally stayed there, eventually failing out because she missed so many classes.   Well turned out, one day after I ate some shrooms with my gay best friend and went to a local hole in the wall bar and got decently fucked up and we walked back. Opened the door. And there is my roommate, looking like a scene from a horror movie. Wet hair covering her face squating over my coffee pot taking a shit into it. She obviously was zooted out of her mind because it took her a good minute to realize we were staring at her. She then proceeded to pick up her shit and throw it at us.   I was boomin so hard that I started laughing then ran away. When the RA came to the room they found her laying on the bathroom floor covered in her shit. Obviously called the authorities. When our room was searched I told them exactly what I had in my drawer safe. Condoms, birth control, a 8th of shrooms and $2000. When the cop opened it up he looked at me. Tossed me my baggie of shrooms. And said "We will be searching the rest of the room now you may leave."  When I came back, sobered up a little she was arrested. Charged with some heavy shit and I never saw or spoke to her again.    I hope she's doing okay because she had so much potential. Still stoked I got away with those shrooms.   P.S- I have another story that is so fucked up. Maybe for later.    EDIT 1: Typos. Sorry I'm tired.  EDIT 2: grammar   So unfortunate.    GLORIOUS!    Since there are 13 books (some of my favorite) how many seasons do you think it would be?   To Beatrice- When we were together I felt breathless. Now you are.   This literally is what mine look like everyday in the summer. I don't go swimming or wear shorts it sucks.    LMAO HAHAHAHAHA my man is a vegan and he eats my carnist pussy all the damn time and loves it.   That show terrified me as a child.    BHOLE   That's a Doozer.    Hey /u/RandomguyDota like this??   How does something like that fucking happen?! I'm washing my vagina right now...   I clicked........I will forever be disgusted with myself.   I have a great life now! I have been seeing my new guy for a year and he's amazing, no children, managing a top notch restaurant. Where I want and need to be. In a really good place. He's 40 now, single and working at Tire Man. (Me leaving forced him to get a job.) Last I heard he got pulled over for a DUI. So yeah...good riddance.   I left out that he is 37. But I agree. My mother was adopted and after meeting her biological mother...it was a good thing.    I love finding mistakes like thus in movies or shows. Makes me feel like "Hey! Even celebrities who are made out to be perfect sometimes can't get it right. So when I'm drunk and can't answer my phone correctly I don't feel bad about myself. "    Forgot something crucial for work. Came home during my lunch break to get it and my fiance and this girl were tangled in my sheets. I simply got what I needed and walked out of the house. He ran after me asking why I wasn't fighting for him. I asked him "Why would I fight for someone who isn't faithful?" And that was it. Moved back in with my parents the next day.   P.S- He got her pregnant. She had a baby boy, and put the child up for adoption. She said having a kid would be a burden at 19.      Cheers friend. Tomorrow is a new day   I live by lake Erie, so I literally have a lot to do. Cedar Point, Put-In-Bay, wineries, my cottage is 45 mins away in Michigan. So much shit..but I guess that all involves drinking HA!    Bummer! Sorry I hope I never have to repeat a day like this again.    Thanks! Pouring will proceed!    Me! Cheers from North West OHIO!    I've had a seriously strange day. Odd, sad, confusing and bizarre things have been happening to me. So now I'm drunk. Off orange vodka, soda. At the local dive bar. Cheers Reddit! Cheers Ohio!    This is actually the picture that brought me to Reddit three years ago.    I know it says "one year', this is my second account.   In my city, Chinese are the worst drivers.   Elephants are elegant creatures. It makes me sick to think someone would do something like this.  	26
 Thanks, I think I needed this. I've really been contemplating reading them soon, but haven't been able to convince myself. This is a real help.   Did not know that... Awesome   Which is ok, because they'll know that for a fact.    I heard that exact story but about Beethoven...   Never seen the film, but the book was a great read.   Yes yes yes yes yes.   Behind The Ocean, American Gods is absolutely the best. It really has to be read. And then read 'Fragile Things' and 'Trigger Warnings', for the short stories. Also because they're both excellent. Also The Graveyard book, and Good Omens (with Terry Pratchett) =D   It's pretty obvious to say we spend far too much time on social media. On the internet as a whole. Googling things to find out even the simplest of questions.   Say what you will about what this has done for society because, assuming there isn't some colossal catastrophe, we have a fixation with documenting every single thing we do. And sure, it's annoying now, but in a hundred years, historians will be able to look back and pinpoint this time as the first time that history was never a huge question mark. They'll be able to look back and see perfectly what we were like, what we did in our spare time, how we felt about everything. We have photographic proof of the food we eat, and the things we liked to watch. We have videos of what we used to do, and looked like and sounded like. For the first time we don't have to guess and assume and put together tiny pieces of a much larger puzzle piece, because it's all there, laid out for future generations.  And that, to me, is pretty damn exciting.   (Why) would you takes notes of a book?  (except in the instance of needing to make a reference - for an essay, say).   No, you haven't. You gotta learn your facts from somewhere. So long as you didn't look it up just now before you posted :)   Hit me with a random fact off the top of your head, if you have to google it, you're cheating.     Writer: Neil Gaiman  Novel: The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman. The Virgin Suicides, by Jeffrey Eugenides. On Chesil Beach, by Ian McEwan. The Ocean at the End of the Lane, by Neil Gaiman.  Film: The Prestige, by Christopher Nolan.   *The Percy Jackson series, by Rick Riordan  Holes, by Louis Sachar  The Maze Runner series, by James Dashner  The Inheritance Cycle (Eragon...), by Christopher Paolini  The His Dark Materials trilogy (Northern Lights), by Philip Pullman  The Night Angel Trilogy (The Way of Shadows), by Brent Weeks  The Virgin Suicides, by Jeffrey Eugenides  The Kingkiller Chronicles (The Name of the Wind), by Patrick Rothfuss  The Alex Rider Series (forgotten the first one), by Anthony Horowitz. (He's done another series, but I've absolutely forgotten the name - I only read the first one.  The Darren Shan saga, by (you guessed it), Darren Shan     Polo indeed - that's a proper royal sport.   You really must hate Croquet...  And Boules.    How about rather than facing the possibility of closing down you do what every self-published studio must do and *self-promote like a goddamn motherbitch!*   I understand how hypotheticals work, but there aren't any stars even remotely near us - that are due to go supernova - that would affect Earth. I'm just being a space nerd, continue with your stories :D   The Abhorsen trilogy is like this. The second installment, Lirael, is longest, and Abhorsen, the finale, is the shrotest of the lot.  Also The Night Angel Trilogy gets shorter by each book.   I also think this is quite a trend with YA where the original idea only fills up the first book, and the rest is just meandering bullshit - clasping at straws to drag the bastard out into a trilogy.  Also the 'The Passage' series. It isn't finished yet but the second book, 'The Twelve' is about half the size of the The Passage, the first one. The last book isn't out yet,  :'(, so we'll have to get a final count for that.  These are just the books I can look to my bookshelf and see.    Also, faster streaming. For the same reason.   PS4. You're cutting out the middle-man if you don't use a graphics card. The quality gets turned down going into the CC up to your PC and out.    It's kind of the reason I don't want to read it now I'm an adult. I'm not sure I'll like it. Having such high expectations, but having so much more to compare it to. I'm worried I'll understand it too well, and not like it.   Me too. I haven't read it in super long because I'm scared of it.   My favourite drink is Coke. You've probably tried it.  Other than that just normal, English Tea :)  Oh, also, Fanta + Coke is surprisingly nice. And, if you can, adding some Sprite in there is great too. When I worked at McDonalds we could help ourselves to small drinks, so we used to mix them see what tasted nice. Fanta + Coke is surprisingly good.   Making his excuses, John rose from his chair. Struggling to make his way through the busy pub, he emerged from the heavy door into the weak midday sun. Collecting himself, he headed towards the Cathedral.   Better? Worse?   This game was fucking BOSS! My childhood right there. Sat with my sister (who was bigger than me, so she got to control the mouse), as we tried to work out the levels.   It had to end the way it did. No way around it.   No. The books are horrendously awful. But the films are ok.   Glad I could help :)   How To Train Your Dragon 2 finale I thought was excellently animated. Perfect. And was, hands down, better than both films.   I haven't read it in ten years give me a break :(   Ah see...sorted. No problems there.   You're excused.   I'm 23. I read this when I was 13. No matter how many books I've read, some I've liked enough to get tattooed, nothing has even come close to The His Dark Materials.   I've tried other stuff. Catch-22, and Toh-Kay and Keasbey Nights. Just nothing compares to Streetlight Manifesto. They're insane.   Dude. I thought you were totally on Streetlight Manifesto. Not the other one. When I was talking about the album, I meant this one. This one is amazing!   Holy shit, I'm about to go to bed so I was like "yeah, I'll listen to this song quickly."  It's not the Streetlight Manifesto version, and it's not as good. Oh god, its quite terrible actually. Listening to the proper one now, drop the link here methinks.   [Ah, that's better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfAdFKJfHZ4)   Tomb Raider.  Never played Uncharted. Love TR as a kid on PS1. Loved the prequel to Rise of the TR, so...   That's the best thing for it to be.   Interesting interesting. :)  Genre?   It certainly helps. The longer you can stay in the swing the easier it is to stick at a single project for a long time.   There have been times when It's been late and I've had to stop writing because I have scared myself. I guess that's stupid, but I scare easily.   Just, when you write your serial novels where you want to put them for people to read them on the web. You said forum host, not sure what that means.  I just assumed you had a kind of a strategy for putting them on the web. Where to put them, how often, how to make get max views, that sorta thing.   My first novel I never pushed myself. It took 3 years, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this new novel I'm pushing myself to write 1k words every day and so far it's really useful.  Whatever works best for you, and there is really no reason to push yourself. But having immediate results gets hella satisfying.   They are simply amazing. This album and their new one has so far proven to be the best two though.    Ah, that sounds cool. Good luck with the novel.   You mean, this is a book and not just a film. My priorities just shifted!   Instant internet win for the first ever Streetlight Manifesto reference I have ever come across. A.K.A FUCK YEAH!  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this song, this album, and THIS BAND!   What's your plan for the web serial novels? Got any idea where to post them?  I write any genre really. Especially in shorts. Some horror, some romance. Really all over the place.   Best way to get a legit following is for them to see your book on a shelf :)   Kudos. You're doing it. Just gotta get better and get that book deal.   Hey, writing piecemeal is better than writing nothing. At least you get something done, even it if it's something small.  Like I always say: Progress for it's own sake.   Does sound pretty good.   There's a story here.   Lots of different things. Shorts I write in every genre. Dabble in poetry. My first novel was action/adventure/sci-fi. My new novel is horror/low-fantasy/literary.    Yeah I got that. I don't know anyone else who writes. Does suck.   15 years is a long time to keep it secret? Why haven't you told anyone?   **The Amber Spyglass**  *"Where are we going?"*  *"To build the kingdom of Heaven"*  What I mean is that whole book destroyed me.   There is always time. Find time. 7 years is 7 years too long to be away from writing. If there isn't time *make* time!   I just want to call out your name because I'm pretty sure it's a reference to *A Day To Remember*, and that's pretty freakin' awesome.   Ah, that's not important anyway. Haha.   That's a lot of stuff.  I'm working on my second novel at the moment.   Well, Emo Culture had to get its inspiration from somewhere.   That sounds really interesting. I would read that =]   We don't know what the year is. I can load, cock and fire an assault rifle in seconds, but I cannot read a clock. Signs I have read on my campaigns tell me I'm near a place called London. I have never seen the ocean, very few of us have, so I have never left this place.   First there were the wars. Then we lost people. Then towns and cities were leveled. Then, there were no more countries. I have counted the days I have marched between seeing one green thing, and another. The rest is brown, dead earth and grey, oppressive skies.  Another sign says I'm in London proper. The building's here are the tallest I have ever seen. Though the bones penetrating free from the top of their brick tell me they are no longer as tall as they once were. We will put an end to this war. Not that I, or my parents, or their parents, had any damn clue what we were fighting for. Here we will meet the factions, and we will lay down our arms, and we will dance, and drink.   The water here is black, and it swallows our weapons and erases them from existence. We spend the night building bonfires, hunting wild animals and drinking the fermented apples and grapes we have brought with us. I meet a girl. And two weeks later we have fallen in love.  There are no more wars. No more enemies. Only allies, and peace. We are left alone, this dark-haired girl and I, to explore this London on our own.  Three weeks later I meet a man whose name I never learned. And when I see him in the arms of my dark-haired girl I attack him and beat him to death.   War is reignited. There is no war without love. And there is no love without war.   Ooh, *out there*, hey? Do tell. =D   The room is unnervingly silver. Each wall is a blacked out window and the two subjects feel that through each, eyes are watching them. The room is perfectly square, with a silver table lining one side.  This surface is lined with knives and tools. Each brand new, never used. A circular saw (plugged through the wall and out). A scalpel. A butcher's knife and a meat cleaver. A wire saw. And others.  In the middle there are two surfaces, beds. Again, silver. So shiny and clean that anyone leaning over it would see their reflection staring back at them perfectly. These beds are unremarkable except for the cuffs designed to hold arms and ankles in place, and the bands to stop the person moving entirely.  But the most remarkable thing, as the subject enters the room, is the person standing up and strapped against the only wall that wasn't a window. It was a he, middle-aged and insignificant looking, if not entirely unattractive. He was bound to the wall by his hands and feet and chest, and gagged. He stares at the newcomer mournfully, his eyes a perfect display of pain and sorrow that the new subject couldn't help but feel guilty for. Though without reason.  From no where comes a buzz of static, and a voice. 'Hello, subject 12.This is subject 11. Can I just confirm that neither have you have ever seen each other before in your lives?'  They both shake their heads.  'Good,' the voice continues. 'The purpose of this test is simple. Subject 11 here will die.'  The person across the room visibly shakes and audibly moans, echoing loudly.  'You, subject 12, may stop that. What you cannot stop is him getting hurt entirely. Across the room from you are some utensils. The rules are simple, and the decision is entirely up to you. If you do not harm yourself, at all, subject 11 will die. Slowly, horribly and painfully. If you, subject 12, were to say pick up that knife there and cut off your finger, subject 11 might only lose both his arms. Cut out your eye, and subject 11 might only lose a hand. Understand? Inflict greater pain on yourself, and you will save the stranger a lot of pain himself. The door behind you is unlocked, you can leave anytime you want. Good luck.'  5 grand. And all it might cost you is an arm. The ad didn't say that.  The second subject crosses the room and looks at the instruments laid out in front of them. The man watches their progress. Watches as they gently finger each item. Subject 11 coos as they brush past the circular saw. Cowers when they pick up a bread knife.   *What to do, to save the life of a stranger?*  *Is my life,* thinks subject 12, *worth that of a strangers?*  They pick up the scalpel and threaten their eye with it, so close they can see the edge. They drop it. They press the trigger on the saw, and it whirs to life with the crisp, robotic sound of ear-splitting whirring. It goes back on the surface. They place their finger over the edge and raise high the meat cleaver. Hesitate. Put their wrist their instead.  *Is it worth it?*  Back goes the meat cleaver.  *Am I worth more than this man?*       I only ask because I did post something on here yesterday, was wondering if you actually came across it.   Zombie genre is so wide and open, how can you not like it? It's so multi-faceted...So many angles.   Well, it's all about conversation. I'm just surprised there's so many writers here, for a sub aimed at such a general demographic.    Which post was that?      I've also found myself drawn to that specific genre from time to time.    Thankyou ^ ^   Must be nice to have a sub-reddit named after yourself. Kudos to her. Thanks for this! =]   I've made threads about writing, and so many people are also writers. And on other threads I'm just checking out, people are writing! And it's awesome there seems to be a sub-culture of writer's on CC but we haven't really ever come together.  Come on CC, let's talk about writing. Tell us about what you write, and your current projects!  Edit: *Buggar, missed out on the question mark in the title. Don't hate on me :(*   Who was that? Who got their own subreddit?   Was going to have a shot at this prompt but you won so hard I don't want to attempt anything else.     Get up for 8:30. Showered by 9, and at my desk about fifteen minutes later after breakfast. I write at least 1000 words into my novel, sometimes more, sometimes less. Then lunch or more work (depending on how I'm feeling about the novel). Then, after lunch. I choose to write for either my script or my game, whichever is more pressing. Usually both if I can squeeze them in. And I try and do that till 5. Then it's read for a few hours, mooch on Netflix, eat my tea, and play a game on Xbox or read some more or watch a film.

I'm really keen on feedback, so please; if you want to rip it apart I welcome you to. Either on this thread or over on Wattpad. I appreciate it :)   What is this!?   Do you want a hug?  Uh-huh.   This sounds like "The Host".   Which other subreddit, if I might ask? I'm looking for a place to try and get some stuff out as well.   * Catdog * Ren and Stimpy * ^^Motherfucking Power Rangers!    What did the mods say? What did you say?   Well, the potentials there.   It's not naive at all. And if it was, I'd rather comfort someone and be naive, than be cold and an asshole.

But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live it's whole life believing it is stupid."* - Albert Einstein.    I think I'm pretty happy with the order as it is. It was a really spontaneous story and I don't want to mess with that spontaneity. When I was in the zone - and writing it - I knew which part had to come next, so I don't want to mess it.  By format do you mean non-chronology?   Possibly. Hard to say. Like I said the non-chronology was the result of something's not working together, that eventually turned out to work really well when I looked at them from a different angle. It wasn't wholly intentional. Why?   Does anyone else have misgivings over this?   You mean, that can happen? There's funny stuff that *isn't* on the internet?      To be honest that just sort of happened, I didn't really have any choice in the matter. There was so much in the story I wanted to get across, that in order to do that I had to keep on jumping backwards and forwards. Once I realised what was happening, I trimmed the story, kept some things back until the end for narrative purposes and then just wrote whichever bit of the story felt right to write next.   The size of it. How much you can do. Admittedly it might not seem like anything to EvE online players, but to me that's pretty exciting. The game holds a sense of discovery, and of isolation, and might be the closest we've got, in a video game, to actually getting out there and discovering these things for ourselves.         How was this not the first one on the list?   I'm super fucking excited, but will appropriately wait until I know more about the game to commit.      It's not heavy romance, to be honest. Very little romance in it. Just takes that angle at times. Sometimes tends to the sexual over the romantic - though that wasn't entirely intentional.   I am. Does that make a difference?   Thankyou kindly :)      **S, or; Straka**, By J.J Abrams and Doug Dorif.   Dreams are fascinating because even though we understand that REM sleep is our brains way of cataloging the events of the day. And the reason why our brains wierd out in the night is pretty well known, why all these things come together and allow us to run through (seemingly) absolutely random stories and events, with somewhat clear images and emotions, we have no idea. But our bodies are so used to this that the brain paralyzes itself during sleep so we don't enact these dreams. That's pretty...fascinating.   I've just started a booktube channel. Uploaded the second episode today.   Well, I know what I have to do now haha.   10 hour music videos. Awesome. Didn't expect there to be a big audience there, but hey, what do I know?   Well done!  What are your video's about? I'm trying to start up my own channel at the moment.      I know I'm pretty much repeating what a lot of other people have said, but absolutely fair play to the guy. It's not like people are just giving him the money, he absolutely earns it. And it doesn't matter how many people dislike him, he gets his views and he's the most subscribed to channel for a reason.  And, more's the matter, he seems like a pretty nice bloke. Whenever he does videos like this, he seems calm and kind. He has done charity work and that certainly shouldn't be forgotten. And it shouldn't matter if you like him or hate him, you have to appreciate the charity work that's done.      	112
  Why do you think Pao would take this case to court when it has no chance of succeeding?  Because she is bankrupt and this was more than likely the only chance that she would be able to take anyone on this planet and a past employer for more than 100 million dollars...all while doing nothing but pay a lawyer to convince a jury that they should award her over 100 million dollars. She jumped at the opportunity to grab over 100 million bucks while literally doing nothing but saying that people were mean to her because of her gender.   Her and her husband are in the hole for something likely close to 100 million dollars by some estimates. That's just unbelievable, really. How else would she and her likely prison-bound husband pay off those debts and pull themselves out of a 100 million dollar hole? Probably by trying to sue someone for about the same amount.     A Feast for Bros    but a CEO that engages in a law suit you don't agree with, then that bitch has got to go.  She lost resoundingly in the lawsuit and her claims were found to be totally without merit. Myself and thousands of other redditors over the past year saw this and saw the suit and her for what they were: a cynical way to bail her criminal husband out of jail (maybe literally) and for her to cash out by screwing her former boss and company over. How is noting someone's past behavior at a Silicon Valley company an "ad hominem" not worthy of discussion? For months, redditors in this subreddit and others were all over what was coming out about her past behavior and about her husband and how this made her look as a person and as the new CEO of reddit. The view that this site had of her was never positive and has been that way since January right up until this week when some people are now viewing her as this wronged woman who did nothing wrong.    All your criticisms are based on her personal life. They are personal attacks.  Not at all. I clearly discussed her personal and professional life and the bleeding together of the two and how she was toxic upon assuming the role of CEO. Not just me but the majority of reddit saw her as unfit to be CEO of this site given what we came to know about her since January or right around the time that she became CEO and people started talking about her during her discrimination trial.    You claim to hate SJW, but you are obsessed with irrelevant details about someone's personal life.  Her personal opinions and views are not irrelevant when she is the CEO of reddit and she has more than enough power to try and instill her views and values on the site and therefore on all of its users. Do you and others really not forget her blog posts and announcement posts on this site that reeked of tech world double-speak and mushy language that people were pissed off about? Reddit literally downvoted one of her posts beyond zero because they were so ticked off with her view of how the site should be run. She announced her views to us all so this isn't speculation it's just the facts and a retelling of how reddit reacted to her opinions and views for the site.    ITT: Redditors managing to forget that regardless of what Pao did or didn't do on this site, she was a scummy, shady character before she ever became CEO here and that was the reason why reddit didn't want her around.   You guys seem to conveniently forget that she sued her former mentor and boss for close to 100 million dollars in a gender discrimination suit in which she lost big time. You all seem to forget that she did so out of desperation because her husband bankrupted their family through a failed Ponzi scheme in which he drained the pension funds of many people through his criminal behavior that may well send him to federal prison at some point. She literally sued her past employer in Silicon Valley for nearly the exact same amount of money that her husband lost through his shady and criminal business dealings. How soon reddit forgets.   http://www.businessinsider.com/john-doerr-on-ellen-pao-suing-kleiner-perkins-i-was-sick-2015-6  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/kleiner-perkins-q-a-we-felt-betrayed-by-ellen-pao  http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/03/04/kleiner-perkinss-john-doerr-and-ellen-pao-a-mentorship-sours/  Totally turned on her mentor, boss, and "biggest advocate and defender" in order to try and loot his company for over 100 million dollars based on accusations that the jury ultimately found to be resoundingly baseless. She didn't get a cent and *she* has to pay her former boss and company's legal bills for suing them over a baseless accusation that threatened to tarnish the entire company and an honest guy who was her champion in Silicon Valley. Low life stuff from her.   You guys seem to forget that her and her husband are seedy, scummy, shady characters who have a history that is available for everyone to read about. Redditors found out about it and called her out for it in numerous threads before she even started doing anything unpopular on reddit and no one could understand why reddit would get into bed with not just her but with her husband since she was taking this job here as her "do or die" job where she was going to try and rebuild her image and career while facing down bankruptcy.   [Highly-entertaining profile on both of them that shows you who Pao and her husband are](http://fortune.com/2012/10/25/ellen-pao-buddy-fletcher/)  [Same as above. Very informative and entertaining read.](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/03/buddy-fletcher-ellen-pao)  [The guy is a criminal. No two ways about it. Pao pulled the gender discrimination card only after her husband played the race card first. This is who these people are. They cry discrimination, sue people with deep pockets over it, and then sometimes come away with major settlements or punitive damages. Scummy people with little to no integrity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Fletcher)  [Update on their relationship and professional lives from this week.](http://nypost.com/2015/07/12/ellen-pao-hedgie-husband-are-losing-their-power-couple-status/)  You also seem to forget that she has a history of associating with the types of people labeled as social justice warriors and feminists who are big fans of censorship and that reddit rightly had major concerns about how she was going to run the website as a result. For example, her Twitter feed, friends, and tweets reeked of this sort of stuff before she even was CEO and it paints that picture of someone who reddit rightly didn't want anywhere near the main controls of this site. Her tweeting during in the lead up to her gender discrimination trial and all of her interactions on Twitter was something straight out of the Anita Sarkeesian playbook and it was noxious for me to read through since it just reeked of "I'm a victim please give me money" nonsense that we've seen before from professional victims like her. None of these views or opinions turned out to be erroneous at all because her and her husband have an open history of this sort of stuff and reddit watched her entire trial unfold for weeks and chronicled it all and found her to be what the jury found her to be: a scheming, cynical opportunist and hustler who was totally full of it and not credible.   These really aren't my sole opinions; they're the opinions of redditors that I have read about Pao since January yet people seem to be forgetting this week why she was so unpopular a selection for CEO in the first place. All of the people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like she literally did nothing wrong, was a good fit for CEO, and that she was wrongly chastized and scrutinized are pretty delusional and have bad memories. Did she personally ban FatPeopleHate? Probably not her personally but her and Alexis definitely sat down and agreed to get rid of the sub. Was reddit really so wrong to assume that **the CEO of this site was not the one who gave the order to ban FPH and other offensive subreddits?** Absolutely not. The CEO is very much the person calling the shots not just here but in most other companies or corporations so people coming out of the woodwork this week acting like reddit just pulled another Boston Bomber manhunt screw-up again are over-the-top and delusional.    I see ZZ Top and ZZ Bottom.   I hear that power chair belongs to Scooter McGavin.   This is totally something Eric the Midget would have done.  RIP you little bastard.    https://warosu.org/data/cgl/img/0063/90/1352444013579.jpg   More like an obitchuary.    Probably because Pao didn't have the good graces not to throw her boss under the bus in order to score millions of dollars to pay off her shady husband's debt. Reddit didn't like Pao not just for her decisions on reddit but because her and her husband are scummy, shady people.   http://nypost.com/2015/07/12/ellen-pao-hedgie-husband-are-losing-their-power-couple-status/  http://www.businessinsider.com/john-doerr-on-ellen-pao-suing-kleiner-perkins-i-was-sick-2015-6  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/kleiner-perkins-q-a-we-felt-betrayed-by-ellen-pao  http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/03/04/kleiner-perkinss-john-doerr-and-ellen-pao-a-mentorship-sours/     Looks like they spotted a foul ball.

 Quite hilarious.    Do you like Scorsese's other stuff? (the director) if you liked this you should watch his other films.      Daud again? Something different?   Victoria? Sorry, I'm not familiar with this.      Context please?   When Jules Winnfield quotes the bible in Pulp Fiction.   And just last night I was wondering when PTA would announce his next film.   Holy shit. Thanks.       Do you remember which book?   Where does it say that?    Looks better than expected.   I agree. On the low chaos ending, we can see Corvo, Sam and a few others at the hound pitts. Corvo is just standing there quietly with is drink, watching the others have fun. I don't know why but that just fleshes out his character much more.      Fuck yes.    What is he like? What are Corvo's characteristics? Can someone please come up with a bit of a description of this based on what you know? I'm fascinated by this character but I don't know enough about him, can we all help each other out? I want to know more about Corvo's character.   As for Corvo's character, I would love to see a torn and weathered man who is still strong and protective of Emily.       People, there are still scenes that were shown in the trailer of Ray that we haven't seen in the show yet. It's kinda obvious he lives. Rubber bullets perhaps? A warning?    edit: Thank you for all of your comments!   Guy Ritchie's best IMO, followed closely by Lock Stock. The writing is brilliant and often hilarious, I love the fast and edgy tone and editing of the film. One of Brad Pitt's best performances, Statham, Vinnie Jones, Del Toro, and all the others are all fantastic. Would love to hear what you guys think of it.

Any advice for a want-to-be cinematographer?      Cant wait for Hail Caesar. Reading the [cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!) is enough to get you interested.   Do I want to watch this?   He'll either get nominated for this or Steve Jobs.      Yeah, until the 17th of December.   A lot worse cinematographers than Deakins?      What are your thoughts on it?  Edit: My mistake, PKD wrote the book which the film is based off. Probably should have mentioned that.   Just watched that as well.   Yeah fuck I'm an idiot.      Wahlberg???  Edit: Fucking hell I'm an idiot. Boogie Nights, of course. How could I have forgotten?                This'll be fun.    Within the next couple of weeks I'd say. Like you said, when the definitive edition is released we'll definitely be getting more on D2.   Indeed that chapter was fucked up. Describing how he gets a boner when he kills animals sent chills up my spine. And him....jerking off Henry.....was just......FUCKED.   **The most**   I feel you. But IMO that's what makes his films so great, they're nice and slow, character driven films.    Please don't spoil anything, but if it does include spoilers, just let me know how big they are.    Both actually. It's a combination of King Crimson's album 'In the court of the Crimson King' and also of the Crimson King from Stephen King's Dark Tower books, if that's what you're referring to. Thanks for asking.   That is actually quite a nice poster. Better than half the other poorly photo-shopped shit.      The stuff of nightmares   Jake Gyllenhaal.  He's proved himself an actor to keep an eye out for since Brokeback Mountain. But recently with Source Code, End of Watch, Prisoners, Enemy, Nightcrawler and probably his upcoming movie 'Southpaw' he's proved himself to be a must see actor in ANY film he's in. He's got 3 coming out this year, Southpaw, Everest and Demolition. I'll happily be seeing all 3 of them.    Oooh, any other books on Corvo?   Spoiler alert you fucking dipshit.    Any stand-out books? if you can remember.   Say what you want but I think Eisenberg will kill it as Luthor. Him saying this now just increases my faith in him to bring this character justice.    I'm just wondering if they are worth reading. I'm thinking of going through the game again this time reading all the books. Is it a waste of time?   Someone give this guy gold.   I'm interested to see what Emily's combat system is like.   That shot of the dead bodies in the wall will be staying with me for quite a few days.         Deakins and Coen brothers.

"Him" being Spielberg correct?   Telegraph Road is their best, IMO.   That's pretty cool. I especially like that specific Big Lebowski one...   Perfection.      The biggest and most anticipate film of the decade. And hopefully the best, IMO.   Yeah, until the 17th of December.   Was it a loading symbol to a website or...   Sorry, what is this?      Looks awesome.   Ahahahaha 75 people apparently.    Imagine going through there on acid.   Please god...   Pretty sure it was a funeral from what I can remember.   You're gonna need a bigger cage...      There's a part of me that actually WANTS Michael Bay to direct. Perhaps he can redeem himself. Or not. Probably not.    Neo-Noir, mystery, thriller, mature comedy (not silly stuff), dark films and quality action. Also, romance that ISN'T melodramatic and is mature and grounded.   I'm thinking of watching that next, how funny is it?   I know, it's pretty bad. Everyone just looks at the world through there fucking phones, it's pathetic.   Edit: By everyone I mean most of the current teenagers...therefore not everyone, but most.   I'm just watching 12 Angry Men and I am enjoying the fucking hell outta this movie. Please can someone tell me what are some more black and white classic films? Only the good stuff, the real good stuff.            Deakins said that he thought he couldn't bring anything 'new' into this bond film, THAT is good decision making. Upon hearing that, my respect for him went up.   There is no better quality one.   Terrific trailer, had me at 'from the director of The Others'. That movie was terrific, I'm on board.   This just gets me more excited for Steve Jobs. I know for a fact he'll win again next year.  Also, the look on Fincher's face when Sorkin is praising him, man that would mean ALOT.            People, Terrio re-wrote the script, and he's won an academy award for best adapted screenplay. Let's not forget that.   Looks promising.   Zodiac  Spirited Away  Schindler's List     This is the second positive review I've read now. I'm getting my hopes up.   More Modern Classics getting remade for TV?  Haven't heard of that before.    "Deuce Bigalow" is aggressively bad, as if it wants to cause suffering to the audience. The best thing about it is that it runs for only 75 minutes.  He had a way with words, that's for sure.   Incredible.    7pm PST, but you'd have to double check.

 So how's he manage 9 FTA per in the last 4 games of that series? If you're used logic holds true (Harden's aggression is proportional to the leniency of the refs on defenders), then he reverts back after the 3rd game when he attempted his season average FTA.    In case you didn't know, it's illegal to cook a human and James would never do that.    Is that because curry? Talk about clever. Harden's nickname should be Wet Cement (because it's something that hardens and most people don't have a penchant for watching it work).   How do you know he's not going to get the calls if he isn't putting himself in a position to force the foul?   A classic "which came first, the kitchen or the chef?"   Might be because he wasn't driving.   He seemed un-motivated honestly. For one reason or another - whether injury, illness or just mental unpreparedness - he wasn't playing the aggressive and decisive basketball that generally propels his success. It was frustrating to watch but at the end of the day, he's just another dude trying to do stuff, and sometimes he'll come up short because of things., and I'm just a guy watching him try, so who am I to question that guy?  Bye.    You're super concerned with including your profession of your possession of the truth in all your comments.   Does Westbrook average 1-2 head flops a game too? He is averaging .2 FTA fewer than Harden but I haven't seen a single reference to his attempt numbers on /r/NBA. Or is that because all of his FTA are legit cookie butter?   It's sad that we view with contempt this man: his combination of speed and strength; his ability to penetrate  and expose defenses like the modern NBA edition of the Blitzkrieg; his acute awareness to force his opposition to resort to the desperate act of stalling - to foul.  Harden is magical... up until he gets fouled. Then it's drudgery. I get the criticism, but I don't like that getting fouled takes away from all of the other elements of his game.    Numbers can be ~~devolving~~deceiving, however. Harden was not playing aggressively at all in the playoffs last year. He was settling for a lot of bad and contested jumpers, and he wasn't attacking the basket and doing his FT collecting like he had been for a the majority of last season and this season. So while those numbers might support the narrative that "the refs clamp down on the playoffs", I believe there are more variables at play than that.  Harden gets more FTs when he is aggressive and attacks the basket, he gets less FTs when he settles for end-of-the-shotclock contested jumpers.    Well, he did stay. It makes sense:I mean, he is stand-offish, generally grumpy and mostly isolated in his own man-made slice of America; he is a genuine personification of the Great state in which he was raised.  The Texans have never won in Indiana. #dontcallitaqualifier   Why pathfind on new planets when you're already King of your own?   http://streamable.com/fbvf  boring player   It's like how something like 80% of astronauts who have left orbit are from Ohio; Indiana produces a lot of people that really, really, really, want to get out of that state, no matter how hard the path.   I was already moored to my post.   YEAH BUT NO ONE WILL BE able to HOLD THEM. hehe   Yeah but we worship him with 100 million buckaroos.   Watt? Stop clowneying around, Houston willfork over a c ^r ushing and mercilous amount of pain on defense. I swearinger it.   Don't worry man, Houston has a lot of fucking pie.   Oh hey Gibbz, I've been listening to your music mucho mucho the past couple of days. Can we chill next time I'm in Brooklyn?   oh my gosh, oblivion? are you ok?   I think the one outside of F Bar resulted in the victim dying.   The best approach is to just devour it like praise until they stop feeding you.    Was this one of the back to back shootings in Midtown? Apparently the kids who did it were 15-16... Hope your friend recovers quickly.   In the playoffs to boot. Mark it down here. You don't just leave your team of 10 years, go their rival and expect to get a piggy back ride to the super bowl. Fate is going to fart on AJ so hard and it's gonna be so satisfying making it further than him and the colts this year.    Like a female God is ever going to let her windows get dirty.   The more words that tumble out of your mouth, the more God just shakes her head and wonders why you didn't quit while you weren't so far behind.    Moreyball is starting with Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb and ending up with Harden and Howard. Assets for all stars.  At least that's the business side of it.    Good list. Honestly though, any top houston songs list, without the queen of houston, beyonce, just isn't. Houston list. Thats a great best houston mostly underground w/ a little national break through songs list, though.     Earl Boykins passing to Muggsy Bogues between Yao Ming's legs.   Not black enough to scare us white folk though    Haven't heard of those, will check out thanks. Kind of the reason I made this post    Ha word. DJ Screw straight murdered that song on As The World Turns Slow.    I guess you're tougher than James Harden.    Not too familiar with blues. Care to throw together a Houston Blues beginners guide?   It was tough capping it at 15, and I tried to get a nice mix of my favorites + songs that put Houston music on the map... so that constrained me as well.  I like your list though, good representation of Houston Rap.  speaking of Houston Rap...   http://www.amazon.com/Houston-Rap-Photographs-Peter-Beste/dp/193826505X  everyone who loves the underground rap scene in Houston should get this.   that's my jam though :p   There's a South Park Mexican verse on South Side Groovin :p   I changed it like an hour ago. The link I provided seems a little wonky.  Search spotify for "top 15 H-Town" and it should go to the most recent iteration.   I agree in concept, I would listen to mo city 10 times before wanna be a baller, but it's national pull necessitated the top spot IMO. Same reason damn it feels good made the list. Personally mo city don is the first song I think of when I think Houston music but I tried not to make it too personal of a list.    But Beyonc *was* DC.    yeah I think 'Welcome 2 Houston' will replace 'Still Tippin', good call.   I always try to establish a distinction between flopping (which I feel Harden rarely does) and selling a foul (which Harden utilizes and is good at). He may embellish illegal contact but only because *there is illegal contact*.    15 from houston (obviously hip hop heavy):  1) wanna be a baller  2) bang screw  3) mo city don  4) pepper  5) int'l players anthem  6) fondren   main  7) feeling good again  8) tops drop  9) drunk in love  10) damn it feels good to be a gangsta  11) if i needed you  12) la grange  13) south side groovin  14) halo  15) still tippin  Link to my list: http://open.spotify.com/user/126159100/playlist/6bbHSxKWegbLmRZqqIu5tA   I bought signed Carl Landry shoes 3 days before he was traded for Kevin Martin. I feel your pain.   Yeah that's true, but you also don't want to put yourself in a position where your assets are a risk to your future.    They aren't losing him for nothing, they'll be losing him for flexibility. If they make an emotionally charged trade 'just to get value for him', they could potentially tie their hands behind their backs in the process. Sometimes it's better to lose something for nothing than to lose it for something worse than nothing.   He's still as raw as he was on the Rockets.    Do you know what genocide is?   The player option Dragic wanted was the biggest reason the Rockets didn't re-sign him a while back.    I don't reddit very often anymore. Actually did play basketball 3 times between you making that comment and me reading it.    genocidal  How do you figure?    no not really, i'm actually a pretty nice and considerate guy. really just thought it was a little bit funny and while it was obviously intended to be a joke about his race, I don't think substituting chop stick for fork is anything more than casually ignorant. i mean... we all laughed at the Jeremy Lin math video, but *how dare I* make a joke involving the utensils with which his people have historically consumed food???  i do apologize if i offended anyone; that was not my intention.  (I have 2 jeremy lin action figures after all, how *could* i be racist?)   stick a chop stick in him, he's done   And Lin!    I think it's funny that you are trying to play the "oh look at this guy acting all high and mighty card", when my reply was to you doing the same thing.       "congratulations, you're 3 days behind the rest of the world, time to catch-up..."  which is funny because the fact that you still listen to FM radio indicates to me that you're 3 years behind the rest of the world as far as music consumption goes.   Sam Presti. Bless his heart.   I can live with that. Happily.    For the East, yah, pretty decent. Don't really see how that makes him the MVP though. So he has the same win % while playing as Harden and worse than Curry, while playing in the East, and somehow that is supposed to be indicative of him being the MVP?  Guess I just can't see how that logically works out into a compelling argument.   Record without LeBron 2-8, with LeBron 28-12.  OK?  GS: Record without Curry 0-0, with Curry 39-8  HOU: Record without Harden 0-0, with Harden 34-14     the end of that series tho :'(   Or maybe, seeing as how it's a vet clinic, it's another dog's semen. Whoa.   I wasn't the guy you replied to initially; I'm just an impartial observer.    9 months? Are you kidding me? It hasn't been too hot to be outside in 4-5 months and we still have 3-4 more to go.  Jesus you people are babies.    Dang you're obnoxious. I bet you just live for trite arguments like these.    It's not the heat but the humidity that kills you. The plus side is that for 4 months of extremely humid heat, you get about 6 months of really nice weather and 2 months of so-so weather. Also every building has AC so if you really can't stand it, it's easy to escape.   MFW it was a joke  -_-   Houston is absolutely not a terrible place to live. I mean, there's a reason it's one of the fastest growing major cities in the United States. Even if the reason is jobs and low cost of living, that alone makes it not a terrible place to live. I mean, it's by no means NYC or Miami or San Francisco in terms of 'vibrancy', but it's a pretty great city on its own merit.   We can't give him minutes because he's not on our team :-/   You feeling a certain way doesn't automatically make it accurate. In this case your feelings aren't accurate.    10 seconds? Did you have to get out a pencil and check your work too?   So it makes him a good lion, and Mufasah was technically a bad lion. He allowed two other males to share his domain. Typically they'll kill even their own male cubs, let alone their weaker younger brother.   haha i addressed that in another comment.   Maybe he's just actually a tiger.    Woohoo!   Both statements are true.    Well I'm not in the shower anymore so obviously my argument will be inconsistent.    Yeah, it's easy to drink all the water when there isn't a source replenishing it because you're in the middle of a draught.    How are you certain of this? You're making baseless assumptions based on the disneyfication of the 'good' guys.    They drank all the water? How do animals drink all the water in a closed ecosystem? The hyenas/Scar were a scapegoat for the draught. If there wasn't a draught, hyenas and lions could have lived side by side in harmony. Scar saw this and while he was hungry for power, he at least didn't subjugate an entire species to the bad lands ( la Mufasah).   If Mufasah was such a great king, he wouldn't have allowed himself to be killed. And this is the animal kingdom we're talking about, where males constantly challenge each other for dominion of territory. Mufasah  Scar  Simba.    Too be fair, Mufasah was a bit of a prick to him.   i'm a pretty respectful guy but if you wear that you're fair game IMO... which is funny because tigers are generally at the top of their food chain (just dad joke things). i have an "only you can prevent narcissism" shirt which people take pictures of quiet often (without asking). doesn't bother me; do unto others and all that. you're never wearing tiger print pants and a tiger shirt to be inconspicuous is all I'm saying.      With socks while eating lox with a fox who has chicken pox?   i'm sorry :(   yeah he signed a consent form    I stand corrected.    One of my legs is shorter than the other by a significant amount.   This was it.   tits   a finer poet houston has not seen      I thought it was funny but this comment makes me think it wasn't supposed to be a joke.    It's called a loss-leader. No, they don't make money on *that*, but *that* makes them money in the long term (customer enjoys themselves the first time due to the promotion, customer becomes regular customer, promotion works). And now there's a picture of their yogurt on the Internet being viewed by millions of people (which admitadly is only applicable if that yogurt place isn't a franchise).    You sound like a diva, bro. "Rodgers has a radio show and made fun of my player so he's a total diva!"   My buddy was one of the coders for it.   The app, Paper.    He also was a big part of the Thunder even getting to the finals In the first place... But people forget about that because he didn't carry them to a championship as a 21 year old 6th man.    And Kevin Martin!!! Hate Kevin Martin as a player and he was traded for my favorite player (Landry) but damn if he didn't help land us the current MVP.    No one? Not even Daryl Morey?    no one knows about it  Tells us about it   (I just woke up and the light was making me squint...)  Lol bullshit dude. If you're gonna blue steel your selfie just fucking own it.         	107
 Is anything he said incorrect? He is being dumped by a few companies who are craven and gutless. I will boycott any company that drops him and hope others do the same. Yesterday Obama called illegal aliens "gang bangers". Did anyone complain? Nope.     He really doesn't care about a few lost deals. He is worth 9 billion dollars. He cares more about saving America from the insane policies of  Obama and the progressives on the Left and the Right   I support Trump because he is the only candidate that isn't afraid to speak. Every other candidate of both parties are so afraid to say anything of substance. Every word is put through a politically correct, focus grouped, mush machine.       I am buying a mattress this weekend. I am boycotting  Serta                     You only hate him because he's African American. POS racist!                              Stop censoring political news! If your Liberal views are grounded in fact then you should be able to withstand opposing views.       Anyone who thinks corporations are people is extraordinarily uneducated. Corporations are considered persons for certain legal reasons such as allowing them the ability to bring lawsuits and be sued. No educated person is suggesting that corporations are flesh and blood sentient living beings.     So you are saying that Fox News always reports the truth? Good to know   The claim that the GOP was relieved that Obamacare was OKed by the SCOTUS is false. That claim is just a Democrat Jedi mind trick                  Progressives are cancer to a nation. The revolution is coming   Actually, the Democrats renounced overt racism in the 60's. Both parties are now not racist. See we can agree on something.   Nice anecdotes.  Can you explain the democrat party's long history of actual overt racism?            Democrats supported slavery, imposed Jim Crow laws, opposed civil rights act, started the KKK, imposed segregation.  Now, tell me again why simply because the Democrats renounced overt racism in the 60's that that means the GOP is automatically racist?  Can you show what racist legislation or racist candidate the GOP supports?       Two pupils? What subject does your dog teach?   Rocket Raccoon:     Question. What if I see something that I wanna take and it belongs to someone else?  Rhomann Dey:     Then you will be arrested.   Rocket Raccoon:     But what if I want it more than the person who has it?   Rhomann Dey:     Still illegal.    Damage control for Republicans? Why? What do they have to do with the shooting? BTW: Democrat Fritz Hollings put the Confederate flag on the SC statehouse lawn  "In 1962, during Hollings' term as Governor, the Confederate battle flag was flown above the South Carolina Statehouse underneath the U.S. and state flags where it would remain for thirty-eight years. In 2000 the state legislature voted to move the flag from above the Statehouse to a Confederate soldiers' monument in front of the building."  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hollings   During the  US Civil War, soldiers used to disrupt the other side's railways by removing the rails, setting them in a camp fire, and then wrapping them around trees so they couldn't be reused. Regular fire can melt steel   Apparently the Left is anti science   When someone is against fracking I judge them to be uneducated and mock them in front of  their peers.    Russell Wilson will get hurt early in the season and be out through the playoffs. Seattle will end the season with 6 wins.            Only a typical, petty, intolerant  Leftist would downvote anyone who thought differently from them. Thanks for not disappointing me.   Enemy combatants captured on the battlefield are not political prisoners. You should read newz n stuff.                         Don't bother debating Liberal religious fundamentalists. Politics is their religion. Facts mean nothing to them. All that matters to them is ideological purity                  r/guns is never stumped. Amazing                           I think times have changed.  Today, only progressives favor gun control (yes a few GOP leaders are progressive RINOs)   Can you offer any proof of your claims?    Businesses expand when:  1. Demand increases  2. Have extra capital to diversify and enter new market with new goods or services.  3. Have extra capital to increase market share of existing market place (even if that market is in decline).  Money does not sit still. Extra profits are invested by the business itself or it is banked and the bank lends out capital to other businesses.    Have you ever owned a business? Most businesses set a percentage mark-up to sell a good or service over cost. If that mark-up is 40% then if your costs go up you raise prices to maintain that 40% mark-up. If all McDonald's and other fast food restaurants have to pay their employees nearly twice what they are being paid currently then they must raise retail prices to maintain their 40% profit margin.  Businesses will then turn to technology to perform jobs currently done by human workers.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/fast-food-robot_n_5668600.html   Businesses try to expand and  increase market share even when demand is constant. Take casinos for example. Almost every state is trying to open casinos. Is that in response to an increase in gamblers? No, it's an attempt to capture market share locally rather than allow gamblers to travel to states with existing casinos.    A higher minimum wage merely raises costs for businesses who in turn will utilize cheaper technology solutions. Businesses will also raise prices for their goods and services which will raise the prices for all products and services. What happens 2 years from now when the minimum wage is 15 per hour and a gallon of milk costs $10? Prices will catch up to wages and minimum wage workers will have the same buying power they have today.                  not every dollar spent on or by given entities have the same economic utility.   Businesses that create jobs have a greater economic utility than giving away money through public spending. One creates JOBS while the latter simply gives away money that is dependent on  continued handouts   Demand can be created by giving the poor money via government spending or it can be created by making the cost of doing business less via less taxation and less regulation which allows business to expand and hire more workers, who will then spend more.   It all comes down to who one philosophically wants to give money to to stimulate the economy: business or poor people. I favor giving it to business because they will create jobs that will remain after the stimulus has ended. Giving money to the poor via public spending ends once the stimulus money is stopped. It's the old give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach him how to fish and he eats forever scenario. Plus, in the real world, stimulus through government spending too often gives money not to the poor but to politically connected unions.     What I am saying, in the simplest way possible, is that both rely on an induced stimulus effect, either given to business or public spending. Liberals always claim stimulating the economy through tax cuts  is terrible but then they wish to stimulated the economy with public spending. This is nothing but a chicken and egg argument.    Sadly, yes... GHW Bush is a RINO. Republican In Name Only   I don't understand your point....   You forget one key element: Giving money to the poor to stimulate economic growth last only as long as the poor are receiving money. When the spigot stops so does the increased demand.      You miss the whole reason businesses exist: to make money and expand if demand and the markets support expansion. If demand is increases then business will expand to meet that demand. If a business has extra money then it usually will expand to increase existing market share or venture into new business lines and products and services. Basic econ stuff here...   Reagan and JFK proved that Supply Side economics works. Romney is a RINO and a progressive      Sorry but you need to learn basic economics. If the poor are given money then they will spend and it will stimulate the economy. When business is given money via tax breaks that money gets invested in new business ventures or expansion. Money in tax havens protects that money from taxes. That money does not just sit there. It gets invested in new businesses or expand existing ventures.   Have you ever taken an econ 101 class?         Sorry but there is no economic theory called trickle down economics. The Left uses the term as a pejorative and derogatory term for the economic theory known as Supply Side economics. The Left also uses the terms Voodoo economics and Reaganomics as similar derogatory terms.   This is basic econ 101 stuff...   "Supply side" economics= lowering tax rates and lessening regulations to give business more money to expand and hire new workers.  Liberal Keynesian economics=using tax dollars for public works and public spending in order to give people more money that will increase demand and lead business to expand and hire more workers.  See? They are the same type of stimulus programs except for who gets the big stimulating chunk of money.  If one doesn't work then the other must necessarily not work either. This is simple econ 101 stuff here....       First off, there is no such economic theory called trickle down.  Second, if top down stimulus based economics is false then the Liberal government stimulus theory must also be wrong.     Citation: read every quote, article, or news report by any liberal.

Actually, all of the gay aliens are on Uranus                              Good luck this year then   You obviously are not educated. I realize that you were told in high school that the Nazis were "right wing" but what you failed to learn back then was that the soviets called the Nazis right wing because they were to the right of them politically on the socialist spectrum.   Naziism was a combination of socialism and nationalism. Hitler was a devout socialist writer and political theorist. If you had ever taken a college level poli sci class you would have known that.    The Nazis followed the socialist belief in government control over the means of production. Control does not necessarily mean ownership. It simply means control over privately owned industry. Again, if you had ever been to college you would know that....      And why is that? The Nazis were socialists. Don't blame me because you are uneducated   Sell stuff and profit!               Obviously it is not impossible for a non elite QB to lead a team to Superbowl victory but realistically it is highly unlikely. Tannehill is competent but he doesn't scare anyone. Miami is improving steadily but until their QB is playing at an elite level I don't think they have a serious chance of winning a SB.               Russell Wilson is elite. Kaepernick definitely not   QB not at elite level. It's that simple                                 You are missing the point. The fact that the Nazis were against the Marxists or Communists does not prove they were not socialists. The nazis were against the Communists because they viewed them as political rivals (and Hitler thought the Communists had too many Jewish members).  The Nazis' socialist roots are a historical fact. Rather than continue this fruitless exchange may I offer a suggestion? The study of socialism is a fascinating pursuit. At the turn of the 20th century, many political philosophers, especially in Germany, sought out to find the perfect socialist system. Many variations of socialism were envisioned. These variations maintained the core elements of classical socialism such as government (community) control over the means of production and distribution and a government (community) centric society at the expense of personal liberty.  Do you remember the movie Monte Python and the Holy Grail? That movie featured peasants that organized themselves as "Anarcho-syndicalists". That group was another of these socialist movements that tried to create a better form of socialism.  Naziism was another such improved socialist system.  Rather than argue, please simply study this extremely interesting period in political history and learn how others tried to add to and improve socialist theory.    After another 30 second google search:  Nazis were socialists:  http://jonjayray.tripod.com/hitler.html  Socialism allows for private ownership of industry during transitional phase:  http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/           You are straying from our discussion. Returning to our discussion, the Nazis were indeed socialists and their form of socialism, as is the case with other socialist systems, there exists a period before community ownership over the means of production that  allows for private ownership of industry. This refutes your claim that the Nazis were not socialist because they allowed for some industries to remain in private hands.                   " the work is planned, financed and managed by the state; the directors of industry are appointed by the state and profits are considered the income of the state. Second, we find that a condition is defined as state capitalism (or state socialism) under which capitalist enterprises are controlled by the state. This definition is misleading, however, as there still exists under these conditions capitalism in the form of private ownership, although the owner of an enterprise is no longer the sole master, his power being restricted so long as some sort of social insurance system for the workers is accepted."   https://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm   It is truly sad that your worldview is so rigid that even when faced with historical proof, you simply can't evolve and assume dishonestly that I must be trolling you. That type of magical thinking is what children do to avoid reality.   If you are indeed a serious adult then you really owe it to yourself to learn about the real world and not the world you create in your own mind. It is a historical fact that the Naziism and Fascism were types of socialism. People sometimes get confused because the Soviets considered them as their mortal enemies and it is assumed that that meant they were opposites politically. It is often stated that the Nazis were right wing but such claims are based on a comparison  on the socialist political spectrum. In other words, the Soviets considered the Nazis as right wing to themselves.  If the Nazis were placed on a political spectrum that included all major political systems then the Nazis fall squarely far left of center in the socialist systems.  Please simply study the various socialist systems created during the turn of the 20th century. Or you can simply pretend that your worldview is complete and accurate and live in a fantasy world. Good luck    I found this simple explanation after a 30 second google search:  Intermediate phases  The period in which capitalism becomes increasingly insufficient as an economic system and immediately after the proletarian conquest of the state, an economic system that features elements of both socialism and capitalism will probably exist until both the productive forces of the economy and the cultural and social attitudes develop to a point where they satisfy the requirements for a full socialist society (one that has lost the need for monetary value, wage labor and capital accumulation). Specifically, market relations will still exist but economic units are either nationalized or re-organized into cooperatives. This transitional phase is sometimes described as "state capitalism" or "market socialism".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production   You obviously have not read Marx. Marx stated clearly  that there are several steps societies must take before Communism is perfected. They start with agrarianism, enter industrialism (capitalism), move on to  socialism (which allows for private ownership of industry under government control) and then transforms  into Communism.   If you studied Marx you would know these basic points. Perhaps you should study a little more before claiming to be a historian?   because the state places some economic restrictions on businesses  Some control does not equal total control as is required under socialism. Control does not necessarily mean out right ownership by the state, it simply means things such as the government controls access to raw materials, access to distribution, regulatory control, favoritism, , official exclusion of rivals etc etc   Hitler disliked Communists because he thought they were too internationally focused and contained too many Jewish members. As a socialist himself, Hitler considered the Communists and any other political party of any stripe as competition that had to be eliminated.   In addition, socialists are historically incredibly pro-LGBT, anti-racist, and anti-conservative. Nazi's are conservatives with an anti-LGBT, clearly racist agenda.  Wrong. Can you provide any proof of your wishful claims?  In fact, Socialists were (and still are) among the most violent anti-fascists.   Wrong again! Did you know that Fascism is also a type of socialism? You know, the part about control over the means of production and distribution and a government centric society at the expense of individual liberty? Did you also know that Mussolini was a devout socialist, was a prolific socialist author, and head of the Italian socialist party?   I am curious, have you ever taken a college level history or poly sci course?   I think i will take Marx's view over your's  	199
 This isn't legal everywhere. In some places only one person has to know they're being recorded (I'm looking at you AZ) but in others, both do for it to be legal.  Though I've always wondered where things stand when calling a company that says it's going to record the call and you record it also.   How do I plug my HDMI cable in if it's not as thick as the connector?   Or Ascension. I thought for sure that would be on there as she's a main character and all   So shots it is then   Not all deserts are bad, just the ones like those that are growing in western/central China   Just sent this article to a friend as soon as I read it. I-10 between Phoenix and Tucson is impossible sometimes   Seems to work on My G3 running 5.0.1   Can I get a version that does say "M as in Mancy?"   I always wonder who they interview for these. Do they ask easy questions like "Who was the first president of the USA?" and then if you get it wrong they take you to the rest of the survey?!   What the fuck is a "mirror?" Seriously, I have one in my bathroom and when I get to work I see whole patches that I missed while shaving   At least he still knows how to bed at this point   Well, they don't "procreate" as we experience it. This is part of why it's difficult to classify them as alive or dead. They increase in number, like something alive,, but require a host to make the copies for them, unlike something that is alive. In this way they are somewhat like parasites, except those usually increase in number through their own means and just use the host for nutrients or some other way that benefits the parasite.   What is Science doing to combat research fraud, aside from standard peer-review practices (which IMO don't seem to be working as effectively as we'd like)?  Thanks!!  	13

 I actually hope Bethesda pick him/them all up. They are traditionally a solid SP company and had Mikami for evil within, so its possible yeah?   Bethesda would be my favorite pick. They are very supportive of new and interesting visions and have the bank to back it up.   Jeeeeez, that's one amazing picture, what a tribute. Says so much ;_; he seemed like such a nice man its so great to see that warmth returned by people honouring him.   It's nice to see him being recognized en masse like this, he genuinely seemed like lovely guy and I think everyone can agree Nintendo's ability to have fun with itself and just enjoy entertaining others is an admirable trait. I'm so sad for his family, friends and coworkers, he has definitely left his mark on Nintendo. They will remember him well.  RIP   They weren't to know, but there is a lesson here about trying our best to be a happier and more upbeat gaming community. I know I've said some pretty demanding/angry things about Nintendo in the past - this was wrong to do and I've since been more positive and flexible to change/ideas.  I really enjoyed their latest conference, there was always a sense of fun and not taking things too seriously when it came to Nintendo pressers/directs, so maybe we as a community should strive to meet that standard.   Have fun, enjoy the games we love.  Peace and Love, RIP Mr. Iwata, you did an amazing job :) 3   The only way to win in war is not to play. I believe the game plays off this concept.  Lets play out the alternative, if you could choose be a "good guy" and not kill anyone wouldn't it detract from the experience?  Walk away cut to credits? A neat easter egg, but most players will take the bad route to see what happens.  Also, the game works best when you don't expect the guilt. Heaps of military games make you kill people thoughtlessly and this game is trying to trap people in that mindset and then turn it on them.    House of Cards and Fallout 3 both have this really interesting tone with the use of Snare Drum and Horns, to evoke the feel of Washington DC. Captain America Winter Soldier also does this.  I was wondering if there was a term for it?   APologies, not my video, so I didn't know what to cut out! I also felt I had to add the spoiler tag and the name of the channel. So I missed up sorry :/   He's basically a huge catalyst of events but does it all happen off screen? I thought PO would have him feature, but he wasn't in it at all, til the end, but he doesn't speak.  Am I missing something? Cos by Peace Walker snake and zero already are against each other.      You can switch between controls in the RE1 remake can't you? I swear you could.   Fantastic Interview, he's so genuine, love his work.   I'm more worried that the message, what Metal Gear says about war (i.e. criticizing it), will be ignored in any future non-Kojima MGS titles, turning it into a gung-ho military propaganda piece :/ .   Then again, I could be worrying pre-emptively, I'm sure there are other staff that "get" the series' core ideas   I played through the whole 3D series just recently and didn't notice any of that. Canon isn't what I'm after in MGS, afterall, it's more fluid to me than most universes, so I'm willing to accept extreme twists.   Why, you can't enjoy a game because of it's politics? Not that I am saying this specifically is a "political" game.   E.g. Metal Gear Solid is improved because of it's political ideas on the evils of war, for instance.   You saying I'm speaking for them :/ jeez, no. If anything I'm defending this game from being dismissed cos some people don't like outlets that happened to like the look of it. Seems unfair, and it's good to see such an interesting game come around now and then.   Is it reasonable for me to be worried that they might turn metal gear into a simplistic gung ho, jingoistic military series after he leaves?  Kojima's themes and the commentary on war (basically a systemic criticism of warfare, society and nuclear proliferation) was what made that series shine...   I see what you are saying but I believe the head dude making it is Iranian (lives in America?) I could be wrong, also those are some of the few movies with eastern people doesnt mean the portrayal will be the same because of the same actors.  I've been playing MGS recently and Venom Snake and Jack Bauer are two completely different characters being played by the same actor, as an example :)   Isn't that overly presumptuous? Why be so pessimistic?   I voted looks engaging!   I like polygon and rps they do good stuff, never heard that hashtag before.   Whats this about snake and otacon?  	22
 KitKat    Cyanoshit     **MODS MODS MODS MODS MODS**   Nah, their HQ will burn down due to the One M9s before they go bankrupt...   Paperman was pretty good.   I started with my Maths and Physics classes... Junior college not started yet.   XD. The weather here is getting gloomier due to rains :(   So, are you planning to sleep today?   Which games did you buy?   Heavy rains here... The only thing that I did today was atching a movie. How was your day?   3.44pm here...   What's the time at your place?   Yes, it looks amazing! Finally a good Pixar film after 5 years.   inside Out is releasing on the 26th in my country :( I am definitely going to see it, though!   I am very excited for Finding Dory, too!   I love Finding Nemo, too. It's just amazing.   My favourite would always be Toy Story 3, for the nostalgia. I've never seen The Road to El Dorado, though...   Yes, they did announce Incredibles 2, and I am super-excited for it! I am a huge fan of animated movies, and also a big fan of Pixar movies. Which is your favourite animated movie?   It's my favourite Science Fiction movie. I am also going to rewatch The Incredibles today.   I watched Wall-E today after many years. I love that movie.   The Heads-up notifications in Android 5.0 were a complete mess, and I hated them. The implementation in 5.1 is much better.    It's releasing on the 26 in my country :( Can't wait for it!   Which distro are you using?   Petition to add DuARTe's daughters to the list of Approved Daughters.   Yes, the JP callbacks were good...   I saw JW, but I personally thought that JP1 was much better. I am a lot more excited for Inside Out.   #BuyANexus   Redditing, and sometimes, watching animated movies.   Truth!   Most of them are incredible.   All Pixar movies.    [Yes, you can make it at home.](http://www.boldsky.com/cookery/vegetarian/break-fast/bun-maska-recipe-030880.html)   Yes, it's very tasty! If you ever come to India, you should definitely try it.   [Yes.](http://www.rajkotfoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/brun-maska.jpg)   [Someone else has the same name as you.](http://i2.cdnds.net/13/10/618x448/movies-disney-film-feature-6.jpg)   Come after your work is done!   Sure! Come to India!   Bun and butter. It's an Iranian dish found in Iranian cafs in India, and the bun has loads of butter put on it.   I am having lunch right now.   Because it's 1pm here in India.   "I go." One of the most emotional scenes in the movie.   Even I still have kept my toys in the bedroom. They were a big part of my childhood, and mean a lot to me. And after watching TS3, I don't have the heart to throw them away.   The ending is just amazing, always gets me.   Toy Story 3 and Up. Also, The Iron Giant.      I started to read Redwall by Brian Jacques.   One of the best comments!   peasant   This is not /r/AndroidMasterCard!   You need to see JP1. It's incredible!   I saw it in 3d. I found the movie to be okay. Jurassic Park was better, IMO.   What makes you think all Indians here are poor?    CC, androidcirclejerk, android.   Pixar's best? This is getting me seriously hyped!   Nothing yet.   [I collect a few of them, but they aren't close to what you've got.](http://imgur.com/rAdfOql)   The ending of TS3 always gets me.   The first 10 minutes of Up.   Thanks!   It's a Linux based distro, widely regarded as one of the easiest to use distros.   No. I am using Ubuntu.   [A screenshot of my desktop :)](http://imgur.com/1A5dY1y)   Studying :(   Spiderman 2 was awesome. Much better than the Amazing Spiderman series.   The ending of Toy Story 3.   Mine is The Incredibles.   #BuyANexus   Sheriff Woody!   Time for our beloved AutoMod to reach there.   This one's only the second flair I've ever had, so I've never had a witty flair.   I didn't really like the trailer of the good dinosaur, though.   But I heard the movie was about Finding Dory's roots, her parents and finding about her childhood... At least that's what I heard... Incredibles2 could be great as well.   Inside Out looks amazing, but it's releasing one week late in my country, on 26th :'(    Also, the script of Finding Dory looks good, too...   *cough cough* Cars 2 *cough cough*    I am super-excited for Inside Out, though.   Even the ending of TS3 was very emotional.   The first 10 minutes of the movie were too damn emotional.   Yup. I love the movie. I love almost all of Pixar's movies.   what's up?    [This](http://movies.disney.com/up)     ^^^Just ^^^kidding    Not using Chrome OS.    **MAWDS!**   The IMEI sticker should be removed immediately. The no. is not for others to see.   Thanks!   Will try to do at least 20 today!   Praise DuARTe!   The Indominus Rex is funded by Verizon and it also has a "Samsung Innovation Center".   Thanks! And I don't think I would ever be able to do 120 Push-ups in a day.   I cycled almost 8km yesterday for the first time! Feeling great :)   I never got into gaming...   Almost all of them.   The Iron Giant?   The Indominus Rex shown in the movie is also funded by Verizon.   No... I didn't see such things...   Flappy Bird.   Goa, India. Yes, it was an enjoyable experience!   Not an early bird, not a night owl, as it's 6pm here :P   Hi, what's going on?   India.   Asia, as I'm an Asian :)   Truth!   What about Inside Out?   I just had rice for dinner.   [Here.](http://imgur.com/x0PGxSi) Sorry for the delay!   In going out for half an hour, I will be back soon and will surely upload one.   Yes, wait... I'll have to upload one. But they're not good :P   Yes, wait... I'll have to upload one. But they're not good :P   Cartoons :)   I've been fine, I started a bit of drawing recently  :)   Hi, missed your panda drawings!   Me too!   Charizard :D   Loving Pokemon!   /j      #BuyANexus   Yeah, right. :(   What right do they have to say that?   Anyway, I won't be returning to the class.

 She might be ugly.   Absolutely, as long as there was a second girl involved.   The autism is posting screencaps from videogames saying things that are blatantly untrue in an attempt to make themselves feel less sad over the death of a man who they've never met.      No, you wanted karma.   This is retarded. Yes, technically bodies decompose and release their chemicals into the air. However, for it to 'scatter across the cosmos' it would have to leave Earth in the first place, and it won't. And even if it does... so what. It's just a bunch of chemicals. It's no more meaningful than one of his broken nails decomposing to feed a plant.  And he's definitely not watching over us, that's just retarded. He's a fucking corpse in the ground and his neurons stopped firing.   So is the black one a chick or a guy?   Have you ever banged two girls at once?   Who was the guy who made it through with a Svengali Deck?     Do you have to tell a producer back stage how your trick is done before showing it to P T? Or can you just claim they're wrong with no one to call you out on it?   That's plenty of time tbh. Pick any nearby building that looks like it would have a back exit. Take a few seconds to get inside. Hulk had no idea which one you went into. You're already in a back alleyway by the time he even searches one building       haha imagine if he went to hell though and every time he tried to program devils put things in his butt :-/ that would be sad!!      Two products flop and he has to take a pay cut to please the board of directors. Yes, what a great 'innovator'.   lol   This would be a successful TIL a week ago.   Very often.  In fact, I'd say in most companies the CEO has industry experience.  Most of the big name CEOs that inherited their wealth or cross sell to industries they know nothing about are in the minority. There's are thousands upon thousands of companies around the world and most would hire CEOs that know what they're doing.   Because he's dead?   Where'd he go?   It was the first game that used it, perhaps it's ironed out the problems since then.   Each sperm is different (some combination of 50% of the fathers DNA). Otherwise, siblings variance would be determined solely by the mother.   DON'T JUDGE ME   This isn't a 'theory', it's just an idea.   I think it's fair enough to say that delaying sex for 10 minutes will cause a different child to be born. Imagine the semen would have changed position (and that's just one variable) and therefore a completely different set of sperm would have survived and a completely different one from that set would have fertilised the egg.    Lol, no animal is "meant" to be ridden by any other animal.  The one exception being your mother.   Unless there person is in the room with you and you mean mimicking them in real time, in which case I'd just say you're "copying" them.   Impersonation I suppose. Impression generally refers to mimicry for entertainment, whereas impersonation is much broader.   So there's a database our there that knows about my fetish for naked females???         That's the point of the thread bro   Imagine if Heath Ledger's performance wasn't quite as good. The script is kind of ass.   I don't think he was a sociopath, just didn't know how to innovate Nintendo's franchises   Pretty much this. Any movie can cure boredom if you're in the mood for that particular type of movie.   I don't think your analogy holds up since we're yet to see a general with supernatural powers. I think if we did, he'd definitely be remembered.  Hell, we still remember Jesus.   Yup, went quite young. This is all well and good news, but unless Nintendo seriously attempts to capitalise on his death and take the opportunity to innovate instead of rehashing, it will probably all be for naught. Let's hope the next CEO isn't quite so stuck in the past.   "HUGH HUGH HUGH HUGH HUGH"  Holy shit that was awkward.  Honestly, was it performance art? I feel like it deserves its own post.   Sorry pumpkin, how much time do you need to mourn before I can ask this question?   If everyone laughed it wouldn't be cringe.  If no one laughed it and sat there silently it is cringe.  It's not the behaviour that makes something cringey per se, but the reaction it illicits and knowing what it might feel like to be in that persons shoes.   What the fuck is wrong with you people, it's just some dude. I'm genuinely curious to know where Nintendo is going to head and I thought this board would be full of insights.   It's a legitimate question. It's not like his family is reading this. And people die all the time, I don't need to care everytime it happens.         Do we really need a scan of Lois referring to Clark Kent as Clark Kent and Superman as Superman?   Decent joke but predicted the punchline almost immediately. Could use some retooling   Banned.   Banned.   Looks cool, doesn't make the movie any less of a boring action movie though    Unlikely   Yeah, let's enable fat fucks!   What about The Joker?   Hitler dud nothing wrong   Awful    These are pretty clever, let me try!  What's brown and looks like a piece of shit?  A black person   I think you missed part of your story. Why were the police there? Where was your dad? Was your mom fucking the other cops or something haha   The complaint is variety, not realism.   Seems like horizontally is almost always better, and feels more comfortable too since you can stabilise it with two hands more naturally.   Ah, the wrong one!   I don't understand why actresses wear makeup  For even more visual stimulation.    FPH literally couldn't say anything except found the fatty  In seriousness, what do you expect them to say?   Unlike the members of that audience.   I'm sure he's keeping his numbers up too   Just make his abilities use Anti-mana   Lol it's pretty funny when you realise that Clark Kent and Superman are played by the same actor    But why    Who says the AI is operating as intended?   Dank memes.   Yes!   What about Lambert? Can you still play cards with him if you spare Karadin?   Probably as simple as it's easier to lie on the Internet then for the events to have occurred. Then, of course, even when the events are based on real facts - people embellish those in real life where they CAN be contradicted, so it's almost definitely happening with even the mostly true Internet stories.   They weren't working properly?   You missed   Me too.      It's deliberate   Better than 50k a month alimony.      Such as?   Yeah, with them all telling him his new ideas are wrong. That guy was chasing dead ends at the end of his life   That movie was my first date with my now ex. We just broke up. Feels time   I'm going to take the unpopular opinion and say that he's liked because it's popular to like him. People who don't like him get downvoted anyway so you don't even see the occasional comments from people who don't find him funny.  The circlejerk didn't even start until Zombieland anyway, which pretty forced the opinion that Bill Murray is amazing on the audience.   The Internet is afraid of me... I have seen its true face. Reddit are extended gutters and the gutters are full of year old memes and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their Pepes and feels guys will foam up about their waists and all the memeologists and danklords will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll look down and go (   )   I'm Mormon    While I agree that it would be difficult to regulate  It really isn't. At least not in Australia.   It's not entirely fair to compare the effects of legalising prostitution in one country to another, BUT, in the first world countries where it is legal, the work conditions actually seem pretty good and it doesn't seem like anyone is being taken advantage of.  Completely legal in my country and I have a friend who is a friend with a prostitute and says she loves her job and so do her coworkers.   Try asking on /r/askhistorians  They'll probably give you a complete rundown on the evolution of date formatting.   I'm certainly not because I don't give a shit.   Probably because of the theme. We've seen Batman vs Anarchistic villains a dozen times by now.  This is the first live action film to show Batman trying to take down another hero, and a hero significantly more powerful then him. It's Batman vs a God. It's Batman doing what he believes is right and, for once, might actually clash with the audiences views.   Damn that car is shiny.   You will  Literally spoilers in the trailer. I'm not even bothering to see the movie now.   I thought the same thing when I read the title.  Know what I did next? This might shock you.  I READ THE FUCKING ARTICLE. Literally the first paragraph doofus.   Those movies were released a year apart. It's kind of difficult to say that superhero films where on the brink of oblivion and the success teetered on Blade. I'm pretty sure even if Blade bombed people would still be interested in whatever superhero movie came after that.  I don't think a small handful of bombs have ever killed an entire genre.   Just a quick one today folks. I was going through my daily watching of The Dark Knight Rises and noticed something in the end credits. If you look closely at the center of the screen, eventually you will see some white characters appear against the black backdrop. I took a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8nsconP.png) on youtube to assist.  If you can make out the white characters, it appears to say something along the lines of "Executive Producers - Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan"  I believe this is a possible hint towards the identity of two of the executive producers who worked on the movie, one of which is Michael E. Uslan. It's possible that this Benjamin Melniker is also an executive producer but I haven't quite finished analysing that part of the text.  And before anyone asks how I managed to notice such a detail, it's because I have a PhD in film studies (currently doing my thesis on The Dark Knight Rises, specifically about Batman's identity - which I believe to be Bruce Wayne).   Free *weekly* **expansions?**  Not even CD Projekt is this generous.   I don't hate movies because of plotholes.   I didn't make assumptions. I admit complete ignorance one how is friends perceive him. I offered potential alternatives - not to state that those are true, but   Me: ***Maybe*** they like it (the alternative being that maybe they don't, I have no idea).  You: You **should** reevaluate your definition of personal space. I'm **sure** you've made them uncomfortable and didn't even realize there, Rico.  In my circle, this kind of interaction is pretty normal and is just as often the girls getting close and playful as the guys.  Sometimes I feel like Reddit is full of prudes.   Completely agree. I don't feel like side quests or exploration are even a distraction like I do with most games, they feel worth doing. I didn't think they could top The Witcher 2 so well, but this game blows it out of the water. Not to mention [spoiler](#s "Bruce Wayne is Batman").   Bruce Wayne is Batman.   Yes.  They don't care. The audience doesn't care/know.   I'm sick of seeing this comment.   Damn Yeezy is beautiful.   Seriously what century are we living in, your assumption is that he is always the one getting 'handsy' and they are all secretly awkward. Maybe they like it? Maybe they're handsy back? Maybe that's just normal in his circle?   Eh, I'm the same with female friends as bigfatty but they initiate it as much as me. Actually, probably more, since I'm secretly crushing on half of them and deliberately 'hold back' so my girlfriend doesn't know.   One bite? Prick   Can be stories, pics, whatever   Did your son have any rare Pepes I can have? If you don't want them of course   Nice   A) He is omnipotent. He could have done it in one day, so why did He take seven (plus rest???).  B) Days didn't exist before the Earth was created anyway so it doesn't even make sense.

[Spoiler](#s "His plans nearly come to fruition")  [Spoiler](#s "His cloud burst is beaten almost immediately after he launched it. He gave civilians enough warning to leave the city when he could have literally had innocents (instead of thugs) clawing eachothers eyes out.

Not that Scarecrow could have known, but it didn't.")  [Spoiler](#s "The game does a good job of tricking you into thinking Scarecrow's plan was a lot closer to being successful then it ever was, but when you realise how small the timeframe is, you realise that every step of his plan was thwarted within an hour of him attempting to go through with it.")   Are tags stored on your PC or does RES store them on their servers? Ie. if I moved to a new computer, would my tags carry over?   Let's say I have 20% Igni intensity on one sword and 10% Igni on another, do I get 30% all up?   Have you got a source for this, or is this just speculation?   Yes, my ex-girlfriend. I mostly drink water and we're both reasonably fit, but she drinks probably 3-4 diet soft drinks a week.   I started a Signs based build because I didn't realise how easy it was to replenish potions (thought I'd be using them too sparingly to bother putting points in that tree). However, after realising their are restored by alcohol I've been using them a lot and I'm thinking of respecing into an Alchemy build. I don't like bombs, so I'm thinking of doing the following build:  http://www.gosunoob.com/witcher-3/skill-calculator/?combat=115 sign=153 alchemy=115_125_143_225_252_323_345_415 general=321  Some explanation: -Deliberately didn't max some skills -Muscle Memory to 5/5 (just for a bit of extra damage) -Delusion to 3/3 (just for a bit of a boost of stamina + dialogue options) -Not interested in using bombs, I'd rather stick to a signs build if bombs are necessary for an Alchemy build to work -Would place Synergy with a strong red mutagen -Rage management to help keep Quen up -Skipped delayed recovery as potions should already last a long time -Refreshment I'm on the fence about as Swallow already will last a long time with this build -Frenzy just sounds obnoxious to use, so I skipped it -Oils seems good all round, but I'm skipping the last skill because I feel like my adrenaline will be used for the occasional sign due to my playstyle. -My remaining two slots would likely go to a point or two in a sign skill, or maybe some of the yellow skills, but honestly, I don't know if I'm liking to reach this level on a single playthrough due to how slow leveling is.   She kept the lipstick at the end. Was it a 'joke' that she was offering lipstick? Was there any intent to actually give them to him?      Are tags stored locally?   But Charlie likes Ghouls.

If not, (and the fridge isn't nice), your cheapest bet is getting a cheap padlock hinge and a padlock and putting it on your main fridge. Much cheaper than buying a minifridge or a safe. Just get one that only requires small screws so you're not drilling through the door.  Seems a little strange, but seriously, your friend sounds like a prick.

If it's a 'visual representation', there is nothing special about Superman flying in one direction around the Earth to allow him to go forward in time vs back in time, yet it syncs perfectly with the movement of the Earth (the visual representation).  This makes no sense, unless Superman knew an audience was watching and wanted to sync his spinning with the Earth's visual representation for some reason.   Is this still happening?  	163

We all jumped in the truck and drove off as fast as possible. She didn't chase the truck far, and went back to her overly curious baby.  Another trip, this with my family, we were kayaking in a river on the Pacific side of Costa Rica. My grandmother got sun block in her eyes, and had to be driven miles back to a local doctor half way through. Almost at the end of the ride, in crocodile infested waters, my kayak capsized. I jumped back in quick, but the thought still bothers me.   "He may ignore you for days to play W.O.W. and get drunk, stoned, and nodded out by himself.

Inexperienced dog owners should not get these breeds, spitz-like or wolf like, in almost any climate, especially warmer. They have high maintenance grooming requirements and need frequent exercising. They are prone to animal and small children aggressive behavior if not properly trained.

Some of the best breeders for siberian huskies live in San Juan Capistrano, CA. They get groomed regularly, are constantly hydrated, and exercise daily.

I read this in a scally london accent.   Dachshunds, corgis, basset hounds, chihuahuas, shibu inus, they all make the list of cry babies and nightmares.  Huskies, which are my favorite breed (my dad used to breed them, and they currently have one), are bad. I've had every bodily fluid on me from a husky. They are wild, dramatic, territorial, touchy, judgmental, and of all the dogs to groom, they are my favorite. It's like an adrenaline rush, will I die? Will I get mauled? Will I get bit? Or will I get cuddles? Who knows hahaha   Edit: one of my favorite haircuts to do are schnauzers and wheaton terriers. Both difficult dogs to deal with at times.

The hair usually grows back, but after a few repeated 'summer time' clips, will never look the same. These breeds were meant to have long coats. Blowing out the undercoat with a force dryer (which your groomer can do) or just providing some routine good ole' brushing should do the trick! Plus, it'll get rid of all that shedding. (Shaving a dog won't, it will just make the shedding hairs smaller)  EDIT: I've also have owned siberian huskies my entire life.

What i tell my clients? Brush the dog once to twice a week, for your dog I might suggest a slicker brush, Amazon has a wonderful one called Miracle Brush, I love it. For dogs that shed, horse racks are good or furminators, though I'm careful with those as they cause brush burn.  Bathing once a month or every 6 weeks helps with smell, making sure the dog is 100% dry after each time they get wet will ensure a good smelling dog. Mold occurs when an undried dog is allowed to naturally air dry.  Brushing would also deal with avoiding mats and plant material in the fur. Also, if you walk in to a grooming salon, they will quickly spot shave mats out for a low, low fee, and it's usually a walk in service, no appointment needed.  Double coated dogs have two coats, a fluffy under coat, and a coarse top coat. The common misconception is that shaving a dog cools them in the summer. This is false. The natural hair actually protects from the sun, and when thoroughly brushed out, allows air to naturally channel through the hair follicles. A common example I give is a german shepherd. When you shave a german shepherd, the fluffy undercoat is typically trapped, creating a webbing affect. As the top coat attempts to grow out, the bottom coat prevents it in certain areas, giving that choppy appearance your pup has. This can also lead to acne, over heating, sun burn, and increased condensed undercoat for micro-organisms to thrive in.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I love helping fellow dog owners out.   I could tell she gets shaved regularly. I don't suggest it for most double coated dogs, but if the client already does it, no point in not doing it.

Like you sort of said, these are carefully formed flocks, split repetitively to perfect dimensions, allowed to grow out.  If you want to.... not have those... you shave the dog. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not try to remove matting this heavy with a brush or demating tools. That's cruel and causes a lot of pain to the dog.  Your dog has severe matting? Bring them to the groomer or the vet to be shaved down. Then, brush your dog 1-2 times a week.   thats why owners typically do it themselves.   So... Shareholders  the only planet we have   Cool.   Yea I googled corded havanese, I just can't pull up the pictures on my phone. Tons.  These dogs with 'Hair' not coat, create oils that can be just great for cording. Though, they can also be nightmare for just normal grooming. I see matted havaneses, poodles, malteses, Shih tzus, way way way way too often. They look like someone chopped off 70% of Bob Marley's dreads an left him outside on a hobo budget. That dog is getting stripped down by either me or a vet. I'm in the dematting is animal cruelty camp. But I digress.   Also the poodle and the havanese. People seem to forget their history of cording.   I believe my link has some great resources on that subject, but I believe you are correct. Also protection from the elements up in the Italian Alps.   Yeah I mean it takes a long time for that coat to dry. An Alaskan malamute takes me about an hour. Sometimes longer. A collie can take like 2 hours. Worked on the great great great grandson of lassie the other day. Now take those coat densities, and put them in a dread. Now multiply that dread by like 500. You now have an insane amount of drying to complete.   So as a groomer, I can comment on this...  Bathe them a few times a year. Like 4-6. Each bathing session takes a total of about 12-14 hours (drying included in that). Each flock must be soaped and dried individually for best result.   If one of the flocks starts to smell of mildew (like an old tent) my suggestion would be to take off that specific flock, though I know groomers that might use tar and sulfur shampoo, a vinegar 10:1 solution, or some Nature's Miracle solution.  Edit: Since a lot of people are asking about the drying process, I found a vet's blog about his Pulis, another corded breed. Here's some of his tips.   The length of time he needs to stay in the dryer will depend on the form of the cords - how densely each cord is packed. Never use heat for drying a Puli. Being strong willed, a Puli is capable of objecting so strenuously to being mistaken for a lobster that he fusses himself into heat stroke, not from the heat of the dryer as much as the heat of his frustration. The safest and most comfortable dryer is as follows:  Build a platform tall enough to set a large (18") high velocity fan underneath. Obtain 2 fans with a lifetime guarantee - like a Patton fan - and set one underneath pointing straight up. (See why you want that guarantee?) Place your dogs cage, which should be of the small mesh construction, upside down (if necessary) over a hole cut in the top of the platform, just a bit smaller than the dimensions of the cage. Upside down the pan can be left out without the Puli falling through the cracks! Place the Puli in the cage and position the second fan in front and at the same level as the cage. Turn on both fans, and retreat from earshot for the appropriate number of hours. Dont worry about the Puli in this arrangement if the crate is secure on top of the stand and the stand is securely built. I usually do this before bedtime, and leave him in overnight. This is a sufficient length of time to dry most dogs, at least if the wringing and sweatshirting have proceeded as above, and hes usually the most comfortable one in the house; a breeze in his face, white noise, the cage hes used to sleeping in anyway (well, in some cases). If its cool where he is add a commercial dryer on top to slightly warm the air - thats all it will do with an open wire crate and two fans. You really wont endanger your dog with this setup.  You definitely do have to rig up something like this if you are going to keep your Puli in a full corded coat. You may be able to tolerate the smell of your darling if he isnt completely dry, but believe me, no one else will and you will be guilty of smearing the reputation of the whole breed! Could you live with that knowledge? If you dont dry him thoroughly, in 2 or 3 days, bacteria will bloom inside the warm, damp centers of the cords, and your Puli will reek. Itll be much worse than he smelled before the effort and agony of the bath. After youve removed your guy from the drying cage, check him again in a few hours to see if capillary action has pulled moisture out to the dry outer layers from still wet inner layers. If so, in again for another 3 hours or so. He hates it when he reeks and people avoid him, and you will pay for it!

Simpson murder trial provided us with a snapshot of a system that is heavily biased towards money -- even more so than race. Without his Dream Team of lawyers, O.J. would have been convicted of murder within a matter of weeks. Indeed, trial lawyers everywhere conceded that death sentences have been handed out on lesser evidence. The counterpoint to this observation is the true-life movie Dead Man Walking. In the movie, white death-row inmate Matthew Poncelet tells Sister Helen Prejean: "There ain't no money on death row."    The rich have several important, if not decisive, advantages when it comes to handling the legal justice system. They can afford bail, which allows them to conduct their own investigations and prepare for trial. They can afford better attorneys (by itself an enormous edge), better expert witnesses, better private detectives, better alibis. In fact, rich corporations or individuals often threaten to put up such a huge legal battle that courts often seek to plea bargain away or even dismiss the charges.    There are two ways that sentencing is biased against the poor. First, the rich either write or lobby for the very laws that purport to oversee their behavior. Harsh sentences for the poor are softened whenever legislators write them for the rich, even though their crimes may be many times greater. Second, judges have shown themselves reluctant to make common criminals out of the community's best and finest. Both of these biases have created wide disparities in sentencing. For example, millionaire Jack Clark received no fine and only one year in jail for cheating stockholders out of $200 million. Yet in the same courthouse, a minimum wage worker who had stolen $5,000 received four years in prison -- that is, 160,000 times the punishment. (13)    A study of federal and state courts found that the poor were not only found guilty more often, but that they were not recommended for probation 27 percent of the time, compared to 16 percent for the upper classes. The poor were also not given suspended sentences 23 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for the upper classes.     "Circle-jerk" or not, you live in a fairy tale land. Economic disparity in jail sentencing is a thing.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Curtis_Johnson#Criminal_conviction  Also S. Curtis Johnson, of the Johnson Family. (Johnson Johnson, S.C.

I've heard this is due to marketing by the major alcohol manufacturers, which makes sense looking at ads at Pride events, or even queer tv programing on LOGO.  Have you noticed this trend as well? What about us as a people make us so susceptible to marketing of an addictive nature? Are there counter forces beginning to push against this trend?   I'm breaking that mustache trimming kit, and using the schnapps and scotch guard to blow the place to high heaven (sparking metal and what not).   I'm swimming in that moat (cause, whatever, whatever, I do what I want.... and piranhas respond to urine, fear, and blood, so don't do those things).

I have heard a lot of about the russian bloggers, bots, propagandists, scoring the web for topics on the Ukraine/Russia issue going on (my intense condolences by the way, my prayers have been going out for those suffering these atrocities).   I was wondering if you believe any of this misinformation is going the other way as well? Ukrainian nationalist in comment sections on news articles marking up facts, etc.  Another question, I've heard of people staying in the worst hit of cities, even after bombings and rocket fire, looting and crime, still staying in their home towns, sometimes even unable to physically leave due to old age, or simply attachment to the towns themselves. When I heard this, I thought the Ukranian government would be making mandatory evacuations, and providing shelter to those displaced (e.g. refugee camps). Are people being helped leaving their towns? Should they leave, and if they aren't, why, other than reasons being speculated?

    It's a little weird the first time or two, but what isn't? One of the best ways to communicate sexually is to share masturbation techniques. It shows how you like yourself to be touched and loved, and the person that you care about can learn that from watching you.   I would and have done it.         Because art?    Look up OAT (Off Axis Torque) on your Google machine. That's kinda what it sounds like to me.               Are you kidding? Kathleen Turner as horny godzilla woman was amazing! I loved her character. I see what you mean about too much Runkel, but I loved Turners heavybreathing ass!    Such an excellent series. I waited far too long to watch this. The seasonal guest stars are amazing, the writing is clever, love this series.  Except for the end. Really? Really? I won't ruin it, but just really?   Depends on how much of the bartenders time you took. Busy bar, and all the tender did for me is get the beer and open it? Twothree bucks is fine. Slower night, and I sit at the bar and the tender chats with me? I'll tip a couple more dollhairs for the company.            My dad's dad died in WWII, but my mom's dad was around when I was a young man.  He was also a WWII vet, came home and opened a shop that sold and repaired volkswagens. Eventually, as he and grandma got older, the shop got to be too much and he sold it.  Not one to sit on his ass doing nothing, he looked for another line of work. He got hired on at our local Veterans hospital as a special ambulance driver. (He transported special cases from hospital to hospital, met organ donations at the airport, occasionally bringing a dead vet back home to their family.)   He mainly worked in between Atlanta and St Petersburg, and over time, he started spending more and more time away. I was only twelve or so when this started but I remember conversations my mom and her mom would have about him being gone so long. They said it was part of his job...he would stay in Atlanta until they needed him to drive to St Pete and then he would be home again for awhile.  Eventually, the time away got to be more and more significant, and then he just didn't come home.  The whole family was very hushhush about it, I don't remember hearing much....until the shit hit the fan.  After much pressure from my Mom, my grandma finally called up the vets hospital in Atlanta to find out what had happened to her husband. I wasn't there for the phone call, but I like to imagine the very long pause, and then whoever she was talking to asking exactly who wanted to know. (I've heard all this second hand) When she explained that she was his wife, she was put on hold. Eventually someone else picked up the phone and started giving her hell for making a call like this, and how inappropriate it was, and how the Veterans Hospital didn't appreciate jokes.  Finally, my grandmother was told that her husband had passed away about eight months prior.  The reason they were so incensed at her calling....  My grandfathers wife worked at the Veterans Hospital as a nurse, and was well known and liked.  Yep, my grandfather had two complete families. Neither knew of the other until he passed. We (on our side) have reached out to them (on her side) and have made some connections. I'm excited to have so many new family members!  Short aside; I remember hearing a conversation between my mom and my grandma about maybe going up to Atlanta to meet the family, or at least visit the gravesite, and grandma was fairly blase about the whole thing...it really didn't seem to bother her. After my mom pressured her, she finally broke down and showed a little anger, the first time I'd ever seen real strong emotion from her.  Her anger wasn't about the second family. Or the lies. Or the time apart. Or anything that really mattered.  She was furious that his other wife was black. (We're not)  I'm sorry I can't share a funny or uplifting story about a grandpa for you, but maybe this one made you smile, and hopefully your PopPop had a long and eventful life full of great stories.

I have had about equal sexual encounters; both brief and in LTR. As long as I have been honest with myself and my partner, I never felt any negativity about any situations, and I don't think that you should either. But each man has to explore his own emotions, and come to terms with what he feels. (Not with what he should feel.)   Thank you for sharing your story. We need more like you to stand up and point out the problem. We're at a tipping point right now, where I think we can still save the idea of community policing as a positive thing, but if we wait too long, it may be too late to ever have the communities trust the police that try to keep them safe.         Those were dark days indeed.   Friends with older brothers who had access to Playboy...or the occasional Hustler. Game changer right there.

Also, hard to believe now, but when you couldn't get access to nekkid girls, you'd wank to anything close. Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, National Geographic, underwear ads in the JCPenny circular; back in my day you just had to make do with what you had.       I don't think the author was trying to shame anyone for valid safety decision making...I do try to let our kids have as much freedom as I can stand, but that's only because I have canvassed the neighborhood, I know most of the folks here, quiet roads, no open bodies of water, checked the child molester websites, tested the childrens safety knowledge, set strict limits on wandering, and remove permissions when rules are broken. The goal is to keep our children safe, but not to let our need for safety override their need for space, when said space is attainable and safe. I hope no one here is feeling shamed for making right decisions for their children.   No judgement here....but the article points out an interesting phenomena...our children are denied the freedom that we (most of us) had in a more dangerous world, and I agree with the author in that it may leave our children without valuable learning, memories, and experimentation. It's an op-ed piece, and it is designed to change peoples minds, not to judge decisions that they have made.   Yeah, I was riding my bike about 10-15 minutes or so by grade 4.   Go. Always.  There is this strange fascination with making sure that our kids are at school everyday...like that's the only way to learn anything. Your child won't fall behind because you guys spent three days on vacation. The experience is part of the learning process, as well. (My wife and I often argue about how much time I want to keep the kids out of school. If there is a rocket launch, or a guest speaker at the library, or an art show, or a guided nature walk....these things seem more valuable to me than organized schooling....saying all this with the assumption that your child is a good student and caught up.)  GO.          Be safe, OP   Hate that shit, man. Feels. *fistbump, buys shots.  People like that make the rest of look stupid.   Great question.  Short answer: Yes, completely safe, assuming the food was handled correctly before cooking.  Here's why. Potentially hazardous foods (like, raw meats, poultry, and eggs) have the potential to harbor harmful levels of microorganisms when handled incorrectly. (They're already present in our food) We can kill most, if not all, these microorganisms in our food with the application of heat, cooking it. So what happens when you get raw egg on your spatula? You use that same spatula to stir the eggs, while heat is being applied, and to flip those eggs, while heat is being applied, and to serve the eggs, while heat is still being applied, or ambient heat is still present. Anything present on that spatula has been cooked along with the product being cooked. So, completely safe, because of safe temperature management. But, consider this. You pull out your ground beef from the fridge early because it is still slightly frozen. It sits on your counter for a few hours before cooking. You use the fork to cook and serve the ground beef. You set the fork on the counter and then enjoy your yummy tacos. A few hours later, wanting a little desert, you get your flan out of the fridge, and not thinking about it, use the fork you set on the counter to eat the flan. That has the possibility of getting you sick, because of poor time management.  Not all the microorganisms get killed by cooking; instead, consider cooking food, to appropriate temperatures, a way of ensuring that there is a safe level of microorganisms in your food (i.e. at a level that your body's defenses aren't overwhelmed). While the fork sits on the counter at room temperature, microorganisms are growing. More means a higher likelihood of a negative reaction to those microorganisms.  In these examples, it's mostly just a matter of time. While cooking your eggs, you could totally just lick the raw eggs of your fingers, and be fairly confident in that not putting you in danger. Not washing your hands after touching raw eggs, and giving those microorganisms enough time to reproduce turns your hand into Typhoid Mary, infecting everything it comes in contact with.   I've always found GOP Women in Congress revolting! Hahahaha...  But seriously, two things here. Can't believe that we're still going on about this whole thing, and second, it's interesting that the GOP (revolting) women (seriously, have you even seen any of them? Gross) are splitting, not because of these draconian laws, but because they might lose votes? Maybe that should tell you something about the nonsense you are trying to pass.             Six hours at room temp? And it wasn't frozen? Toss it. Just not safe. If it was not chicken, then maybe you could work with it, but fuck salmonellosis.   Hadn't seen that one. Have you seen *Frozen Lincoln Saw Her Snatch*? A very cold car falls in love with one women's vagina after peeking through her window.      Check out the site, people aren't posting giant stories of their lives. Just one or two lines sometimes, mentioning what they had for lunch, or asking a question about their target language. Great real world practice, though from a spanish students POV, a bit frustrating. I'll post something, be told I did a great job by someone from Mexico, and then corrected heavily by someone from Argentina, and then a user from Spain corrects him...lol.   Love working the two together. For more advanced learning, also check out fluentu.com, a video based learning site. Watch youtube videos in spanish while reading subtitles and then study words and phrases you've learned. Also like lang-8.com, a sort of social media platform where you post in your target language and native speakers come and correct you and engage you in conversation. In return, you correct students trying to learn your native language.   The only way that I find motivation to learn is to find a way to apply that learning in the real world. I've been successful at learning spanish because I have real world friends that I can practice with. I share trivia on some message boards online, and with friends over drinks. Without real world applications it does become an exercise in futility.   Depends on the GC type and restaurant policy.  VISA (and other) backed cards are treated like debit cards and can be tipped off of.  Restaurant cards (branded, without VISA (or other) backing) are subject to individual policy.

We both believe that just because the roller coaster shut down, you don't close the amusement park.   This is a hard thing to learn if it doesn't come naturally. I'm lucky enough to just sort of "get it"...but I've worked with people before that didn't have natural timing.  The answer is planning and practice. Plan your meals (or work from recipes) and timeline your meal. You need x amount of time for rice to cook, x amount of time to prep meat, x amount of time to bake bread, etc. Plan backwards from mealtime. Meal is at x o'clock, then rice has to be started at x-20 minutes. Cook time + prep time on your entree is 60 minutes, then start the prep at x-60 minutes. Put it on paper, and stick to it.  Then practice practice practice. I still have an occasion or two where I mess up the timing, but I have enough practice time in the kitchen that I can adapt.   Hard to say without actually being in the kitchen, or at least with more info. If the chicken was put in late, and not time abused at that point, then microing could bring everything into safe temp and kill any baddies floating about. But as someone mentioned above, if microorganisms are sufficiently present, cooking off an killing them solves only part of the problem, and could create more of one. The microorganisms leave behind toxins that are not temperature sensitive.   Interesting fact about pork and trichinosis...the reason most people still think pork has to be nearly incinerated to be considered safe. Trich (a parasitic worm larvae) was rampant in the marketplace well into the 70's. Food scientists investigating Trich discovered that it's lifecycle needed a pig to consume feces (or offal) from pigs infected already. Slop feeding of hogs was immediately outlawed for market hogs, and by the late 80's, Trich was almost completly removed from the marketplace. Newest update from USDOH/USDA have temps as low as 140f for cuts, and 135f for roasts. I personally enjoy thick center cut chops at a nice medium rare. Delicious!   I didn't want to get into anatoxins and food intoxification! I thought we'd keep it simple. I wonder with the resurgence of the crockpot's popularity if maybe we'd all be served well by paying a little closer attention to the safety of the food we're serving.   Someone else mentioned the sliding scale. It's a little different when sous-vide and hydroemersion cooking. Used as a point of reference, and even at long time, low temp cooks, the four hour benchmark applies and OP's chicken should have appeared cooked.   Lol. Yep. Consider this, how many times have you had a little "24 hour bug"? The squirts and a bit of a tummy ache? That was food poisoning at low levels, more than likely. Being young and assumedly healthy, your body and your friends can take it. That same dish that might make you just a little sick, or not effect you at all could cause serious problems for an elderly person or someone with a weakened immune system.   Absolutely correct. Assuming no time or temp abuse happened beforehand. Within reasonable consideration you can "cook out" any mistakes. Even at low temp cooks though poultry would fully cook and appear white throughout (excluding any other ingredients that could color ingredients).   Couple of things about the four-hour benchmark. First, it's cumulative. Any time that chicken spends in the danger zone has to be considered part of that four hour window. If you leave your chicken on the counter to thaw for an hour, you would want it to hit a safe serving temp of 165f within THREE hours...if you start considering prep time, cook time, thaw time, you can see that working with poultry, especially chicken is serious business. As for once a dish is done, most crocks have a low temp or holding temp. That will usually keep it at or near a hot enough temp to be safe for as long as the crock is holding it hot. Personally I wouldn't let my crockdish set out for longer than about an hour to cool, and I consider that as part of my four hour window.   Slightly safer. With chicken, you can't be too safe. Other meats are safer. It's safe to assume that any market chicken is already contaminated with some level of Salmonella.  Food, to be considered potentially hazardous has to have certain characteristics. FATTOM. Food for the microorganism, a friendly acidity level, time to pass, within the temperature danger zone, oxygen (for most microorganisms, there are some anerobic dangers, like botulism) and moisture. Marinating with a vinegary marinade can change the acidity levels, but again with chicken, probably not enough to get me to try chicken that was served medium rare or spent six hours in the danger zone.   Sure. Crash course food safety here.  Some foods are potentially hazardous. Meaning that given the right conditions could harbor microorganisms that they could get you very sick.   One of the right conditions is temperature. It is safe to store food below 41 degrees f or over 140 degrees f. These temperatures inhibit the growth of potentially hazardous microorganisms.  Within that temperature range (41 to 140 degrees f) exists the optimum temperatures that encourage microorganism growth.  The other thing that food needs to encourage microorganism growth is time. The general rule is that if food spends a total four hours within the temperature danger zone, then that food is no longer safe for human consumption, and should not be eaten.  So, in the slow cooking example here, if the chicken had not reached 165 degrees f (the minimum internal temperature for chicken to be considered "done") within the 8 hour cooktime, then there was a very likely chance that the entire dish spent four hours or more within that temperature danger zone, (assuming room temperature ingredients, chilled chicken, etc) meaning that all the right conditions for microorganism growth existed.  Saying all that, there is wiggle room, and this is the most basic explanation of some advanced food safety considerations. Read up on minimum internal temperatures, time and temperature food abuse, and the temperature danger zone to learn more.   Temp it! If the chicken is around 165 f or so, you have cooked chicken.   My concern here is that if you have pink chicken after 8 hours of cooking, you might not have hit the "165 f in four hours" benchmark, which could mean that your meal could be potentially hazardous. Proceed with caution.   It's a short one, but it's my current favorite:   "I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand     the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow.   I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep     there are no words for that. ~Brian Andreas  So brief, but so packed with feeling. I can hear how much he loves this woman in this short passage. Being in several relationships where I loved a woman fiercely, I get this reference...it's not easy to explain why you love someone, but "the way you move against me while you sleep" is as good as any, and that feeling, were it taken away, would leave a gaping hole behind. It just seems that Andreas was aware enough to recognize that one moment as an example of what that kind of love is, and put words to it.   I sorta wrestled with it for a minute, but really it's just one of those things. I don't know the difference, and it was just "normal" at that time for an American white male born in the 70's.  Our family is a fan of logic and science and reason, and thinking about things. Doing just a small amount of research showed us that there was little necessity for circumcision. That was really all it took for us.   I'm cut, my son isn't. Our issue was simple...we saw no evidence of medical need for circumcision, and found quite a bit of evidence supporting a "whole-man" stance.  There have been some studies that showed a decrease in some STIs,  including HIV, transmission in cut v uncut, but it was a small difference, and I equated it to cutting of your nose so you don't get the sniffles.  A friend of ours, a nurse, tried very hard to convince us otherwise for cleanliness issues. I asked her how often she cleaned her ears, and if she ever thought of removing them from her head so that she wouldn't have to be troubled by that anymore.  In short, we felt that it was archaic, and barbaric, and unnecessary, and the boy not looking like me thing hasn't really ever come up. I've done the research, I know what he needs to know about hygiene, and any possible issues that may pop up, and we've talked about them. I don't think he knows that I am cut, and at this point (he's ten) I don't see a need for him to know. I would tell him the truth if he asked, of course.      Good to know, thanks for the answer.   Great idea. I may know a couple of folks, I'm sending it on. Could something like this exist for convicted felons?   Huge King fan here. I see what you mean about It. I love the story, think it's great, but the dialogue was ... off. Hard to write ten year olds doing really adult stuff, and try to capture the adults responding to the stresses of the kids they were.   Saying that, I think It stands out in that failing, along with The Talisman (another great book, but the main character is young). His early writings lack the depth of his later work, but are worth the read for the rawness of them.   Recommendations? Try some of the short story collections. They're quicker, less depth and character development, and equally good. If you like those, expand! There's so much to like. And, because I almost have to, try the Gunslinger. Unlike his other work, but tied to almost everything that he's done before.  Personal favs: Tommyknockers - An unexpected find in the woods leads to unexpected results. A little more grown up of a story. Needful Things - A new shop opens up in a small town, and sells exactly what you want, but can you afford it? Misery - A big time writer meets small town crazy. Insomnia - An old man can't sleep, and starts seeing things that may or may not be real. The Stand - An epidemic leads to a spiritual good v evil finale. (Bit cheesy at the end, but the journey is worth it.)   Just recently watched "All is Lost" with Robert Redford. Kinda of an artfilm, no dialogue, just a story of a man and his boat. Worth the watch.         Plenty of folks already here saying encopresis, which my ten yo is dealing with. What no one is saying is that [r/encopresis](http://www.reddit.com/r/encopresis) exists. New sub for parents dealing with this issue.         Umm....don't want to be that guy, but... *Niggerback?*   The only real cure is prevention. Drink water. Get drunk, maintain drunk by alternating alcohol then water. Now that you're fucked, the only thing to do is eat something that will soak up any leftover alcohol, something heavy to give a sense of fullness, and start pounding water. Take something for  your head, but not aspirin...that can hurt your liver, and it's already on the ropes. Think when you drink, friend. Next time.   We made a simple mistake. My son has my name, and my daughter has my wife's name. Not Jr, just first names. It has caused problems whenever dealing with forms and such. I don't know if I regret it enough to rethink it...I'm happy with their names, but it wasn't something that we thought of ahead of time. (We all have different nicknames at home)   Probably not what you're looking for here, but today is my Dad's birthday, and he's been on my mind a bit today.  My dad worked hard to support our family, and I appreciate that.  But when you ask what I would thank him for, the things that come to mind are the negative stereotypes that he evinced.   I never wanted to be a father. My dad didn't seem to want a family. It was something that he felt he had to do, and it showed. He was distant, and often angry (more on that later) and sometimes abusive, to me, my younger sister and my mom. Later in life when I became a father, the things that I always hoped my father would be guided me through the difficult transition into fatherhood. I knew that I wanted to be present, and involved, and positive, and not ham-fisted and judgemental. I've got pops to thank for that.  Pops was a Vietnam vet with a serious anger problem. Most of my memories of him are him being angry. Often for things and reasons that I didn't understand. While his experiences in Vietnam were a big reason for that unresolved anger, I learned later in life that it was something that sort of ran in my family. I experienced it firsthand as a teen and later as a twentysomething that was constantly angry. At myself, at the world, at girlfriends, at everything. There was a moment where I realized that I was becoming the things that I disliked in my father, and that was all I needed to realize I didn't want to go through life that way. After a few years of therapy and some very understanding friends, I developed some tools that have helped me deal with that fuming red dragon, and it has been a long time since I blew up at something stupid. I still get angry, I just now know how to deal with it when it happens. So, thanks Dad, for that too.   My dad, like I said above, felt like family was an obligation. He put aside everything that he wanted in his life, because he felt he had to. As soon as my sister and I left home, he started to persue the things in life he wanted. (i.e. music performance, stage, small screen, re-enactments, that sort of thing.) He eventually spent so much time away from home and mom, that they divorced after 27 years of marriage. I learned that I should never forget to chase my dreams, and make them part of my family, less I become something that I am not. Thanks, Dad, for that too.  I recently started talking to Pops again. Small conversations, usually on Facebook. He apologized and recognized that he was a broken father, and I did my best to forgive him, and thinking about it now....maybe I've got to thank him for that too. It's never too late to try and apologize. (I don't know if it will help our relationship at all, but it was nice to hear.)  Thank your Dad for being there. For being strong. For raising you right. It's clear that you want to thank your dad for what he did; that means he did a good job, and hearing that from someone whom he loves is going to mean the world and more to him. I don't think it will matter how many words it takes to tell him that. :)   Not an equipment option, but just to show you the versatility of your instrument, [check this out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbndgwfG22k)       I have a daughter. She is the most beautiful thing that I get to see everyday. I tell her everyday that she is beautiful, but I do go out of my way to reward her for being smart and kind and thoughtful and for following rules and helping her brother and a million other things. She can know she's beautiful, I don't think that's a problem, and I don't think that it will become a problem, because even though I tell her often that she is beautiful, she gets rewarded for doing things, not just for being things. But that's just like, my opinion, man.   Possibly. I don't know of any interview where he mentions when he is a fan, but as many know, he is a member of the [Rock Bottom Remainders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Bottom_Remainders), a band made up of mostly published authors. They played together from around 92 to 2012 or so, including a show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their set included a cover of Rockaway Beach by the Ramones. He has said in interviews about the band that they only play music that they like, and that is easy to play; the Ramones would easily fit the bill there.   I don't know about these individuals, but I'm going with the Tampon Bay Pluganeers....just like a tampon, they only have one string and are only good for one period.            "We can't stop spying on our citizens...because ISIS"? Really? That's the best they could do? Who voted these fucks back in office?    I completely agree with this author. He makes an excellent point by being stupid. These facts are bad, and the author should feel bad.         My grandmother was a very special woman in my life. We did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye even though her death was expected. (Expected far earlier than it happened; she lived with intestinal cancer for the last ten years of her life.) I would absolutely trade a year of my life for an hour long conversation with her. A chance for her to see the man I grew to be, to meet my children and my wife. Easy choice.    Read the book, for sure. Then watch the most recent movie. The film does a good job dealing with....uh...some sensitive subject matter, but it can't capture the overall feel of the novel, for obvious reasons. The film lacks depth without reading the book first, but that's like just my opinion, man.   Thanks for this. Could use a support community.                  The twelve string guitar is played the same as a six string. There are six sets of two strings. The bass EADG are an octave apart; the standard string and one octave higher, the B and e are sets of the same string. Simple enough. Fun to play, big full sound.      Sexto in english means "sixth".   Also, penalizar means "to penalize"...kinda sounds like penal lizard or penile lizard. I'm reaching here, I know.  Pianista...a pianist.   You feel like you accomplished something when you get out. Of the blonde.   The scientific view on aliens and gods are very different.   We have discovered life already; here on Earth. However, we have not discovered any gods.  We have discovered that most stars have planets, and that some of those planets exist in a habitable zone around their respective stars, providing a possible place for life to exist. However, we have not discovered any proof of where gods or afterlives or punishment schemes may take place.   We have discovered that here on our planet, life exists in almost every niche imaginable. From our upper atmosphere, to the deepest parts of the ocean, from high temps to low temps, from high o2 to low o2, etc. However, we have not found any proof that gods occupy any space other than the collective imagination of their creators.   Personally, I don't identify as an atheist, I identify as someone who requires some proof before I believe in outlandish claims. I do not believe in any gods because there is no proof of them ever existing. I do however, believe in the **possibility** of extraterrestrial life (not "aliens" so much, but microorganisms, possibly more advanced simple life) because the exosciences continue to show that life finds a way here on earth, no matter how extreme the circumstances, that other stars have planets, and that some of those planets exist in habitable zones, that water is plentiful in the universe, and that only considers our closed minded assumption that any life we find will be carbon based and water needy.  I think, much like the explosion of discovery with exoplanets in the last decade or so, life will be found singly somewhere, probably in the fairly new future. That discovery will help us understand how and where to look for life, and we will find that while life itself may not be abundant in the universe, the possibility of life is.   Doesn't change your argument, but the Florida State College, before the reorganization of the Florida Education system which turned FSC into the Florida Women's College, (which later became FSU) fielded a football team from 1902 until 1905...said team was sent to Gainesville under the reorganization efforts of the Florida Dept of Ed. Yes, the Gators were born in Tallahassee. Sort of.  edit: clarification   Couldn't tell you the last time I bought a CD from a online retailer or in person....probably more than 10 years ago. Last CD I bought was at a show, semi-underground guy named Zach Deputy, probably about three years ago.   My current wife was sort of a hook up our first time. The first couple times were fun, fun enough that I came back for more. We became compatible very quickly. We dated for ten years, got married five years ago. Two kids together, still finding new ways to experiment and have fun. So, I guess the first time it didn't matter, but the sexual compatibility we discovered led to our dating, which led to our romantic relationship, which led to kids and marriage, so maybe it mattered.          I show up to work at about 8am. Start with coffee. If I'm lucky, somebody will bring donuts or something I can stuff in my face while I'm working in the kitchen. Around 9am I have to have honey glazed carrots roasting, and bacon cooked off for the turkey gravy and the green beans. I already roasted the turkey the night before, so I don't have to worry about that too much, but I do have to worry about making mashed potatoes and the gravy and the green beans and the stuffing, and making sure that the desserts are getting handled (this year probably 12-14 apple pies, and 10 or so pecan pies), and setting up for service, all by 11:30 or so. I'll spend lunch and dinner on the line, usually plating about 130 covers or so for the day (that's in addition to regular menu service, about another 80-100 covers), sneaking in a snack here in there...usually while checking the scores to the football games. Around 9pm, I'll start to relax...we'll feed the staff leftovers, and break out the wine (if it was a good shift). By 10, I'll be at the bar, drinking whiskey and bitching about having to work another Thanksgiving.      Literally just watched it traverse about two hours ago (7:37pm EST). The text alerts and the app help a bunch. Having a little knowledge about where and when to look to the sky makes it super easy. (When I first got the alerts, and saw my first (confirmed) ISS sighting, I realized I had seen it a couple of times before, and not known what it was.)         Had one of my servers come back and ask about a medium plus...then she asked what that meant. The whole kitchen, damn near in unison, replied "MEDIUM WELL!"   What the hell is this? Why on earth would a link from Huzlers.com end up in r/science. Calm down folks, don't load up the shotguns and buy the booze yet, Earth will continue to experience its normal amount of sunlight over the foreseeable future. Thanks for calling.      Wouldn't that be great? But unfortunately, whenever a vacuum is created, something else is created to fill that void. (Second law of Inverse Televisionics) What ever is created to fill a recently created vacuum is also usually worse than that which was originally vacated, so the question becomes....what could possibly be worse than this? And, how many people will watch it?                       Yes. Absolutely yes. Baby powder is either talc or cornstarch. Talc gets broken down by sweat. Cornstarch babypowder is superfine, and gets everywhere, but it works better than talc baby powder.  I like to use the Vigo kitchen use cornstarch. It's not so superfine, not so messy, stays on, keeps drying all day. Just make sure to be dry before applying.  I've been using cornstarch for about six  years now. I work in an extremely hot and fast paced kitchen where I sweat and move around a lot. It's the very odd day that I have any rash or jungle rot going on anymore.   Shower often.   Dry well after shower.  Apply cornstarch.       Most of Hughes work fills out my top # list, certainly in comedies. Great film.                   [I freaking love lists like these!

 Thanks - [I finally got a chance to briefly take a look](http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/asaneed.php?bk_no=664 cid=4564 sid=720) (didn't check that the other wordings are identical) - but I may have had bad information here since some of these are at least purportedly hasan. I was taught that cannibalism was haram by ijma and not by an actual textual proof so I must've misunderstood that at some point to have meant there was no textual proof while there seems to be.         A recent fatwa has been placed against calling them apostates  **{citation needed}**  i have heard of bad things they have done but I haven't heard of takfir... I know for a fact some shias do takfir but it is not representative of us, same way daesh is not representing sunnis.   Look - I'm sure you don't believe this garbage, the idea that the Prophet of The All-Knowing God handpicked a bunch of his closest companions who would turn around and betray him and leave the religion...I'm just pointing out that it's absolutely intellectually dishonest for you to pass that off as a general/pervasive opinion among Shi'ites, or what the religious texts support.  This is not like the issue of Daesh not representing Sunnis. Daesh are literally only a handful of Sunnis. Out of over a billion people, Daesh are a couple thousand. That's nothing.  The takfir on the Sahaba in general *"illa thalatha"* (or some other number) in the Twelver religious texts (**literally chapters are titled by this issue**), and by the founders of the religion (the early scholars) is insanely extensive...This doesn't come from the lecture of some po-dunk Molvi in Pakistan during an Ashura sermon...I'd be happy to link you to examples if you're legitimately unfamiliar with this - do you understand Arabic?   The notion "your madhab", "your sect", "your ideology" and various other alternatives were valid, but your religion indicates Shi'as are of a separate religion, like Christians, or Jews.  It indicates that your religion is not Islam, and that your religion does not constitute a legitimate Islamic sect (like Sunnis, Ibadis, Zaydis, Mutazillis, etc.). It doesn't mean you're not Muslim, and the distinction is made by innumerable ulema. I'm not misapplying grammar, and I'm not doing takfir - you're just jumping to conclusions.  Nation of Islam, the Druze Religion, Alawi Shi'ism, Qadiyanism, etc. are not Islam. Tenets of each of these religions, if believed, would in theory put you outside of Islam. But by the benefit of the doubt, and the sahahada, the assumption is that the lay-person of these religions is technically Muslim. The "religions" themselves are outside of Islam. The ruling on the religion doesn't extend to the people who ascribe to these groups unless they adhere specially to those things that constitute shirk.  No backtracking here or lying (I'm not a Twelver like you brother)...   Therefore point still stands  Your point boils down to the fact that some Imam who ran a seminary did something stupid. That Imam has nothing to do with *me*, or with Ahlus Sunnah as a generality. My criticism is about *your religion* itself and the fundamental premise on which your religion, and every book of Twelver ahadith is built (lying). It's rather sad that when confronted with the absurd nature of *your religion*, the best you can do is attack some *personalities* that ascribe to another religion. I hope you can notice the distinction.  I didn't say you were wrong - the man seems to do what you're claiming he did - saved his life by walking out in a burqa - it's just irrelevant to the Sunni Islam... And as embarrassing as that is, I'd rather be caught in a burqa than ascribe to a set of beliefs that makes 'Ali (ra) look like a pathetic wimp and suggest the Imams (ra) were a bunch of liars.  And easy out, I can feel your anger bursting out from comments, lol, chill out if you may :)  LOL. Wallahi I'm not angry, I'm just sorry for you.   A Mormon missionary very vocally made the claim that the Book of Mormon is an authentic book from Divine inspiration. I asked the Mormon why he believes in Joseph Smith and his book - what makes it authentic. He said to go read the Book of Mormon, with sincere intention, and the Holy Spirit would guide me to know its true. I asked him if he could give me even a small tid-bit, a teaser, to suggest that it was authentic and from God, and all I got was the same circular logic. I understand the guy blindly believed in that non-sense and had no credible reason for it, but you'd expect people to at least be a little honest with themselves.  I just asked for the name of a muhaqiq. Khayr inshaAllah, I'll look into it, best of luck.   I highlight "your religion" right up there, and that is still not enough for your to read and make stupid assumptions?  Yea, I said "your religion"...how is that takfir?...Qadiyani and Alawi religions etc. aren't Islam either...that doesn't mean me, or anybody else, does blanket takfir on every average Druze / Alawi...  As for your "Taqiyyah" comment, all I say is that our scholars don't go full lunatic and try to escape in women's clothing on broad daylight like Mullah Abdul Aziz here  Right...Because some random Imam at a Masjid from Pakistan attempting to save his life has just as much relevance to my *religion* as the fact that your *religion* is based on telling lies right down to your fundamental books of ahadith, to the extent that your major modern scholars [don't even cover it up anymore](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)...  But I suppose if laughing at some random Sunnis in embarrassing situations makes you feel better about the fairy tales you go to bed with at night, I guess that's something.   Also, do you count add a traveller if you're travelling for work?   You'd be musafir (traveller) even if you were making safr for a haram reason.   But I would *ask a sheikh* if you want a detailed response with ahadith - there's too many variables in your question for anybody to easily search up all the associated ahadith. Is this boat going to another destination, or are you on a navy sub / aircraft carrier that will just turn around after some time period? etc. etc. etc.   I don't understand what you mean by the forward...in the English translation? Can you TL;DR for me one piece of evidence or the name of the muhaqiq who did the authentication and I'll look it up?  Appreciate it!   generalization of all Shia begins, leading to you being called kafir.   Ruling on the generality doesn't mean it applies in specificity.  I find that hard to believe  Why?    Shia believe, simply based on fact and evidence, that it is reliable, and would argue (many would say very effectively) that it is sahih.  In that case, if you dont mind, can you tell me which muhaqiq did the authentication? Of all the narrations? It seems like a real feat since the author doesn't provide sanad for anything, the muhaqiq would literally have to first find the asl for every tradition on his own as well...   Will there be any Muslims with you on the boat? There's no salat al-juma without a jama. Will the boat be in such a condition that you're musafir? There's no salat al-juma for the musafir.  You should ask a sheikh with your specific details.   Source for what? That you're musafir while on the boat? Or that there is no juma for the musafir? (the later is the jamhoor opinion so I'm sure you can google it).   Nonetheless, I am comfortable with acknowledging myself as a Shia and it makes me very sad when some people try to disregard us as Muslim completely, even if they do not know what we believe in personally.   TBF - Very few people do takfir of the majority, or even of the average Twelver Shi'i. Criticizing the religion isn't the same as making takfir of you *personally*   Right...well obviously the Shia would not believe that.   Why not? As a Sunni, if you brought meaningful evidence demonstrating the weakness of a hadith, I won't believe it anymore. As an example, there's a beautiful and extremely popular saying attributed to the Prophet to seek knowledge even if you have to go all the way to China. At some point, I learned this hadith was mawdu at worst and da'if or tenuously hasan li-ghayrihi at best.  If you have substantial and convincing evidence for something, it shouldn't matter how popular it is or what your sectarian affiliation is.   No offense but most books written purporting to be ex-Shias that became Sunni are usually hoaxes.  That's a pretty substantial claim. Do you have examples of these hoaxes and associated books? I know plenty of ex-Shias in person as well as a number of people well-known on places like ShiaChat over the last 10 years who left the Twelver religion so it would be rather strange for Sunnis to resort to such cheap/desperate tactics...when there's so many knowledgeable ex-Shi'is, scholars, people who drop out of hawza and hawza "graduates"...  If you have a recommendation of one that's written by the real deal I'd be open to it.  Sure - not in English though. Do you read any other language (Farsi, Urdu, Arabic?).   A recent fatwa has been placed against calling them apostates  {citation needed}  And if you're going to point to an aberrant opinion of one of the few reasonable twelver ulema like Fadlallah, it's still intellectually dishonest on your part to imply that Twelvers as a group don't do takfir of Sheikhan when Twelver scholars by jamhoor, historically and today, and hadith books prove the opposite...   I like nothing better than people showing their close mindedness and doing a mass takfir like this.  Where did I do mass takfir on any post...ever? I understand you need to build strawmen as you wanted to question the scholarship of Husayn Murad and got exposed on that front - but isn't that a bit much?  I suppose when lying is a fundamental part of your religion you just can't help yourself huh...   I have never heard of such so-called esteemed scholar...Another one of those mullahs on the petro-dollar honour roll  GreyMatter hasn't heard of him so he must be a nobody on the "petro-dollar honor roll" [**in Jordan**](http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/_).... Being on TV or embroiled in politics isn't the only way to be a major reputable scholar - as this guy was in Twelver scholarly circles before he left, more so than the clowns hyped up by apologists of your religion like al-Tijani as examples of people leaving Ahlus Sunnah... [You must suck at using Google btw...](http://www.al-shia.org/html/ara/books/lib-rejal/nafahat/234.htm)   He cited everything he said. A lot of shit went missing after Operation Iraqi Freedom...   What makes ISIS think they're more Islamic than the early caliphs?   TBF, a lot of the times destroying some idols wasn't pragmatic. It wasn't a decision to preserve art/history (see Egypt under 'Umar). In other cases, the Muslims never reached some of those areas entirely during the early empires since the Muslims in al-sham and Iraq didn't really mingle with the non-Muslim communities that fell under their protection. Some empires/rulers were also more prone to iconoclastic tendencies than others (Ayyubids, Mahmad Ghaznavi, Aurangzeb, etc.).  That said, these aren't exactly idols. Nobody worships them and its a shame we've lost something that gives us a glimpse into the past.   You're arguing for the sake of arguing brother, and you were wrong on multiple occasions in this thread alone. Take a breather and reassess your intentions, your ego shouldn't be one of them.   Well a Muslim reddit user said it was not accurate, another said there are more accurate and more respected translations.   It's not inaccurate - The criticism against it was that it was verbose, and because of how much Keller wrote in terms of notes, it's more of a commentary on the book vs a translation. Some people don't agree entirely with the commentary. The translation itself is as good as a translation will get.   Al-Tijani is a clown...  If he read's al-Tijani's books (rudood of which you can easily find in entire volumes in 'Arabic or even of several assertions on English sites or his humiliating representation on mustaqillah) - will you read a book by a Twelver leaving that religion and becoming Sunni? Are you fluent in any language besides English?   Shias have always debated, it has usually been others who silenced them.  Right...but even if there was some vast conspiracy to silence Shi'ite debaters instead of disproving them, I can understand why given that [lying to Sunnis as part of debates is allowed in this religion](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)...  :                        :       .     they cannot be called apostaes  I don't understand how you're even able to *try* and spin this. There's entire chapters in the major Twelver hadith books on the fact that **ALL** of the Sahaba made irtidad except a couple...in contradiction to the dhahir meaning of several ayat...  It wouldn't take more than 20 minutes to find that same opinion uttered by the major scholars of the Twelver religion outside of primary sources either...   Zaydi Shi'ites believe it was unintentional. Their position is that the Prophet made no clear nass to appoint 'Ali - hence why Abu Bakr, Umar and the Sahaba in general aren't hated.  Twelver Shi'ism suggests the opposite (Majlissi - one of the major mashaykh of what I assume is your religion):                                     ( )                          The traditions in Twelver Shi'ite books about the appointment of 'Ali are extensive, as you must already be aware. Which means the only way Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman could've become Khulafa is by *intentionally* forgoing the command of the Prophet / not believing in it. Hence the conclusion above (on the kufr of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and the Sahaba).   Sunni and Shia schools of thought have different principles of jurisprudance...  And completely different religious traditions (ahadith and athar).   Search up 1991 iraqi failed revolution and iran iraq war, they killed close to 700,000 of us, and that's the low estimate , the high estimate is about 2 million  Stop playing the sectarian victim bullshit. The 91 rebellion was started by ex-Ba'athis, Saddam didn't single out Shi'ites in exclusion to Sunnis for his reprisals - and to his death even when he became more religious, he didn't care or know anything meaningful about the differences Twelver Shi'ism introduced. Drawing Sectarian lines of targeting is the forte of your compatriots, and the modern organizations that grew to power as the only defense of Sunnis against your compatriots.   I don't think that passage exists in what we have of the Gospel of the Nazarenes, any of the other Jewish Gospels or proto-Matthew reconstructions. Which is what conartist probably meant by real Christians (Nazarenes, Ebionites, and early non-prosletyzing "Jewish" / non-Pauline Christians). You can also see some of other MSS (Shem Tov as an example) lacking even the "all the nations" clause - and explicitly contradicting the idea of Christ being sent to non-Jews.  And at best we know that even the traditional Matthew manuscripts were substantially modified in this verse. See "in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit" as the well-known interpolation. So IMO it would be a bit problematic to rely on this statement attributed to Christ exclusively as evidence of his goal being to spread his message to gentiles.   Hey, dude, they didn't kill him, he is in custody and they don't plan to torture or kill him.  I didn't say they killed the kid who was referenced by OP. I said that you can't treat a witness as reliable when he's being held captive, especially by organizations known to use torture. The video I posted is of a kid who they *did* kill. He's tied up, being slapped around and ultimately shot in the head.  You just gave a random video and said this is what shia iraqi army does to sunni kids without context.  Do you want videos of Iraqi army soldiers in Iraqi army fatigues doing the same thing? I've posted several videos like that to /r/iraq and /r/syriancivilwar...before the US came in and helped the Iraqi army clean up their PR, the Golden Brigades Facebook page was proudly posting videos of the same sort of stuff (torture, putting corpses and driving them around on vehicles, executions of tied up Sunnis, executions/burnings of Sarkhi's Shi'ites, etc.). My videos are direct from the army page...you can look through my old submissions...  I could give countless examples of sunnis doing all sorts of horrible things to shias  You mean the mass executions? I don't see how that's hardly comparable to torture videos and executions of kids who don't look like they've even hit puberty...  sunnis are not a largely persecuted,genocided and victimized group  Right...Baghdad went from a Sunni majority to a Shi'ite majority through peaceful means...   The images are pictures of people in Bashar's prisons. You can see signs of torture and starvation. The pictures are a small subset of what's going to be coming out soon (you can check the NY Times or many other established networks about the pictures to be released). It's irrelevent if they're fighters or not, there's Islamic ways - fuck that - human ways to treat captives.  **The video is of a kid, tied up, being slapped around by Shi'ite soldiers. He's then shot in the head**. A gun is a gun - sure... When you're a POW, you don't have a gun anymore...   It makes sense though. He's looking to consolidate his power with minimal use of force so he'll want Imams on payroll for the future of "Islam" in Egypt. What is difficult to implement over thousands of tiny mosques becomes much more solvable when implemented against fewer mosques that just have larger congregations.   Sounds peachy - but having your life expectancy halved just to get laid seems a bit much lol...   It is evil without a God because the person who is raped did not consent.  The animals we kill and eat don't consent either. The junkie you do an intervention on didn't consent either. The suicidal bridge jumper you pull down didn't consent either. A sado-masochist can consent to real physical harm. An incestuously minded couple can consent to an incestuous relationship.  I don't see how consent being the basis for defining "evil" or morals is at all reasonable.   Go to your local mosque. The literal meaning of "Qur'an" is recitation - it wasn't something people simply read in their homes, it requires interactive dialogue. When Islam spread originally, it wasn't through people handing out copies of Qur'an translations but acting as actual delegates who would explain Qur'an/Islam to different cities/communities/kings. Ask if they have a Qur'an class at your local mosque or an Islam 101 sorta thing. Don't be scared - these guys are generally friendly  IMO the best place to learn, whether you're a beginner or somebody who's on his way to being the mujadid of this century as with other people who (presently) know more than you do.      Dead - the Arabic English the end....damnnnn   If you keep this flair for over a week - you may have bigger things to worry about than this sub   If this report is accurate  It's not. He's a Sunni boy, who used to be in Daesh currently in the custody of the mostly Shi'ite Iraq army. You can imagine what they did to him...  Hell, you don't even need to imagine. NSFW [Here's what they do - as of yesterday](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1) to Sunni children that they capture from Daesh. This story has no credibility unless that kid is in a safe place - no testimony of an obvious Iraqi prisoner is real testimony. Same goes for the testimony of NSFW [captives of SAA/Hezbollah.](https://www.facebook.com/StandwithCaesar/photos_stream)   [Fake story](http://imgur.com/VxoxFNP)  The image originally came from Quds-news. There's a Jan 15 timestamp, so this kid was injured before that pilot execution video was even released! An Arabic news agency then fabricated this story mid-February after which it was picked up by a bunch of online news sites. And now it's beginning to get spread to English "news" like this website. The entire story, as well as the lousy explanation of how this remote village saw the graphic video is fiction.  No doubt it's tragic that this kid was hurt - regardless of the circumstances. But I find it sicker that people are using the legitimate suffering of others and reinventing propaganda around it.   This news story is likely false. I remember seeing this picture a long time back.  Edit:  [Found it.](http://imgur.com/VxoxFNP)  The image originally came from Quds-news.

ISIS isn't a good group, but OP has an agenda - double check anything an anonymous person (myself included) says to you online.   There's different opinions on drawing pictures, but robots are a totally separate category.   It makes as much of a statement about a group as the people they kill, if we're going to use that to understand them. Everybody operates with some sort of morals. Neither ISIS, nor the Iraqi army, or the myriad of other organizations go in thinking "heh, we're the villains".   Yep.   You'd be surprised. Al-Muhajiroon, Sh. Abu Hamza al Misri, Anjem Chowdry, etc. all used to say stuff like this with impunity. The government, in theory, cares more if you actually plan to do something like that (versus liking that it happened).    Very very contentious topic and a lot of misinformation due to the emotions relating to it.  She didn't lead a revolt per say. She moved on Basrah before 'Ali had widely been given the bayah. 'Ali actually then moved his army towards Basrah. In any case, here's some in-depth talks based on Muslim historical chronicles:  [Lecture on the topic by Sh. Adnan Abdul Qadir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ciR5Vwa1k)  [Detailed part of a lecture series by Mufti Abdur Rahman b Yusuf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH5sdjJ6U5I)  Conflicting views come from the fact that the people to whom this is an important issue (Shi'ites) have their own religious texts produced later on (see al Kafi al Kulayni, Bihar al Anwar by al Majlissi). They record many of the same narrations as all the rest of the sects, but their narrative will focus on attacking Ayesha. The narrations there will pose Ayesha in the most vehemently negative light. They also come from the fact that Sunni historians (like at-Tabari) used to record narrations from all people, including different sects, reliable people and unreliable people, descendents of people who fought in the war, etc.  It boils down to simply, 'Ali was given bayah but people were unhappy that the culprits weren't caught. Talha and Zubair, who originally gave their oath of allegiance to 'Ali, were unhappy with his reluctance to immediately pursue/turn-over/punish the alleged killers of Uthman so they went to one of the highest authorities among Muslims, Ayesha, a Mother of the Believers as she was known. She, based on their narratives, was encouraged to march and convince 'Ali to deal with the issue. She went with a large group of men and this resulted in a short battle. After 'Ali won, he made sure she was safely able to return home. It was a political dispute where 'Ali was in a pickle, for political reasons, he couldn't easily handle the situation promptly, but people wanted blood (their former caliph had just been killed). The majority of scholars held that she was incorrect in her ijtihad, and he was correct, afaik.    This was in direct defiance of the quranic verse telling the wives to remain inside their homes after the death of the Prophet.  There are exceptions to that rule ya himar...they aren't under house arrest once the Prophet dies...   Khawarij is plural btw...   [NSFL Mirror](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1)   [NSFL Mirror](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1)   [NSFL Mirror](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1)   [NSFL Mirror](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1)   [NSFL Mirror](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1)   [NSFL Mirror](https://vid.me/e/IRqX?card=1)  The kid looks 13-14 at most, they slap him around before shooting him in the head - it's very hard to watch.   He condemned violence against mass civilian targets, not necessarily what he was doing. That said, it's possible his life circumstances made him change his mind? Or he believed the people he was executing were legitimate targets for some reason or another? Who knows - there's more to it.   They don't generally kill kids. You may remember the several kidnapped Kurdish boys in Syria. They were allowed to speak with their families on the phone and were just given an alternative education. A current example would be the fact that ISIS freed the elderly Assyrian hostages they were holding (they still have around 200 hostages remaining). That's the most notorious group in the region, you can extrapolate that most of these extremists avoid killing certain classes of people.   If you condemn Shi'ite atrocities, you must be an ISIS fanboy. /s   Before ISIS declared a caliphate and was moving on Baghdad, prisons were full of former fighters against the Iraq government / Coalition forces. After the big move, the prisons were basically empty.   Second one was condemned by everyone, so it was probably ISIS(dont lump them with the rebels)   Nope - I remember that one. That one was FSA or some other group - it was from over a year ago.   None. ISIS just has better production value and is more honest about it.   They used to post stuff like this - and worse, regularly on the Golden Brigades division facebook page (Iraqi army) - including videos of torture. Not just of Sunnis - they took a video after burning alive a Sarkhist Shi'ite (during their short lived rebellion) and drug the corpse around the street chained to a motorcycle.  There are *tons* of videos like this, they don't have the same production value as ISIS videos and don't get mass media attention like ISIS. Something seemingly hard to comprehend for a lot of people is that almost every major group plays dirty.   Shi'ite militias / Iraqi army are generally good about not filming (before the ISIS quagmire, the proof was usually corpses with signs of torture like drill marks). But not always.   If somebody gave me money to remove a thread, I'd remove it. If a 7 or above wanted to suck me off to remove a thread, I'd remove it. If I got a cease and desist or official request for takedown with lawery jargon on it - I'd probably remove it.  They said they removed it as it was 'misleading' (in this particular case - that might even be an accurate assessment). You can decide for yourself if it was accurate or misleading. But as to why they removed it - nobody here *actually* knows so you're asking the wrong group of people...   Yep - you have to do a search for the ones with the "misleading" tag that got removed by mods to find ones that are actually accurate.   It's definitely not an issue that can be resolved easily by just replacing corrupt mods. The people who seek power are never the ones who deserve it most.   giggity   I know somebody who went to jail for specs of marijuana in their car crossing borders between two states.   I bought Beats :(      No Information = No Limit   The current trend in India is Fascist. Modi, of the BJP, who presided over the Gujrat Riots/Massacre of Muslims, was popularly elected. He's what you'd call a strong-man leader. Mein Kampf is a pretty popular read because people are impressed by Hitler, in spite of his ultimate failure, in his ability to drive his nation out of a slump and make it power-house at that time. There's also the fact that people in India recognize the role played by Adolf indirectly in India gaining her independence. You can say that all of this leads to an affinity with the man which in turn leads to denying the things he did which they don't necessarily agree with. You can compare it to the nearly instantaneous response of "Pallywood" conspiracy theories by many people any time Israel commits something egregious. It's effectively the same mind-state, affinity causes you to hype myths and minimize flaws.   There was a rally planned in opposition to Putin. The expected turnout was very low. Nemtsov, an opposition politician leading a very unpopular political party was effectively rotting away in obscurity to most Russians while Putin has the highest approval ratings of his dictatorial career. Nemtsov, the basically irrelevant politician, suggested in an interview that he might be assassinated. Nemtsov ended up being shot in the back of the head. The assumption was made by some people that Putin was responsible for offing this man. In turn, a small rally turned into something comparatively huge (50,000 people - or 0.4% of Moscow's population).    There was a rally planned in opposition to Putin.

Usually international pressure results in more extreme punishments. I wouldn't be suprised if that's what's happening here.  Which makes complete sense - do you really want to set precedent in any country, as a leader, that will undermine the rule of law? Police forces to ever actually give hostage takers what they want. Many countries refuse to negotiate with those dubbed terrorists or hostage taking criminals, etc. for the same issue of precedent and what it encourages long-term.   My gut reaction is that the Saudis have figured out that for the next ten years and every time he is flogged, the story is going to be in the foreign media and will embarrass the kingdom. The would rather kill Raif now, take the bad press over it and let everybody forget about it in 6 months or so. I'm not an expert, but that's how this reads to me.   That would be exceptional politics on their part. But I doubt it's the case. If he gets a death sentence, he will most probably be convicted without Saudi royalty whispering in the ears of the judge. You have to remember that the judiciary is composed of religious scholars, who by nature tend to be more zealous and less corrupt. The judiciary system in Saudi Arabia is pretty separate from the royalty (at least as far as this case his gotten).  The new king could *technically* let this guy off the hook in an appeal that travels up the chain to him, but he realistically can't do that. It would send the wrong message locally: If you're convicted for something that isn't a crime in the West, appeal to Western media to influence the judiciary. Attempting outside influence on the judiciary is actually a crime in its own right.  And all of that assumes this isn't just Badawi's wife and legal team trying to stir up a story in order to keep him on our radar.   **Both** sites you use are actually anti-Shia propaganda  **1** al-khoei.org is the main al-Khoie foundation site.  **2** And regardless of what you think of twelvershia.net, the riwayat on that particular page are listed with cross-check-able references to primary sources...   Does 4:140 forbid Muslims to talk with non-Muslims if the non-Muslims ridicule Islam?  It's a prohibition of sitting with anyone, even someone who is technically a Muslim, if they're mocking religion (until they stop). Islam distinguishes between dialogue and mockery and there's a rich tradition of Muslim apologetics without ad hominems from either party. Similar verses suggest to give them reminders about what they're doing wrong and about taking existence in jest.  Do 5:57   6:70 forbid Muslims from being friends with non-Muslims?  No, that's a war verse - you'll understand the context better if you read it with tafsir. If we read it out of context, then by that rationale, a person would have to distance himself from his non-Muslim relatives after conversion. Islam explicitly promotes the opposite.   Hah I wish - this was before YouTube and WorldStar   Debatable. Would I rather the Mona Lisa be in some private rich dude's mansion and nobody besides a privileged few would ever be able to see it or would I rather it be destroyed straight up?   [Don't bring a knife to a gun fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZCsU6u74cM)   Can confirm, tried to take on 2 dudes boozed out their minds years ago (self defense). Had a golf club - tons of connections right to their heads. They seemed impervious to pain and just kept on rolling with it. Then I lost the golf club...I wasn't impervious to the pain.  Lesson learned: If the other people are fucked up and you're not, [just beat it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym0hZG-zNOk)      Most organizations do that so its not exactly odd.  Generally speaking, when ISIS and other criminal groups the world over (Africa, Asia, anywhere) get a hold of these goods, they remove the old emblems and put on their own and redistribute the aid in the impoverished areas (non-religious criminal groups also profit from reselling the goods), etc.   According to this news agency...but you can't really trust a local news agency to 100% accurately convey the original claim. I'd double check what they actually published in Dabiq.   You don't stoop.   Let's be real, after 10 years of chaos, almost none of the remaining artifacts are likely real. The good stuff is sitting in the private collections of wealthy individuals who took advantage of the situation.   Can someone give me, like a proper example to help me understand the term?  Orthodox Muslims get a rap among ignorant bigots in the West because of this concept which has nothing to do w/ 90% of most people claiming to be Muslim. The issue is that Twelver Shi'ites are in modern times a very substantial subset of the overall population and happen to be vocal in media and politics, and this concept is the bedrock of Twelver Shi'ism. [An example of taqiyyah in action:](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)  :                        :       .   That's from the website of al-Kho'i, a venerable mujtahid in modern Twelver religious tradition. He's being asked if it's permissible to lie in debates against "innovators" (non-12ers - i.e. one of the types of taqiyyah) and al-Khoi is clarifying that it is as long as it is useful in winning the debate.  Here's some narrations on the concept from Twelver Shi'ite religious tradition:  http://twelvershia.net/2014/05/29/1184/   The real things are probably in private collections and both ISIS/Baghdad have a bunch of replicas. 10 years of chaos will lose a lot of national treasure.   Well countries that have nukes aren't necessarily in good shape either. Pakistan is rife with special interests, targeted assassinations, terror attacks, general bursts of social unrest, etc. Even if Ukraine had nukes, Russia could and would cause problems if they were put in the same situation as they've been put in our reality.   If that's the harassment we know about...there's probably quite a bit more we don't know about. Don't see how this is an unreasonable basis for determining a motive towards this path for the man...      Really? I've seen it **multiple** times across LA (in Torrence) and beyond. They have a quarter to get in system.   It's depressing since this exact illusion keeps a good 50% of voters not acting in their self-interest and ultimately ruining the concept of democracy.   "We need peace, and clear skies"   Like Pakistan?   What does US have to do with anything?  A lot...      A radicalized anti-Russian Ukraine is better than a NATO member-state anti-Russian Ukraine on his border. Weighing his options, you have new strategic territory, supportive regions in ethnic Russian territory as a buffer and your neighbor state is no longer fit to approach and join NATO as it was aiming for a few years ago.   Academic polling iz 2 hard tho   Umm...that makes no sense. Islamic apocolyptic literature suggests that the people closest to that period of time will be the worst of human beings. If you're a 'radical', you want anything *but* Judgement day to come.   It's unreal when you think about it. They say that their aim is to create a massive Caliphate that stretches the globe, and yet they haven't built a single thing. They just maim and destroy everything like rabid animals.  The first thing you build is an army. You build an army by having people with nothing to do. When you burn books and music, people have nothing left to do.   Men who run off to ISIS at their age are given no mercy.  They should be too. Media + Pussy pass is a whole nother issue entirely imo.  If ISIS let these girls fight on the frontline and kill people, don't you think they would do it?  Maybe. And if you found me 10 years ago and asked me what drugs I was selling, you'd have a very different answer from than you have now. The point is to know about this issue, and put in measures to ensure that youth will *live long enough* to grow out of this phase and prevent them from ever *having an opportunity* to go out "on the frontline and kill people".   At what point do a people claim ownership of land?   I don't think it's easy to come up with some sort of absolute for something like that, and I'm sure you agree. What I do believe though without a doubt is that anyone displaced, particularly anyone (or descendent of one) displaced who is presently getting by on scraps at a refuge camp has every right to go and reclaim their stolen property. That they have more right to the land they were expelled from than a people with a vague and messy notion of "Jewishness" and no provable near memory connection to the land.  Without a doubt, a lot of the Palestinians' ancestors came to the land from elsewhere.  Even if that were the case, there are plenty who are as indigenous as our history books go. Various tribes that the Prophet allegedly interacted with and 'Umar allegedly interacted with.  I also see a gigantic difference between invited, or at least not repelled, early migrants vs a Jew making aliyah in the early 1900s for the express purpose of clandestine political subversion.   It's possible that Israelis and Palestinians, maybe in a few generations, can live together and respect each other's rights.   It's possible.   And plenty of kids made bigger mistakes than you probably did in your sheltered life. Joining local gangs, stealing and killing in their own community, ending up dead locally or in jail, flying down to Vegas and getting forced to become hookers, etc.  They're still kids who made mistakes.  If you can't empathize with them, you're the only psychopath here.   They're young girls. They have about as much foresight as young girls you pull out of the club...   Who brought up non-Sunnis? Andy was asking why dhimma were being killed.    I don't think a huge percentage of blacks would say  It's not a numbers game. You said the only reason somebody would hurt you for being an annoying asshole and exercising speech is if they're insecure. I pointed out that being an annoying asshole can get you hurt/killed/"persecuted" anywhere and has nothing to do with insecurities...whether you're in Europe and you're academically questioning the Holocaust, or you're in Russia, Africa or pretty much any Eastern country and you mock religious icons or somebody's family, or you're an annoying white kid yelling nigger while walking through the bronx....   If they pay their taxes, it becomes IS' duty as Muslims to protect them (like the Muslims in the territory they occupy) - assuming they still follow some aspects of Islam. But these aren't Moslawi Christians or Christians from other IS territories - [There are Christian enclaves and militias](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/christian-foreign-fighters-deserting-kurdish-ypg-syria-because-theyre-damned-reds-1976493133) in cities beyond IS.   Except that immediately when they took Mosul various Sunni movements gave bayah including non-Salafis - even prominently jaysh naqshbandia, average sunna' from baiji, fallujah, mosul...feel free to pretend that's not what happened and Anbar was just a bunch of "Wahhabi" sleeper cells...   It's happening, but Israelis have a way of disconnecting with the crimes perpetrated on their behalf by the IDF. Anytime Palestinians suffer something barbaric by inhumane democratically elected government of the people of Israel, several Hasbara will come along and call it Pallywood, or come up with something to the effect of "well Americans do it too!"   He's correcting the statement "open discussions" in the post he's replying too...   I mean, where the hell did he get the prophet (pbuh)'s wanting to commit suicide because of his doubts on the Quran?  There's a ziyada through az-Zuhri on a hadith in Sahih al Bukhari which discussed suicidal inclination on one occasion. Not for doubt of the Qur'an, but I can see where he kind of started.   Not insecurities. If you walk around a poor black neighborhood in the US calling everybody "nigger", don't think you'll walk out alive or at least not have your ass whopped. It's not because people are insecure about being black - it's simply that they're not okay with you saying something like that.  If you go to any part of the world where mothers are valued (so much of the world outside of US/Europe), you will either die or get your ass whopped for making a harmless "yo mama" joke. Same thing. The guy who's mom you called a whore *knows* his mom is not a whore, he's not *insecure*, he's just not okay with you saying that...  Insecurity would be if the Muslims were as riled up about Haggarism (by Cooke and Crone) as they were by Salman Rushdie. There's a difference between questioning/criticizing something and mocking it - and Muslim empires historically recognized this difference. Nobody was punished for apologetic or argumentation.  I understand its hard to imagine, but not everybody has the same values as you and not everybody believes that people should be allowed to *say* whatever they want. Nobody can control your thoughts, but no country doesn't have some restrictions on what you're allowed to say.   And likewise there's countless cases of baseless propaganda by Shi'ites against the various anti-Bashar, anti-Iraq Military militias...  And likewise there's countless cases of actual barbarity by Shi'ite militias...to the point where even Moqtada al-sadr isn't even willing to roll with some of these guys...you can find several examples of torture and vicious killings by Shi'ite terrorists (before Daish started coming up as a uniting Sunni response in the region) in my old submissions (to r/iraq)...   I've said some stuff critical of some of the big things Seattle believes in (bikes, public transpo, homos, Murray, etc.) without being downvoted into oblivion. You can get away with articulating a counter-cultural point just fine. It's coming off as a complete idiot or a troll that doesn't work (and why you guys must have the opinions you do about the sub)....   I think he has a point as in millions of Israelis have been born on the land.   I didn't say he doesn't have a point - I just don't believe assuming a state surrounded by enemies can exist indefinitely, or for any substantial period of time, is a good basis to 'move forward' on. That said, its not like the Crusaders didn't have children and influx of occupiers/"emigrants" when they occupied Palestine either. The only difference is the number.  They call it home and they would do whatever it takes to fight for it.  Calling a place home doesn't mean you'll do "whatever it takes" to fight for it - even if we assume that the children of thieves have the right to keep stolen property as their own.    If both of those really wanted it, Vietnam or Afghanistan would be utterly destroyed like Germany was 70 years ago.  If you don't believe we really wanted it in Vietnam, you don't remember Vietnam. That failure happened in spite of a wanton disregard for human life and destruction on a massive scale. As I said, that doesn't win wars...you have an advantage if you can level cities at a time, but that doesn't mean you'll walk away having completed what you set out to do...   You also don't mention that in those proxy wars all involved countries were armed by the rival side: Afghan Mujahideens armed by USA, Vietnam armed by Russia   China, etc ...   Actually - I basically did: "using antiquated outside technology...using antiquated Russian arms" - its not like the US gave F16s to the Mujahideen or the Ukranians...the technology they used in winning that war (and the subsequent ones) is for the most part no better than the crappiest arsenal held by an Iranian or Pakistani army group...   Technology has *always* been important in wars. It doesn't win wars. As the Russians call them, "goat herders" drove out the Soviets with nominal and antiquated outside technology. A technologically in-superior Viet-Cong drove out the USA. Today, Taliban controls substantial swathes outside of Kabul in Afghanistan after the war. A separatist movement in Ukraine using antiquated Russian arms is fighting a relatively successful war against a modern Ukranian army.  Evidence 1   2 aren't directly relevant to military development.  Evidence 3, assuming the iron shield is actually what its proponents claim, is definitely an impressive logistical feat. It's not exactly new technology though, the tools to intercept crude Hamas/Hezbollah type rockets (and better) is widely available in much of the world. You have advance warning sure - and effectiveness against this one very particular type of scenario -Qassams coming out of Palestine. If the Muslim world operated with some semblance of a homogenous unit in the next 100 years, you're now dealing with a hatf or something else less susceptible to what your ABF is tested against...  Your military development is earmarked to handle the very specific scenarios you expect well - its not like you lot are set up for something unexpected, and that's what I alluded to. The Crusaders didn't imagine Salah-ud-Din. They effectively handled the things they knew, but that doesn't prepare you against a surprise 50 years later.  And military development isn't everything either. You guys are amazing at leveling entire apartment complexes and cities, sure. But when IDF finally sent in ground forces, it wasn't exactly a cake-walk, and that's with air-support and a pretty no fucks given attitude to the destruction of life and property in the territory you were occupying. Imagine "terror tunnels" that open in major cities with 100s of Palestinian soldiers fighting the same urban war from within your own cities. You can't just level the buildings. The technology that works so well in destroying hospitals, schools, water sanitation and electrical plants isn't going to help in that environment.  I understand your investment and your hope that the Zionist experiment lasts indefinitely. I'm just not seeing any substantial reason to truly believe you can sustain a country, for any lengthy period of time, surrounded by people who support the indigenous people you've oppressed. At some point, the many battle-hardened Libyans, Egyptians, Iraqis, Somalis, Yemenis and Syrians who are busy killing each other right now (an absolute blessing for Israel) may redirect their anger. It's happened before...   He gave an *analogy* of a racist regime of the past who's people thought it would last indefinitely to a modern apartheid government. What does this have to do with *Jews*...   This whole discussion is irrelevant, because Israel is not going to disappear.   The Crusaders occupied Jerusalem for over 100 years, and several generations. What makes you so sure the indigenous people and their brothers nearby won't eventually find a way to work together and send you packing? It's happened before...   inshaAllah   Forces that will likely be one day shooting at you. Fleeing soldiers aren't an interdiction of enemy forces either, nothing imminent, but historically armies attempt to kill and capture people as they run away as well. Soldiers sleeping in barracks, etc. etc. etc. To put it as you do, no one expect they would be bombed sleeping. No one expects they would be bombed taking a shit.  They're still soldiers.    Because it was a fucking political rally. No one expect they would be bombed walking down the street of their own city. There is no excuse for this...  So if somebody in military gear is at a political rally, they're off limits during a war?   Well it's not a theological issue - it's a fiqh issue. If we go down to the very simplest understanding of the question, is there a legitimate opinion allowing qisas (retribution) of this nature if the family of the victims ask for it? Sure.  That isn't to say anything about this group, their legitimacy, their ruling over the man, whether the man deserved it, if a pilot's job is comparable (allowing this as qisas), the wisdom of doing it in this way, whether the video was real, whether the pilot is under the rules of a POW or a criminal, etc.   Yea it's definitely weird. They were pretty explicit too:   The footage was faked.     So you agree that ISIS are in fact Muslims but you disagree that they are rooted in Islam?   The ISIS foot soldiers appear to be Muslim.  And I'm not a relativist at all but when you have are dealing with written sources it often becomes impossible to speak in objective truths.   For things which are open to interpretation, sure. Stuff like whether to fold your arms above the navel, below the navel (etc.) in prayer are open to interpretation. Textual evidence isn't clear. That's the spectrum. But this is what you said, "who are you to decide what the objectively correct version of Islam is"  If somebody comes along and says, "well sure, Islam teaches this publicly, but Islam was actually transmitted in secret and the true religion was transmitted through a small subset of 'Muslims' and contradicts the openly available and multiply transmitted information" (as a simplification of 12er Shi'ism) - than you can pretty easily say it's not Islam, or not "authentic" Islam. If somebody comes along and says "Here's Qur'an 2.0 - this is Islam, again, easy call.  Likewise, if you have somebody that says Islam allows or encourages stuff like homosexuality, or killing anyone you choose at random, both of which are explicitly prohibited in the source texts - you can objectively say that this is not an 'objectively correct version of Islam'  Permit me a flippant example, there is a legitimate argument to say that Gatsby (of The Great Gatsby fame) was actually African-American. Can anyone objectively say one way or the other? And who is the final judge on such matters? Admitting the impossibility of objective truth in some situations is not a withdrawal into relativism.  And that example is fine, and it addresses differences of opinion in issues where there is an availability of interpretive leeway. Stuff like the details associated with prayer and other things. But you don't need a judge to tell you the incorrectness of someone espouseing values that contradict the dhahir (obvious) meaning of certain verses, as understood in context through chains of tutelage that go back to the Prophet. There's plenty of open issues that Islam accommodates differences of opinion in, even explicit texts which allow for such differences. I only took issue with the broad idea that nobody can objectively say something is or is not "Islamic" when there is abundant source texts which can be understood in context and have had a unanimous interpretation.   I didn't criticize OP for simply editorializing - I criticized him because of "BS editorializ[ing]" - the editorialization is not supported by the article itself as Prystaiko doesn't in any way admit that Ukraine wasn't serious about the cease fire....  There's a difference between simply editorializing and flat out lying. If you can't comprehend that difference, I can't help you.   We're on the same page, Putin explicitly negotiated the ceasefire so that the rebels could settle Debaltseve without violating the agreement. That said - OP is editorializing the title like crazy.    international scientific consensus that we were heading into an ice age  **The scientific community had no consensus at the time**, there wasn't enough data...averages over a 30 year period isn't (and wasn't) proof of a trend...  http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914494,00.html  What we have today is an actual consensus, with substantial data - not just media picking up and fear mongering both possibilities (as in the 70s)...   The footage was faked.   Average Sunni Muslims vs IS Types vs Shi'ites vs Secular Kurds vs NATO vs Russia  Israel kicking back with a beer at the beach and watching explosions in the distance.   Except its not racial. Anybody can join ISIS!    ISIS is rooted in a literal and very uncompromising tradition of Islam.  A literal and very uncompromising tradition of Islam allows burning to death of POWs? This is news to me. Given that there are explicit traditions literally prohibiting burning people to death.  In any case - I didn't say I have a problem with the idea that ISIS lot are Muslims until proven otherwise (theologically). I simply pointed out that there's a fundamental flaw in your modern Western approach to Islam, "all interpretations are valid, there are no objective truths", etc. The spectrum can be defined as whatever fits within the context of the vast set of undisputed Islamic sources. It's not something grey.   Welcome to /r/worldnews...   Last I checked Allah has no Air Force and an army of peasants with 30yr old ak47s so desperate to escape a life of poverty and boredom they blow themselves up.  Isn't that what the Soviets said in Afghanistan? And what the US said in Iraq 2.0, Afghanistan...  If those were military victories in your mind, you really need to re-assess what winning is.    Their radical messianic/apocalyptic stances  What stances are these? Dabiq? Their interpretation of that being in the near future isn't a theological difference imo   A well-edited video with a "specific leader" (literally somebody who nobody who's a somebody knows) isn't evidence of a centralized organization with a wide breadth of control.   What I'm saying is that there is no way to arbitrate this dispute between interpretations.  Yes there is, interpretation is on a spectrum. Eventually you can fall outside of that spectrum. If somebody comes along and tells you "I'm a communist" and than goes on to expound on the nature of his belief in free-market capitalism, it's pretty obvious they're not communists. The same applies to Islam. You can have wonky Shi'ite sects for example, but if they're stepping beyond the source texts - there is no theological issue in establishing takfir...   I would argue that licences should be distributed to all affected (or should I say infected) countries granting them impunity when dealing with these monsters.  So basically, let's keep the cycle going...  'Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster' - Nietzche  Even these IS **people** are only the product of what they've collectively experienced. People like you, if you weren't a keyboard soldier, are the exact sort of people that join IS (or the other militias - depending entirely on your location of birth) - quite literally the entire problem in al sham right now...  	140
 Does Sony always get this advertisement space? I haven't seen anything non Playstation related on that space in a while.    Agree, that top down camera as the riders fly down the main straight is beautiful.    Brilliant   Pretty crazy to see that back then and see [this](http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/bmw-i8-test-drive-review-75.jpg) today. The car is the BMW i8 for those wondering.    Do you really think they are going to follow those rules?   Ah I didn't do the drawing unfortunately, my talent is the ability to be as useless as possible when it comes to drawing. Here's the artists page http://nathandearsley.blogspot.co.uk/   You will like this promotional video for Hankook showing their idea of the tyres in the future https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zu7GVfx6Ng   To this day I still don't know whether it was staged or real.    I wish mate, that was the only pit stop drawing from the artist.    [Pitstop](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iglgspq4lKo/VWt0nUWLC4I/AAAAAAAAAWs/RsoRGM_wPqo/s1600/mclaren_mp6p_photobash.jpg)   To be fair I wouldn't be totally against it as it did bring a fuck ton of money into the sport.    Credit to [Nathan Dearsley](http://nathandearsley.blogspot.co.uk) where you can see the rest of his awesome drawings and more from the MP6/P      Oh wow, guess this explains why he has never been able to make another film.    Why is that?   Final Destination 3D is the movie with the human meat grinder escalator   The show isn't out yet...perhaps that's why you cannot watch it.    so I have to wonder, wouldn't it get really tiring controlling the pod racer, considering your arms are always in upwards position?   Wait aren't Charlie Day and that other scientist dude also in Pacific Rim?   Oh wow, I didn't realise that Doberman's had naturally floppy ears, thought they were always pointy. Sucks that people mutilate them for their own vanity.    Is there any reason to crop the ears?   Are the books worth reading? Considering I love the game so far.    I know that feel, I remember when I bought my car back in 2012 and a few days later I saw a tiny dent on the passenger door.    Merchandise   I never understood this joke, can someone explain it?   Looks like they were filming a scene for a movie.    "You will go to sleep or I will put you to sleep..."   It's just so poorly edited, you have no idea what is going on when the main character is fighting anyone, and this isn't shakycam it's actually the editing, it feels so off. I feel the main reason for this is because it was PG-13 along with Taken 2 which had bad editing as well. Such a shame because if both films were still R-rated then we probably wouldn't have this shitty editing.       For a more recent big budget film I would say Taken 3. Man that was a struggle to watch.    "still learning"....   Meet the cop who can't be stopped.    You ain't seen Bad Boys 2?  EDIT: why would someone give me gold.   That's fucked up OP, sorry for the theft :( Some people, especially the ones with punchable faces are massive cunts. Hopefully you get your equipment back.    Well Tyrions cock didn't get sold to the cock merchant...yet.    I was 11 years old when this came out and I remember watching it at home and crying when they left him in the forest. I was afraid my parents would do the same to me :/   I get that there are monetary incentives but wasn't the game crowdfunded? If someone who runs an AMD card pledged money to the developer and then the developer goes and takes this monetary incentive which they know will segregate those who have an AMD card, then isn't that developer ethically obliged to reject the NVIDIA's offer?    Some clubs here in Sydney have a $20 cover charge. I'm gonna assume a lot of the big nightclubs in major cities a have a hefty cover charge on weekends.    Can someone explain why people collapse the way they do when shot? It's so different compared to what movies and television show us.   indoor soccer   According to IMDB he is born in Kashmir, India. So yeah pretty cool.   Dat RT score tho   Stupid question but does insurance cover this?   AVP: Requiem (the sequel) was. Not the first AVP film.    Maybe if the game is received poorly they can avoid all the victory related puns/headlines that will go alongside it lol   I think the game on your own can be a bit of a grind but supposedly the best way to experience it is by joining an active corporation (guild) since i assume they all help each other out to unload the grind a bit.    Konami took down their own E3 conference this year.   Depends how cool the trailer and music is.    Lol mate you have to be joking. AoU was nowhere near as bad as you remember it. Yeah that scene where he walks up to an old John Deere tractor they don't even sell anymore which is contextually located in it's natural habitat, A FARM, combined with his character making a snarky pun... Or that 2 second shot of Quicksilver grabbing Adidas shoes out of his closet? Your examples suck and the fact that you tried to say that the product placement in AoU wasn't as bad as Transformers shows why no one has taken your opinion seriously.   Take your [pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4YwLlB9daM) and rethink your argument.    To be honest the product placement in AoU wasn't THAT bad. It's only obvious if you try to notice it in my opinion. The absolute worst offender is still Transformers 4, the "Beats Pill" product placement was just absurd.    Did I just see Ari Gold throwing meat at a bunch of hippies?   Cheaper to air reruns than produce their own content I assume.    I'll never understand why they cast non-australians in that role.   BOOM   He has an eye infection and the doctors said that he has to avoid exposing it to artificial light.    Also a good time to bust out that Oakley sponsorship.   Obligatory, The Grey. This wasn't a bad thing however.   Well to be honest I am extremely excited for both, however Mad Max comes out next week where as Star Wars comes out right at the end of the year, so I think in a few months the tune will change.    I really like what the Wachowskis do, even if their films can be quite flawed at times, I have still enjoyed them all. This show looks really good and hopefully they can get whatever ideas they have down better in a TV format.   To be honest I wasn't hating the film, up until near the end when   SPOILERS  Dave Francos character crashes his car on the bridge, it was so stupid how he didn't "die" and escaped that. Also the reveal that Ruffalo was the last horseman was stupid as well.   I agree, I just hate having to reference the movie so my friends get a visual understanding :/   Chances are that it may be quite expensive to license any Pink Floyd song.    [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85mbsD_5_U) for ze lazy   Same here! I really thought they should have capitalised on the different houses/corporations and what they owned, the drama between the warring houses would have been much more interesting than the story of the two main leads.    I thought it was an Oculus rift or an oculus (mirror).   Why? Just get a dock for your phone if you want to use it in traffic, the law states that you cannot hold it in your hand or on your lap unless the car is parked on the road and the ignition is off. Last thing we need is more people NOT paying attention to their surroundings while in traffic. All it takes is one person at the lights who sees it has gone from green to yellow and then takes off at the intersection and causes an accident.    ***YES***   For clothing you could always have a look at [ACRONYM](http://www.acrnm.com/). They are expensive however, but from doing some light forum browsing, the quality seems to be worth the price.    Yeah sucks man :( I was fortunate enough that the PS3 version had all the DLC minus The Arrival since that came out after I believe. But to still charge full price for the DLC in this game is frustrating to say the least.    This baffles me so much, I owned ME2 on PS3 but bought it on PC again for better graphics/framerate etc, however the DLC is still ridiculously priced and it has never gone on sale.    Really? Although some of the Roger Moore films were entertaining, he looked way over the age a Bond should be. Not to mention during his stint we got some of the most absurd Bond films *ahem* MOONRAKER.   I'm not sure whether you understand just how difficult it is to do backwards compatibility with the new gen consoles, considering their architecture vastly differs from the previous generation of consoles.    Awesome edit, it also hilariously highlights how bad the lightsaber battles in the OT are compared to the prequels. Makes it look like the lightsabers in OT are claymores compared to a more Katana like weight in the prequels.    Also Hersh did a selfless act towards the end, I haven't seen Control do any such act.    I think Control will die mainly because her character itself is pretty fucking evil, kidnapping people, torture etc. However I feel she will die whilst helping Team Machine.    Was the show doing well in ratings before it was cancelled?   So legit question, what do you do to NOT piss it off?   It's super expensive to make unfortunately. Look at Final Fantasy: Spirits Within, it was a more mature animated film which pushed the boundaries of computer animation, but in the end it bombed. Now there's a variety of factors as to why it bombed (which may have been prevented) but it was a very expensive bomb which seems to have had a lasting effect on the green lighting of these types of projects.    I guess the soundtrack to Alien Isolation is pretty damn close since it uses similar themes to the film.   The look on Martin Scorceses face at the end says it all.    http://i.imgur.com/QZBOL.png   Most MCU one's are in my opinion. The best marvel property posters are the ones FOX made for The Wolverine. Check out:  [Poster 1](http://www.thewolverinemovie.com/reveal/assets/images/fb-share.jpg)  [Poster 2](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/the-wolverine-poster-silver-samurai.jpg)  [Poster 3](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/the-wolverine-poster-yukio.jpg)  [Poster 4](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Jean_Grey_The_Wolverine_poster_2.jpg)  [Poster 5](http://whysoblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/the-wolverine-viper-poster1-610x906.jpg)   EDIT: Yes i realise that wolverine isn't MCU   Oh wow that's a big one, never saw this poster thankfully.    I dunno, even in the shitbox Ferrari he had last year he was able to pull off some amazing manoeuvres, so if the Mclaren is awesome next season, then I think he could be at the top again.     Don't get me wrong Hamilton is a great driver as well but he is almost always at the front  with quite a margin, so I feel we don't get to see him do too much in the way of defending or overtaking (at least for now).    So we see trailers that more than often end up spoiling a film, but are there any posters that have spoiled a movie in a particular way?    His overtakes were sublime  [Hungary w/commentary from Ricciardo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfb3vbBfLW0)  [Ric faking and overtaking Vettel in Monza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9zC-95bzv8)  [Ric overtaking Alonso in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5dC7VA0Vjo)  He just put on too good of a show in that car last year, he was always doing something interesting.    umm, yay?   Might be because the Batman V Superman trailer was already scheduled to be released, while this one isn't.    I think [this](https://www.facebook.com/thebucketlistlife/timeline) is it.    Fuck those are some expensive Shapes.    Would they be allowed do that?   Damn one more lap and Kimi could have won, still a phenomenal race to watch.    omgggg   Maldonado is the bad luck Brian of this year's season   Bottas sounded like a bot in that transmission    Grace Bros still exists in Australia? I thought they all became Myer?   I have a feeling Tomorrowland and Fantastic Four will underperform.    The main issue with making a Bioshock film is that the main character doesn't speak. Unless the film is a prequel of some sorts to the first game, then it may be a very hard film to write.    Paraphrase, "compared to another engine manufacturer who has been in the game for one year, our problems aren't that bad"   JB taking a jab at Renault haha   Verstappen, assassinating Maldanado lol   This, the active red button also makes it awesome. I swear the engine noise sounds better on the driver cam than it does in the regular coverage.    Ah I see, TIL. Is Martini not a title sponsor for Williams, or is it a Sahara Force India situation?    backstory?   Mclaren don't have a title sponsor on their car, and while I assume they still make enough money from their other technologies to fund F1, surely not having a title sponsor is impacting their funding in some way right?    Luckily most of the European leg is watchable. The only races that will be tough for us are USA, Mexico and Brazil.    [Official countdown](http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront)   I just remember like 2 years ago there was just a placeholder date of 2015. So at the time you had all of these films + Avatar 2 releasing which made it even more ridiculous at the time.    I remember a while back that Avatar 2 was also planned to come out this year as well.    I don't think it's gonna be R...it's a huge budget film, which many children will be watching. To put it in perspective, The pirates trilogy was also PG-13 and it had some pretty dark things in it.    Feels weird, has the film grain been removed? It kind of looks a bit too fake, much like The Hobbit.   	112
 Hey Sev,  Great feedback - thanks a lot!  Picking a domain was a difficult decision. I'd like to buy the .com domain eventually but for the time being I'm bootstrapping so I'd rather start to build a community first. The reason I picked the .io domain was to first appeal to the techy-foodies but you're right that it could be a barrier to non-techies who tend not to trust non-standard domain names.  A lot of people fed back to me that they thought the site is cluttered. I've added a small amount of padding around the images like you suggested and a few other changes which hopefully helps for the time being. I'll continue to make changes and play around with things to make the site a clean and user-friendly as possible.  I'm also tempted to move the search bar (or I call it the panel) over to the right hand side. The only issue with that is I think mobile users are used to having a menu button in the top left-hand corner...what do you think?  Thanks again for your great feedback! Joe   Thanks for your feedback! I really like your idea of switching the price and cuisine around - I've now made that change to the live site and made a couple of other changes to make the website feel a bit cleaner (particularly on desktop). I think the website could still be made cleaner but the current changes are a start. I'm currently a one man band and design is not my area so your feedback is really valued.   Hey oCheesus,  Thanks for your feedback!  I'm a one man band at the moment having coded it, designed it and now marketing it all myself. I did most of the work over the Easter bank holiday in the UK. But as you can see, I do not have a natural design ability. Eventually, I'd like to get more people involved that specialise in those areas.  I like the point system or giving users some sort of reward for their submissions. I'm a big fan of product hunt and I think I might take inspiration from their site to add photos and names of users next to each submission (or something similar).  I made a couple of changes to the UI last night based on feedback I received on reddit. Hopefully it's a little cleaner (particularly on desktop). Still further to go but let me know what you think in the meantime.      Hey everyone,   I've just released [Food Finder](http://www.foodfinder.io) into an incredibly crowded space.

 Later on in his speech, Sanders talks about how many Americans are working more than 40 hours a week. If we don't need people to produce, why are we putting in so many hours?    That would mean about1 person out of 30 in the area attended the Bernie Sanders speech.  I know there must have been out of town attendees and it is hyper-political progressive Madison, but still, that's a pretty impressive percentage of the area population at any event.   And Honda Fit's.  Suddenly every third driveway in my neighborhood has a Honda Fit.   I'd say it took about 20 years for gay marriage to go from a fringe issue to mainstream acceptance.  I'd expect the polygamists have some work ahead of them.   I think Tom Coburn (former Republican Senator OK) [summed up](http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/tom-coburn-on-2016-gopers-cruz-and-walker-not-ready-for-prim#.oq0jRkpnQ) the Wisconsin recall the best.  Coburn said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is not ready for primetime in my opinion. He said Walker didnt win the recall election in 2012 but Republicans around the country did it for him.  Wisconsin was flooded with outsider money which propped up Walker.  That and a lack of decent Democratic candidates to oppose him.    I hope he is.  I was there. Who do I speak to about my check?   These sorts of crowds aren't unusual for Madison. 30,000 came to see Obama in 2012. **80,000** people showed up to see John Kerry in 2004. OK, it was John Kerry and Bruce Springsteen, but still, Madison is a great place if you're a progressive Democrat and want a big turnout.   Or perhaps he's a Democratic plant ...  Look I just started my own conspiracy theory.   Indeed, early in the negotiating process with Walker, union leaders said they would concede to his demands for higher employee contributions to pensions and health care if he would drop his insistence on gutting collective bargaining. The governor said no.  It was never about money.  It was about reducing the power of groups that support Democrats.   Citing a department study, Bratton has said that he doesn't believe the large drop in stop and frisk activity -- from nearly 700,000 in 2011 to about 47,000 in 2014 -- had any impact on the shooting increase last year.   I'd say most of this article supports, rather than refutes the conclusion reached by Washington Post.      Vote for Scott Walker -  because you don't want any rights or protections at work !!!   They're going to get their instructions and [boilerplate legislation](http://www.prwatch.org/news/2015/02/12743/wisconsin-introduces-verbatim-alec-right-work-bill).    Walker might even have trouble carrying [Wisconsin](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walkers-wisconsin-approval-rating-drops-in-latest-poll-b99482677z1-300128921.html). He hasn't been doing himself any favors back home recently, and while Wisconsin skews right in off year elections (when he won his elections), it skews left in Presidential election years, when people like Tammy Baldwin get elected easily.   He should. It would give him a good cover for some of his more inane pronouncements.  "I'm sorry I said that, but I was totally baked".   I wouldn't be surprised if he got that many, or close to it.  Progressives in Wisconsin are a bit keyed up by events over the last 6 years or so. Also it's Madison.   With his wife?  I'm guessing they had either a very short or a very solid marriage.   For me , it was mostly just listening enough to get familiar with his music. Some years ago I had a long commute and and old car with a broken radio.  I had a copy of Free Jazz in the car, which I though was OK, but pretty strange. But for the entire week I kept forgetting to bring another cassette out to the car, so I probably listened to Free Jazz nine or ten times , and by the end of the week I couldn't remember why I'd thought it was weird.    The analogy I use for Ornette Coleman (or other forms of outre music) is to compare it to painting.  If you went to a museum and were expecting to see realistic visual representation and found yourself in a roomful of say, Jackson Pollock and Paul Klee, you'd probably think.  What is this crap, these guys can't even draw.  But if you spend some time with it , you realize they've decided to take the art materials and do something completely different, something with it's own logic that is completely different from representational art.  I think Ornette Coleman more or less reinvented jazz music, the way some visual artists reinvented painting.  (Don't take this analogy too far or it starts to break down.)    That was probably a good rule. Some years ago I was on a business trip in San Antonio and was at a place across the River Walk from Dick's.  Some of the patrons at Dick's  were dressed up as giant condoms and most of the rest seemed unsteady and boisterously drunk. At eight o'clock in the evening. On a Tuesday.   I think Jindal is not seriously running for President. I think he's auditioning for a Fox News commentator spot.   Can't they both be right?   I have matches !!  Go ahead, take 'em.    No one wants to live in a country where the government coerces people to act in opposition to their conscience.  Such as being forced to pay taxes for an illegal war in Iraq?   Dale Knapp, research director for the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the states current budget woes are in great measure self-induced. Walker and Republican allies in the Legislature gave themselves no cushion for error in their bet that broad tax cuts would jump-start the states economy and more than pay for themselves.  When the new projections didnt materialize, we put ourselves into a hole, Knapp said.  Tax cuts pay for themselves - the conservatives most enduring fantasy.        Indeed, the reasoning is flawless and the sourcing is thorough.   Or some gun owners might decide to join up with the invaders. Can't say it will or won't happen, but groups deciding to side with the invaders has happened often enough in history.    In explaining the weighting of categories, to some degree, Minnesota benefits from a trend that we have sought to reflect in our study this year, the network said. Rather than just seeking the lowest taxes or the highest incentives, companies are increasingly chasing the largest supply of skilled, qualified workers.  So, the quality of your employees is more important than low taxes and  wages?  Hey Walker , Brownback , Jindal , et.al  - You're doing it wrong!   Judicial tyranny in this context means 'a decision Mike Huckabee disagrees with'.   A juvenile, yet completely accurate comment.   They were named after a song by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6UMtWi5rX0), who was a pretty good songwriter himself.   Scott Walker 2016 - Hypocrisy without Limits   I'm seeing a campaign slogan here     I think the mono-culture started breaking up earlier, in the 70s.  I don't remember any radio stations playing, oh say , David Bowie, P-Funk and the Doobie Brothers. Although I would have listened to one if they did.   It's a subtle difference, but ISIS is destroying ancient and irreplaceable archaeological sites, which is not quite the same thing as objecting to the display of a replica of of a 19th century flag.  But  anybody could get those two mixed up.    A bit rich, coming from the guy who [stated](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html) his strategy against unions was to "divide and conquer".   A small price to pay to protect their freedoms!      And don't forget about [this problem](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/22/8824579/lancet-comission-climate-change).   Hey Matt, right now Rand Paul is at [20/1 odds](http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/us-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=791149) to win the Presidency. Why don't you put your money up and collect on a big payday?   Scott Walker - the billionaires' best boy.    Blaming the poor - a political trick that never seems to fail.   Unfortunately, that attitude is limited to neither high school or Reddit.   I'm guessing that they want an excuse to go on a fact finding trip someplace warm.   Deciding when a citizen needs to be denied his rights and removed from society is one of the most important decision a government makes, and a corporations profit or loss should not be a part of it.   Sometimes, like in the quote above, I find myself cheering Paul on, thinking "Someone is finally showing some courage and making sense". And other times, say when he presented his tax plan, I think "This guy is dishonest or an imbecile".  Does Rand Paul have this effect on anyone else?   Ted Cruz , always a master of [good taste and timing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/03/ted-cruz-joe-biden_n_7507284.html).   But illegally sold or obtained.   And Scott Walker will be telling us that ISIS is trembling in fear because he busted the school teachers unions.   I'm really looking forward to Paul Rand and Donald Trump exchanging ideas at the next Republican debate.    It's a bit [more complicated](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/12/gun-rhetoric-vs-gun-facts/) than that.   Straw purchases and corrupt dealers seem to be the most common ways for criminals to obtain guns. Stolen guns are less common. [Source](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html)   Or for that matter, how many crimes are committed using a gun that don't involve killing the the victim? Intimidation with a gun can work both ways.  Edit:  Found one [source](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/GUIC.PDF) for the information, although it's pretty dated. But 20 years ago,   According to the Victim Survey (NCVS), 25% of the victims of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault in 1993 faced an offender armed with a handgun. Of all firearm-related crime reported to the survey, 86% involved handguns.   And to complete the insult, Walker is handing out [free money to 'job creators'.](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-jobs-agency-gave-loans-credits-to-firms-without-financial-review-b99523031z1-308521291.html)    itll be interesting to see how the Catholic GOP presidential candidates react to what is basically a searing indictment of their entire worldview. (Dibs on the campaign slogan Debris, Desolation   Filth: Vote Republican.)  They'll handle it fine.  What's one more bit of hypocrisy?   I think there's another reason.  Admitting mistakes requires some emotional maturity.    What I want to know is what it will take for Brownback to admit his 'experiment' has produced negative results?      And Scott Walker wants to [take it away](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/03/28/wisconsin-eliminating-weekends-koch-idea-nation-slave-labor.html).    Gun violence is the US is [eight times higher than in Canada. ](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/depending-how-advanced-is-defined-obama-was-right-about-gun-violence-2015-06-18). They don't have the same problem as the US has.      John, John, John. Putting the needs of your constituents ahead of ideology?  It's simply not done.    Seems to me the Pope wants us to be less greedy and more concerned about the inadvertent harm we cause the world's poor by warming the planet?  Wouldn't we be better people if we did that?     I like to imagine a big sign on the border greeting the tourists from Illinois.  Visit Wisconsin's lakes and woods!  Now with more toxins and pollutants!   Not to mention this [one] (http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-wont-comment-on-camerons-disputing-statements-b99521441z1-307893591.html). Walker is really a lying sack of cheese curds. I don't think he'll hold up any real scrutiny.    I'm with you there.  Some of his pieces could be used for audio torture (Einstein on the Beach) and some of them (Aknaten and his [String Quartets](http://www.amazon.com/Performs-Philip-Glass-KRONOS-QUARTET/dp/B000005J35) ) are  among my favorite pieces of music.   Absolutely.  I try to up vote people who disagree with me if they're making a genuine contribution to the discussion.  (Although I'll admit I don't always live up to this standard.)   It's just like the Nazis treated the Jews in Germany before WWII ... because the slightest imposition on or criticism of conservatives is always just like Nazi Germany.   She's certainly no Bernie Sanders, but compared to what we'll get if Scott Walker and Paul Ryan are free to reshape the laws and economy, ... shudder.   I particularly like the quadrant graphic, showing how Clinton is trying to get the voters to perceive her.  Wealthy doesn't mean you serve only your own class, and coming from modest circumstances doesn't prevent you from being a toady to the rich.      Hillary is lame. It it's scandals you want, [Scott Walker](http://scottwalkerwatch.com/) has accomplished a lot more in just a few years as Wisconsin governor.    Making it harder on the poor and easier for the rich. How all these putative Christians legislators justify their actions is beyond me.  I'm almost certain Jesus said we were supposed to the opposite.    Walker has left a trail of slime a mile long.  His history of corruption and dishonesty really needs to become national news.    One truly stunning thing about Coleman was how many years he made great and innovative music.  His brilliant album, The Shape of Jazz to Come was released in 1959, and the Pulitzer Prize winning Sound Grammar came out in 2006, 47 years apart.  Who else, in any genre, made great music for 47 years?   Indeed.  But we sure were fortunate to have him for as long as we did.  Coleman was one of the most important musicians/composers in jazz history, on the level with Armstrong and Parker.   Sound Grammar. Coleman's great late album.    Republicans do prefer strong leaders.   Eventually, they'll figure out that the party that's concerned about the 'job creators' will do nothing for the 'job holders'.   As he watches the early days of the Republican primary unfold, he sees candidates speaking out on poverty and showing compassion, a departure from previous cycles, particularly 2012, where he recalls many candidates forgetting the conservative heart.  And I'll bet he said it with a straight face.   They won't find a better puppy to server their purposes then 'Scottie' Walker.   Wisconsin has a large tourist industry and this can only help.  'Visit Wisconsin's great outdoors.  Now with more toxins and pollutants!'   Hound Dog Taylor.  Because I imagine your uncle could use cheering up and nobody in blues was more fun than the Dog.   And the economic value the University of Wisconsin brings to the state?  Somehow Walker never seems to mention it.   Here's an idea.  Legislators should put their duties to the electorate ahead of their pledges to a lobbyist.  Think it will catch on?   Well a real fox preys on "birds and small mammals like squirrels, rabbits and mice. A large part of the red fox's diet is made up invertebrates like crickets, caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles and crayfish." . That list of animals is a pretty good metaphor for the Fox News audience.   Then I'd guess you'd agree that Walker's promise that his policies would create 250K jobs in Wisconsin was also asinine.   Privatization is the slipperiest form of crony capitalism.  Obscene payments under the guise of providing a service.    50%.  I don't believe I've ever heard anyone state the number is that high. Perhaps you could show us your calculations.   While Fox News is busy [smartening everybody up](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/05/28/donald-trump-for-president-why-billionaires-candidacy-is-no-joke.html) on the crucial events.   Interesting.  How much of your money is spent on those items?   The conservative view on government funding is: There's always a reason why 'those' people shouldn't get anything, but my need is different and deserving.     I'll bet Paul Ryan (R-Wis, and head of House Ways and Means) is still saying his supply side incantations. It's not going away quickly.    I was thinking more along the lines of buildings or statues.   [Eric Dolphy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimpUKVAbY8). Ought to be more memorials to him.   I think Rubio just wrapped up the surrealist vote.   The most rigorous research study availablepublished in 2011 by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute and conducted by Heidi Shierholz (now the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor) and Elise Gouldcontrolled for 42 variables. **It found that right-to-work laws result in lower wages and a lower likelihood of health care and pensions for union and non-union workers.** It also shows right-to-work laws have no impact on economic growth.  Working as planned, I'd say.       I do wish more people realized the number physical and economic problems lower class parents face.  You can read a lot of twaddle written by respected columnists (especially one named David Brooks) about how their problems are caused by moral failings or inability to plan long term and misses the obvious issues in the lives of poor families .   Christ almighty, is there anything more short sighted than skimping on education?  Hey Repubs, you want America to be able to compete in a globalized world?  You want an economy that can support you in your retirement?  No? Well then you're on the right track.   Rep. Craig Gagnon (R-Abbeville) is now my favorite Republican.   I wasn't intending any criticism of your business. I don't anything about landscaping business in Texas (or anywhere else for that matter.)  I was pointing out if that for Americans, working in landscaping is probably an OK job (better than fast food or other service jobs), but for some one on a visa, especially someone without much education, it's probably one of the better opportunities they'll have. I'd be surprised if the visa laborers didn't take the job more seriously.  It's a good chance for them and losing it would probably cause them more difficulty.    That's why I said if you were able to pay 20.  My point is that the quality of American worker you get for 10/11 isn't going to be the top shelf, and  if you compare them to immigrant workers, who are probably some of the more ambitious people in Mexico, American workers are going to come off as lazy.    Here's an idea, let me know if it seems to match up with your experience.   For 10/11, you're probably not getting the best people in the American labor pool. But for the visa workers, 10/11 is much better than they'll earn at home.  Hard working people from Mexico want these jobs. If you were able to pay 20 an hour for laborer jobs, I would guess you'd get all the competent hard working Americans you'd need. Edit: Grammar and clarity   I don't think people should be down voting this comment. Asking me to back up what I said is a useful contribution to the discussion.    I'd say this headline sums up most of what you need to know about what's wrong with the American economy and justice system.   All these fact checking news sites have their flaws, but you don't get these kind of [ratings]( http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/) when you're adhering strictly to the truth. [And this one.] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/02/04/scott-walker-wants-to-drop-search-for-truth-from-the-university-of-wisconsin-mission-heres-why/) A drafting error?  While this is a [highly partisan site](http://www.alternet.org/story/150170/20_of_the_biggest_lies_told_by_wisconsin_governor_scott_walker), and you may want to discount some of it's claims, most of them are properly sourced. Not to mention his dishonesty about his intentions. His signature issue, Act 10 to eviscerate public unions, somehow didn't get mentioned during his first campaign during governor.  Or that his intention was to [divide and conquer](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html)  Wisconsin's unions.    They shouldn't. The guy is a lying sack of cheese curds.   And expand slavery into the western states.    Actually it was more a spend and don't tax situation. The high tax and high service model can work, the low tax and low service model can work, but the high services without taxes to support them fails every time.   Not to mention that Wisconsin's income inequality is [growing faster](http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/mike_ivey/wisconsin-income-gap-widening-faster-than-nation-as-a-whole/article_acc8a776-a0be-11e3-a5f1-001a4bcf887a.html) than the national average.    Yet virtually ever Republican in Congress voted for it.  Makes you wonder about their judgement in other matters, doesn't it?   Walker would like us to believe that the state's dismal economic performance on his watch is everyone else's fault. He's blamed Jim Doyle, Barack Obama and Mary Burke among others   I never understand why politicians can get away with this.  They make ludicrous promises (Walker promised his policies would create 250K jobs) and when they fail to deliver, it's everybody's fault but their own.  Arrant puerility, and it's coming from people who are leading the country.   Funny how all the right wing pundits who blame the poor for their lack of morals never get around to addressing this sin.   It's not just Fox News . Slagging an unpopular groups (i.e. people of African descent, native Americans, immigrants) is an old and unfortunately effective play.    Apparently they blame Obama for the gaps in the law's coverage.  Some people just can't be wised up.  He and his wife dont blame the state for not expanding Medicaid, or themselves for waiting until illness struck to sign up for insurance. According to Helms they blame President Obama and Congressional Democrats for passing a complex and flawed bill.    But the [money thrown away](http://legis.wisconsin.gov/LAB/reports/15-3highlights.pdf) by Walker's Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation? Fuggedaboutit!   Anyone who criticizes America's economic system must be a socialist. Or a communist. Or maybe even a realist.    Here's a [link](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/DC-Decoder/2015/0303/Wisconsin-going-right-to-work-What-s-the-impact-for-jobs-and-incomes) for anyone who'd prefer a more balanced discussion of RTW.  	116
    My friend crashed (pranged) his car and got done (booked) for speeding.   I'm certain it was a fixed camera, fixed to bridge/road sign.   He's going to tell them they're dreaming.   One of those sneaky commas snuck in there like a little bastard.      Perfect execution.   A bluewafflemachine and a redwafflemachine makes a purplewafflemachine.   The red or the blue wire?      I've only just joined this sub so excuse my ignorance, but I keep seeing plants in glass 'pots'. I thought terrariums were plants in glass enclosures?   Young magpies are normally grey. I've been told that there's a whole family of them nearby.      The bike wouldn't need too much to get around.   Haha. Like saying "a redditor who needs no introduction, here's Slip_85!". I get it. But I have endless trouble uploading imgur galleries, and by putting the name of the van in the title I thought that should've been enough. Maybe I should have put 'link for the lazy'.    More [here](http://kiravan.net/).             I found Sinister's [opening scene](http://youtu.be/gf1S81eEqNQ) to be pretty effective.   Quan from Regurgitator.      Noice.         I like to think that if the ball *had* gone out of bounds, that it would make the odds of making this kick even harder. Either way, it's impressive.       Now, we wait.    The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another his mother called him WILD THING! and Max said  ILL EAT YOU UP! so he was sent to bed without eating anything.  That very night in Maxs room a forest grew and grew and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through the night and day and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are.  And when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws til Max said BE STILL! and tamed them with the magic trick or staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all and made king of all wild things.  And now, cried Max, let the wild rumpus start!  Now stop! Max said and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper. And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.  Then all around from away across the world he smelled good things to eat so he gave up being king of where the wild things are.  But the wild things cried, Oh please dont gowell eat you upwe love you so! And Max said, No!  The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good-bye and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through the day and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him and it was still hot.       Basketball. Haw Haw Haw ^^your ^^^sides.      I'm almost certain his initial reaction was to try to help. It was possibly a family member inside the diamond in which he knew was in trouble, so his body reacted before his brain could tell him not to. It was very much a fight or flight scenario, and until something like this (well, not *exactly* like this) occurs, it would be hard to imagine what you would do.       This secret cameo will be revealed in the commentary!    As much as I already love watching them play live, I would love to see a big production make its way to Australia. Oh well, QOTSA are going to more than make up for it I guess.    Not just [once](http://i.imgur.com/CIAOAO2.png).      *goosh*    Haha thanks, I don't normally submit from my smartphone. I was so busy making sure it didn't autocorrect to r/orthopedics.   Not that it matters, but which part was a lie?    When you have badboys like [these](http://i.imgur.com/EE9vic0.jpg) lying around, you can get caught up in it. Check out the fake debris.   This is the most logical and rational comment. I didn't know that the displays were mockups until I saw the styrofoam, and I thought it was mildly interesting. This seemed like the best place to post such a thing.    Well now, does it win?   Five dollars.   Woah, woah...calm down tiger.       [This](http://i.imgur.com/fYnAhRQ.jpg) is a better view, where the case is visible.      If I know anything about skateboarding, it's that for every trick like this, pain comes with the territory.      Thanks, Mom.    A reoccurring theme with comments as such, is that they come from users that don't contribute anything themselves. If you can't make it any better, don't try to make it worse.   That's an excellent reference, thank you.   I find the creepiest things are when things seem almost normal. It's normal but unnatural, which has an unnerving effect.      	56
    It's actually two parts, neither of which are clickbait or nonsense.  Part one, a link to an article showing a concept of a Nintendo phone. Not my article, nor do I get paid for page views.  Part two, a discussion of what you think about the concept of a Nintendo phone.  That's it.   That would be ideal and could get the functionality out to market with low overhead, but you would be missing out on the retro styling and cool factor.   I think it works well as a concept, and it might be something that could work in a few years, but you're probably right about the lack of infrastructure support.   Probably not, but it's a fun concept to think about.            Thanks! Purply is one of my favorite planes of existence.     	10

 Yea that's one of the things I've heard, I'll have to do some research on it   Do you have any recommendations for beginner programs? I have been lifting since last september though, but not too seriously until a few months ago when I finished school and started the cut, and have seen some good muscle developments and have been able to increase what I'm lifting despite eating at the deficit.      I think this is the main reason for the difference   So I have two different packages of plain cashews, yet one has 310 cals per 1/3 cup and the other has 227 cals per 1/3 cup. Why is there a difference? Shouldn't it be the same since it's the same food?   	5
 NFL-related people only por favor.   Please link to specific photo.  Thanks!   I came across this photo... http://i.imgur.com/ZkMNFZz.jpg ...and thought it was remarkably unsettling in a way.  Was curious which other photos come to mind that elicit a similar response or other odd feelings.  (They can be out of context, in context, or whatever.  Stars in other jerseys is weird, but I'm looking for all sorts of strange.)  Thanks!  Edit:  Grammar is fun!   Windhorst is a creepy stalker in my opinion.  Here's a candid picture Windhorst took of Lebron and his son during the All-Star break (that Windhorst then posted to his public twitter page).  Lebron should ask for a restraining order.  http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg  Edit:  Grammar.   I love these parent/child videos and pictures.  Here's a picture of Lebron with his son in Atlanta tonight while they watch the Rockets/Warriors game.  Such a striking resemblance.  http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg    I believe I can fly.    Candid photo of Lebron and his son watching Rockets/Warriors tonight. He looks just like his father. It's remarkable... http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg   Heaven.  http://i.imgur.com/1nyFEUu.jpg   He still doesn't look as old as his father at his age... http://i.imgur.com/HEfegqC.jpg   !  ?   Today is a good day to pause and reflect.  Lots of positive/negative emotions last night.  Curious what's swimming through people's minds since there isn't an NBA game on tonight.  Thanks and have fun!   Awesome subreddit just needs a few little tinkering-fixes and it will be Finals for Pacers!  Edit:  Other pictures next to posts like the NBA logo, etc are stretched as well.  Maybe it's an easy fix in the code?  I'm not a mod (yet) so I'm not sure what to do.  Thanks!   My idea is for a meta film of Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin trying to get Coneheads 2 off the ground.  It explores issues such as crowd-sourcing, product placement (in a different way than how wayne's world did it marvelously), aging stars, new forms of comedy, CG vs props, Aykroyd talking up his Oscar nomination, who really has clout in Hollywood, Lorne Michaels as a gatekeeper, Curtin's built up resentment of Akyroyd for the ignorant slut joke,reboots vs remakes vs one last final hurrah, rights to the characters, etc etc.  It doesn't really start with Dan and Jane wanting to do the movie, it just kind of blossoms over time and they ride the wave, attempting to get off the wave from time to time, etc.  There would be multiple scripts for the Coneheads sequel, and about 3/5th of the way in, it would get even more meta as all of a sudden the projector would screw up (kind of like the muppets movie) and we realize that the Dan/Jane movie is a movie within another movie that we're watching about trying to get a movie about Dan/Jane making Coneheads 2.  And the producers having problems with marketing that film and reshoots, ethics of using unused Farley footage, and what is too ironic/complicated, etc.  I would have story and screenplay credits as well as an executive producer credit.     Edit: Spelling and whatnot   Could be the person who encapsulates the idea of the NFL for you, your favorite player, whoever swims around your head most, etc.  Just the one player that would come to your mind most often/first/etc when you think of the NFL.   I'm curious about the anticipation of the championship.  We cannot know exactly what would happen in the eyes of NBA fans if Cleveland wins it all this year, but with him going back to Ohio, the Love situation, etc, etc, I'm curious what you think the aftermath will be.   How do you guys honestly think the Deflategate circus will play out?  Not what you hope will happen (and/or your sense of karma).  What will ACTUALLY be the end result of all of the appeals, possible civil suits, press conferences, PR battles, fan outrage, etc, etc.  Looking for the final outcomes related to the league office, teams, players, and their reputations (which obviously will be different from various perspectives).  I personally think this whole thing is beyond dumb, but the drama, emotions have been interesting.  Thanks!  Edit:  Grammar is fun.      You can just put them in numerical order like this...  1.  Team - reason why 2.  Other Team - reason why 3.  Another Team - reason why 4.  Last Team - reason why  Or perhaps two of them meet in a Super Bowl for the first time each?  Or one never makes it EVER.  You can mention the year you think they'll make it, etc etc.  It's just whatever your brain predicts.  Have fun and feel free to explain your answers.  	18
 What on earth does knowing about what to look for in a cast-iron pan have to do with misogyny?   I'm a girl!   You're only partially right here... after 1900, the content in manufacturing cast iron cookware changed, and it continued to get worse and worse each decade.  Even a low quality pan, *properly seasoned* will stand up to a ton of use and abuse... that said, I'm not surprised that it was the handle that broke off... a lot of people think you only need to season the portion that is used for heating and cooking, so it's common to not be as vigilant about caring for your handle.  If you're into Griswold, the thing to look for is an italicized name in combination with a fire-ring... that is the best damn pan you can buy!  :)   Great!  Although, I want to tell you that you might want to go Linen in the summer and Bamboo in the winter, the bamboo tend to hold moisture, so if you're like most men and sweat a bit throughout the night, things might get damp. :)   If you like Egyptian Cotton, you should think about getting Linen or Bamboo based sheets.  Contrary to popular belief, a super high thread-count isn't desirable if you're not buying a high-end sheet... It will pill.  Get yourself something in the range of 300 - 400 and wash them a few times, it'll be just as soft, but more durable.  I'll let someone else address mattress pads.

Where do you think the propensity for straw men on reddit comes from?    A great example that comes to mind was the infamous Father's Day post in /r/askreddit about why men had abandoned their families... not a single post in there talked about fatherhood, merely about the devil women who they were doomed to pay out the ass due to an unfair custody battle... How many men could the casual redditor actually know in real life who were fucked by an UNFAIRLY biased court system to believe it is a serious issue and worth bringing up every two goddamn seconds?  I can't help but think we wouldn't have guardian ad litems if it were as cut and dry as reddit makes it out to be.     The knowledge that Anthony Hopkins had a short-lived career in the 1980's as a pop star.  Here is his one and only single: [1986's *Distant Star*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cz_mNW6S_w)  You're welcome.    Really, Grumbler?  What kind of shoes do you spend your premium budget on?  Now I've just got to know...    Your dad is trying it now... you seriously made my night.  You have a great time, man! :)   If you say "orange" really slowly, it sounds like "gullible."  Just get yourself a shot glass and six beers and do a Power Hour.    Communicate effectively.    What has stopped you from adopting a reasonable hand washing regimen?    Yessss... I love my Griswold collection.  My babies!    Pretty much any toaster... buying a new toaster is pretty much like finding a spouse... it's going to be heartbreak after heartbreak until it isn't...   I definitely appreciate that you're trying to help me, but he is an introverted person who would never consider therapy.  He has had relationships prior to me, some for simply sexual means.  He is 11 years older than me, and a seven times daily marijuana user.  This is what I chalk it up to.  No amount of communication on the issue has helped me.  I talk, he responds in monosyllables and then goes away. It kind of is what it is.  He's a smart, kind person who is a wonderful father and lets me be myself in almost every other regard.  I think this is probably as good as I can reasonably expect.  You can't win them all.     A-fucking-men, man.  That shit kills your soul.  I've been with my husband for just about five years now.  He wants to have sex maybe an average of once per month.  If I could pick my perfect scenario it would be 3x a day, a day off, repeat.  So it's pretty exciting when it finally comes around... but when he just rushes through everything and doesn't even kiss me, I feel like I'm dying inside.  You shouldn't do that shit to the person you're supposed to love more than anything.    What has your wife done exactly that causes you to believe that she is an unfit parent and thus doesn't deserve custody of your child?   Well, I have to say that it's like pretty much every other huge life-changing event... people say cliches about it, so you imagine it'll be a certain way, but then it happens and it's nothing like what you'd thought it would be.  I don't think about my 8 month old daughter throughout the work day very often, but when I do, I'm hit with a heartbreak feeling and I miss her so much in that moment that I could start crying... it's very strange, because you only really feel those overwhelming feelings when you stop to think about them.     You mentioned that you're an English teacher... what is some required reading you would like to ditch from your school curriculum and what would you like to sub in?    The best revenge is living well.  This is none of your business, stay out of it.    I subscribed... your hustle is real... good for you! :)   Hard drugs.  Out of the bedroom physical violence.    Here's a great one for you: I have dyscalculia... I am beyond terrible at math and numbers... instead of burning myself out trying, I devised a guessing method.  Using the assumption that they will always try to get you on a rounding or order of operations technicality, I narrowed from four to two answers by spotting the two that were closest together.  Then I just guessed between the two.  Using this method, I scored a 16.  This was score was higher than average the year I did it (2007).  Edit: Sorry, I took the ACT... scoring is different.  Still... I'd assume it would be very similar since the tests are largely interchangeable to colleges.    It's absolutely more difficult to etch on a woodblock BUT you really should check your course descriptions... almost all beginning printmaking classes deal exclusively in linoleum prints (which are SO MUCH fun....).   I'm sitting on 11 crebbits right now, but I bought them prior to the Chooting... how do you know these persons aren't the same and just spending them in a way to illicit a reaction?    Well, in my mind it is less of a stretch of your technical cognizant skills as an artist... in intaglio, you're taking away an area that will then look like a highlight... in relief printmaking, you're taking away an area that won't read as a highlight until you ink and pull a print... it's much more intellectually stimulating.  There is also the enjoyment of the deferred image... there is just something magical about putting all of your work into one object, and then pulling something startlingly different from all that work... it's amazing!     I love relief printmaking... it's wonderful if you like a process and are a perfectionist. :)   Well, why do you think that?  I don't actually think we do, I just think those "one-hits" haven't stood the test of time... I remember my mom asking who played the song that was on the radio, and I said to her "Buffalo Springfield," and she literally accused me of making up a band that had Neil Young in it.  One hit wonder... Warren Zevon? One hit wonder... Norman Greenbaum?  One hit wonder.... Pure Prairie League?  One hit wonder... I'm sure there are countless others that just didn't stand the test of radio play time...    I would switch to an extra soft bristle rating and keep doing what you're doing.  The other poster is mistaken... you cannot brush your enamel away, if you could, they'd damage your teeth by de-scaling them in the dentist's office... you can, however, brush your gums into trauma if you use too firm of a brush in combination with a strong stroke.    /r/benfranklinfanclub   Duck abuse.    I would let it die out with me.  The infant mortality and mother mortality rates have gone down significantly due to medical intervention... suppose you take that risk of impregnating your partner and then run into complications?  Is it worth the risk?  Even if everyone gets out alive, how long will that baby live?  It's a risky business if you ask me..    Yeah, I got that, but you can tell by my answer that I don't think what happened the last two days is relevant.  I do it to make the day of a random user... I don't see my paltry $30 every five months as a significant profit for reddit and I don't actually have an opinion on Pao's alleged reign of terror.    Telling the kid "Don't cry..."   Hello, male suicide rate.    Ross is also my favorite character... probably since the only thing he ever said that resonated with me ran deep.. I am ALL ABOUT making sandwiches out of Thanksgiving leftovers.... a "moistmaker" sounds like a pretty good idea to me.   People who have never gotten it before get really excited about it... I like to give it out to people who make me laugh or renew my faith in humanity.   I can't stand Friends... it's just not at all funny to me.  I thought maybe I was too young to get it, but upon it coming to Netflix a few years back, I found out, no... It's just not funny to me at any age.  I think it's because I don't find a single character on the show to be relatable.  They're all very one-dimensional.    I don't know that it's an even split, because it assumes that we're all working.  There are plenty of potential voters who are disabled or retired or simply unemployed.  I'm trying to think of a good incentive, but I think the only thing I think would work would be the opposite... a fine.  In Argentina, it is illegal to be of voting age and to not vote.  The penalty is a fine.  We all care about money, I think this would be the only thing that would resonate at every level.  I wish I had a more positive answer for you.    [Here, I got you this.](https://menssuitsleo.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/8-style-tips-for-short-men/) The model (you) is everything... yeah, on a damn table, it might look geriatric, but I doubt you're going to scroll through this and think "Man, paging Mr. Rogers..." unless you're determined to do so.  I don't find any of these men boring to look at.    Okay, those are some interesting thoughts... but we're looking at a very real difference in ideology insofar as taxes... typically your lower-income liberals are not going to be enticed by a tax break since they over pay to get a big refund... a tax break is really only going to appeal to conservatives who are already going to the polls anyway...  I don't think you're right in your thought that the money saved would be funneled back to the working class through their employers, that's pretty idealistic.  I think offering a tax break is very akin to Voter IDs... it would just be another subversive way to ensure that only conservatives find voting attractive.    Okay, let me try to help you... I think you should look into getting yourself some corduroy pants (it was like pulling teeth to get my husband to buy a pair for our wedding, but then he wore his to death for four years and I had to throw them out in the night because of holes.... most comfortable pants he ever owned), a sweater collection (lots of variety here homes, you can be Nero from Sons in a Cardigan, rock a sweater vest like a cute little hipster, or go classicly preppy in a nice pullover).  I think you should hop on over to Uniqlo.com for styling inspiration... it doesn't have to be boring.  I wouldn't be caught dead in slacks and a polo either.    If he thinks guys pants suck, he should try putting on a pair of professional women's pants... you can't breathe, they cut in, and the pockets are merely decorative.  I weigh 104 lbs... These pants are the right size... hips and high-waisted pants cannot co-exist.    How would a 1% tax break even in theory save money?  I'm very confused...   Edit: OP don't down vote me because I asked you for clarification on your question....    Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdeasForAskreddit/comments/3bxj7n/megathread_subreddit_shutdown/   *TL;DR: Fuck me against a wall with your hand around my neck to make me orgasm.   I like it when a guy isn't self-conscious, asks for what he wants, takes control.  It's a turn off if he talks himself up, I'll believe you and inevitably be disappointed when you don't live up to your own hype.  Girls are not all the same, you might've been the best oral sex your ex ever had, but that doesn't mean you're the best I've ever had.  You'll know you did it right if I walk into the wall on the way to the bathroom.    Cautionary tale : If he's 11 years older than you, he's too old for your youthful bullshit.  Ahahaha! :-|   I flirt with my husband probably about eight times a day.. he pretty much just ignores me.  Occasionally he'll call me crass.     You need to check your ends for breakage.  Color damages your hair and broken hair doesn't appear to grow.  Changes in diet can also contribute.  I'm guessing it's just time for a trim.    I think we established this when I said I had a 31 inch inseam and no torso ;)  Also that I have a thigh gap and C-cups... Believe it or not, I have almost no fat on my face... what you're seeing is cheekbones.  It's very weird.    Ahahaha.  Well, I'm not.  But I appreciate the sentiment.  I'm at a BMI of 22.... which is in the high-mid range for my height.     Ah well... I was really thrilled when "thigh-gap" became a thing... I've had one my whole life and thought it was some sort of knee deformity... FINALLY, a genetic jackpot!  Wee!   My sister had breast reduction surgery... the doctor wouldn't take her below a B-Cup saying he needed to ensure an "aesthetic result."  If I have to have drains put in and go through what she went through, I'm not getting less than what I want, which would be flat as a board.  Watch me get diagnosed with breast cancer now.    I'm only a C cup, but I would have them cut off if I could just because they get in the way.  I'd like to be, uh, willowy.  But it's just not in the cards genetically.  I figure my daughter will be about 5'3" though... I'd be shocked if she wasn't.    Okay, we're moving out and into a place with central air.  Then we'll make ice cubes on the countertops and we'll never be sad or too warm again.    Yeah, the pregnancy definitely made me uncomfortable... I had trouble breathing from the time I was four months!  Curse my short, short spine!   I'm moving in.    How dare you... I might be under 5' but I also have a 31 inch inseam.... I'm basically nothing BUT legs, sir.  (I can't wear a belt without looking deformed, but hey, belts are stupid... they just pull your pants DOWN if you're a girl...)   You know I'd miss you, and I'd notice you were gone in about 48 hours. ;) Please don't ever go on vacation.    I can tell you from one stolen glance at an ex who was scarfing down a pizza that it can actually do irreparable damaged.  The immediate image when I hear his name are those bulging eyes.  Be very careful. (I haven't peeked since.)   Right? The fact that we eat as a social activity is really mind-blowing when you think about it... it's pretty much the most unattractive thing ever.     Only if he's Peter Dinklage... although, I think he might actually be taller than me.... Um... really, anything over 5'2" is fine. It's not important.  I just so happen to be 4'11.5".   I have a baby who is drinking formula.  The US Government has straight up said that they approved an over-floridization of water.  My books tell me I'm supposed to give my baby unflorinated well-water or risk her teeth coming in streaked white... that's pretty fucked up...    It costs me $33/month with Culligan... install was about $70.  They change the five filters every six months.   I know you had a run-in with her the other day, but I actually think you should take a look at her comment history and listen to that Warren Zevon song "Reconsider Me."    /u/hugsouffle That Aussie is hilarious and warm.  She's also nice to other women.  We could use more just like her.    I don't care for baseball, I feel like it has a lot to do with numbers.  I do, however, love le cheeseburger.    The question was "What do you do that gets a lot of unjustified hate?"  I gilded this : "Listen to Eminem and jailbreak my phone."  I thought this was HILARIOUS.    Yes... that's why I rent a reverse osmosis filtration system for my drinking water...    Taking their insecurities out on other girls.  We should be raising each other up.    I have two dream jobs:  Lead singer in a Warren Zevon cover band... this is never hiring because not enough people listened to Warren Zevon to make a cover band appropriate.  Person who names paint colors.... this isn't a real job in and of itself.   The dream is over. :(   CRAWL Magazine... they have awesome customer service.  They're an off-road mudding quarterly publication that will totally send you free stuff if asked. :)   I swear I'm not being snide or difficult, I'm asking as the parent of an 8 month old... how can you have a child and no expectations from your partner? Teach me your secrets!    No joke, I would probably date you in a hot minute.  There is nothing wrong with being one in 120,000.  You're amazing!    The secret is to actually not need anyone outside of yourself.  If you know that there are five more people who would kill to be with you, you'll project this and it makes it impossible for guys to then take you for granted.  I moved in with my husband after we'd been dating for two weeks.  We got married at 1.5 years.  We've been married for almost four years, we own a house, two rescue dogs, and we had a baby last year.       I identify as a feminist and I love reddit.  I'm not a crazy sjw, and I'm actually more passionate about educating people on race issues.  However, it seems because I choose to not let a few crazies scare me off from the word, I'm presumed to be one of those crazies.       [Prepackaged "Baby Carrots" are, in fact, full sized carrots that have been whittled down.](http://www.healthfitnessrevolution.com/baby-carrots-less-nutritious-lie/)   Do you mean socialize them with other animals, or do you mean with people?   That was the subtle humor.... ;)   "Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue" by Toby Keith needs to be on your list.     Didn't he try to steal "Keep on Rockin' in the Free World?"   Born in the USA was some guy in the 80's.....    This is mega appropriate: From watching George of the Jungle, which I was just pointing out as a must-miss comedy.  Ahahaha!    George of the Jungle starring Brendan Frasier comes to mind...    There was this god-awful news story about a child pornographer who was arrested in my city... because it's not a huge city, you couldn't really get away from the coverage, it was a really big news item... He lived with a girlfriend who had a 5 month old baby girl.  The baby girl was featured in the footage he was selling over the web at the fire department he volunteered for.  My mom told me about it and having a two week old baby, I lost it.  I was inconsolable for about two hours.    That I meant what I typed or that the average ages were that in 2004 or that girls are waiting longer or what man?  Because one of them, I can't prove technically, since I'm the source, but the other two, I can dig up for you if you're that passionate.   Thanks for the edit, here's mine: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37853719/ns/health-sexual_health/t/surprising-sex-statistics/   I'm not sure why both these other posters think I made a typo here.  I meant what I typed, although my statistic was outdated... In 2004, this was the case.  These days apparently girls are waiting longer than boys on average in the US.    I was 16.  He was 18.  This is the statistic median in both cases.    This should probably be posted at /r/morbidquestions ... those guys know their stuff.    Absolutely!     Dude.... this leads to NECROSIS of the penis... If this is actually happening to him, get the fuck off reddit and go to the ER NOW.   That's so irresponsible of Instagram! :(  I'm sorry this is happening to you.     I really enjoyed Rango... it was so offbeat and clever.     Sounds like your imposter is Catfishing people.  You get a following if you cyber with people on the internet.  Can you report them?  That's so not cool...    I used to work at a Gamestop.  I was going to go out into the mall to get a soda on my break... on my way out this guy came into the store and said "Oh! Are you leaving?" And I said, no I'm just going on my break, but if there is something I can help you with, I can do that first.... He said "Oh no... I just came to see you."  And then he left.  Two weeks later my co-worker noticed that this same guy was following her car from the mall parking lot in his car.  She had to drive to the police department.    I can't take it if a man doesn't wear a t-shirt or undershirt under his dress shirt... like I ever want to be looking at your nipples or your chest hair in a business setting... this is way unprofessional.    Nevermind... this is the only answer.    I think initially, it feels exactly the same... it's a difference you grow into.  My mother described it, quite pithily, as being like a birthday.  I feel different now, but you know, it's been nearly four years and we have a child together now.    How about slow building up to fast?  I think that's the only answer.   A Scanner Darkly   	101

 Look into *A Piece of Cake* by Cupcake Brown.    Lately I've been biting off more than I can chew with the books I've been reading. I've been reading some dry nonfiction or very dense classics and haven't been getting much joy from it.    I need an easy read that will remind me again why I love reading. I'm hesitant to say what books I like because I don't want you to overthink your recommendation. I'm just looking for something easy, not horribly long and a page-turner.    I think the opposing team gets to pick who shoots.    It's almost like the award is based on an 82 game season and not the most recent 6 quarters.    7 point game at the half and everyone is ready to give the Cavs the ring right now. Calm down, people.    ??? Both games have gone into overtime. What else do you want?    He's that fucking good.    Well, we play the Padres a lot.    Heston must have thought there was only one out.    Only 74 pitches too.    More like Clark's desert boots.    LeBron wearing white socks with black shoes. /r/malefashionadvice would flip if they saw.    Pitch count after two: 52/14   How is Philly's bullpen? I have a feeling we're going to get to it early today.    What a day for sports. Giants baseball, Champions League final, and a potential triple crown winner.    I hate being sad when Dodgers fans are happy.    Don't push it too much. Getting punched by a fist full of rings hurts.    Their GDT are lucky if they break 100 comments.    Boneshaker's in Rocklin has good tacos and beer. If you want to go to Sacramento, try Azul on 20th.    Remember when Chris Stewart was an easy out?    Caitlyn Jenner looking good in The Solar Company commercial.    That was strike 3 to Pagan earlier.    At this point, I don't think his ceiling is very high.    Confirmed. Would plunder booty.    No one told Belt that it's not May anymore.    Who do I talk to about ordering sexual donuts?    I'm glad to see this comment. I actually bought the shoes this afternoon in anticipation of pants that I ordered last week finally arriving. So, I know the pants are the weak spot in this outfit, but by the end of the week they should be the strong point.

Can't wait to wear them out.    What is the general rule for pairing ties with outfits? I've been shopping for ties lately and I struggle to visualize them with the shirts I own.    What would you wear [this tie]( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0402/4577/products/IMG_1844_copy.jpg?v=1405656294) with? I just bought it because I thought it was awesome, but I'm not sure what it would go with. Ideally, I would pair it with a shirt sans jacket.    Read a magazine. Lately I've been trying to buy magazines on subjects that I know very little about in an effort to expand my horizons a bit. If you enjoy it, great. You might even discover a new hobby. If not, you only wasted a few dollars and the time it takes to read a magazine.    Grunting guy needs to stop. This is a family show.    It was scored a hit, but it would have been an error for any other short stop.    [Who Timmy reminds me of when he wears the flat brim hat and do rag]( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyvtmfqPia1qzkotso1_500.png)   I was being sarcastic. Will seems like a great guy :-)   Dude just wrote on your ball?! The nerve...   When you finish cooking the steak, put some mushrooms and onions in the pan with some wine and cook those for a few minutes.    The Dodgers are getting rained on right now. I swear to God I'll die if they get out of facing Michael Wacha this series.   In bed with an ear infection. I need these antibiotics to kick in asap so I can watch the game.    How tall is Amy G? She's eye to eye with Belt. Is she standing on something?    Nay    You'll notice the same guy in red pants on the arcade and the same boat out in the Cove. Every time.    Has anyone else noticed that when the CSN graphic comes out of McCovey Cove it's recycled footage and not live?    TJ surgery in 2012. He was never the same.    Who is the guy talking to Heston in the dugout?    What was the question?    On the current roster, only Belt, Crawford, Aoki, Panik and Blanco bat lefty/switch. Of those guys, Belt and Crawford have the most power. My bet is Brandon Belt gets #69 this series. Hopefully I'll be right where I am now: sitting on my couch.    Edit: Well, it's not #69, but I'll take a opposite field HR to break the 0-0 tie.    I've been using the terms interchangeably, but there's a big difference between [this](http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m32homu6aA1r3s2t7o1_r1_1280.jpg) and [this](http://imgur.com/BqPOWow).    It's always winter in San Francisco.    It's okay, guys. We can stop booing him now.    *"Hnnngggg, I need that"*   He could be useful to another team. He is a stud defensively at first base and he knows how to work a good AB.    Can someone explain to me why those Rockets fans had chef gear on?    I'm no doctor, but it doesn't seem like an injury that can be aggravated by playing. Worst case scenario is he's just ineffective.    You think a hold is equal to cocking back and elbowing a guy in the face?    If only the Browns could return to the glory days of Tim Couch.    My opinion is that he would look great in orange and black.   As frustrating as it was to watch him this year, he always had a good attitude and by all accounts was a good clubhouse guy. I truly wish him the best. He wasn't getting it done on the field, but I'll still root for him to turn it around.    Unfortunately for him, there's not really a spot for him on the team. His defense isn't good enough to be a big league third baseman and we don't have a use for another first baseman, at least not as much as we could use another bullpen arm. It sucks because he's raking this year.    So we still don't know what this means for McGehee? He could go to Sacramento or opt to be released?    What exactly does it mean to be DFA? I've been a baseball fan for 15 years and I still don't know. Sometimes it seems like it's basically equal to being released, other times it seems like it's just a send down.    It's the exact opposite of what we're used to in SF, so it's stressful to watch a game played there. I've heard it's one of the nicer parks though.    Woohoo! Baseball!    There's no way we get two games in today in this weather. I guess it will be the W's and UFC 187 to get my sports fix in today.    Sounds like a dick to me.

It's a nickname and it's pronounced KEY KEY. Still offensive to the Jews though.    I'll take "Phrases in my browser history" for $500, Alex.    He literally didn't get a hit this season until Saturday. Scrub.    The salt in the /r/Dodgers gdt is so tasty.    *Juan Uribe is a Rembrandt*   Yes. I posted the same picture a few months ago with a story of how he was stealing my gains.    Keep your back straight and your core tight. It's what he would have wanted.    [Here's the recipe for my grandma's Mac and cheese](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainitmeals/comments/2ln927/just_recreated_my_grandmas_macaroni_and_cheese/). I think it's great.    I don't need to tell any of you how important having a good lifting partner is and I was fortunate to have a great one for 11 years. Unfortunately, his health began declining rapidly in the last week. This morning, he entered Swolehalla. I'll continue to lift without him, but I like to think he'll be spotting me in spirit.    Here's a picture I took of him right before he set a PR.   http://m.imgur.com/HMLmOQe   [Going to a country bar tonight and my buddy and I want to dress the part as best as we can](http://imgur.com/a/bFECB)   Land's End shirt/belt   Levi's 513   CDBs    Anyone know if that GMC commercial with Jeremy Affeldt where they talk about pitchers who paint the corners being called Rembrandts is played around the entire country or just Nor Cal?    Like this one a lot!    I like this a lot. Looks stylish without trying too hard.    [Business casual]( http://imgur.com/a/4MqgN)   -Land's End shirt/belt  -Tie Bar knit tie  -The pants/shoes are both from a local store. I'm waiting on 2 other pairs of pants (khaki/olive) to come in the mail.   http://imgur.com/a/4MqgN   Trying to dress a bit nicer for work. I'm waiting on a pair of khaki chinos and another pair of olive chinos. In the meantime, I have these off white things. How does this outfit look?    http://imgur.com/a/Fr61u   I bought this shirt to pair with khaki chinos to wear to work, but does it work with jeans? Could I wear this successfully to a bar?    http://imgur.com/a/HHLIp   I'm really just looking for an opinion on these boots. Can they be worn with jeans and a button up shirt if I'm just going out to a bar with friends? Any other suggestions for making them work? I bought these a long time ago, but I'm not a big fan of black boots. I hate letting them just sit in my closet though.    As someone who has never followed Bellator before, where can I watch the prelims?    This isn't true. I received my degree in social sciences last year and in none if my classes was it so much as hinted at that non-whites can't be racist.    At least Joyce didn't blow a perfect game again with this call.    I've been hearing recently that McGehee is playing injured. I say we put him on the DL until he's healthy, then platoon him and Duffy until of them wins the job.    I called the company last night but the package had shipped yesterday afternoon. I'll call UPS today to see what they can do.    I ordered a pair of jeans from Levi's last week. The money was withdrawn from my account, but I never got a confirmation email. Should I be worried?    [This]( http://imgur.com/a/HIUPg) is what I wore this weekend for a wedding. First time I've had to dress formally since high school 4+ years ago. I probably won't have to dress formally again for awhile, so I didn't want to put out for a full suit, so I tried to duplicate [this look](http://imgur.com/IbMzgfd). Jacket is from Nordstrom Rack, shirt/tie/pants from a local store, shoes from Ross. Hair product is Murray's Pomade.    As much as I'd like to see it, I don't think so.

 Can't wait to see Idris Elba lose another loved one!   [Alan Partridge's Lip Syncing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ei0-wq9AqQ)   Most notably to me, Funny Games.   That is amazing. How did you get such fine white detailing? Eraser?   Nah man, you're an artist. And a pretty trippy one at that.   Me too. That was a positive statement.     The Drop, tho.   Dude   It looks like a lithograph from an old novel or something, particularly an old copy of Huck Finn I had. I love it.         I love them all. Somehow I never caught Inherent Vice in theaters, and I've been waiting to see What We Do In The Shadows since I saw the trailers. Thanks.   Oh yes it is. Watched it with my very conservative mom once.   How the hell did I forget Four Lions in my description, it's one of my favorites. And I love In the Loop.   I'll have to check those out. Thanks for the list   I've been meaning to check that out. Thanks   Of course   Two of my absolute favorites      Love em all. I've seen all the Coen Brothers stuff more times than I can count, all of Guy Ritchie's best, and I've already seen Kingsman twice.   Thanks. Always happy to watch a classic.   I'll check it out. Which version? I'm guessing the original?   Definitely. I love everything Coen.   Oh, most definitely. The Naked Gun is amazing, and Airplane is one of my favorites.    Love it.    I just watched Alan Partridge and absolutely loved it. That dry, quick humor that's constant in the movie is my favorite. I watched The Trip as a follow up, and it was moderately funny, but not constant enough to have me dying like Partridge did.  Other movies with the kind of humor I'm looking for are In the Loop, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Rushmore, In Bruges, The Guard, etc.   Any suggestions?    I just saw The Boy Next Door in theaters yesterday.  It was hilarious fun to watch with friends, but it's far and above the worst film I've seen in a while.   Whoever edits these How To's is amazing. The timing of the cuts and the music makes the videos 10 times funnier.   If the script were written by a woman would it have been okay?   Anthony Fantano?   Joaquin Phoenix and anyone.   Especially Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line, or Amy Adams and Scarlet Johansson in Her.   Just thinking about it gives me chills.  "Not many people in California have basements."  "I do."   I can't tell from your comments in this thread: do you get upset when people use "underrated" incorrectly?   I also watch Last Week Tonight.   It looks really cool, and almost like Jennifer Lawrence. I think the eyes are too high, though. But what'd you use? The textures are great.   Well shit. I feel all cold and cynical now.   I guess I took it as too much of a legitimate guide to the underlining themes of The Shining instead of a documentary about the cultural phenomenon it became and the obsessions it created.   Thanks for pointing that out to me.   Really? I found that movie to be pretty worthless, if not frustrating.   There were a few people in there with interesting theories and neat analyses, but they were overshadowed by the idiots talking about random shit.   What was that lady talking about the drawings her kid made? Or the guy trying to prove Kubrick's face was in the clouds?  Plus it didn't seem very careful production-wise. It was more than obvious that everyone recorded themselves at home with mics of varying quality and no concern for background noise. I remember hearing kids pplaying behind some of the speakers.      1) The King of Comedy  2) Goodfellas  3) Taxi Driver  4) Wolf of Wall Street   5) After Hours   Her.   Yeah the original was a bit spooky for me.      Myers actually later agreed with Kanye and said, "I'm, like, super proud to have been next to him."   The darkest of the dark.   Which is why Plemmons played Hoffman's son in The Master.   You are a crazy person.   That's what it was! Thank you so much.   I remember hearing a bit about being able to tell a lot about a man by how ugly his wife is. That's really all I remember. Any ideas?   Your dad is the coolest lookin motherfucker I have ever seen. ^So ^crisp.   Don't forget how great Gone Girl's sound mixing was.   cool   /r/gaming:/r/games::/r/movies:/r/truefilm   /r/movies is more of a casual discussion forum about film while /r/truefilm is more hardcore cinephiles discussing actual film theory and what have you.   I had a friend watch Antichrist on her first date.    Where'd you find this?   It's very bad.   Bad enough to where it should be funny.   It's not funny.   That's just water.   I hope you and Carter became the best of friends.      /r/ShittyHDR   [Amazing soundtrack, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI4iCx7LnbY)   [House of Cards, anyone?](http://imgur.com/salcoMO)   Your choices are wrong.    I think a big part of the movie was the fact that there were plotholes. The scene where she's recanting her stories to the FBI people and any questions from the Sheriff woman are shushed because of the preconceived notion of "innocent little Amy" and the media's role in how people perceive the couple and treat the case, overlooked evidence against her case in favor of their unfairly biased ideas, are pretty huge. Especially with the whole Nancy Grace parody thing running in the background.   I'd buy.   I was uptoke 1234! Let me taste that sweet, sweet karma gold!!   Go look up the movie "Riding the Bus with My Sister". She plays a retarded person in what I supposed to be a very dramatic and touching drama, but it's one of the most unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen.    How'd you get the black speckling so perfect? It looks fucking awesome.      Kevin Smith constantly talks about how his movies look like shit because he has no visual style. At least he knows.   Kid Cudi's Cudderisback over the instrumental of Ottoman is one of my favorites   Z-Bo made the cops leave a party I was at.   A Worms video without Gavin is sacrilegious.   That's weird as hell. I love it.   Is that the Space Needle? Kind of inapplicable. Cool poster regardless, though.   Marty McFly on the drums   Hey, at least you got some gold.   Hey Adam, how do you feel about piracy laws?   I'm praying they add the store again. So much fun to be had.   It looks great except for the inside of the mouth. The crest of the tongue is too defined and makes it look like he has two big squirrel teeth or something.   It's sideways.   Big Lebowski. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. Punch-Drunk Love.

 Are they bae?   Are you talking about me, dude?   Boogies down?    Mad Twatter   It's a fairly normal thing to do.   Same, really. I've done one year of Uni and it was alright at first, but after Christmas it just become a drag. Now that I'm back home with nothing to do I simply play drink beer, play videos, read, or watch something on youtube/Netflix.  Regarding netflix recommendations, I dunno much about movies, but I watched Sin City 2 recently and it was pretty good. If you're interested in TV shows then Sense8 was a hoot, and I'm currently enjoying Attack on Titan, an anime.   Where are you from? I'm assume the USA from "summer break", if so, which state?   Happy bday dude   Hello everybody,  last night I had a dream and in this dream the power got shut down worldwide for a week  I wake up and see this article  In conclusion, buy a generator   Last night I was reading for a whopping five hours but only managed to bat out 200 pages, which is what? 40 pages an hour?   I have this mate who says he can read faster than that and flamed me.  "that's  not  SUPER fast m8 :P  no offense"  So, yeah. What tips do y'all have?   cause bae was in it   [ohhhh shiiiit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdza03XOmTw)   -70 for a harmless joke, oh boy   aka fap material   Shame he's a hunter   lovably so, though, jerkwad    NO GAVIN?!?

Downvoting the creator, thats fine   I want to lick Barbara and Mica's shoes.   She?   scared baby   Disregarding what you said about video games because it is irrelevant and nobody is talking about that (like really m8, what? where'd you even get that from?).  And yes, people being shot by police is obviously bad, but you're attaching a QQ sentimentality to it. We need to look at facts not "woah, what the hell, I can't believe that cop did that".  Thats how all cops get fingered (;)) as baddies.     Yeah, well...   to counterweight the sentimentalisation;  piss off.   Maybe if they gay? I'd take it right home and turn it into a cumbox sorta thingy wingy   thats what a butt pad is, guy   looks like he deleted what he said. For context it was him asking about rumors whether Jack and Ray maybe didn't get along all that much.   Maybe I'm just being more attentive, but Jack has been really, really funny as of late.   "Lol"  Screw you, dude   I want to lick Barbara's shoes.  why the downvotes?   Ah right, cheers. Personally I think people are too sensitive over stuff like this, but eh, I'm not the one getting affected by it so I guess I can't really complain much!

If one of my friends is doing a transmog run and I wish to tag along, I will always pass if a mount drops. Since I'm being boosted.  And its the same thing whenever they want to join on my runs.   What even happened with that? Why'd the co-pilot do it?    To be fair, quotes in title, it has been 12 months and its from a different subreddit.   Lol'd but felt bad   .   I dunno, that sounds sorta fun   .   Not really, dude. There is diminishing returns with this sort of thing. It'll taper off and you'll just remain at the same level, probably after a week or less.   Solar flares maybe   Different game I think, mate. I'm Romania in this one   I'm sure it has. Modern though? Useless.   Is it wrong though, sunshine?

 I wish I was this smart when I was 14   Sneak/lie your way in. I'm serious, if you're clever enough it probably isn't all that difficult. If your passion for history runs that deep make it an adventure and go.   If you're living with you're parents, move out and have them cut you off financially. Being independent and supporting yourself will be an immense source of newfound pride and freedom for you. Even if it sucks for a while and you don't like your job, it'll be worth it. You'll figure out what you like as you move forward. But like some of the other posters said on here, it's about moving in a direction, no matter what direction may be.   What would the job be? Would it be something you're interested in and how much would it pay?  Do you WANT to go to college? Or simply doing it to go through the motions because it's what people are "supposed to do"?   Apologies, I'm very ignorant on this subject, what is the significance of no visible craters?   NYers, myself include, don't take advantage of that website nearly enough.   Don't be lame.   Walk everywhere. It's the best way to experience the city. Pack a backpack up for the day with some water/book/laptop and just nomad it up around the city. Check out all the museums, parks, bridges, etc.   Beans!  Dried beans are super cheap, have no sodium/sugar and are an outstanding source of protein and fiber.

Step 2: Get valuable advice because you didn't antagonize anyone.   What's this? An actual analysis posted on r/nfl and not just trade gossip or rehashed discussion topics?   Oh you mean the Best Book Ever? Would definitely call $3.50 a bargain for it.   What translation do you have? Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have what's regarded as the best one, though the below article argues against their version.  http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/01/the-pevearvolokhonsky-hype-machine-and-how-it-could-have-been-stopped-or-at-least-slowed-down  That being said, the part of your day with the girl is far more intriguing.   How are you doing now? Do you feel stronger now that you've made it through this?   I can't recommend Rodney Yee's "Moving Toward Balance" enough.  I bought this book and started Yoga without any advice or direction and gained such a comprehensive and spiritual understanding of it. Reading this and exploring it on my own gave me a deeper perspective on it than friends that had been going to classes. He teaches you step by step with properly detailed photographs, but continually teaches you the philosophy behind this movement.  A few months after I had gotten into this, I talked one of my friends into doing the P90X Yoga video (an intense 90 minute workout). His mom stopped by while we were doing this and was very pleased, as she herself is a yoga instructor and enthusiast. She went into her office to grab "the perfect book for him", and to my delight it was "Moving Toward Balance".  EDIT: Including Amazon link  http://www.amazon.com/Moving-Toward-Balance-Weeks-Rodney/dp/0875969216/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8 qid=1436972841 sr=8-9 keywords=rodney+yee   Walk around outside for a bit, have a big breakfast, write down all of my reflections and conclusions from the trip. Writing everything down helps tremendously for me.   But is there an Earth twin?   Wow, how long does that typically take for people to complete?   During the day, and all I need is power/wifi. I was specifically referring to places within New York City, so while the poolside resort sounds appealing I don't think its a realistic option.   You can pull it off if you're careful enough. Keep in mind depending on your profession salaries tend to be higher in NYC.    Wow 1862, that's tremendous. Always worth checking out shops like that.   Browse the subreddit....   That quote sounds like the advertisements I see for books on the subway.   I use this pretty often- http://www.timeout.com/newyork   They're going to have a less-talented league play during the NFL offseason. The Goodell-Leviathan continues to grow...   If there's a specific team you have in mind, try emailing both the team and the broadcasting station. I wouldn't be surprised if most of team's had these stored digitally. At least for the Giants, whenever they put highlight reels together on their website they always use the radio announcer's version of it.   Whether it's a particular cafe, hotel, park, etc. Looking for a good place a I can post up with my laptop for the day and work.   It's become completely unbearable to watch.   Purchase it, borrow it from someone you know, or just post up in a book store all day and read it. I'm not even going on some self-righteous don't torrent rant. Watchmen is an artistic masterpiece and to look at it on your computer/ipad screen is going to utterly dilute your experience.  You should be able to find it used pretty reasonably priced on Amazon or Ebay.   I feel a lot of the same sentiments as you, but what is the point of this post? You want fans to justify why they like characters? There's a lot of Batman comics because people like reading about Batman. Get over it.     I think you may have forgotten to post the link   Walk the Brooklyn Bridge from the Financial District, Walk the Hy-Line on the west side.  EDIT:   It's also worth browsing r/asknyc, people post questions like this pretty much daily.   It couldn't hurt to by some foam/padding separately and put it in there, otherwise you'd be sacrificing the great design/function of the UD packs for something that can be easily customized yourself.   Nice!   I use Ally, top notch customer service and website/mobile design.    Congratulations. That's so awesome, and takes a lot of self-discipline and growth to accomplish, keep working my friend, be proud.   I have this and love it: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UR8AI52/ref=pdp_new_dp_review  For the price point it can't be beat. If you're willing to spend, the Ultimate Direction vests look like the best option as they seem to wrap around your chest completely and will keep the contents of your pack super stable.   Such a great spot   Show up in your work out clothes, fill out a form and give them your ID. Pretty much all of the gyms will let you have a day to try out the gym and see if you like it.   Anyone have experience purchasing land and selling it years later after the market in the area has increased? Would love a direction to be pointed in as far as resources I can check out to learn more about this process.    Thanks, bud.   Income(x) - Rent(x) vs Income(Y) - Rent(Y)   As a noob, you might as well be throwing your money on the roullete table. That's fine, as long as you're willing to lose it. This is coming from someone who's in the same boat as you, complete noob until about 6 months ago. The best way to learn is by doing though. If you have an iphone, I'd suggest the app RobinHood as there are no transaction fees, though it is quite restrictive in the moves you can make.   Just keep in mind you're probably going to lose a substantial amount of whatever you put in. As many in this community will tell you, unless you can do a top down evaluation of the company and rationalize what you're buy/selling, then all you're doing is gambling.   If you have an iPhone, RobinHood has zero cost per trade. Many restrictions in what's available, though.  As people in this sub will tel you, Vanguard is always going to be a superior alternative to the Wealthfront types.   Cook your favorite, tastiest dish, and sprinkle an ample portion of cocaine on top of it.   I'd throw it into a Savings account. Wait till you have $1000 in there and then open up an account with Vanguard using it (Pretty sure their minimum deposit is $1000).   I like betterment more. This site did some great reviews of similar services: http://investorjunkie.com/best-robo-advisors/   I've had a lot of the same issues you're bringing up (still do to some extent). The book The War of Art resonated with me tremendously, might for you to http://www.amazon.com/The-War-Art-Through-Creative/dp/1936891026.  Also I've found exercising affects me positively incredibly on my psyche. Don't know if this is something you already do, but regular weight lifting/running has been the greatest aid for me.  You're 100% on the right path, encourage yourself. To put things in perspective, there's many people that go there entire lives having the issues you've mentioned but never take any steps to improve upon them.    If you love it, then don't think of it as studying. You're simply engrossing yourself in something you enjoy.    This is clearly a spoiler.   That's disappointing to hear. Sounds like both him and Goyer behaved pretty childishly though.    The first Blade was a unique, tremendous film. Other two were pretty awful.   What happened during Blade 3?   Why is he a douche?    Yeah definitely don't take 2.  Couple more piece of advice: Do some exercising tonight/tomorrow morning. And meditate tonight/tomorrow morning. If it's something you don't normally do, check out r/meditation or google it for some quick tips, dosn't take more than 10 minutes and will help tremendously.   I'm completely inexperienced in what you're dealing with, but I wouldn't withdraw on the 401(k). Pretty sure you'll take a big tax hit, and will basically be undoing a lot of the work that investment was doing for you.   This is intriguing, and resonates quite a bit with me. Do you have some examples of what real economic assets you'd be investing in? I agree completely with your rationale, but am quite new to the investing world.  	64
    thanks for you quick response to Google.....      I'm extremely agree with you bro.   One tooth is blue....  	5
 It's such an amazing cotton candy look! I love it.     Hi!  I've recently misplaced my Force charger and was wondering if anyone had one they didn't need anymore.  Please let me know how much you'd like for it.  Thank you!!   Ours easily poops 3x-4x on each walk.  At the end it's just... Very very soft serve lol.  If we don't go on a walk, he goes 2x a day.  Definitely more if we keep saying "poo poo" lol.   I loved those books!!!  Soaking their bread in milk is what I remember most :D   Agreed!  We just bought the soundtrack and it's beautiful.   No, I'm clearly Benjy lol.   Howard looks great!   It's definitely slow.  I'm still working on figuring out other problems with it. But at least now I can login 100% of the time after disabling that backup plugin :(   Hi RedBull7!  I didn't post a link to my blog because I'm never sure if it's considered "promotion" or not on Reddit.  I always get so worried so I just figured I'd skip posting it until I was asked.  I did respond to Yurishimo after with a link to my blog as well as a list of plugins :)     Yes! That plugin is awesome.  It showed that my Ready! Backup was sucking up the most resources and I've disabled it since.  Jetpack is definitely #2 on the list and I'm trying to figure out if I really need it.  Thank you for your help standard_staples :)   I'm really such a noob and I'm not sure which resources it is lol.  My hosting company pointed me to the "resources" icon on my cpanel and it shows that I've maxed out the usage.  You were absolutely right on the backup plugin being the problem.  I've since installed p3 profiler and apparently the Ready! Backup was taking up the most juice. Since I've disabled it, the blog is much better.  Thank you so much for dropping in and helping me out :)   Hi jedidave!  I've never heard of Cloudflare and will check it out.  Thank you!   I was getting the 500 server error as well.  I figured it was because of my resources issue since I never had that problem before my blog started to slow down.  I definitely took your advice and took off a security plugin as long as quick cache.  I'm really trying hard to keep the list of plugins on my site to a minimum since I'm so worried about the resources issue lol.  Thank you for your help Yurishimo!   Hi tabrisrp!  I dropped iThemes and the Google XML Sitemaps.  Thank you for your help :D   Hi lingben! I downloaded that p3 plugin you recommended, and it helped SO MUCH.  Apparently Ready! Backup was the culprit.  I disabled that plugin and it's running much better now.  You're right, jetpack is definitely using the 2nd most amount of resources and I'm trying to figure out if I really need it.  I'm pretty sure my blog is slow because of me, but I will definitely check out webhostingtalk if I change my mind.  Thank you so much for your help!!   Hi texxs!  I do have access to my cpanel so I will definitely take your advice and deactivate my plugins one at a time.  If I can't get this to work on my own, I will DEFINITELY contact you.  This problem is really bumming me out.   Hi Yurishimo!  My blog is http://www.test_subject6067.com and the list of plugins that are currently activated are:  Akismet,  Albine PhotoTile for Instagram,  Fancybox for Wordpress,  Google Adsense,  Google XML Sitemaps,  IThemes Security,  Jetpack by Wordpress.com, No Right Click Images Plugin, Pinterest Pinboard Widget, Quick Cache, Ready! Backup, Related Posts Thumbnails, Wordfence Security, Wordpress SEO, WP-Optimize  *edited to organize the list of plugins  Thank you   Hi!  I have a personal blog that has been having some major problems in the past 6 months.  My hosting company says that I'm using up all of my resources and suggested I deactivate my plugins.  I have trimmed the list down but it hasn't seemed to help.  Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to fix this problem?  Thank you!   That looks so delicioussssss   That's my expression when I'm sick too hahahah.  I hope your puggy feels better.   The hashbrown part is really weird.  Maybe cheeseburger and fries?  I think this may be ok as a dip.  Definitely super gross as a soup.   Awwwwwww   I'm loving both looks!     I'm only on season 3 and so far it's been great.  I'm a little worried for he up coming seasons now... Ehhhh    I've been binge watching Criminal Minds and it's so amazinggggggg.     So pretty! I love the color combination and your cut.  Your whole look is beautiful!    Thank you!  That makes total sense.  I am indeed in LA.     That does help!  Thank you so much johnjgraff :)  I was also wondering why this lot wouldn't have a physical address.  It seems like there are addresses across the lot but not for the lot.  Why are lots always listed as 0?   Hi! My husband and I are currently interested in a piece of land that is zoned LARE20.  We'd like to eventually build a single family home on it and was wondering what it actually meant.  We were also asking for a physical address to take a look at the lot and the realtor just told us that it was LARE20... Any help would be appreciated! Thank you :)   Tres Tres Leches Cakes!   Exactly...but we're supposed to cut our water usage in CA so it seems like not watering our laws would be the easiest choice.  Nope.. not here.  F your showers... water your lawns!   My dog is pretty quiet, so his way of begging is by staring.  A few times at night I've caught him 2 feet from my face staring.  He wanted to go pee and I was watching a movie on my laptop in the dark.      You're not ticklish in your armpit???     You're not allowed to let your front lawn go yellow in my city.  Kind of stupid since I'm in California and we have a major water issue.     The Matrix.  I'm assuming since they don't have a grasp on technology, this movie would freak them out big time.   :(   Hi Trolol420!  You can definitely add a little bit of "extra" oil after the trace but some soap makers argue that you can't determine which oils become saponified during the process.  Since most of the saponification happen during the first 24 hours, even after trace it's still working.  I have no idea if this is true, but I have also read that some soap makers add more expensive oils to superfat the soap after trace.  Because they say that the qualities are retained.  I personally haven't experimented with adding oils after, but I don't see why you couldn't.  Jojoba is pretty shelf stable so even if there's extra I saponified, I wouldn't be as worried about DOS compared to grapeseed or flax oils.  I'm not sure if I helped or not lol lol.     I know that he's unbelievable unhealthy but.. i love him and want to squeezeeeee himmm so badlyyyyy.  Cuddle buddy!  Imagine all that room for tummy rubs :D   sooo freaken cuteeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!   Wooooo Las Vegas would really be nice.  Finally we won't have to pay $900+ to stay in a crappy hotel for 4 nights!  Late night steak and eggs, catch a cirque show, play some slots.... Vegas is definitely the way to go!     Those are beautiful!  Just wondering... does your mom happen to have a recipe for sun cakes? Those are my fav :D  	41
 Part of it is the area Charleston is difficult to find a job outside of culinary f b. I got stuck bartending for years until I finished my masters ( I am a teacher now). Here are a couple things you could do outside culinary but they may not pay as well, work for an autism intervention program pretty easy to get hired on but stressful. You could get an ESL certificate and teach, or you could try and find volunteer work in the field you hope to go into and hope a job opens up. What field do you want to go into? Do you have any connections to people who "got out " of culinary?   I know what you mean I have been there for two years this is the first time anyone has seemed ready to make the change. I bet you get more peoples wheels turning than you give yourself credit for.   That's awesome! I think living by example peaks peoples interest the same thing happened to me with friend who was Buddhist she just lived her life quietly but before I knew it I was asking her questions and reading books she had suggested. There is something to be said for letting someone come to you and offering guidance vs trying to force someone to see it your way. But I also wouldn't want to discredit anyone who is more vocal about it and creates change in a more aggressive way. There are many paths to veganism.   Seems to be more health motivated but I encouraged them to check out earthlings or cowpericy at some point. The chorus teacher had some questions about why I don't eat milk and eggs and I explained my issues with those industries I could tell he was a bit shocked to hear about it. The coach I think is trying to keep his weight in check but he has also had some great questions about the ethical side.   So I work at a high school and recently I have had several teachers take an interest in a vegan diet. I bring a vegan lunch everyday and bring a little extra for people to try if they want. The chorus teacher and his wife have decided to try being vegan for 6 weeks and I have given them cookbooks and websites to help them on their journey, and I am hoping it will stick once they see how easy it is. Also one of the wrestling coaches has been asking a lot of questions about my diet and he text me today to ask how to start a vegan diet. I am so excited for them and proud that just because of my vegan lunches 3 people are now trying a vegan diet!  Just wanted to share the good news with people who will get it .   It seems like you were trying to be original and find your style . at least you were never basic!   I believe you and its not your fault. I believe you and its not your fault.  I believe you and its not your fault.  Rape is very difficult to deal with I never went to the police for similar reasons but I did get counseling which was very helpful.    My parents didn't sit me down either . they answered questions when I had them after I moved out , but never really taught me about money. They did encourage me to save and warned me about credit cards before I left but that was pretty much it. It also depends on where you teach , I teach at a poor rural school so I don't expect everyone to have a lot of finance experience.   I do a budget project with my econ kids and it is a struggle to get through it. But every year after they have started college I start getting e mails thanking me for the project, because they know how to get an apartment fill out their fafsa and apply for a car loan. Even if they don't get everything know that they are getting something.   Having a system in place for everything. I spent my first year so disorganized, year two was much better but I have some things I want to tweak. If you think a lesson could be better go ahead and make the changes you will thank yourself next year.    Women who think it's OK to have a glass of wine every now and then while pregnant. I know that it probably won't do any harm but why risk it . you really can't give up wine for 9 months. And before anyone hose crazy I am a woman and I have given up wine for 9 months    South Carolinian here, sc is in the bible belt and there for subjected to blue laws which prohibit certain items from being sold due to moral reasons. For example when I was in college you could only by food and meds before 1pm on a Sunday. The bar I worked at had to close at midnight on Saturday because we couldn't sell any booze on Sunday. The idea was that people should be spending that time at church and with their family not shopping or getting drunk. We won't let you drink on Sunday but you don't have to wear a helmet on a motorcycle. God dammit my state is backwards.   He is very thoughtful most of the time after I explained it he totally understood.   Omg I had to explain to my boyfriend how tacky this was ,the fact that he didn't already know still causes me great concern.   I took it twice ( I got an Mat and hadn't had a world or us history class in about 5 years) the test was set up similarly like same percentage us world Econ gov questions but the essays were very different. I had to write one about the Chinese empire and another one I had to write about the transcontinental railroad.   Yeah ground and raw the trick is to put 1 part flax into three parts water and let it sit for a few minutes it becomes a great binding agent (egg replacement) for baked goods. I also will put it in with soy yoghurt and let it sit overnight , or add it to a smoothie which is kind of grainy and not my favorite but it works.   Check out founding brothers does a great job covering early us history   Hey I am all for trying the natural way before taking drugs. You have definitely given me some things to think about. I am sorry that I can't do the oily fish I know it has great health benefits but I haven't eaten meat in 17 years I feel at this point it would make me sick both physically and mentally. Do you have any plant based suggestions for omega 3s I eat a lot of flax and chia seeds so I feel I am prob OK o. The 6s   I eat 95% vegan I am on my feet all day (teacher) and practice yoga a few times a week. My skin is much better since I made these changes . dairy breaks me out with in 72 hours. I could definitely eat less sugar so I will try that change first. Thanks for the advice.   I have an appointment in June so I will see what she says but it has been so frustrating dealing with the break outs every couple weeks. I wanted to see if sca had some suggestions I could research before I go so I know the pros and con's of the products   I get hormonal acne but can't take birth control because I get blood clots. Are their any alternatives that could help with this? My current skin care regiment works well other than the week before my period. Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Diva cup is the best investment I ever made. Who knew I could grow so attached to a little piece of medical silicon   I really love teaching native American history unfortunately it has been all but cut out of my states us history standards.   Since you are touching on history I would like to bring up two men involved in the desegregation  movement just after the civil warBooker t Washington and WEB Debois. Washington believed in gradual steps to end slavery and wanted African Americans to focus on getting jobs that didn't threaten white people because of his approach he was able to get funding from whites to send African Americans to school who otherwise would not have been able to go. Debois believed that African Americans should seek full inclusion and pursue jobs as lawyers and doctors because of his efforts many were inspired to get jobs once thought of as off limits to blacks. Both men had a positive impact for their cause one approach was gradual the other was a bit more extreme. I think veganism is similar if it seems approachable to omnivores they may be more likely to try it . if you tell them how awful the meat industry is they may be more likely to try it. I think the end goal is the same and ultimately you have to go with what you think will be most effective.   Great advice !   Haha I was just thinking about learning to ride a motorcycle. I have always been afraid because I have awful ADD. But it does appear we have much in common. If you could have dinner with any 3 people dead or a live who would you invite and what would you eat?   I watch hardcore porn, travel solo , love camping and hiking, drink bourbon neat, and hate chick flicks. I have been told some of these things are manly but I think its just personal preference. I also do lots of girly shit.   Honestly I had to think of it like learning a new language. I had to practice everyday if I wanted it to get better. Even when I didn't feel like it even when I felt miserable in my new body I practiced my new thoughts. It is hard but worth it I still have days that I feel gross but they are few and far between. In box me if you ever want to talk hang in there it gets better.   Or bi   I dated a guys who was 38 when I was 24 we were both bartenders. he was a lot of fun at first but then I realized he liked dating younger women because he didn't want to grow up. After a couple months we split because I realized he had no ambition in life and an affinity for coke. We were different races so no one ever thought he was my dad or anything but we often got questioning looks from people.   I went through this when I was in recovery for my eating disorder. I started doing a guided meditation on body acceptance that helped me out a lot. Also I tried to pick body parts that I liked and focus on them after 6 months I was feeling sexy and healthy.    James k Polk is a good one Ohio is about kent state , born in the USA is ab coming back from veitnam .   I think that it is odd for a male teacher to hug a female student. Most male high school teachers are super aware of how things can be taken out of context and err on the side of caution. There should be no secrets about what a teacher does with a student especially when it comes to affection. If your friend is uncomfortable then she should speak up but like others have mentioned she should be sure about what happened because it could potentially ruin a good teachers career. Even if it is investigated and he is found innocent there will always be doubt's about that teacher. If she doesn't want to report it I think she could be proactive and tell him that she does not want to be touched. Hope that helps a little.   Noticed that at Sullivan's I used to live on iop it happens every once in a while not sure why though.    It sounds like she is being very manipulative. New vegans often go through a crazy my eyes have been opened now I need to show everyone else phase. However it is often better to lead by example than try and force someone to become vegan which is exactly what she is trying to do. Ask yourself this do you want to be with someone who will try to manipulate you into doing what they want or someone who will try to educate you and then let you make your own decisions. I am guessing that this type of behavior will extend past food eventually. With holding affection in any relationship for any reason other than you genuinely don't feel like it is a bit crazy.   	35
 That Verizon one pissed me off. That one I forgot, but it was so blatant.   My ticket in 3d was under $13. And I live in CT   There's one scene I remember where it's basically a zoom in on the Mercedes logo then after about 4 seconds it pans up. I know there was some more, but I can't remember    More like T-Rex, raptor(s) and big fish Dino vs genetically engineered T-Rex. That scene felt good at the end.   So I loved the movie. One of my first impressions about 5 minutes in is oh that's Judy Greer. I like her! And then oh no horrible acting and fairly cheesy so far. And then it got nostalgic. And then it got somewhat funny and then we were being introduced to characters. Then it got tense and that tension turned into bad-assery. I would recommend it. Perfect movie theatre movie. I'll probably go see it in a theatre again. Worth it. Just don't expect it to be written well. If you go into a jurassic park movie expecting brilliant writing you clearly didn't look at the poster. The seller of this movie is the thrill, Chris Pratt being hunky and the magic felt from the original.    Any tips?    I'm looking for informative reads. Thanks!   So I've become fairly interested in the paranormal and I'm wondering if there are any informative books about the paranormal? I'm talking creatures and all sorts of that jazz. Thank you!   So I recently got the xbox one and I've been playing FIFA 13 since it came out. Would it be worthwhile to buy 15, it for a few months and then get 16? Or should I just hold out for 16?   Those are nice too!   Yeah it is tough to read, but they're pretty nice looking   Does any other guy here want a Germany jersey? Those are beautiful    This is my first time watching women's soccer. I love it as much as I do men's soccer.       It really hurt to see that Elton Brand one, as a 76ers fan. I was pretty excited about him.    I hope he comes into his own. Loved him in FIFA 13, became an absolute beast for my Aston Villa squad.    I'm looking at transferring to NYU from a community college and I'm just wondering about the experience some of you may have had transferring.          So I have two semesters left in a two year university and I'll be applying to transfer to four year universities come fall. I went into this two year university with my eye on epidemiology, but I kept my heart and my eyes open. I've bounced around from thinking about French, history and psychology. I have my eyes and heart set on epidemiology now. I'll be graduating from this two year school with a liberal arts degree, and then I plan on getting my bachelors in something else. I'm thinking biological sciences, but is there another major that would be better preparation?    Anywhere I can listen online?   Wth him being a Yankee I'm sure he will start if he keeps it up   One of the best movies I've ever seen. Didn't care for how long it was it was brilliant   The one I work at doesn't, that's probably a southern thing   This is the truth   Every Lowe's I have been in has wifi   If I recall correctly, Kershaw had a rough start last year, and then he finishes with the lowest ERA in his career. I might as well keep bombarding trade offers. Once in MLB the Show I sent a trade offer about 50 times and the other team accepted.    I don't think anyone would. His average is terrible, but he's Jose and Jose still has a good amount of RBI and HR production.    I've been thinking about Tanaka, especially as a Yankees fan. I lost Wainwright and I'm trying to find another top gun. I've got Greinke, and he's been unbelievable, but I think my staff is deep enough where I can take the Tanaka risk.    I've been sending Kershaw's owner in my league a flurry of trade offers and he hasn't budged. I guess his owners really like him, as they should.    So I'm looking around my league and I'm seeing guys like Neil Walker, George Springer, Ryan Zimmerman, Anibal Sanchez, Carlos Gonzalez and many other players that are not playing as well as it seems they should be able to.   What are your prime buy low candidates right now?    Damn it I had a dream I was going to say this on here, but that dream was before he was even signed...   Sounds good, thanks!    Okay so I'm gonna say thanks for the pretty quick reply, but I'm looking at these and I don't know what they are. Can you tell me why this stuff works for me? I don't mean to sound snobby, I just don't know this stuff and I'm trying to learn a little.    So soon I'll be coming onto a decent amount of money, and I will be looking to invest at most $2,500 of it for now.  I'm 21 years old, in college and I work part time making roughly $360 every 2 weeks. Right now I make it paycheck to paycheck, but once this money comes in (probably in the next 3 months) I will have a good safety net from it.  I just want to turn this money into more money so I can pay some of my student loans off quicker. I want that money to be safe though.  I don't have any holdings aside from a 401k with about $2000 in it. (is that a holding?)  No big debts yet, but I'll have some once I transfer to a 4 year school. No house, no car, girlfriend is fairly needy though. Thank you. Also, I really have no clue what to do with this, but I'm a quick learner so if I could get any tips on books I could read to become a better investor that wold be really appreciated. Thanks again.       **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**  I will be using the laptop for school and gaming, as well as listening to a lot of music and watching a lot of movies and tv shows. I like to use Microsoft word and all that jazz. For games I will typically be playing GTA, FIFA, Cities Skylines and some various sport simulation games.   **What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**   My maximum budget would be nothing higher than $1600.   **When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**   Probably won't be buying for about a month or so... I hope that doesn't actually matter. I don't mind if it's out of date, I'm just looking for an idea of what I need.   **What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)**   Everything, tower, os, monitor, keyboard, mouse, controller, etc I'm not too sure  **Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in?

If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?** I would like a copy of windows 7 included in the budget.     There's nothing unoffensive with your attacking strategy to be a counter attack which looks like Floyd's style after watching some videos of him boxing.    Part of combat is preventing attacks which is exactly what Floyd seems to do.    I watched the Manny and Floyd match, and I actually really enjoyed it. It seemed clear to me that Mayweather won because he dictated the pace every round except for two or three and when he was on the offensive it seemed well planned and much more impactful than Pac's offense. So after the fight I browse Facebook and a lot of people are saying it's bullshit that Pac lost and it's embarrassing how Mayweather ran around all fight. Before watching I did my research and expected Mayweather to win, and quite frankly I thought it would t be too close, and it really wasn't that close in my eyes.  So when I check this subreddit out a couple days after the hype I notice that no one is really complaining about the fight and I figure that's because the people that go on here now actually know boxing. I think Boxing might slide into competition for my 4th or 3rd favorite sport, behind baseball and soccer.  Also I have a question, was Ali more of a tactician (like people say Floyd is)? That's what my friend who is a small boxing fan said.    He's got a strong voice for the job too. Unfortunately it's the broadcast team and not the broadcaster.    I love watching that bat flip by A-Rod, but I hate when I have to watch it because it means he struck out.   Shulman has been the one I've hated the least.   I'm sure the average baseball fan wouldn't sound as forced as Olney or as annoying as Kurkjian. I mean that act sounded like someone reading right off a script and then someone with no acting experience trying too hard.    It's disgusting, I can respect it if you're a fan of one of the teams you are watching, but when it's clear as fucking possible that you're rooting for a certain team in your commentary you don't belong.    Wow, first time watching Sunday night baseball in a few years and this is the most disappointing commentary I have ever experienced. They're not talking about anything interesting, when they talk it's absolutely one sided conversation or they're repeating stuff (West Virginians). It's terrible, I don't know if it's because I'm older now or if Kruk, Schilling and Shulman are terrible. They seem to jump to conclusions, make terrible attempts at jokes, repeat themselves and circle jerk.     	45
 Thank you! Means a lot to me.   It is funny how we are so caught up in our lives that we fail to notice the little things around us. The flower we miss on our way to work, the smile we dont return, the homeless guy we miss; the list goes on and on. We are so drawn into these screens around us-the phones in our pocket, the laptops on our table, the watches on our hand- that we never catch the present as it slowly drifts by. Perhaps this is why I failed to notice the little changes around my room, the occasional shifting of the pillows, the curtain moving at night or the random noises at night. I dont believe in the paranormal, never did, and probably never will, but what I witnessed today did change the lens through which I view this world.   It all started when I got my own room (which is a pretty big deal for a teenager) my room was my home, my shrine, and most importantly, my bubble from the outside world. Did badly on the test? To the room it is. Mum scolding me? To the room I go. The harsh reality of life getting to me? To the room I run. Although I always enjoyed trying to fall asleep while staring at some poster on the wall, I always felt strange going to sleep, something just didnt feel right. I would wake up and forget all about it and then go on staring at some screen, getting updates from people I couldnt care less about, liking my way through social conventions and texting my abstract emotions through an assorted selection of emojis. The day would end and I would just lie on my bed trying to sleep. At first, it was tolerable-the curtains moving, the sounds, the occasional weird shapes in the shadows.   I tried to rationalize it as much as I could, maybe it was the wind, or maybe it was my exhausted teenage mind that was playing tricks on me, but then things started getting weird. The sounds slowly evolved into the sounds of someone punching, the carpet moving, and the lights giving out for no reason. Like any other teenager, I told my parents and complained to my friends but soon forgot about it when the next season to my favorite show came out. Things got better and I again got lost in the labyrinth of the web. Little things still escaped my ever-decreasing attention span. The screen had become a life support for me and I was glued to it from dusk till dawn.  All that changed today. Today I realized how big the little things were. Today I realized that the carpet moving was not just my brain playing with me, that the punching sound was not the wind, that the lights giving out was not a weird coincidence. Today started out as a normal day, I woke up by the 6A.M alarm on my phone, yawned for a while and then put my feet to the ground. I felt something and looked down to see a hand clenching my right foot. A rush of adrenaline shot through my body and frantically kicked the hand and ran for the door. I turned around before locking it shut and what I saw made me sick to my gut. I saw a man under my bed. He was just lying there, looking me right into my eyes and grinning. I locked the door and ran to my parents. We called the police and he was arrested. They recovered a bag of chips, a blanket and a kitchen knife; he was carrying nothing and had no name.   This shook me to the bones. It was then I realized that the little things were not little. That someone had been under my bed for the whole time. The punching noises, the curtains moving and the weird shadows were an actual person. And no one knows what he was thinking of, what he could have done. The police told us that he had escaped from a mental facility and had been on the run for the better part of the month. A month he spent under my bed, right under me, coming and going through the verandah at night.  A year has passed and I still check under my bed each night, notice changes and freak out if I see anything new around me. I don't do this because I am paranoid. I do this because I dont want to miss out the little things.  Because it is the little things that count.   	2
 I haven't seen the playthrough so this is a serious question: could it be possible the person playing just didn't use the systems? I've played plenty of games where I didn't use some of the systems.    I think that's why people like it. You can tell everyone is having so much fun acting so dumb.   Hmm, sometimes I'll just say black because that's what color they mostly are, but mostly I'll just say they're black with some orange mixed in.   This was a nightmare to put together! I've never had so much trouble putting furniture together. Those pegs. Those damn pegs!  Does look great though.   Where did that Saving Private Ryan come from? It looks great!      Except for, you know, misquoting it.      I'm going to throw Robert Pattinson out there. I think he's shown he has acting chops, looks young, right body type, and can do an American accent. Don't know about wittiness though. He does seem fun in interviews.  And if it weren't for Xmen, I'd say Nicholas Hoult.  But if we're talking about more realistic choices, I agree with those saying Logan Lerman.   all of them   It was interesting at first, but after hearing/seeing it every time they perform with little variation it feels stale. I think it's good, but boring.  I kind of can't wait to get huge performer Lady Gaga back.   Seriously? I find that super interesting considering how many number one hits she's had.   I don't know, I think back to when Buried came out and people were wondering how a movie about a guy in a box could be good and it ended up being solid. Granted it has different circumstances than what I'm doing. But I think it'll all be in the execution.   I do appreciate all of your input though. It's given me a lot to think about.    Well in a situation where you are severely injured and in the middle of the woods, I think it would definitely take priority over other things.    There wouldn't be any "same as they were before the accident" because it starts immediately after the accident. We don't see the person before the accident.   They wouldn't be running around. They are severely injured so it's them getting from point A to point B. That's why I'm wondering if a story can still be good if the character doesn't develop.    Well the accident that stranded her also killed a loved one, but honestly, beyond wanting to survive and live, there is nothing she wants.   In the context of the story, all they want is to live.    Essentially it is sort of a bare bones survival story of a person stranded in the woods for a few days. They are injured and can't do much physically. I'm trying to figure out how to develop the character when they are the only character.   I'm also wondering if a story can be good without character development.    They are stranded after an accident. The physical condition they are in would not allow them to hunt. They are also there for only a few days.   I like the example of dreaming at night. But even in a dream, I'd run into the same problem of trying to deliver exposition and character development with only one character.    Yes they are trying to survive after an accident. It has a cold opening that starts immediately after the accident. But it's not like Cast Away where they are stranded for months. They are only stranded for a few days so going crazy doesn't seem likely.    I'm writing, or at least trying to, a story that takes place entirely in the woods and with only one character. How would you go about developing the character, defining who they are, and showing an arc?  Internal monologue wouldn't fit with the story and talking out loud seems clunky. Can I make it work?  Does a character need to be developed or have an arc for the story to be good?  Help?   You might want to delete that and pm it to me for your own privacy   I'll just email it to you using Google drive and it should give you an option to download it.    I can send it to you in a Google drive. Would that work?   I'd love if you gave it a shot!    This is it!   I'm incredibly flexible! Two weeks would be great! But like I said, I'm flexible!   I guess something more low key. Something modern, moody, and slow. While editing the short, I was listening to a lot of drone and ambient music.   More symphonic    It's all narrated    Good idea! The full thing isn't posted anywhere due to it not having any music, but I did post a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB-FYkQr-_4) the other day! It'll hopefully give an idea of tone.   I recently just finished editing a short film I spent 7 months on. I'd love to have it be a 100 percent original film, so I'm looking for someone who'd be interested in scoring it.  I'm going to just put it out there so I don't waste anyone's time: I don't have money. This has been a passion project of mine that some friends were kind enough to help me with. I'm not saying that I expect someone to score it for free, but if I did pay someone, it wouldn't be a lot purely because I just *don't* have a lot.  Now that that's out there, let me tell you about the film. It's a small scale crime story about a cop bringing down two criminals. It's heavily inspired by classic film noir, but takes place in the modern day setting. It also takes a somewhat existential look at death.  I really could see some drone/ambient music fitting it well. But I'm not experienced in music, so I'm open to anything really.  I've done music for my own shorts before, but they're never good, so I'd love to have someone who actually knows something about music do the score.  If this isn't a good place for this post, could someone point me in the direction of a more proper subreddit?  Thank you so much!   I don't know if this is it. I distinctly remember Brad trying to read the name of the person the next email was from and being interrupted every time until he finally just yelled.   So while going through some bombcast videos, I was reminded of a fairly recent podcast episode where during the emails section, Brad read an email that led to a rather gross/disturbing discussion. The crew kept talking about it despite Brad trying to change the subject by going to the next email. Every time he tried to transition to the next email, the guys would interrupt him and continue the conversation.  Anyone know what I'm talking about?    As someone who's studied forensics, any time someone is hurt/killed and there's blood/gore, I automatically get super critical of the realism. I hate myself for it because it will sometimes ruin movies for me.    You should check out The One I Love. It's a great comedy/drama with a strange scifi twist. Feels very much like it could be an episode of The Twilight Zone.    As a guy in the singles ward who *didn't* go on a mission, this suuuucks. RMs taking all the women.       Great! Thanks for contributing and helping this sub get started!   [Just did it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTitleThenStory/comments/2u5n9h/lock_void/)      Hello, I made a subreddit that I feel could be the sister subreddit of this place.  /r/FirstTitleThenStory is another kind of writing prompt subreddit I made where instead of a traditional prompt, the prompt is just a title. Nothing else. No other information. I thought it'd be an interesting experiment.  Is this something anyone would like?   Hey everyone! This is a subreddit where someone submits a "title" and people will reply with a story based off of that title! The idea behind this is to allow users to get even more creative!  Think of it as a writing prompt, but instead of a synopsis, all you have to go off of is a title. No genre, no style, no nothing.  Let me know if you have any questions or ways to improve this place!  Hopefully this will be a fun thing that will survive!  Edit: I'll post a title a day until the sub grows a bit. Hopefully it will!   You should see Take This Waltz. He does a good job playing a normal husband in that.    I guess for me it's the number of films I have with alternate box art designs.   I think for me the reason I tend to get a steelbook over a normal one is because I see movies as works of art, so I think the cover art should reflect that. I don't just want my collection to be good. I want it to *look* good as well. I personally think most movies have terrible or generic cover art so that it's easier for them to sell, which is understandable. They have to make money.  I also think the blue cases throw off some good cover art.  Most steelbooks I come across have more interesting artwork and can get away with being more abstract so that's what's appealing about them to me. But if the steelbook art looks the same as the regular art, then I'll just go with the regular one since it'll be cheaper usually. And in some cases, the steelbook will have worse art. Like [these](http://i0.wp.com/www.pissedoffgeek.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/breaking-bad-steadman.jpg?resize=752%2C619) Breaking Bad ones. Sure, they're interesting, but I jus think they don't look good.  But that's the thing, it's all just preference.   I'd have to say for me personally, it's steelslipcoverregular blu  But you're not idiotic for not liking steels. It's just a preference, man!   Why?   I think "not big on it" and "atheism" are two different things.    I'm looking at getting a new laptop. It's preowned and has FCP9 on it already. I'm used to and comfortable with FCP7. How much trouble will I have adjusting? Is FCP9 bad?  Edit: Shows how much me and the guy selling the laptop knows. Didn't know FCP 9 wasn't a thing.    I'm looking at a new laptop that is preowned. I'm used to and comfortable editing with FCP7. The laptop has FCP9 on it. How different is 9 from 7. Will I have trouble adjusting?   This is where dreams come true. Good luck everyone!   Looks like Eddie Vedder    It's interesting you bring up 2001 because the man who did the visual effects for 2001 also did the visual effects for the creation of the universe scenes in Tree of Life.   I saw it when it came out a couple of years ago. I declare it a masterpiece.   Warriors of Virtue is the sickest   Well, I mean, 1999 was like 15 years ago and 1990 was like 25 years ago. A lot has changed in cinema since then. A lot of advancements in technique and technology. It's perfectly reasonable to assume most movies of the 90s haven't stood the test of time. If you're someone who was born in the 70s, then the 90s probably don't feel old. But if you're someone who was born in the late 90s, that was an entire lifetime ago.  I don't consider the 90s "old" but it *was* over a decade ago. Heck, 1990 was a quarter of a century ago! It sounds old when you say it like that!   Yep. As a big guy who can't grow a beard there's no hope for me :(   But purple rain   I made a short film and I wanted to give a gift to the people who helped me make it. A physical copy of the film. I know absolutely zero about photoshop so I was looking for someone who is creative and artistic to create the cover art for the Bluray case. I can be contacted through PM.   I mean, to be fair, the no chemistry thing works because she doesn't want Bruce Wayne anymore.    I think the core concept and story of the first Saw is incredible. However I just think the execution missed the mark a little. I still love it and think it's a great movie though.    The thing is though, while Middle East would be really cool, I just think there wouldn't be enough variety in animal life.  And the reason I said Galapagos is because I think there's good variety in the geography and some interesting animal life. But yeah, you're totally right in that it'd feel too similar to 3.  Another cool one would be the Alaskan wilderness, or heck, let's just go to Antarctica!   Something like a fake So Paulo would be cool. Have some wilderness but also some favelas on steep hills.   Maybe something Middle East inspired with dessert environments and canyons.   Also since Far Cry 4 didn't have enough of it, it'd be cool to have one that mostly took place in the mountains.   Galpagos Islands would be pretty sick!   As someone who just watched Saw yesterday, most of that movie is like a 6/10. But those last 20 minutes, when you see everything come together and play out, it's like a 10/10.   I enjoy a song that has a nice build up to a big release. What are some of your favorite crescendo songs?   Quite literally    We always hear the villain say something along the lines of "You and I are a lot alike." And the hero will say "I'm nothing like you."  Are there any instances where the villain and the hero are indeed just alike?   Essentially making the movie from the perspective of the antagonist.    I'm writing something and was wondering if you guys knew of any movies that tell a beautiful love story between two gay people.   I feel like most movies portray gay people in an unrealistic way. I'm looking for movies that portray gay people in a realistic and beautiful way? Brokeback Mountain would be an obvious one, but what are some romance movies about two gay people?   People who say Requiem for a Dream is the most depressing and traumatizing movie have not seen Martyrs.   You could really say the same thing about any Marvel movie though. People can say what they want about Avatar's story, but it created an incredible and original world and universe. It's so incredibly detailed and well realized. More so than any movie had in a long long time, and more than any movie since.    I love Terrence Malick films but the problem is that he's only made a few and I've seen them all multiple times.   What are some films that feel very inspired by his films? Not just in their themes but also in how they are shot and edited and how he does storytelling.    Avatar is still the most jaw dropping theater experience I've ever had. I'd give anything to see it in 3d imax again.    I dunno. I was thinking about it, and I'm not entirely sure it fits what I'm looking for. The thing about LNS, and I won't spoil anything, is that, while there *is* a character that isn't who they say they are, it doesn't really play on this. LNS doesn't really show you-know-who's character as a mysterious one, they just use flat out misdirection, which I don't think is the same thing.  The thing about the movies I used as examples, The Guest and Stoker, is that they don't misdirect you into believing the character's are something opposite of what they really are. Instead, they leave their backstories vague and almost breadcrumb-like hints about the true nature of their characters. In fact, right from the get go you feel something is off about the characters.  LNS, on the other hand, leaves you no hints to who the character really is, and I personally never felt like something was of about LNS's character. They don't ever give you a reason to not believe the character is who they say they are.  Now don't get me wrong, I think LNS is a fantastic movie and I love it. I also haven't seen it in a while, so I could be super wrong in all of this and might be overlooking some things that I have forgotten about it. However, I don't remember getting a "this person isn't who they say they are" vibe from LNS.   Yes, I've seen it and this definitely fits what I'm looking for!   I just watched The Guest and I really enjoyed the first half of it because it plays as a mystery. You're wondering who this guy *really* is, and you get a sense that the character is not who they say they are, and their background is kind of unclear whether it's true or not.  Another film I can thin of that kind of follows this is Stoker. In Stoker, you're not really sure who Matthew Goode's character *really* is, but there's something mysterious and off about him.  An interesting thing to note is that in both of these films, the mysterious character is a very charming and charismatic guy.  Are there any other movies that play around with the idea of someone not being who they say they are? Or where a character's true identity or back story is a mystery?   I'd like to see more movies where there is a character who is mysterious, kind of off, and gives off an "I'm not who you think I am" kind of vibe.  Edit: I thought maybe it'd help if I clarify that I'm not looking for movies that just simply have a character that's not who you think they are, but movies that have a character that's not who you think they are and *the movie plays on this idea*. If that makes sense.      The Exterminating Angel has held up very well in my opinion.    Storyboarding will save you time and are so efficient. The best part is that you don't have to be a good artist. Since you are directing and operating the camera, you are really the only person who needs to be able to discern them.  Storyboarding will make shooting so much easier and organized. It's so nice to go into a shoot knowing exactly what shots you need. Too many times I've gone into shoots without a storyboard planning to just improvise and I end up wasting a lot of time standing around trying to figure out shots. You save so much time when you storyboard because when you're done with one shot, you just refer to your board and can immediately know where and how to set up your camera.   I'm gonna buy a house!      In this scene a man is standing in the wilderness at night. How do you light a scene like this on a micro budget? What's the best way to shoot it?  Also, a side question, what's the best way to capture a starry night on video?  I'll be using a Canon Rebel T3i, but I might rent a camera instead.   It's just a man asking people where someone is but the way it's shot makes you feel so uneasy. The camera is sideways throughout most of the sequence which leaves little room in the frame.    I'm super late to the party so no one will see this.  Inside. It's a French horror film. Very disturbing, but more so in terms of gore. It's definitely going for shock value in it's violence. Basically it's about a woman who breaks into another woman's house to steal her unborn baby.   Why? I haven't seen it in a long time and the only disturbing thing I remember from it is the dream sequence and even that wasn't *that* disturbing.   I love the hellish mood of it. It felt a lot like watching a nightmare.   Even if you end up not liking it, I think it's still a worthwhile experience because there is not another movie out there like it. Highly original and visually stunning.   Yeah, the nightclub scene, not just the fire extinguisher part, but the entire sequence, made me feel severely uncomfortable and claustrophobic as well as making me feel anxiety.   I feel like I'm missing something. I don't find the babadook to be a great horror film. I do think it is a great film all around, but it feels more like a psychological thriller mixed with a family drama.    I find it interesting that you'd hesitate to call The Cabin in the Woods a horror, whereas I'd hesitate to call the Babadook a horror.    The ending of the Matrix when Rage Against the Machine's "Wake Up" kicks in gets me so pumped.    Ditto   I do agree but I'm not great at articulating. Never have been. I worded it to the best of my abilities.    Like when a Wikipedia page is so interesting that it leads you to more and more links and Wikipedia pages   This sub is meant to be a bridge between /r/movies and /r/truefilm. I think my post, while not great, does fit here. I don't know if you were the one that downvoted my reply to you or not, but I feel it was unjustified. You asked me to be a bit more descriptive and I told you that I wasn't great at articulating and gave you two reasons why I didn't find it great.   Then in reply you basically told me my post was bad and didn't belong here. I don't blame you for expecting higher quality posts, but that attitude is kind of why people are intimidated by /r/truefilm, and is why this sub was created. To be a more formal /r/movies and a more casual /r/truefilm.    I wouldn't say it's more /r/movies tier than most post on here. I posted this to get more of an understanding of what others thought of Goodfellas.   It is entirely possible that Goodfellas was overhyped for me, and, in turn, I set myself up for disappointment. It's kind of hard for me to explain why it rubbed me the wrong way. I've never been great at articulating. I never said Goodfellas was bad. I do think it's a good movie. Above average and better than most movies. I just think that when compared to Scorsese's other work, Goodfellas hardly stands up. I know this isn't a great answer and not what you wanted to hear.   Someone else said it earlier in this thread. They said that since I have seen Scorsese's recent work before I saw Goodfellas, it probably didn't seem like anything new or special. However, had I seen it when it came out, it would've been very fresh and interesting. I think this is entirely possible.    Great response! I also thought Wolf of Wall Street was disappointing. It felt like a parody of Scorsese films directed by Scorsese himself. It felt like one of the most self indulgent movies I've seen.    Scott has definitely made some great movies, but recently he's been like 85 percent bad and 15 percent good. Actually for last decade he's been like that.   I kind of just found it to be underwhelming. I didn't find it to be great like everyone keeps saying it is. Is it a good movie? Sure, but I don't think it's great and definitely don't think it's Scorsese's best.  Am I missing something? Is it actually an overhyped film? Can we talk about what it is about Goodfellas that sets it apart and makes it better than any of Scorsese's work?   I feel so weird because I think The Master is one of his worst.   I tend to enjoy them. It's interesting, movies are supposed to be a way of escapism. That's why I go see blockbusters. But there have been so many big budget movies in the last year or so, that I look forward to these small, hyper-realistic films. They're a nice break from all the blockbusters. An escape from escapism movies, if you will.    #sprangbreeeeaaaak   Triple Nine sounds great. Great cast and great director.  Everest is a great story with a great cast, but I'm worried about the director. Contraband and 2 Guns weren't great and this is the kind of story that needs a director that will do it justice. Although he did make an Oscar nominated film so there is still hope.  Is the Jungle Book going to be animated or live action? And will it be 3D or 2D animation? Do we know?  I had no idea the Coen brothers were writing a film for Steven Spielberg. That sounds pretty great.  The Martian is such a good book and I'm excited to see it, but I'm extremely worried since Ridley Scott is directing.  Never heard of The Revenant, but consider me excited. Interesting story and I love Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu.  Thanks for posting this, OP. I hadn't heard of some of these before so now I have new movies to look forward to!   Eh. I won't say it looks great, but Mann hasn't made a movie yet that I didn't at least enjoy, so I'll hold on to hope.   It's not, the article stated that the director is a first time director with Abrams producing.  Also, would Microsoft even allow Sony to produce a Halo movie?      Alternatively, what job/career is not as great as most people think it is?   That girl getting bullied was stone cold! She handled it so well. Those girls were trying to be intimidating and it was so satisfying watching her not buy into that empty intimidation.   I've never really had luck with finding steelbooks on Ebay. Almost everyone selling one thinks that their copy is so rare so they will list it for twice as much as you could get it from Zavvi. I just got a bunch of steelbooks on Zavvi. They were all in stock on zavvi, but when I checked Ebay, they were all more expensive there.   Yeah when it came out, but once it had been out for a couple of months people just sort of stopped talking about it.   So I don't now if it's actually not as good as I thought it was(I loved it), but I find it kind of strange that hardly anyone is talking about this movie.   Well, I mean, technically you can. It's called an identity rhyme.   I think Universal actually has plans to do more of these.   We asked my sister to take them and we picked out a couple that we liked. My sister told us that she didn't have any photo editing software and we don't know anyone who does.  We'd be happy to compensate for the work! Just enhancing and adjusting colors and lighting and touching them up to make them look really nice. We know nothing about photo editing! We'd appreciate any help!  I'm not super sure how this works, but if you PM me with some sort of estimate of the cost, that'd be great!  http://imgur.com/a/5PUXf   Are they reliable? Are they legit?   I love slapstick and physical comedy. What are some comedies that are filled with this kind of humor?   That doesn't make it okay to have a shallow story or characters.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXhpePGZdPM list=UUrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA#t=617   Gravity had a shallow story with shallow characters. It lacked depth. Not saying that Interstellar was any better. I think both are equally bad when it comes to writing.   Right, because it totally didn't spell everything out and left stuff to the imagination.   Was Gravity a visual masterpiece? Hell yeah. Was Gravity the definition of a visual story? Hell no.   What little Gravity had to say about it's characters or story, it said through dialogue.    I agree. Yeah, they both take place in space, but Interstellar is a high concept sci-fi, whereas Gravity is more like a "can happen today" kind of story. Someone said Gravity wasn't science fiction, but was more like science non-fiction, and I think that's fitting.   I think there is nothing wrong with having a bare-bones, straight forward story, but Gravity's story, to me, felt more shallow than anything else.    Interstellar was more like Nolan flatly telling the audience the story in dialogue and skipping over all the working underneath.  Wait, so you're telling me it's bad that Interstellar did this, but it's okay that Gravity did it?   Interstellar didn't have the best writing, but there's no way Gravity's writing was any better.    I vote Logan Lerman as Danny   Can you think of movies like Whiplash? Where the main character has an idol or someone they look up to, then the person becomes the character's mentor and then the character finds out their idol isn't who they thought they were?    Thanks?   I was just trying to be humorous   What does that even mean?   I don't know. I added a question mark because it was supposed to be read like I was unsure. You know, like with the inflection of my voice getting higher as the sentence went on while raising my shoulders.    I was always under the impression that it was considered a classic?   I've always seen the Dark Knight as more of a crime movie than a super hero movie. Even though it's a Batman movie, it felt hyper realistic by super hero movie standards. Not that that's a bad thing.    So there is a local tv station that has an entry level production assistant job opening. The guy said to send in my resume as well as some of my sample work from when I did tv production before.  My question is, how do I attach samples of work I've done to my resume?    It's not quite a movie, though. It was from the 90s. It was a video where your face would be on the cartoon main character's body. You might have been riding a bull at some point? I don't know how it worked. I got it as a Christmas gift from my grandmother when I was like 6.  Any ideas?      Was just wondering how my radio knows what song is playing on a given station   I agree that Fincher's visual style would fit well. I don't know why what I said pissed a couple of people off, but I think Anderson is great at creating a tense atmosphere. Look at There Will Be Blood, it's not at all a scary movie, but it definitely felt unnerving and tense the whole time. Now imagine if he was actually trying to scare you.   David Fincher is easily my favorite director working today, but I always thought his style was better suited for real world movies. Movies that are more grounded in reality. Which the same could be said for PTA, but I can see them both making a good Bioshock.   You should watch Death Wish with Kevin Bacon and also watch John Wick. Both of those feel like what a Max Payne movie should be.   Maybe directed by Paul Thomas Anderson? I feel like he could definitely pull off the atmosphere and style.  Edit:Sorry for my opinion?   I guess I was just really looking for a camera that "sees" well in amy lighting condition without loss of quality. Sort of how a human can perceive things well in incredibly low light situations and very bright situations.  And thank you for the response! It was very informative!    I'm kind of a newbie so I have a question.  What camera/camera settings/lens combination, in your experience, replicates the range of light and colors humans see with their eyes the closest?  Using only natural lighting, have you found a lens/camera combo that replicates what we see with our naked eyes?   So are there suits that have more flex than others? Something stretchy? I have a pair of pants that have spandex(?) woven into them so that they have some flex to them. I find these pants extremely comfortable. Are there full suits that have some stretch to them? Something that will give me a wider range of motion?      So I just saw John Wick and really liked it, but I was kind of distracted by the CGI blood. I'm a huge advocate for practical effects like actual squibs. However I totally understand the benefits of CGI blood like not having to clean up your set or actors or wardrobe when you reset a shot. So it logistically makes sense. And there are examples of good CGI of organic things like water.   So why is CGI blood still kind of bad for the most part and are there any examples where the CGI blood and gore looked really good?   I don't think they're nitwits. Them not liking the movie isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that they are so objective about it, yet only cite the story and structure without going into detail as the reason for it being bad. They refuse to have a discussion about it. I love discussing movies I love with people that don't like them! Of course all while being civil and respectful.   So I really love the Tree of Life and my friends don't. I'm fine with this. People like different things. This doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that they say it's a "shit movie" and it's "terrible". They don't say they *think* it's bad they will say "No, dude, Tree of Life is bad."  This didn't use to bother me because my friends are the kind of movie goes who would rather watch an action movie. Not that there is anything wrong with that. So I just chalked it up to the fact that it's just a very different movie than what they are used to.  But then my film friend, a guy I've known since high school and talk movies with all the time, recently watched it. I thought, "Finally, someone who appreciates all kinds of movies will watch this with me." We watch it and I'm like, "Now I know someone else who will like it and I can talk to him about it." But alas, he also tells me it's pretty terrible.  So this got me thinking, am I missing something? Again, it's totally fine that my friends don't like Tree of Life. What bugs me is that they will objectively say it's a bad film. So artistic stuff aside, is The Tree of Life *technically* a bad movie?  Their reasoning is that the story is bad and say it's too hard to follow.   So now I'm genuinely curious, is it bad technically? Am I biased because of how the movie affected me emotionally? So much so to where I cannot view it objectively?  Edit: I just want to clarify that I'm not here to pander. I seriously want to discuss the technical aspects of this film and the structure of the story.   I might be interested in theater work whether it be on stage or behind the scenes. Where can I go for info on upcoming auditions and what not?   Paul Thomas Anderson doing a horror movie would be incredible.   Geeze, honestly, who fucking cares? There has been a lot of Mormon stuff on here lately for some reason, and every time there is all I have to say is "Who fucking cares?" This applies to all posts about religion.   I still think Shame is McQueen's best film.   I also find it frustrating when people just refuse to believe he has any talent. They just go, "Michael Bay? Total shit director." He's actually a damn fine director. The man can direct action like no other. Despite whatever opinions people have on the artistic value of Bad Boys II, I still think it's one of the best action movies from a directing standpoint.   Why? It's a giant Hollywood action/adventure epic. Did you expect them to cast racially accurate actors over actors with star power?   Everyone keeps talking about how great Tom Hardy was but no one is talking about how great matthias schoenaerts did! That dude is Belgian and English is not his first language and he did a fantastic job.   	153
 Best comment I have seen in a long time..   I sometimes make slices with sweet potatoes as snacks. Cause I'm lazy and its to hot to use an oven, I just slice them and pop them into the microwave for about 8 mins and they're soft. For cruchiness, another 3 mins and flipping them over makes them a great snack.   On the upside, the walnuts are a great source of fats so... win-win?   Congrats! You look absolutely incredible, I've just started my journey to get fitter again after the exams season and your progress is so encouraging.  I'm 5'4 but I have the same goal weight too :)   Southern fried chicken, the batter in particular. I have no alternatives but will eat it maybe twice a year   There's a great podcast by Neil DeGrasse Tyson with Elon Musk called 'The Future of Humanity' where he discusses some of these issues and his opinions that I'd recommend.   'Force' this 'force' that for Chinese, 'learn' this 'teach' that in the West   Hear hear  Although I'm sure they exist, I for one have never had the interest in them   Yeah I get you, the whole British villian thing is super popular across all genres though   Congrats!      Drive- the visuals and soundtrack are incredible  Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs and most Tarantino for revenge/bloodshed   Dazed and confused all the way, The Breakfast Club to a certain extent too.   Inception, although most people I know are still confused   Yes!!!   Doesn't bother me either, I don't know why but I can completely block out what I know and still focus on the story. I do it with books too, Harry Potter is a great example of how I read it backwards.   I hated it at first too but I think its a film that requires repeated views to relate better. (Or maybe I relate better cause I'm the same age as them...)   Anna Kendrick, Jessica Chastain and most South Korean and Chinese actors and actresses   I think a lot of Disney is... I watched Aladdin the other day and realised that Jasmine was dressed as a harem girl even though she was a princess.  Theres a buzzfeed article on it [here](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/are-these-disney-movies-racist#.us9ld7RXR9)   I agree with what you're saying on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty too. For me, Drive: story line was poor but man, if you can watch it and completely tune out what they're saying and just listen to the music...  Sometime Wes Anderson's stuff, The Grand Budapest Hotel in particular. I found the story to be the blandest out of his work but the sheer attention to detail is overwhelming. I recently read an article about the set design and how the word 'patisserie' on Mendl's boxes was spelt wrong and Anderson picked up on it and had it corrected in post-production.   Edit: perhaps not *disproportionately* good but John Wick had beautiful visuals and soundtrack too, especially considering the storyline   Was I the only one who found it to predictable and a disappointment?   I think this explains it pretty well, the neutral tones are often in characters with a   e.g. ,, and these are pronounced very short.  Try doing exercises with just the 'a' vowel like       .  I do find that most people struggle with the third tone, but its just a falling and rising tone and longer than the others. Try it out with different consonants and vowels to get a feel but  is probably one of the more difficult ones to do.  	22
 AM I?  	1
 Oh man lesson learned. I guess you are right I may have scarred her because of my lack of sensitivity. The part that is confusing me though is that she told me she loves me and I am the one but she's hurt still. I don't understand what she wants me to do.   Sorry typo in title. Having issues with my girlfriend of seven months.   Ok so I've been dating this wonderful girl that is smart, gorgeous and everything I want in a partner. Our relationship started of with her going to college three hours away but I still made an effort to see her at least twice a month during weekends.  Our issues started during intercourse when I decided to be an asshole and get mad at her over her not being able to continue to give me my orgasm. I had been going for about thirty minutes and had given her a pretty decent time but I guess she couldn't handle it. After she mad me stop immediately in the middle of sex she told me that it felt great and I responded with yea for you because you got your pleasure.   I know this was fucked and uncalled for but it was my dick talking honestly I was just caught up in the moment. Ever since this I have tried so hard to make it up to her and it's been three months and she still brings it up. I don't think she is capable of forgiving me and it's making us fall apart.   She has been working a lot this Summer to the point were we don't see each other at all and the last time I saw her she told me she had a thing for a guy she knows at work because I drove her away and she feels the only way she can feel better is to do something to hurt me back.  I honestly don't understand her. I really do love her and did plan on marrying her. She knows that cheating on me is the one thing I won't take her back for so I don't know if she's testing my love for her in a sick twisted way or she is just scarred because of what I did?  TL;DR Told my gf she sucked at sex, now she hates me but loves me and wants to have a summer fling with another guy to get back at me.   Wish I could find a girl like that. My girlfriend is like you lol always busy with other things.   Wow what an introvert.   reddit makes me money, while it is just a waste of time for you and maybe a sad fap.     suck a dick         Maybe jews hid there during the war.            haha yea true. I was thinking of  just leaving the little ads at the top and taking away the big ones that pop up in your face.  	14
    If he wanted to help he could advocate a return to glass steagall.      It's a "free speech zone".       This policy change will make reddit a "safe place" for increased corporate advertising.   This new content policy will make reddit a "safe place" for corporate advertisers. RIP free speech.         Not giving breaks and working more hours is not going to save a company enough money to increase wages 5X.    Sounds like a fun place.   Foreign news agencies have covered articles of the onion thinking they where  real.   Now that's a true conspiracy.   Nothing just like the term. Wikipedia the article  of dark triad.  Good reading   This video is satire.      This is satire.      It wouldn't suprise me.    That is true. I am talking about most CEO of large corporations. Many CEO's are great people.   Thanks buddy. My spelling sucks.   People are not asking for a 100k . Proper breaks(30 min) and air conditioning would be a good start.   This is why we need better labor laws.   That is what bosses told their workers in the gilded age after a 16 hour work day.   I am moving to Australia.    They love temporary labor.    Down with censorship. Down with venture capital inventors demands. They have TV. That is ok but leave this website the way it was.   Enjoy being a troublemaker.      I wasn't mocking users. Don't talk about yourself  as a group.    First therapy doesn't work for dark triad personality types. The best way too deal with them is to avoid them. Also I am not claiming I can fix the problem but rather just pointing out a truth of the world. Not all problems have solutions. Just because I don't have a complete solution doesn't mean I can't point out a truth.   Some individuals need to be made fun off by labels and comedy.    The number one rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club. What is the number one rule of karma?   Some CEO's are good people but the rates of CEO's being dark triad personality types is several times the general population. This makes them highly rational but only through the prism of there self interest.    Most socialpaths are psychopaths.   It is a problem if most people don't have the ability to spot a dark triad personality type.   Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts...absolutely.  Centralized power leads to absolute power.   My research of peer review medicial papers lead me to a new method of treating my MRSA superbug infections. http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/   Psychopathic people love centralized systems of power.    Yea systems of dark triad people.    "I don't understand you point" is a saying. It means I don't agree with you.    It's called being a secondary psychopath. So I don't understand your point.    In your profile you call people reductionist. Isn't that's labeling buddy.   I deleted my comment because I wanted too.    I have the freedom to delete my own comment. If someone else deleted the comment it would be censorship.    Left brain analyst    You sound like the thought police of 1984.   Some evil people need to be labeled. If more people would have labeled Hitler maybe this dark triad would not have been able to kill half the Jews of Europe.   Go troll somewhere else buddy.    Free speech buddy.    The problem is high IQ psychopaths fake emotion with there superficial charm.  	51
 Then you have a bug, report it on the forums   Just move away until the horse marker isn't on the minimap anymore and he'll respond.   Press tab      Sorry, should have been a little more clear. Changed the ones which could be optional   Ah, I didn't realize the rarity step. Thanks!   This is buy back, for if you accidentally sell something    Theoretically. But you have access to the "storage chest" all the time, even when fighting.   Hadn't heard of this idea before! I'll add it in.   It's also if you hit anything on the way down.   As someone who hasn't read the books yet, I somewhat disagree. Yes, a lot of these things are easier to miss, but if you pay attention most of it is explained as backstory. Is it perfect? No, and I felt lost sometimes. But they made the games well enough that you don't lose too much.   I play with KB/M, can you explain?     Added!   Added!   But why should you have to loot so much to find it?   I believe starred items (new) are always sorted at the top. Then once you look at them, the sorting is by type. Within each type, it's sorted by how new they are to the inventory. If you drop something and pick it up again, it should be the last one of that type.   Edited to be clear.    You can, it's the "change objective" button. You can also turn off the dotted line entirely.    Weird, I'll look out for it. They do have a thread for bug reports on the cdpr forums, you should probably post it over there.   The actual mechanics of this is that when sword is not out, the other items gain the same amount of damage that your basic fists do  That is so weird. Either way, I think it's a bug and should be fixed to a standard.  Personally I really like the grid system since it gives you a visual representation of where everything is.  I would agree except that everything is jumbled together, especially on the equip screen. It looks a little ugly instead.   Even when I roll I sometimes lose a lot of health.    I found one...once.    Awesome job guys! I've barely got to Skellige and I'm 80+ hours into the game already. IMO, this should go into the list as one of the best games of all time.   However, there are a bunch of things that people have found to be annoying about the gameplay, which, if fixed, would make the game even more enjoyable. Since you guys don't have the time to be reading every post, a lot of these probably slipped past you. So I took the time to compile all of the complaints/proposed fixes I saw and made them into a list. Here they are!  **Important:**  * Fix fall damage! Make it less, automatic roll, etc. Maybe a potion. We should be able to jump from heights like in the Witcher 1 intro video. * More key bindings, fix some of the ones available. For example, right now sheath and dive can only use the same button if you keep the default. * Swimming Controls * Horse Controls (ex. doesnt stop randomly, reliably navigate around objects, automatic jumping over low barriers) * **Storage**: Please give innkeepers stashes like in the two previous games, or maybe a 'Travelers Storage chest' at all inns so we don't have to talk to someone to access our stuff. There are many options for this, but I would like to have all the types of witcher armor and swords available somewhere, though not necessarily on me. Maybe Roach should be a storage chest? * More options, especially for potions and bombs, in the quick access wheel, like this: http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/374d3l/anyone_else_wish_they_had_something_like_this/[3]. This isn't necessarily the answer, but applying oils, switching bombs, and drinking potions is cumbersome right now. It would be alleviated somewhat with extra tabs (see below), but not entirely.  **Combat:**  * Jump while in combat * It seems that if the sword is out, all other items deal ~ as much damage. Is this intentional?  * Larger axis of rotation when aiming crossbow and bombs. There's a small limit right now, and sometimes I can't shoot high enough to hit flying monsters. * Make it easier to run away from a fight, Geralt sticks to the enemy too aggressively. * Auto sheathing swords sometimes happens while still in combat but a little far away, or an archer is targeting and you can't parry because you didn't close yet. * Option to manually turn on and off combat mode.  **Economy:**  * Merchants need a buy back feature at the price it was sold at. Maybe this should be in a different tab so that the sold items don't clog up the main screen. * The buy/sell ratio should be more equalized. Right now it is a little ridiculous for both gameplay and immersion. * There is very little coin in the beginning of the game, and lot once you hit level 12 or so.   * Food and alcohol prices and extremely high.  **HUD:**  * Adjustable minimap size * Slower, larger combat and item log * A toggle button * Smaller size possible * Being able to move it to the actual edge of the screen (adjustable settings don't get it quite there) * An option for a compass/clock without the minimap  **Map:**  * Zooming out more * Quest filtering/switching on map; maybe have the option show all quests in grey, and clicking on a marker makes it the active quest. * Multiple quests shown * Option to show a map of the inside area of a cave on the large map screen * Custom notes * Icons for merchants, blacksmiths, and armorers dont disappear when they unload * The world map is hard to scroll with a gamepad, the cursor sticks very aggressively to icons.  **Crafting and Alchemy:**  * Monster mutagens could be disassembled/be used for regular upgrades * A sort function in the crafting window, perhaps by item level or damage/armor so that we don't have to look through everything to find the best one. * Tabs in the dismantling menu * The collapsible menus should not reset. * Choosing whether or not to replenish potions and bombs when meditating; and/or choosing to refill potions without meditating. * Hide feature for already crafted potions; on the same note, don't replace the old recipe with the enhanced one. * Crafting should also have a item is already owned notification when confirming so you don't make something twice * When dismantling items, show how much of the components I already own and how much they are worth. How am I supposed to make a decision between dismantling and selling if I don't know if a component is rare or valuable? * Highlight new recipes * Allow us to auto-buy missing materials from the vendor if he stocks them, or double clicking on the material from the crafting screen.  Now you have to look at the material missing, look for it in between a huge list then look what do you need to craft it and search again. * Possibly remaking a piece of equipment to rise its level to your own  **Quests:**   * Have active quest appear in the quest menu when opened, and save the drop down state. * Make the flavour text of quests and glosary entries more friendly when they update. * Easy searching of completed quests.  **Inventory:**  * New tab for Books   Letters   Notes * Books and scrolls should have an additional tooltip line indicating read/unread * Books and letters should have the option to be read when picked up/looted, instead of having to find it in the inventory * New tab for food or potions/oils/decoctions * Different tabs for crafting   alchemy * A sort function with multiple options (weight, price, quality, level req., name, etc.). On that note, how are they currently sorted? Pickup time? * A way to fav/trash items * A tab for Gwent cards in the inventory  * When buying from a merchant or looting, items should have a line in their info popup that states either "Owned: (#)" or "Unowned" * There is a lot of dead space on the screen. Either expand the grids or use it in another way? * **Maybe**: A list option instead of a grid system  **Other/Controversial/Inane:**  * Better navigation of menus (e.g. quick exit) * Option to turn subtitles off for English/chosen language but keep them for the other languages in game in order to understand them. * More higher level quests * Better leveling -- doing all the side quests leaves you way over leveled * Better trophies * Fix item weight (feline armor set should not weigh more than griffen!) * More things to do, people to talk to after the main story * Rewards that correlate to quest level. My blade of the bits was level 15 because that's when I started the quest, even though I ended it at level 19 or so. My masterwork sword was outclassed by the time I got it. * Assign a hotkey for reapplying current oil * Being able to loot under your feet. You currently have to move a little. * Option to reduce the frequency of background music playing. It's unrelenting, there's never a quiet moment. Especially since your environmental sound effects are some of the best I've heard. * FOV slider * Fist fights should not immediately start on a cutscene ending. There isn't enough time to react. * An expanded glossary: Herb locations/descriptions, cities/factions/locations, etc. * The drop rate for some alchemy substances is low for rare monsters, like a golem heart or ekkimarra hide. Can we get either the monster to appear more often, a higher drop rate, or special alchemy merchants to sell these for high prices? * More gradient speeds * Cloaks and hoods would look really cool * Camera zoom in and out, if possible. * Ability to pause cutscenes. * Meditating should save the game.   **Extra Requests: (Ignore this):**  * Romance DLC * Allow Geralt to imbibe more alcohol. * Ability to give money to beggars  Thanks again! We really appreciate all your hard work!   Non CDPR people: Add your own in the comments. Maybe CDPR will hear you too. ;)  Edit: Edited  Edit 2: Since I'm not going to bother responding to every person, I have a few points:  1. These are suggestions I have seen people have that I thought made sense or seen other people agree with. Yes, some are frivolous, but I purposely did put not graphics or bugs/glitches here. Would you prefer this or a bunch of people continuing to make the same complaints over and over? This is deliberately a positive list of things to make the game better; if you have an objection to something on the list, say it! Writing that 80% of this is crap helps no one and only makes the entire discussion acrimonious.  2. Yes, these are minor improvements, only because the Witcher 3 is already such a great game. No, CDPR is not obligated to do anything. However, since they said they are reading this forum, why not bring issues to their attention? Lot's of good suggestions are buried.   3. Sheesh people, stop freaking out about the list idea. It was a suggestion I saw a couple of times that I saw other people agree to. Thanks for making your objections known, CDPR probably won't do it.   4. For the people who made more suggestions, thanks! I added some of them in.   The only problem is that the baron's quest get's stuck on investigating the wife's disappearance without and clues on where she it, and you just have to go on. That killed my immersion a little.   Yes! This means a Dark Souls 2 discount!   Nexus mods is wonderful, but it is really frustrating finding the right mods because of the bad UI. So to keep all the mods I might want straight in my own head, I made a mod list of everything uploaded so far. I realized that it might be helpful to other people too, so I made it publicly available on [google docs here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0).  Then I realized that this would be a very good resource to the fledgling Witcher 3 modding community if more information could be filled in and the list could be continually kept up to date. Unfortunately, I have neither the time nor the resources to do it all by myself. Does anyone who thinks similarly about this want to help me? I especially want to know if it's possible to pull the information directly from nexus (like an API) instead of copy-pasting a bunch of things, since it would make managing updates, etc. a lot easier.   And then they have a clear weather, and you realize you're fucked!   but had he not killed himself and they had returned  he doesn't kill himself in every ending   Minimize your deck. You need a minimum of 22 unit cards, so keep exactly that amount of unit-cards, and trim your special cards. I have 22 unit cards, and 5 special cards (weather, scorch etc) in my deck. It improves your chances of getting the good cards and combos.   Unless you're playing Monsters/Scoiateal with a bunch of calling cards. Then just load them all into the deck for a massacre.   Neat! Did you get the information from actually playing, or did you pull the info from the code somehow?   According to [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/37y5lr/increased_damage_with_sword_sheathed/), it seems to be all non sword items, including signs and bombs! No wonder everything else seemed so weak.   1. Remember that except for the last 200 years or so, everyone livid in small villages. It's very easy to pass down family traditions in this setting.  2. Being a Kohen is not just a term given to your family that can easily be forgotten. Even though in practice we have largely abolished the class system, there are different mitzvot that apply to you. Since a large requirement of Judaism is parents teaching their children, this is one of those things that would continue to be taught.  3. As a Kohen, one actually has a different role in the community. Duchaning (the kohen's blessing) is one of the largest. Even as you were separated from your parenys or your entire village at an early age, this thing is an easy identifier of your familial status. As a Kohen there are different rules for calling you up to the Torah; not only can you not go up at certain times, but when you do you are caled up as "name son of name the Kohen." So even for a non observant family that only goes to shul once a year, they would still need to know this little piece of info for the bar/bat mitzvah.  So yes, just like many other things the family tradition of being of Kohen can be lost, especially over the last a hundred years. There are numerous stories about a rediscovering of this kind of thing. But it is almost as hard as your family forgetting it was Jewish in the first place.     While we're in duh moments, is there anyway to get all the info of an item without hovering over it?   It would be so much more useful if we could have a potion quickbar. :(   They made a character that looks like him and named him Nick. See the pictures    Hey, it's not so hard, I only built mine this past November!   Hey, if no one sees it what's the point of me making it?   Ok, just in case you're really missing the point: There is no way to beat the guard in the picture above unless you want to spend half an hour fighting. This doesn't make sense, narratively, because why are there people so much stronger than Geralt?  This is about leveling and the fact that other enemies seem overpowered. Not you being weak.   Anyone know what the consequences are for the different decisions made in the Witcher 2? Obviously [Spoiler](/s "if you kill Sile and Letho they won't appear") but what about the others? If you save Triss are the witch hunters less prominent in the game? Does killing/leaving/saving Saskia make a difference at all?   I play with KB + M and I would prefer to attack whatever I'm looking at, even if another enemy is closer, without having to cycle through targets  I do too and never use the targeting button. The auto target usually works, I target whatever the camera points to.   Range indicator in the quest log (so it's easy to find nearby quest)  That is something I didn't know I wanted until right now. Yes!  Cooler and more diverse Trophy effects.  What would you like to see?   The only problem I have is Roach randomly stopping. What are your issues?   Why is that? In order to keep items (or parts of them) when over the weight limit?   How would you fix it? The only suggestion I saw that is remotely feasible is binding it to a different key.    Use quen and a lot of dodging (not rolling). Apply spectar oil before hand. Use your potions And yes yrden does help, but you have to lure them into the trap, they're only slow inside it.   It's two buttons. Once you select the quest, press the map quickkey and then tab.   I was searching for mods and getting really annoyed but Nexus' UI. Since NMM doesn't work yet for the Witcher 3 (I think), I couldn't keep track of which mods I downloaded, if they updated, etc. It was also hard to compare several mods of the same type.  [So, I made a list!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zStz8eChga1xHsntz2qKyBgK_BCy9_S-Pvnx4DfKRYk/edit#gid=0)   Right now it's minimal -- I only included the link, name and author. In the first tab, I also broke them up into different categories to make them easier to sort. Maybe later the community can do something like Skyrim Gems, though I don't think the modding community will get quite that big since the Witcher is a more focused game.  If you want to help edit, shoot me a PM and I'll add you.  Enjoy!  Edit: If you're looking, upvote this so other people can see it too!     I have no idea what happens at the final battle, I'm not there yet. How would you make it harder on Death March?   So the game has been out for almost two weeks now, and everyone loves it (I hope, otherwise what are you doing here?). But we all have our own individual problems we run into. Some people hate the UI, others the controls, or combat just doesn't work. But since we do a lot of complaining about what we don't like, can we try and imagine the best possible solution to it as well? Imagine you're at CDPR and you could change whatever you want, but with one caveat -- you have to try to keep as many people as happy as possible. What would be the best fix?   I'll start: My biggest pet peeve is every single time when going into the crafting (and lesser extant alchemy) menus, everything is always open and it takes forever to scroll through and find what you want. And then when you do, it's hard to compare it to other one's on the list!  Solution: Save the open/close state of the menus instead of defaulting to open. Then in the bottom right corner where there is all that empty space, add a sort by level or alphabetical option. Everything would still be in the same categories, but now you won't have to squint to find your next tier sword among all the level 5 and 10s!  Your turn! Please keep spoilers to a minimum.   There were only 3 paper mario games, what are you talking about? There were no other paper mario games after the Wii. Certainly none on the 3DS. None whatsoever.   The Witcher 3 is an absolutely amazing game. I don't know if I'll put as the best game I've ever played quite yet (I just finished the prologue!) but I wouldn't be surprised if it gets there.  That said, there are some issues I've had and others I've seen people complain about on this board and elsewhere. With the newest patch giving more key binding options, it seems that CDPR is really listening in order to make the Witcher 3 the best game it can possibly be. So, I think instead of complaining in individual topics and comments, we should make one topic for all the issues people would like tweaked so that CDPR can better address our concerns. It would be great for the mods to make a sticky out of it, but for now I'll start here. If you comment I can add the the issue in the OP!  **Combat:**  * More options in the quick access wheel. Potions should have their own tab instead of being part of consumables.  * Either have oil in the quick access menu or as a hotkey.  **Economy:**  * Merchants need a buy back feature at the price it was sold at. Maybe this should be in a different tab so that the sold items don't clog up the main screen.  * The buy/sell ratio should be more equalized. Right now it is a little ridiculous for both gameplay and immersion.  **HUD:**  * Adjustable minimap   **Map:**  * Zooming out more * Labels without hovering for better info * Quest filtering/switching on map * Option to show big map of cave, inside area, not just world map  **Inventory:** (adapted from [the other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/373eim/cdpr_please_say_that_you_will_update_the_inventory/))  * New tab for Books   Letters   Notes  * Separate food and other usable items. In addition, have a separate slot to put potions to use in combat!  * Different tabs for crafting   alchemy stuff (they don't belong together)  * A sort function with multiple options (weight,sell price,quality,level req., name, etc.)  * A sort function in the crafting window, perhaps by item level, newness, or damage/armor so that we don't have to look through everything to find the best one.  * A way to fav/trash items; a small symbol could appear in the bottom corners (PS4 - click left stick to Fav an item* / click right stick to designate an item to sell/dismantle once you get to a shop http://americandigest.org/trashcan.jpg) a feature from the borderlands games that was very helpful.  * Dismantling is hard! why is everything in the inventory suddenly grouped together in the dismantling menu, please give us the tabs back here!  * Please give inn keepers stashes like in the two previous games, or maybe a 'Travelers Storage chest' at all inns so we don't have to talk to someone to access out stuff. There's stuff I might want to keep (like witcher gear) but don't want to keep with me at all times! Putting them in random places in the overworld gets annoying.  * Please make a way of showing what Gwent cards we have in the inventory perhaps in there own tab so that we don't accidentally buy cards we already own. Having to pause the game and open the Gwent menu is kinda a hassle just to check which cards we own.  * All items in the game should have a line in their info popup that states either "Owned: (#)" or "Unowned"  * Books and scrolls should have an additional tooltip line indicating read/unread  * Choosing whether or not to replenish potions and bombs when meditating.  **General UI:**  * The down menus in alchemy and crafting should not reset.  * Better navigation of menus (e.g. quick exit)  * More options for key-binding  DONE!  * http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/374d3l/anyone_else_wish_they_had_something_like_this/  Remember: Don't just complain! Offer a solution to the issue you're having instead of bitching about it. We're trying to help CDPR make Witcher 3 the best game it can be, not bash them.   It's if you move the mouse while pressing escape, it cancels the escape attempt.   Yes! Key bindings was one of the main things I was annoyed about. Hopefully they can fix the menu next.   Play people with worse decks like innkeeps and shopkeepers, and buy more cards. Yes, the starter pack isn't great.   Any books which focus on 47-48 civil war and the 48-49 independence war will devote some time to this topic. I recommend one or two classic Israeli, one revisionist Israeli, and one Palestinian to get a few range of views. Unfortunately I don't have any specific recommendations since it's been a while since I read these and I'm a little bit biased, but I'm sure you can find some good ones.   It's a large combination of factors, including: relations with the local Jewish community, security threat, individual commander choices, levels of fear, etc. This is a question for /r/AskHistorians and then one to read a few books about.   Anyone know how to get rid of items once you put them in your cart? I want to check out, but I don't actually want to spend that much money.   Hey! Just an idea I had while browsing games today. Maybe ascension should have some kind of check you can run where you can import your cart from websites and see what games you already own. It's getting hard to keep track of everything I have.   Is there a defense that she might have been raped? Yes, from what's come to light it's a possibility. But how she's been behaving means that whatever sympathy she had is turned to a political issue. I'm just mad that they let her do this as a senior thesis.   This is bugging me, and I want to know the answer before starting the game. If you choose not to import of simulate a save, what are "default" choices made for you? Does anybody know? My google skills have failed me today.  And does anybody know the consequences in the witcher 3 for each of the choices?   The West Bank was granted to the Arab state  When?   They are hypocrites in a lot of ways. The rest of us learn to deal with it.    she says "are German and are Jewish"   The professor called Israel and students in the audience Nazis. She objected to the offensive characterization and he responded that  because his parents were in concentration camps he has every right to call other people Nazis if he wants.   Rekt   There's also the halacha that a non makom kavua does not need a mechitza either.    There is zero prohibition in any orthodox Shul I've ever attended for women to have a separate minyan.  But it is almost never done, for a large part because there is a strong social sanction against it.   What does the rest of your post have to do with  our discussion?    So, the reason it's ok for the Kohanim to get special treatment is because it's d'oraissa?   Yes, and personally I feel better about it because of the explicit balancing laid out.    If there was a source d'oraissa that said women were not obligated to pray three times a day, would you drop the egalitarianism?  1. In this argument I'm advocating, at minimal, equality without egalitarianism. Do you have response to that?  2. I'm pretty sure there isnt; I recall a sugya that states the time-based positive mitzvah rule is a guideline at best. And even if there is, why does that stop a woman from taking on the obligation and then leading? Or leading in the non time bound services?   This also doesn't address the argument of women holding women only minyanim, women being excluded from communal leadership positions, etc.    Korach is not a problem because the shul I go to are egalitarian in regards to the sexes but not other societal roles. Kohanim got the first aliyah, etc.   The Torah says we shouldn't steal. So, if men are constantly stealing, should we change the rules to allow stealing?   Funny thing is, this is a legitimate way for a community to reject halacha derabanan! If they don't follow it, it will eventually be abrogated. No, the same isn't true for Torah laws, but I think it is important to point out we can change the rules.    What if men didn't abuse the position? What if the Saducees hadn't abused their priesthood during the times of the Second Temple?  The torah has explicit balancing measures to make sure that the priests didn't abuse their authority. But it has no such balancing measures between man and woman, especially those which would apply to today. In addition, from what I see men over the past centuries have used this loppehole to craft halacha and minhag which excludes women from any say in the community. Modern Orthodoxy has taken remarkable steps to attempt to remedy this, but IMO it is not quite there yet.  The fact of the matter is (and this is where we will have an eternal debate that we will never resolve) I believe the Torah represents the Truth of the universe and that man fails miserably to live up to that Truth.  I am arguing from this principle, and I'm trying to live my life by it. I think our disagreement lies in what we interpret as torah. While I believe in torah she bealpe, I don't believe that everything the rabbis say or pasken count as that torah, and I am fully in favor changing halacha derabanan or minhag to achieve equality. The fact is that people hide behind halacha to keep power, and I find that unacceptable.   Edit: I largely agree with yodatsracist's latest post.     The modern world comes along and says: not egalitarian means discrimination but that's not even factually correct, is it?   An employer isn't better than an employee. It's just a different role.   A teacher isn't better than a student. Different role.   That's what Parsha Korach comes to teach us. True equality is that, irrespective of our role before God, we are all like nothing before the Eternal and we should stop worrying about the attractiveness of the other role and focus on our own the best we can.  I agree and disagree. I've been involved in both Conservative and Orthodox communities, and I see this is true *in theory.* However, it is clear that it is also used as an excuse the more right you go. When haredim don't allow women any kind of public influence, the stated reason is that their role is in the home. When women aren't allowed to lead services like kabbalat shabbat even though they would like to, it's because their role is not to their role to lead the community in prayer.  I fundamentally disagree with you because I see the Torah does teach equality in many places, even if it not egalitarian equality. As you gain more power, you are also mandated more responsibility. The Kohanim must continually keep themselves tahor, Levites cannot hold any land and must serve as teachers, landowners must give so much to ones who do not own land, etc. This also applies in the secular world; the employer must provide and not take advantage of their employee, and teacher has an obligation to treat students fairly and ensure the best education.  The problem comes when the power is taken without responsibilities and repercussions. In the secular world, it was when teachers abuse students, when employers work their employees mercilessly in awful conditions. In Judaism, it was when the community did not take care of the downtrodden, when the Levites seized political power.   This is what I see happening in Judaism. Yes, in theory men and women are equal in different roles and men have more mitzvot to keep. But in practice, men take the power and use it to isolate women. Men are supposed to get consequences in Olam Habah if they abuse this power, but that doesn't remedy the inequality we see here in our communities on Earth. One solution is egalitarianism between the sexes, which of course creates its own set of problems. But it is not a solution to say that we are all technically equal so lets all continue as we are and not worry about it.  This is an issue that has been troubling me for a while, so I would appreciate a response.          I've been creating some merged plugins, mostly from the DLC/patches individual mods have because those are the safest. What are script fragments and navmesh edits, and how do I check for them?   Just read all the books, read all the Cosmere info, and then re-read the books!   :D    Hell, it already blows up! I hadn't run ASIS yet, thanks.   Go to STEP, and see if that works for you. They also have their own forums you can request help in.   I installed pretty much everything I would ever want for Skyrim mods. I used STEP, step packs, and Skyrim gems, as well as looking for other mods I liked. It seemed like it would never stop! I think I got all I wanted for now, thank god. I have played a little vanilla skyrim and some 30+ hours into a STEP extended playthrough, so I'm not doing this blindly and I know about the 255 plugin limit.  So, what can I do now? I've heard a little about merging plugins, but I don't know how I go about that and how it will effect the LOOT order, among other things. What can I do to reduce the amount of plugins I use so I can actually play the game?  http://modwat.ch/DiamondMind#/plugins  Thanks!   Thanks! Exactly what I was looking for.   I just came across this, and I just want to say that it looks amazing! I wish I could help some, but I noticed the applications are closed for right now.   Anyway, my two cents: My main problem with the current setup with all the different clients is **not** the separate storefronts, because we have different stores everywhere we go. I think the bigger issue is organizing the games you have bought and/or downloaded all in one place, because right now its a major hassle. If I was in charge I would ignore the storefront for now and just work on that. ;) But I'm not, so thank you and and I hope this works!   Thank you, that is exactly what I was looking for! This should be publicized more.   With the launch of GOG beta, it's getting increasingly difficult to manage several game clients and keep track of all the games you have/are installed on the computer. It's hard enough on Steam itself, let alone juggling two or more programs to find your game if you're not sure where you got it. Steam has a very limited feature to add outside games, but it is time consuming and not very useful.   Are the any game organizers, out or in development, which can take the data from each client and organize it? Yes, Razor Cortex is an option, just not a very good one. It wouldn't have to be very complicated, just a simple organizer (by name, category, client, etc.) with a link to each game shortcut for the game to launch without going through the client. You could still use Steam and the rest for the community aspects, in or out of game, but you wouldn't need the open the client to do so.  I think this would be a **very** useful feature which would cut down on the hassle we have now, and which will only get worse in the future. If there isn't one in development, does anyone know how difficult it would be to make?  Edit: Apparently /r/Project_Ascension is trying do something similar. Go check it out!   I have it. But it comes with too many other things you might not want, and the UI for finding games it annoying. There isn't even a way to make the icons smaller! Something more user friendly/configurable would be nice.

So what you're saying is gun control does work?    The Witcher 3 is definitely worth pre-ordering, and I haven't pre-ordered a game in years.    I have a Motorola Razr and it's fucking awful.    Pre-order the Witcher 3 to show that some companies are still trusted!       He disabled it :P. He changed the the price at my request though, thanks   I was about to buy from him and then he raised it to $30 :/ How do you make a lower offer?   Damn. I'm having the same problem. I guess I have to go back to all my mods to check.   There is a difference between abandoning the religion and converting; the latter is seen as much more serious.   Did you ever figure this out?   Except then people will cry racism because the vast majority of Arabs also don't serve.   Just to correct the poster above you: Marriage laws are a holdover from the Ottoman empire which put marriage under the domain of the recognized religious authorities. This means that anyone can marry anyone, in theory, except that the religions have restrictions on it. Ask an imam to marry a Jew and a Muslim, and it won't go over so well either...  Women not being able to get a divorce is the opposite - true in theory, but not in practice. By quirk of Jewish law, the husband does have to *give* his wife a divorce, but if he refuses he is essentially expelled from society among other unpleasant things. Most "husbands" give in quickly.   For the rest:   places where you can't drive through on Saturdays  not by law, but because the community wants it so, and the authorities cooperate. Community, as opposed to individuality, has a much higher standing in Israel than America because of its socialist beginnings.   The other two are correct, but like for the pigs there are various ways around it without violating the law.   Think of it like blue laws in the United States.    Subtle? They kept the camera on his face for five whole seconds!   As you can see by the phrase "he who says, " this is about people who are publicly claiming such, not about those who want privately believe.       Gamers won because we have the power, as long as we're not pushovers  Just like we're winning with Greenlight, Early access, shitty mobile apps, and microtransactions, right?   You have a good point. I'll sleep on this. Does paying a small minimum amount not change your mind at all?   I'm trying to compose a plan to keep the modding community alive for TES6. It's not not a guarantee that we'll have one, you know,   But what if Nexus could expand more? Improve the interface, make a better mod manager, etc. What if the modder decided what percentage Nexus gets?   I have 100+ mods myself for both Skyrim and Morrowind, so I get what you're saying!  I didn't include it because I thought this was implicit: we're trying to keep the modding community as open and collaborative as possible while preparing for the inevitable paid mod scheme. Hopefully, there will be a few great mods behind the paywall, while the rest will be free; but to do that, donations need to become more of a norm when downloading. If for every 100 downloads, $1 donation is given, many people will make a not insubstantial amount of money.  That's also why I think there should be so many limitations for the paid mods. That shitty armor pack shouldn't be allowed as a paid mod, nor the fancy sword from Dota. The ones allowed in the marketplace will already be good and useful. SkyRe, or something like it, is something I could potentially see being there if the modder wanted it to. But the minimum should be about 25 cents, not a dollar, and for payment a sliding scale like humble bundle, or an area where you manually enter what you pay, is implemented.  I want there to be a community for the TES6, which I fear there won't be if crap paid mods will immediately flood the place.   But we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models, and the addition of paid mods to Skyrim's workshop. We understand our own game's communities pretty well, but stepping into an established, years old modding community in Skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating. We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly, even though we believe there's a useful feature somewhere here.  Nothing there about Bethesda's games not having paid mods in the future, and they still think there is a useful feature. The only way there won't be paid mods is if Bethesda says no, which I don't believe they have.  The Nexus has donations nailed down. Why are you trying to help them take a cut?   Because a better Nexus means a counter to the inevitable monetized Steam workshop. Plus, a donation to the mod creator should include some to the mod hoster.     Do you have a source for the Arab immigration? It's a common statement in right-wing Zionist circles, and I've been trying to find one for a while.   We can't change the negativity that happened, but I hope we can get something positive out of it. /u/xaliber_skyrim is trying to compile a extensive list of everything that was wrong[ in the stickied thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343jtf/your_voices_were_heard/cqr1041).  My opinion is that paid mods are an inevitability we need to prepare for. [I made another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/) where we can discuss how a paid mod scheme might actually work so that it won't destroy the community.   I made a discussion to preempt it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/)    and it should be modeled after the humble-bundles.  Can you explain how, exactly?   Your welcome! I think we also need a compilation of what exactly went wrong, but that is not what I'm focusing on.   [Link to original /r/skyrimmods post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343ym0/paid_mods_are_coming_whether_we_like_it_or_not/) ods and other "industry practices" to allow this. I'm new to the modding community, which means I only started playing Morrowind a year ago and Skyrim over the last six months. But like people have been saying a lot, recent events have inspired me to give back. As I have next to no money and not enough time to learn to mod extensively (even though I played around with it a bit in Morrowind), I was thinking about what's going to happen in the future. I realized two things:  1. Paid mods are coming, no matter how much we protest. The Valve press release was pretty clear about that.  2. Next time around, there won't be a community uproar at nearly the same scale. The Skyrim modding community is the biggest we have, another one won't be established by the time the next game is released. We can't stop the hundreds of thousands from buying the next Bethseda game, even if it is announced with paid mods.   Since we can't stop paid mods arriving, I think the best solution is to preemptively speak as a community to Valve and Bethesda about what we *do* want. Reading around the forums, I've noticed most people don't have a problem with paid mods **in theory**, as long as several key conditions are met. However, the implementation this time around was abysmal and we all realized nothing but slow (or not so slow) decline of mods would come from it.   So I have a radical idea. I think we should compile a list of the many sins that were committed, the problems they would cause, and improvements that would need to occur next time. We can present these to Valve/Bethesda as demands for the community to reluctantly support, or at least not condemn, paid mods. By conditioning our support on several key demands, we can make sure Valve sets up a marketplace that does not set off the disastrous effects we fear. Both parties would benefit: Since we can't stop paid mods, we could turn them into something which will have neutral or maybe even beneficial effects. Bethesda won't get the inevitable PR hit next time around, which is fresh in their minds right now and so holds the most power.  I've started small list below, and I think it would be great for the community to put together a comprehensive list and make it as official as possible. Hopefully this will be an opportunity to bring us together after the recent bitterness.  Here's my start, from what I've seen people saying.   Issues:  1. The way the marketplace was set up encouraged crap shovelware micro transactions over good mods. 2. There is no good way to test a mod and return it if it doesn't work. 3. There is no way to make sure that the modder will continue supporting the mod through main game updates and other mod changes.  4. Mods use one another assets all the time, which makes monetizing them a legal quagmire. In addtion, relying on modders and the community to police stolen assets in unworkable. 5. The paltry 25% the modders got was absolutely ridiculous. 6. The secrecy of the implementation runs counter to how the modding community functions. 7. Most of us using mods don't use the Workshop because of its limited functionality, meaning we can't access the mods posted like SkyUI 5.0.  (To see longer arguments for above points, go to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/343jtf/your_voices_were_heard/cqr1041) by /u/xaliber_skyrim   Solutions:   **Quality**  /u/DiamondMind: A paid mod being on the marketplace means that the developer has endorsed it as unofficial DLC for the game and guarantee it. This legitimizes the cut they take and gives them a stake to supervise which mods have their name attached.   /u/DavidJCobb: All mods must have a seven day return policy, no questions asked and no consequences.  /u/BullZEye22: Mods should gather a certain amount of approval before they can be sold.  /u/fadingsignal: Behind the scenes, there should be a partially dedicated faster-response support team for mod authors. If a mod is having trouble because the Steam downloader is screwing it up, or there is abuse or stolen assets being used, someone who is a verified author should have a slightly elevated support level, so they can in turn better support their customers who purchase their mods.  **User convenience**  /u/DavidJCobb: Load order managers and mod managers are essential to using mods while keeping one's game stable, but Skyrim doesn't natively support these tools, and the average Steam user won't know much about them. This is quite possibly the largest barrier to modding. Bethesda must develop their own analogues to LOOT and MO/NMM, and integrate these directly into the PC versions of FO4 and TES6.  Authors should be permitted to upload full archives, rather than a BSA/ESP pairing (the current limitation), but the uploading of loose files should be discouraged, and some sort of warning should be indicated to the user in the Steam Workshop's UI.  /u/DiamondMind: Do not tie downloads into the workshop; allow them to be used like Nexus files. That way, Bethesda and other developers do not need to create their own tool and force us all to use it.   /u/fadingsignal: Fix the Steam Downloader to be actually useful.  **Compensation**  For Paid Mods:  Modders need to get at least 50% of the sale. Valve and the publisher can work out how to split the other 50% on their own. There are more than enough differences between mods and other "industry practices" to allow this.  /u/fadingsignal: Option to set the minimum price to $0   For Unpaid Mods:  /u/NeuroticNyx: A donation button for unpaid mods on the Steam Workshop. No profit form Bethesda can be made from this, as it is not endorsed.  /u/MaryMudpie: A system of Pay-What-You-Want for all mods. (Probably not going to happen.)  /u/EggheadDash: A pop for a donation once the game is closed, with Yes/Remind me Later/No options.  **Compatibility patches**  Modders should be permitted to create compatibility patches between mods even when one of the mods is paid, so long as the compatibility patches don't use any resources from any of the original mods (including the paid one(s)) without their authors' permissions. Users should not be permitted to sell compatibility patches; they should remain free. This should rather neatly solve the community's concerns about the interoperability of paid mods; if a paid mod is good enough, I guarantee you that some industrious user will build a patch to make it work.   **Limitations on sale**  /u/DavidJCobb Mod authors should not be permitted to sell bugfixes for base game content, official DLC, or any other mods. These must be free. Obviously this policy must be worded in such a manner as to permit a mod author to continue selling a mod even if they must later release a bugfix for it; yet to forbid that author from releasing the bugfix itself as a separate paid product.  /u/DiamondMind: UI and other "fixes," not just bugs, should also never be sold.  Perhaps there should also be a lower limit on the content sold so that microtransactions like adding a sword aren't allowed.  **Theft**  If a mod author's resources are stolen and used in a paid mod, that author should be able to report that to Valve and have it acted on promptly. The thief's revenue should be transferred to the original author; or, if the author doesn't have payment details registered with Steam, the full amount should be held in escrow indefinitely, without a time limit, until it can be transferred to the original author.  In particular, we need assurances that Valve will pay attention to content that was originally uploaded to other sites, or at least to the more notable ones, when investigating theft reports. The full details of their policies regarding theft should be made public.  **Transparency**  Speak to us every step of the way, and release a prototype version first that we can check for issues.   This is of course unfinished, and there a lot more problems to address. Comment and I'll add it to the list!    	109

Okay, time to watch the extended edition yet again. Real world, see you in 12 hours.   The site is beautiful, fast, and works as advertised. [Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/361a71/hi_reddit_i_built_an_image_search_engine_that/).         I'm glad to hear (ha ha) about the fully voiced characters. As much as I loved and played the game, lack of voices broke the immersion for me. With that and the new quests with fresh ending, I'll definitely give it another go.   So you are saying the hair also disappointed of him.      Thanks. Sad news for me.      Short and safe answer: yes. The important ones (email, bank, facebook, paypal, credit card, utilities websites, windows, etc - any password that leads to an account with real life information).  Edit: I just want to state how a good firewall is important. Lots of anti-virus, anti-malware will identify the keylogger, but they have lots of false positives. However, when a firewall prompts that a process wants access to outside world (send or receive), there should be a real good reason to allow it. Even if it's a legit program, 95% of them don't need (or shouldn't need) internet access to work properly. I can count on my hand the number of programs on my pc that get internet access.   So in this case, even is the keylogger worked, it won't be able to send the data out.   Easily one of the best trailers I have seen in the past few years.   Last I heard was that Bradley won't return as Ronnie Brooks, which is a bummer. Does anybody know if more episodes are planned and when? I really like this adaptation, and my only complain is that they stick too much to the original scripts (And as a L O fan, means I pretty much know all the plot after the opening scene. Still liked it plenty though).    You can try Hola (with Chrome) and BBC's iPlayer.             Most of the stuff is like final assignment for design graduates. If you do like this kind of stuff, check [Yanko Design](http://www.yankodesign.com). Lots of designers submit photoshop mockups of products.                I would actually support a 4 point line between the arc and mid court. Makes the game more interesting, what's not to like.   I tried to slide the second image. Why do I always fall for that?   I get it, nobody likes it when "his" term of identity is "stolen" and mis-used, but language, economy and social habits are all living things, they change and evolve over time.   The word "socialism" isn't what it used to mean, and it means differently in different part of the world. So it changes through time and space.   So don't be the guy, that when someone calls him "the guy" (like I just did) says in reply "actually, did you know that **guy** comes from the name of Guy Fawkes and it used to mean effigy, and I just hate it when people use it differently."   You want to tell me that some people think 35 minutes of mounted travel is SHORT?   On a blind test, you'll swear it's an ice cream.      Magic wasn't a scorer.   Where you leave, do politicians have immunity for murder? Can they buy M1 Abrams tanks for personal use with tax payer money? how come they can't? who's enacting those law?   So to me, if I were a person who's okay with *The System*, I would simply point out that the same laws and regulations that prevent them from murdering and buying tanks should be extended to hookers and drugs.   Most people think *The System* works, and any flaw can be fixed within *The System*. The flaws that can't be 100% fixed are tolerable and are justifiable cost to keep *The System* running.  Now, I'm not saying they are right or wrong, but I don't see how simply pointing out something that be fixed by law is going to convince anybody.    If you want a cool variation without icecream (dairy free), try frozen banana and coconut cream as a base. It works great. Make sure to peel, slice before freezing the banana.   To that you can add any fruit (like frozen strawberries, blueberries) or cocoa poweder or cookies or peanut butter.  For refreshing taste, try mint and vanilla.  If it's too thick (but then, how can a milkshake be too thick) add coconut milk.   Excellent. I saved it in my notes.   That's his 2nd worst year with TO. I think it's because he has to carry the ball more and make more plays for the team. Irving is a great point guard, but I guess his injuries impact that as well.    The first half was like watching an 8th grader sneaking into 3rd grader game.    Probably divorced and make them go with shirts like: MO|AD and DA|OM.    The good news is nigga you came a long way   The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way  -- J. Cole   You can see how he started to time from half court. Basically looked at Rose and didn't run until Rose was past him.   You are on point. We like candidates with teen spirit and adult temper. They usually don't go hand in hand. Paul got the first but lack experience (though he's getting there). Clinton acts professionally but lack substance. Obama, the 2008 candidate, had a lot of the first, and enough of the second.   That's why Sanders excites the liberal base, because he's got both (not that he has a chance of winning, but that's for other reasons, just don't tell that to Reddit).    Home got to it.   They are both patients in a mental hospital. He just doesn't know it.   As real as this story mate (that's 100% if you haven't been following).   Why? are you saying people don't have the right to exercise 2nd amendment right? what's triggering you in this story? oh, I get it, the stray dog. That would be animal control, not CPS.   Oh man, you have no idea. I just happened to press F1 in another program to open the help file, and I had to watch Notepad opens and populated with thousands of Fizz Buzz. I felt trolled so hard.   I don't know. Whoever convicted those guys I guess: [List of American state and local politicians convicted of crimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes).    I never heard an answer that convinced my opponent himself  Seriously? how about: "let's throw that politician in jail and outlaw hookers and blow." Sounds like a typical liberal answer.  The concept of taxes is accepted by most people and also by many libertarians. so I don't see how giving an example of one particular wasted taxes is going to change anyone's mind.   Everybody knows that taxes aren't 100% effective. But all the people who accept the tax concept (which is the majority of people, right after they stop bitching about it) just argue on the amount and how to spend it.   I just ran it fine with 10,000 iterations. I would guess it's maybe some kind of memory limitation?   Edit: looks like mine breaks at 15K, then I'm getting garbage. I think you find the ultimate shitty program :)    Forwards from Grandma are literally from the wrong generation.    It won't be a season finale without Daenerys in the final scene.

Now: oh, Expanded Consciousness, I hope they dumb it down to gallery format, I've got 2 minutes to spare.    traditionally and historically  Historically I was an ape. How about we'll focus on the present now?    haven't done my surgery rotation yet so I don't fully know this answer  Well, OP also hasn't done her surgery rotation and she sure has a lot more confidence talking about this stuff than you, so I guess I'm gonna take her word for it. Nice try thin patriarchy.   Putting the Wild in Buffalo Wild Wings.   1 million more republicans voted for Romney than those voted for McCain. They didn't stay at home at all. If anything, Democrats stayed at home in 2012 compared to 2008.   I love how he does couple of flips, pause for half a millisecond and then goes: yeah what the hell, I'll do another one, I've got so much time before landing.   Booing from the crowd every time he holds the ball is uncalled for.   I hate lots of players (Kobe Shaq who dominated us for 5 miserable years, Noah, Dirk and the entire Dallas team, McGrady, Carter Kidd, Artest), but that's part of the game. I wouldn't boo them for just playing ball and I really wish them best of luck (when they play against other teams, of course).    and a scholar.     Cell phone companies are trading thinness for battery size  No. Cellphone companies are trading electronics for money. They compromise battery size because they know the majority of people prefer good bright large colorful screen, fast device, big RAM, storage, good sound quality, reliable fast connecting GPS and reliable networking. All those greatly consume battery life.   If you don't care about thick device, some popular cellphones have [battery cases](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dmobile tag=hotoge-20 field-keywords=battery+case rh=n%3A2335752011%2Ck%3Abattery+case).

If you care for her, make sure she's got a proper phone charger.   It's weird because not wanting kids is a somewhat a deep decision that isn't reached lightly. It involves different stages of life, your spouse, sometimes parents and it also affects you financially and socially for many years...  ... and /r/childfree sometimes downplays it to kids screaming for 10 minutes in a movie based on a comic book.    That's probably true for all years, except 2001.      The bike? It's custom made with Carrera's frame and XTR - [picture here](http://i.imgur.com/GZd8z8B.jpg). The only downside to me (and the reason probably for a relatively cheap price) is 26 wheels, but I can live with that.   I'm ashamed to admit that I stopped reading 75% through with no good reason, because I did enjoy the book. Good chance to go back and finish it.   Amazon has a sale on [RAVPower Element RP-PB07 10400mAh Portable Charger](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009V5X1CE/). $16 for the 10,400mAh model (with promo code P3FFG8XA). Or the bigger model: RAVPower Deluxe 13,000mAh External Charger ($24), Promo code ZMF24RGT.  That's a good deal.   The Following - how is this still a thing?   Yeah, same here. With $1500 budget I got high-end second hand hard tail, all Carbon, 9-kg/20-pounds bikes. A real beast.   I don't do technical rides, I prefer long marathon/endurance rides (50-75 miles) on mostly wide trails. So the bike fits me perfectly.     An artist is a person, before all else, and people often hold beliefs  Exactly. Even if she '"caved" in direct response to pressure' as OP wrote, that's fine, and by no means should be interpreted as a negative thing. Different people reacts differently to pressure, and she has every right to avoid difficult situations (if we assume it's a reaction and not political statement, which she obviously entitled to).  Hell, I know people that don't go to work because they have a little headache in the morning and they don't feel like standing in traffic, so why should be surprised when artists decide to dodge when a century old conflict knocks on their door.       We should vote for people with real life experience, like Brian Roberts.   To answer seriously for a second, 'rape culture' means the socio-cultural environment encourages rape, or at least does nothing to prevent it, meaning, rape is seen as a normal act.   I can tell this is true, because I wear suit and tie to meet clients. I'm literary raped by having to do that. Who's making me, you ask? Nobody, I'm self employed. This is how fucked and serious rape culture has become. I'm raping myself because it's what society expects of me.   I'm not sure what are you talking about. Create a shortcut called "Sound Playback" with the following target:      C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,,0  Create ahk script that runs it:      Run, Sound Playback.lnk  Activate the window:      Sleep, 100     WinWait, Sound,      IfWinNotActive, Sound, , WinActivate, Sound,      WinWaitActive, Sound,   use arrows to select the BT device (let's assume it's 3rd on the list)      Send, {DOWN}{DOWN}  Hit context menu, and choose disable/enable      Send, {APPSKEY}{DOWN}{DOWN}{ENTER}  I'm sure with 10 minutes tweaking and testing this can easily be done.       You are talking about 3000 years ago, so I think it's worth mentioning that according to Jewish law, 13 is the adult age, in which a boy  becomes accountable for their actions (12 for girls). The ritual is called Bar Mitzva. Part of the ritual is the father, thanking God that he's no longer responsible for his son's actions. http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2473-bar-mizwah   You can probably create AHK script to do that, so you'll just need to assign it to a keyboard or desktop shortcut.   Twist: there are 50 pills in that box and 1 mint. The girl likes to take a chance.   Dude, no preview spoilers.   You are not a real man! the proper way of doing that is monitoring your female teacher behavior. If one of them acts irrationally, offer her a tampon and tell her she doesn't even have to thank you.    OKAY! I'm going to craft a statue to prove you wrong! Step one: where can I download some stone and some tutorial ebooks?      I think his point is against the whole argument of: if something small and usually not that meaningful happens you can say goodbye to huge phenomena, that probably not single event can affect.  To say thay Clinton is a bad candidate is one thing, but to think that her election will make any dent in gender equality, for better or for worse, is a bit out of touch from reality and how social changes shape.

[ Kendrick Lamar - i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aShfolR6w8) - love yourself this summer.  In Baltimor, summer started early:  They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street   And a gun in the hood and a mob of police   And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends   And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup   These days of frustration keep y'all on tucking rotation   I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum bases   Dreams of realities peace   Blow steam in the face of the beast   The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now   The strong in me, I still smile     I love myself   (The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)   I love myself   (But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)   I love myself   (He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)   I love myself   (One day at the time, sun gone shine)     [Balai Maria (@balai_mari)](https://instagram.com/balai_mari/).   Just watched Real Time and one of the guests, Dan Senor, made that comment in the title (I didn't verify it). "We are pouring tons of money into places like Baltimore. Input isn't the problem, the output is a disaster." Bad and totally ineffective government spending.   Absolutely. If you can love a dog, feed him and put a roof over his head - get one. It's a win win situation. Dogs are very adaptive to their owner habits. If you leave early and get home late, the dog will get used it and probably sleep comfortably the whole time.  Edit: lots of people are saying that this isn't healthy, and I agree that it's not ideal. However, I replied to someone who compared adopting a dog to a dog living in a cage. This is far better life. And yes, you got to compensate for the time you are missing:  * wake up earlier to take the dog for a walk. If you can go on an early jog, that would be great. The dog will love it. it shouldn't even be a long jog, 2 miles is a good distance for a dog. [check this chart please](http://www.runnersworld.com/sites/default/files/dogs500.jpg). * take long walks with him at night, if it's a big dog that can run the distance (see chart above), consider using a bicycle. * whenever you have a day off, take the dog with you, stop at the beach or at the park.  * those are good ideas not only for the dog, but for you as well. * consider getting a walker. Depends on where you live, those shouldn't cost much. If you can't find one, you can also talk to a kid in your neighborhood that will take the dog out after school for few bucks.  Anyway, while I hear lots of those comments and agree with them, remember that the most important thing you can for a dog is to love him, show your affection, communicate with him, feed him properly and have fun with him while you are around. so if you are busy, it might not be 100% ideal, but not everything in life is. This is still better than a dog sitting in a cage in some shelter where he feels like nobody.    After some digging, I think I found [Balai Maria (@balai_mari) / Instagram](https://instagram.com/balai_mari/). *and if you are looking for more pictures, try also her Russian name:   .      [few more](http://imgur.com/a/3LX32)      As other have explained, it's a matter of percentage within population.   There's also another (unmeasurable) issue: how much of it justifiable? I'm not talking just about the final kill, but life events. For example, if [white kids are more likely to sell drugs, but black kids are more likely to go to prison for drug charges](http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/kids.htm), then black kids are more likely to grow up as criminals and have future trouble with the law.   So even if all police harassment is race-blind, there are still underlying issues that increases the chances of black people to be involved in such incidents.      It's like a typical dialog in a movie: "let's go out to a dinner tonight, I'll pick you up" - "sure" - both hang up. STOP, THEY DIDN'T SAY THE TIME! ^THEY ^ALSO ^NEVER ^SAY ^BYE!

It's not an original quote -- Michael Scott.   For every ingredient in the first row you can match any ingredient in the second row, so that's 5\*5 = 25 meals. For each one of those 25 meals you can add another variant from the 3rd row, so 25\*5 = 125 combos by the 3rd row, and so on. That's 5^5 = 3,125 meals   And [here's another variation](http://eattillyoubleed.com/2015/04/moroccan-preserved-lemons/) that was posted recently in /r/Cooking I think.

I was talking about economic policies, was I wrong in any of the examples I gave? And yes, republicans as whole are also far from libertarianism. I mean, Rand Paul is probably the closest viable candidate, and he's polling what? [not very strong even in its own base](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rand-paul-is-losing-his-fathers-base/).    what's wrong with requiring an ID to vote  There's nothing wrong with ID all by itself. However, in the current social environment and ID issues, lack of ID targets very specific demographics.   If, let's say, there's a major move to provide everyone with ID ([like many other countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_identity_card_policies_by_country#Countries_with_compulsory_identity_cards)), then it would be reasonable to force ID when voting after a grace period of few years.     I consider myself a libertarian but I don't see much distance  Well, his economic views are as far from libertarianism as possible.   I mean he's mostly against free trade, pro minimum wage, pro workers rights by law, heavy wallstreet regulation, etc. and there's the government intervention/stimulation angle which most Libertarian economists are against.  I'm don't mean to phrase them as bad policies, that's up to debate. But overall, don't expect much love at /r/Libertarian.   I meant as a core. Obviously some of running gags will aim at younger audience (those following him) and some will aim at older audience (those staying at that slot).   Anyway, he might surprise, who knows.

In Sweden, patriotism is heavily associated with racism for some reason.    lol. Thanks for that. Really helpful considering I'm almost always sleeping on my stomach with my hands under the pillow.  Also. How do you remember to do that reality check? Do you try to focus on something in the distance also when you are awake? Maybe in your job? I think most devices are scams though.     I don't think you shouldn't build rockets in a game that for *that* long...   I'm not sure how this answers my ANY questions at all... But hey. Good for you :)   When I read/hear that it's a great book again. I'm gonna read it. I never saw the movie either.   Wet eyes after 4 paragraphs... And that's an understatement.   Be glad it was not Bob. holy shit now I'm afraid of going to bed for just thinking of him..   You there. YOU. How often do you get lucid? And how long did it take before you were able to do it quite often? I have had maybe five lucid dreams in my life. 1 of them in my adult life.   I'd like to know what super calm mean in this case. If it's just calm. Sounds frickin' awesome.   Hopefully*   Hopefully a socialworker of some sort.   I was like 7. Maybe 8. (around 2000)  One night when I was gonna watch go turn on the TV (probably a recorded pokmon episode or something) I remember being more afraid of the dark than usual.  As I walk up to it to start it, I get this irrational fear of a growling bear or dinosaur. Or something. When I turn on the TV. There is a growling bear/dinosaur/whatever animal I was imagining right there growling.   I ran down as fast as I could. And I still remember it to this day.  **tl;dr: One time I predicted what was gonna be shown on the TV before I turned it on**  I'm not lying, and I would want and explanation.   Sure, but DNA tests are like mega expensive if I'm not mistaken. And there are a lot of less weird and sneaky ways of getting ones DNA.   Seems like a great last class before the new chalk boards went up: "Let's draw some awesome stuff on here before we put the new boards up. Someone will find them when they take them all down"  We will probably never know.   If we pretend all the tax money is water. And we put a million drops of that money-water in a big (big) bucket.   If you take out a glass and take a scoop. Which drops will you have taken out?   Trevligt och informativt inlgg. Jag gick ekonomi p gymnasiet, vilket inte sger srskilt mycket.

You got any good links?   No, but it has been posted here before. I'm not complaining. The new people here need to see it.      Well. I know some cool religious people to, but some are just. Well.   Yeah. If it's good shit, you should upvote. Many people will not have seen it. Especially considering how many new subscribers this sub always get. almost 10 000 in a month?   Yes.

No one can argue he was a fellow you would probably want to be friends with.   I wonder, what are the most severe safety risks when making an app to share your location with your friends. You wouldn't want some outsider to be able to get through and track you.  Not saving any location data more than temporary on the local device.     Inkomstskatt fr rika?

Hopefully we can turn towards green energy soon too so that there doesn't need to be any emissions.  If you downvote this. You are payed by the Koch Brothers. I'm just saying. If you don't agree. Write why.   Because Iceland has no army.   Yes, but there are no Nato missiles in Sweden, that's the whole point of this threat. They don't want any closer borders with Nato heavy weapons.   This is old. Not that it makes it irrelevant.     Jag hller med dig om att frverkliga skatter som inte drabbar gemene man utan endast de otroligt frmgna. (Jag vet inte vart grnsen gr mellan frmgen och otroligt frmgen)   Men lt oss sga 200 miljoner kronor.  Och som du sger r det ltt att undvika skatterna fr de som har resurserna. Kamprad har vl inte betalat ngon skatt sedan 1982 skulle jag tro.  Men att det mste gras r klart tycker jag. Det finns ingen sim behver miljarder kronor i personliga tillgngar. Men att det finns mnga som har det r sjlvklart. Och att de vill behlla allt r egentligen inte deras fel. Det r inprntat i vra gener efter miljoner rs selektivt urval fr att man ska vilja bra med sig s mycket mat hem man bara kan. Vra gener r vr vrsta fiende.  Kanske r det EU som borde ta tag i detta. Men den chansen r inte direkt stor..   Antagligen togs den bort fr att nn svinrik snubbe brjar bli gammal..  Arvsskatten r nog den enda som kan komma att pverka mig, men nog fan ska den finnas. Staten ska ha sin bit av kakan nr ngon fr pengar fr ngot en annan jobbat fr.   Now this is journalism.  How Russia can continue do deny after this is beyond me. There are so much proof.   I'll be a little shocked if you want. But I'm not.   Sadly they are doing their job perfectly if you watch their job description.. Which probably is to try and quiet down everything about how well he's doing. While making fun of his hair.   Jag r uppenbarligen ingen expert. Du kan inte krva av mig att jag ska komma upp med frslagen. Det r ngot folk med 8rig utbildning i mnet ska ta fram frslag p. Men vad sgs om kapitalvinster fr privatpersoner ver en viss grns, hgre moms p lyxfreml av olika slag, fastighetsskatt ver ett visst vrde. Jag r som sagt ingen ekonom men det r inte srskilt svrt att gra det om man vl vill.  Men hej. Vad sgs om att gra det lite dyrare att anstlla unga igen. Det funkar ju ocks.   *"Konfiskeras"*. Du behver inte ta i s du spricker min mn.  Istllet fr att hja arbetsgivaravgifter och elskatt kan man kanske istllet hja frmgenhetsskatten med 3% p alla som har mer n 2 Miljarder kronor i personliga tillgngar?  Eller tror du att man skulle sakna ngra miljoner om man hade s mycket pengar?   **Vad gller bankerna.** S verkar du ha ftt allt om bakfoten. Bankerna kraschade fr att Clinton (Den amerikanska staten som du sger) lt sl ihop de kommersiella bankerna som ger ut ln, med investmentbanker som handlar med kapital p bl.a aktiemarknaden. (**Och detta gjorde han fr att han ftt massor med donationer frn bankerna fr att gra just detta**). Inte fan r politiker s dumma att de gr det med vilja. De hade massor med ptryckningar frn marknaden att gra just detta. Och stoppar man tillrckligt med pengar i kampanjfinansiering t politiker i USA s kan man f dem att lgga en rst i ett lagfrslag som gynnar dig. S r det bara.  Bank A brjar lna pengar av Bank B fr att investera i marknaden, sedan lnar Bank B pengar av Bank C fr att investera i marknaden.   SEN. brjar det roliga. Bank A lnar pengar av Bank C fr att kunna betala tillbaka lnet till bank C och Bank B som d fr in lite pengar investerar vidare. Detta fortstter och 2008 hnde det som mnga ekonomer skrek sina halsar rda ver i nstan 10 r utan att ngon lyssnade.   HELA SYSTEMET FLL. Och de tog halva Europa med sig.  Du kan inte sga att det r var personers ln utan kreditvrdighet som orsakade kraschen. Det var bankernas vrdslshet och girghet som orsakade den och inget annat.   Den funkade. Nej jag har aldrig beskt den trden. Verkar ha skrivit en del vettigt i det inlgget dock.. Mycket stmmer.  Min inspiration kommer frn att jag hnger mycket /r/SandersForPresident fr att jag tror att det r USAs enda chans att komma p ftter. Han har aldrig ngonsin tagit stora pengar, aldrig krt en attackreklam vid val och det frsta han ska gra om han blir vald r att f ut pengarna ur politiken.. (Han motstter sig ocks stora handelsavtal mellan USA och Asien som bara finns fr att det ska bli billigare att importera varor tillverkade av 10ringar..)  Hillary Clinton har ndrat nstan allt hon har att sga fr att matcha honom. Han har ftt ett enormt genomslag p bara en och en halv mnad sedan han utannonserade att han skulle delta i valet.  [Ta en titt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtBVuye4fZQ)  Tog en titt p budgeten, lste ngra PDFer som Regeringen slppt och vips s kan man f en uppfattning om vart vrt eget land r p vg. Arbetarpartiet hjer avgifter fr arbetare och hjer elskatt fr arbetande mnniskor. Medan man lter totalt 1 500 miljarder kronor som de allra rikaste har tillsammans ligga kvar orrt.   He's doing it to get his brand out there. The Young Turks made a great video about it (damn I'm glad I found those guys) Unbiased reporters that are articulate are hard for find.  [You can watch the explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdgq6ZD4I3Q)     Missfrst mig inte. Han har en bra bit att g mot jtten Clinton. Men han har gjort bra ifrn sig (frvnande bra p en och en halv mnad). Srskilt i New Hampshire, Iowa vilket r de tv viktigaste staterna eftersom det r val dr frst.   Amerikansk media tystar och vill inte prata om honom. Vilket inte r s konstigt eftersom han dessutom sagt att mediekoncernen som ger alla stora nyhetskanal r fel, och han vill bryta upp dem...  men bakom lyckta drrar r Hillary Clinton livrdd. Hon har ndrat alla sina policys till samma som Sanders. Det borde sga en hel del kan man tycka?    Jag hller med dig. Men inte sg vi ngon hjning p kolen eller oljan som r ca 25%.  Jag har inte satt mig in i det s mycket men jag tror att det r vattenfall som ligger bakom.. Och miljpartiet.. Vilka jvla mesar.  Det r iallafall en drivmedelskatt p gng till rsskiftet. Det tycker jag r bra. ven om jag bor p landet s fr man lra sig att tnka lngre n nsan rcker och dra sitt str till stacken.    Jag blev frvnad ver mngden vettig diskussion som faktiskt skapades. Var rtt sker p att 80% skulle vara gnll p migration.   Du har rtt i mycket det du sger. ldrevrden verkar dock ha ftt ett tillskott i budgeten p flera hll.    Are you not entertained?   Gladiator.    Yeah, he's got a foundation to soak up all the money..   Sna som rstar ner allt.. Och de finns p hela reddit.. frstr verkligen.    Jag sa aldrig att den var bra. Men du har hamnat p fel plats med dina jvla invandrarkommentarer.  Edit: dumt att svra t dig. Frlt.    Don't downvote the poor fellow. He don't know what a real feminist is. He only knows about the feminazis, and those will scream their lungs out at you trying to get their ungrounded arguments out. .. A real feminist is a person who thinks everyone is equal, regardless of gender.    UK has some really weird laws when it comes to sex.   Regrettably those are the ones who scream the loudest.. That sounded wrong. But you get the point.    . That's a word. Means "river"   G hem till /r/sweden med din skit   Det r min uppfattning. Mestadels extremister av ngot slag. Krnkraftslskare, krnkraftshatare, Sverigedemokrater och sociala rttvisekrigare..    Well, just about every Scandinavian will speak decent to very good English. And I'm studying and really don't know very much about politics if I'm to be sincere. I can read up on stuff when I'm getting into it, but it feels like bernie needs a pro.  Thank you though. We Swedes love to be complemented on our English.    That new Patriot Park outside of Moscow? That is not made to grow the patriots of the country then?   Samtidigt som nyheten kommer om att de i r har skaffat 40 nya krnvapenmissiler.      a fellow child of the motor way. YANA    It's a publicly traded company. All they will EVER care about is showing a great profil for their shareholders. Every quarter. The streaming companies should fight for us, the consumers. Not the other way around.   It's like asking a politician what he/she voted on a topic.   Tror det gller din umgngeskrets lika mycket som alla andra umgngeskretsar i hela vrlden. Jmlikhet fr alla my ass.   They think they have to choose between a rock and a hard place.  We have the power people. Because they rely on our payments.   I will not. But I will tell you. It's not getting any better for us. They announced the budget yesterday and no mention of higher taxes for wealthy..  Considering we have IKEA not having payed any taxes since I don't know when. The owner is worth about 61 Billion dollars..  Well. At least he don't make his money from oil. But it's still a shame. Also H M clothes use child labour in Bangladesh. And payed a total of about 60 dollars of taxes to Bangladesh a couple of years ago.. Pretty much two pair of pants.   So we have our own fair share of greedy billionairs.    The fact that they want to raise subscription when they are clearly getting more and more users. No one is commenting on that...  We shouldn't have to choose between higher pay or ads. They just want to pocket more money..   Thanks for the response. I guess forming rules that are not to broad is really hard.  The speech from Marshalltown was maybe the best one yet. He really put his words in the right order, and he was maybe even more engaged in what he said than he otherwise is.   https://youtu.be/GGcdILJ3wz0?t=242   Regrettable it's an amateurish video but I guess that you guys got that clip somewhere. People need to analyze it and get to what is so good about how he phrased things. Because I was not the only one saying it was the best speech.   Sure. I can hate Warner Bros. more. But you still follow the guidelines and policies of your parent company.    Oh I forgot to tell the whole story. (the real story I'm not making this shit up as I go along lol).  In Sweden there is a Vacation Law. That basically says you are *entitled* to 4 weeks of consecutive payed vacation sometime between June and August. Some people save a week or two. Others take it all. Others save them all for up to five years and just stops working for a year. (not very usual, but the vacation days can be saved up to five years)  There are exceptions when a company can order you back or else. But that has to be very special circumstances and I've never heard of it.  Bernie should have a political major advisor from Scandinavia..   Yeah. I know but that doesn't matter. Warner is Warner.   That law should be in the Reddit amendments.   Why not make it Stump while we're at it? I learned to not use his real name because that's the only reason he's running. Name recognition and branding of himself...   I hate Time Warner ever since they ceased and desisted MERP. A Skyrim Mod set in Middle Earth.   USA has taken up the scent on welfare now brother. It sure feels good to sit on the other side of the great pond witnessing a revolution in progress.   Because sadly our own budget yesterday was catastrophe .   "I can tell you I'm a little surprised. But I'm not"   In Sweden we get payed more than usual when we are on vacation... I'm almost feeling ashamed.   Open you mind.   EDIT: I'm not in an environmental group. I read scientific papers based on tons of evidence about all kinds of subjects. The environment happens to be one of them. You can look it up yourself if you want. Evidence supported by far more than a handful of scientists. Your own [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) included. Which earth sciences Ted Cruz want's to cut funding for because they collide with his and his donor's personal interests. The reasons he give for wanting to ct their earth sciences research is because he don't think they should do research. But only space travel....  They are not interested in facts, and will try to shut down everyone who tries to give them facts.. You. The voter of America. Have to look at the evidence with open eyes and think.   END EDIT : Because what the oil industry is doing is taking the carbon that has been stored in the earth for billions of years. Dead animals and plants getting crushed and broken down into raw oil over the eons.  In an exponentially increasing rate we have been pumping it up. And set it on fire in engines and power plants.   The chemical process while burning any kind of oil basically joins a carbon atom with 2 oxygen atoms, making it into a gas and released into the atmosphere. The increasing density of the molecule that is formed: CO2, due to the dark color of the carbon atom. Makes sunlight reflected on the earths surface (mostly ocean and ice caps reflect sunlight. But with increasing levels of carbon in the air more and more sunlight is being absorbed by the darker atoms, just like a black t-shirt gets warmer than a white t-shirt.  This is a spiral. The more carbon, the warmer it gets. And when millions and millions of years old ice melts and exposes methane gas trapped underneath. Temperatures will climb even more because methane absorbs even more sunlight.    I'm sorry that you are a little out of the loop, genuinely. I understand what kind of upbringing you had. but you should always know that it is never to late to late. Never. ever to late to change.  Oh. And $2500 so out of touch with reality I'm almost crying.. [Read for yourself](http://www.thenation.com/blog/178743/koch-brothers-spent-twice-much-2012-election-top-ten-unions-combined) 412 670 666$, I have read higher and I have read lower. But nothing that comes close to your number.    I think you completely missed the point where I'm not a moron who needs a science education for a fucking 12-year old...   -8 points. So. People actually thought I corrected you? Of course it's the Sun  It seems you have to write like you are talking to a five year old to make /r/science get that you are not a fucking moron.   OH MY GOD.... That I don't believe in. I'm Swedish. We are atheists. Well. I'm the coward's kind of atheist.   You most certainly do. And I have not even mentioned the climate change and the fossil fuels. You do know that Cruz takes huge amounts of money from those two dudes who owns one of the biggest oil companies in the world? The Koch brothers. Worth 40 billion dollars. EACH. Those guys deserve their money. I mean. Their father made them selling oil riggs to the russians after all. They should get to do whatever they want with it. Tax Free. Even though their company is one of the major contributors to the climate changing... And they neglecting the existance of the very phenomenon that would actually hurt their business?  The impending drought climate that is predicted to hit America in about 10-15 years, much due to the fact of global warming?  Let me guess. You don't believe in global warming. You are choosing to believe the 3 % of the world's scientists on this issue, instead of the 97% that says it's as real as you and me. And it's gonna have consequences.  OR. Maybe the 97% of all climate scientists in the world are flat-earthers? If you knew what the scientific model was..   EDIT: For some reason people seem to believe I'm a moron. To clarify. Of course the sun is a fusion reactor. I'm not retarded. And I just think that a building a fusion reactor here on earth is not only reaaaaaallly hard but also unnecessary because we already have one that's gonna hang around for about a couple of billion years. But hey. I know you want to educate people on science. I suggest you don't do it in the /r/science because here people actually know some things...  However we want to make "green energy" that is not nuclear. The energy is always gonna come from the sun. I am beginning to think Fusion Reactors is a red herring to keep us from beginning to invest in solar of various kind.     Witchcraft.   Absolutely. The fact that you don't have paid paternity is beyond me. How the hell is that kid gonna develop naturally with that lack of stimulation?   I'll be a little surprised if you want. But I'm not.  Zero benefits is... Wow. They would get massacred by unions in Sweden if they were that big and didn't offer benefits.   It's something. But you should really begin to take your vacation. It's your right to do and your boss should be happy about it. You will be more productive if you have something to work for more than fridays.   Ja. Du har sklart rtt. Men eftersom vrlden r uppdelad i lnder s fr man gra vad man kan. Vi kommer f ett vrlds-EU/US/UK ngon gng i framtiden. Men tills det hnder tror jag tyvrr chansen r ganska liten att vi kommer f se sann solidaritet..   Maybe. But your claim "knowing" is just plain ignorant. You can't know something that hasn't happend.    I think you mean dark ages. Well, better still... Imagine if religion did just touched the morale of things. And not people's entire lives.   Jag fixar. Welfare for everyone.   Vnliga Regards, Sweden. The Welfare State.   I'll be a little surprised if you want. But I'm not.   EDIT completing the information: You poor bastards. We enjoy 25 days of payed, consecutive vacation a year (optional, of course. And you are able to save your days for up to five years, spreading it out or taking it all in one go) Also you can save your overtime as vacation. Or take it out in money. Your choice.  But 2 weeks is a lot better than no weeks. So keep at it guys. You will win it. And [I shall cheer for you](http://www.sharegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Gladiator-quotes-3.gif)   I found this and it makes it easy to see how much a billion dollars is. It's quite hard to fathom when just thinking numbers.   Sure you can believe that if you want. But the questions you need to ask yourself. Do you agree with his policies?   I will tell you some of his policies:  **Flat Taxes**: That means people who owns a billion dollars will pay as much tax as one who owns ten thousand dollars. And ten dollars. Flat tax rate means everyone pays the same tax. Regardless of anything.  He wants to abolish **Net Neutrality**. That means he doesn't want internet providers to load all websites at the same rate.  Basically advertising will load instantly, and the youtube video will load slow. Because the advertiser has payed a lot to increase their speed. Net Neutrality is good.. No.. IT'S GREAT and nothing we want to live without.  TED CRUZ **don't want abortions. **  Oh, and he hates **immigrants**, **homosexuals** and he want's to send US troops into the middle east again to fight ISIS. Instead of letting the neighbouring countries that are the good kind of Islam take care of things.  That was the last I had to say on this matter man. I hope you have opened your eyes, or are the biggest troll. Because otherwise..        Ja, jag funderade med p om elpriset skulle pverka industrier. Och det gr de sklart. Du har rtt. nnu en anledning till att inte hja energiskatt p krnkraft istllet fr kol och olja. Jag har debatterat s mycket att jag inte orkar att skriva fackligt. Jag r inte srskilt bra p det heller. Jag vill mest f folk att tnka till.  Inkomstskatt r en dlig skatt enligt mig. Antingen beskattar man frmgenhet eller konsumtion av varor som inte uppfyller de krav man stllt p dem rrande kvalit, milj eller arbetsfrhllanden. Som du sger r det vldigt svrt att beskatta frmgenhet fr de smiter. Skattesmitare borde sprras in lika hrt som ngon som som kr ver ngon med bil och ker drifrn.  Stannar man och gr sin plikt r det lugnt. Tnker man bara p sig sjlv och ker drifrn ska man bli straffad.  Skatt p kapitalvinst r ju det bsta. P det sttet skrar man att pengarna stannar kvar i landet och inte sticker ivg via nn stiftelse till Bahamas.      Det var ett knslomssigt uttalande. Riskerna r ganska lga. Men vi har inga planer fr framtiden nr det kommer till krnkraften. Jag sa att jag var neutral. Jag vill inte avveckla den. Kanske i framtiden nr vi har bttre alternativ, men idag r det ett av vra bsta alternativ fr att producera en stor mngd el.  Men nd r detta det enda du tar till dig frn den hr trden... Det r tragiskt hur blinda vissa r och hur instllda p sakfrgor de r. Jag har en vn som bor granne med Ringhals. Det r omjligt att hlla en diskussion med henne om detta fr hon pstr att det inte finns ngra nackdelar i princip.   Jag missade valet 2010 fr att jag r ett jvla decemberbarn. Nej du r inte ung och nyintroducerad. Du r en av f mnniskor som frsttt problemet med politiken. Inte bara i Sverige utan hela vrlden.  Vi r inte s rika att mnga skulle gynnas av en snkt frmgenhetsskatt. Det r inte en punkt majoriteten av alliansens vljare vill. nd r det politik de fr nr de vl har makten. Det luktar fisksoppa om alltihop.   Vnsterpartiets jobb r ju att frska gynna oss i Sverige med hjlp av deras ideologi. Precis som alla andra partier i riksdagen.. Inte fasen tnker de slppa in alla som vill komma hit och jobba. De verlever hemma, men de kanske fr det bttre stllt i Sverige.  Att istllet slppa in dem som riskerar att bli knsstympade osv.osv. i sitt hemland, och frska integrera dem i vrt samhlle som ligger p plats 144 nr det kommer till reell befolkningstillvxt. Dr har du en av definitionerna till det dr ordet du frskte sga att vnstern saknar. Att folk inte fattar att vi kommer se tillbaka p den hr tiden som s jvla idiotisk r bortom all frstelse. Vra debatter gr i cirklar medan storebror str utanfr och gapskrattar t oss och vrt jvla tjat om [Inandningen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lcRQfzDXBs)   Titta p USA och se hur valfriheten hjlpt deras land. Kom tillbaka med argument till varfr det r bttre n hr.   *"Endast vid en (helt orealistisk) uniform frdelning skulle 40% rknas som fattiga."*  S.. USA allts? Eller missuppfattar jag dig rtt?   Tack fr tipset... Varfr gr man s? Jag tror inte att en vldigt rlig person kan stta sig in i denna mnniskas tankestt..  	105
 I could, but I would need to ship it internationally to me here in Australia. The P650SE was appealing to me, but I was under the impression the base model didn't include hard drives or operating system, and when I added these in the price difference wasn't big. Also, I need a 17" screen. Thanks for the tip though!   Interesting. I wonder how much longer we have left...  Edit: And purples   Nicely done ;)   I also just joined the brotherhood at 10s. Welcome, doubleFisted33 :)   Hi all, trying to decide whether the extra ~$400 is worth it to upgrade to the [P37W](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5349) from the lead in [P37K](http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5375). The laptops are not cheap so I am trying to keep it reasonable. I specifically need a relatively high powered, thin gaming machine with internal optical drive at a min 17" screen.  From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-965M.134120.0.html) to a GTX 970M in the P37W. According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.  Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the GPU upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.  Thanks!

From what I can see, the only difference is the upgrade from a [GTX 965M](http://gpuboss.com/graphics-card/GeForce-GTX-965M) to a GTX 970M in the P37W.  According to GPUBoss, the 970M is up to 35% more powerful, has a larger memory bus and higher clock speed.  Does anyone have an opinion as to whether the upgrade would be worth the extra cash? I'd love some help. Also, please let me know if I am overthinking things and the 965M is perfectly solid.  Thanks!      'Pet hate' is a colloquially accepted idiom   DAMN!

 I'm gay.  But he's way cool.  Much cooler than I am.      Yup.  But, when the dispute is between a woman and a man, the ignorant public will typically judge on the side of the woman.     I don't doubt that more often than not, it was the man that was being overly aggressive... so people just assume that this is the case EVERY-TIME.   I got caught in the trap of that.     As a male I say it's bullshit.   But as a person I just say suck it up and move on because it's a fact of life.  And to remember that an open mind is useless without open eyes.        Me either.  And if I do click I read the headline, photos and captions... then I scroll to the bottom and watch the astroturfers and trolls duke it out on Disqus.  The more extreme or radical the comments in Disqus, the more likely the REAL story is something I should be concerned about. So I then look deeper for information on websites that don't try and sell me one crazy tricks...  Unless multiple reviews of the articles claim it's legit on reddit... I don't bother.  I'm so tired of being disappointed is all.   And the comments on reddit that say it's a good article can't be stupid.  Like "DIS ARTICLE PREACH! CAUSE IT RIGHT!!!"

She was definitely a real person at some point but had since had her entire body replaced with cybernetics beginning in childhood.     It was safe to say she was no longer alive but self aware and conscious.      Turning off Talkback reduces a big chunk of the lag.   It does not eliminate it entirely though.   My exynos is almost instant.  My snapdragon is very laggy task switcher.      And when he did that he got closer to becoming president than he ever had before.      You need to get a lawyer... and there are rules to who can file and what type of debt.    If you have assets that can be liquidated they will be.  You can claim exemptions and keep some stuff... but for the most part yes you file, they liquidate what they can and the rest gets written off to the taxpayers.     There are many different types of bankruptcy chapters you can file.   The best thing to do is talk to a lawyer and let them advise the best way forward.     Keep in mind: its not all puppies and roses.    You won't get credit again for a while.  You won't be able to get an apartment without huge deposits .  You have to live cash.    You can have trouble gaining employment if they do a credit check.     So you have to be sure you REALLY need it... because it doesn't necessarily make life easier.   For some, yes... it rescues them.  The outcome is less bad than the debt.   But if you're not having trouble paying your bills and your credit rating is good, there is zero reason to fuck that up with bankruptcy.      Not on weed it doesn't.     Which doesn't have diddly shit to do with what the discussion on implementing the technology.   Did you even fucking read the article... or the thread before you came in with this utter nonsense.    I can't even say it's contradictory... its just complete and total nonsense that has ZERO to do with what we were talking about.     I'm turning off inbox replies now.  LOL   Oh my fucking god....

It really is absolutely massive and you can see it from great distances away.     It will also be the death of us all.      Just remember... each time you watch one of these dots fill up.... you can never get it back.  It's gone forever as you approach your own final dot.      But they don't have insurance policies for these cases.  Who would insure against that?  The police are constantly being sued.  Someone is eventually going to win.   The premiums on this insurance would be astronomical.     [See my reply above with the links about taxes and settlements.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3dolwh/police_dog_dies_after_being_left_in_handlers/ct7lscz)     [Except there are places that have raised taxes specifically because they have to pay huge settlements.](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2015/06/01/floyd-dent-inkster-beating-tax-settlement/28328993/)     Suing the police doesn't hurt the police.  [It just hurts taxpayers as these 7 other cities found out.](http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/bad-cop-7-cities-where-shocking-police-abuses-cost-taxpayers-millions)      I'm not a doctor.  But I grow Coconut and produce coco oil.    You might not want to use coconut oil.  Coconut oil is extracted from the copra, which is cooked over anything from coconut husk, to palm leaves, and some producers (not us) will even use cardboard.    At any rate, there is a good deal of fungus that grows on the cooked copra.  Not only is the oil slightly acidic, but it's not just coconut that's in it.   One particular mold is a white mold... this mold tells you that the copra's water content is low and the meat is ready to be sold to the processor.   This white mold is an irritant to the lungs and eyes which causes a moderate amount of itching for about an hour after exposure.  While most of this mold gets filtered out, some will still remain.  The amounts remaining will have no effect if eaten, but a vagina is a bit more sensitive...   Perhaps try a lubricant specifically designed for her lady parts and is balanced for PH and all that.     Edit: Save the coco oil for cooking.  The health benefits are outstanding.  Better for you than olive oil.      Thanks!    I agree.  I usually replace Unity.   I wonder if you can replace the desktop environment on the phone.      this....actually fucking works.      What the fuck are you talking about.  We aren't talking deductibles.  And shit plans have shitty deductibles, and stupid low caps.     So honestly, I don't even have a fucking clue why you're entering the conversation, at this point, with this nonsense.      It can if your hand is wrapped around it.       no it's the nuclear powered seawater.     Well duh... you obviously wouldn't do it in a manner that would kill the plants... that's a given.

As such they've found lots of stuff I've carefully stuck between the pages.     My cat died on a different day than my dad but I still say cherish it.     They both utilize the same technology.    Edit: A very nutshell "How does it work"   Transporters work by scanning the body's molecular structure, converting that into energy, and then shooting it to another location where the molecules are reassembled from available carbon.    The replicator works by having molecular patterns of objects saved in memory.  It utilizes a "carbon block" as the source material where it uses a transporter beam to materialize the object.  Its all a bunch of mumbo jumbo hootinany nonsense.      What the fuck is wrong with us?        Yeah... before it tips over like what's happening in Guam.     I agree with you so hard that I want to have your babies.    Does this mean that she supports "liveable wage" over "minimum wage"?    Who says it needs to consume 100% of our carbon.    Why limit ourselves to any one solution?   Employ multiple solutions dynamically and regionally....   I'm so sick of the arguments against doing something always seem to amount to, "well it is impossible to get 100% so it doesn't work at all, or it's not worth doing."   Where is undersky in all of this?    Plus you could build the fern towers right next to the industry producing carbon.  You could capture 100% of the carbon and shove it at the ferns.    even if you succeed at reducing only 20% of the carbon produced, its still beneficial.... and you get a profitable byproducts to go along with it.        They'll come sue me when my houseplants find fern dna in my applesauce babble Rage!!    I feel like I need a hug from Jesus now.      So your son comes with cupholders then?

Unless you can afford the premium insurance, your shit is only partially covered.     "Obamacare rocks"   LOL   Well to people not on a doctors salary 6500 can be 30% of their yearly income.  So for the middle and lower class 6500 can be just as impossible to pay as 150,000.    So it doesn't really matter what the end number is to families that can't pay.    It should be free. We are the richest nation to ever exist so my fuck it should be free.  For everyone rich and poor.   Then those aren't good mangers.  And it still has nothing to do with technical knowledge.   The point is that managerial skills can replace technical knowledge.  If you don't have the managerial skills, then you won't keep your job long when your department fails.     I never had brain cells before reading it.   Well... both.     [Brains have a way of doing that....](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gore/comments/3dco2u/ill_just_head_out_to_the_store_now_brb_gore_nsfw/)    Didn't it come out later that a good bit of faces of death  was fake?     I think we place to much weight on pieces of cloth left to flap in the wind.      I saw it after I posted.  I'm missing half of my dominant hand so I type with one hand.  I tend to not give fucks about certain typos.   And I'm certainly not going to waste any effort in getting Butt Krispies name correct.   I can't imagine being able to keep that down.     whatever.  call him a turd for all I care.     They're great for new teeth.

It doesn't matter they could not give consent because they are inebriated.      Which is dumb... because it says to women that they are inferior in the way they handle alcohol, and therefore not responsible for their actions while on alcohol.   This is how drunk women charge equally drunk men with rape.     Edit: And it's because of this situation that REAL rape gets marginalized as falsely accused. See Bill Crosby about that.     Dear Ladies,  Please blow into breathalyser before reaching for my zipper.   One time I rejected a girls advances. I only said "No thank you I'm just relaxing tonight." She get angry and scream to me, "I said no!  Don't fucking touch my ass again! SECURITY!"  She then starts screaming that i'm a pervert and sexually assaulted her.    I got the fuck beat out of me on the way out and they used my head to open the big ass solid wood door on the front of the establishment.          They do all the time.  Its about what kind of interest rate you're willing to accept.  Many lenders, like Citi, have daughter corps that specialize in subprime lending.  They'll lend to the shittiest of credit scores with the highest interest rates attached.  The profit is made in the tax write-offs when the borrower declares bankruptcy.      Most people, who have 100,000 education costs, earn substantially more to go along with that.   Sure there are outliers that get underemployed... they get fucked and may have to go the chapt 13 route. Or if they make TOO MUCH they go another chapter as well.  Some get off only paying 20% of the debt back after it is restructured.     The lenders make money.  They aren't just told to stuff it and walk away.  The taxpayers foot the bill.        Edit: I should also note that it is not IMPOSSIBLE to discharge college loan debt through bankruptcy alone.  There are special cases, like when someone earned a PhD but now they work at mcDonald's, where the filer is allowed to discharge some or all of their college loans.       Chapter 7 remains on your credit for 10 years.   However, you can repair your credit through smart choices and Chpt 7 won't matter after just 2 years.    As long as you show that you're paying your bills since the bankruptcy discharge date, you won't have problems obtaining credit.   Some people even get mortgages just 2 or 3 years after declaring bankruptcy.     Some lenders may view you as less of a risk.   You cannot claim bankruptcy again until after that 10 year mark. So if you have a good income, and you show you're paying a secured credit card on time, a lender will agree to extend credit... 'cause you ain't getting off that hook.    They also know you're trying to rebuild your credit, so you're less likely to skip payments.   Edit: Lastly, get all your advice from a lawyer.  Don't try to file on your own.     Huh?     Both the Bible and the Koran give followers instructions to kill non-believers in the name of God/Allah.        He was delighted by the stereotype.  That wasn't a criticism... he was bragging when he said that shit.   He loved it.       What in the fuck?   Am I understanding this?  If I get free college, I get some 2nd string instructors?    If I'm correct in that (if not please correct me), this basically turns public universities into junior college turd centers of the early 90s.      Edit: It was supposed to say "junior college tutor centers".... but I think turd is good too so I'll leave it.      I'm sort of on the fence about this.  While on the surface it's easy to say, "Well that's bullshit they are managing something they don't have a clue about" I think it doesn't stand up to reality.      I am called a "Logistical Engineer".   Basically I find systems that are broke... and I fix them.   For example. I organized and oversaw the installation of a community water system that feeds over 10,000 homes.  I don't know shit about plumbing.   I just found people that did, and made sure they were where they needed to be.     I organized the building of hundreds of clinics and hostpitals.... I don't know shit about construction.      So while it's easy to think it's bullshit that a manager doesn't know the technical sides of what they are managing, it doesn't mean that they will be an ineffective manager.    Like a master general controlling his undefeated armies, yet he's never actually fought in the trenches himself.       One should feel encouraged to learn the technical side.  But it's not requirement to win.      That's a great point you made.  However, [research in Germany](http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/30/marijuana-compound-treats-schizophrenia-with-few-side-effects-clinical-trial/) doesn't really corroborate your claims here.  [Neither did the more recent findings in Australia.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2735555/Now-marijuana-used-TREAT-PREVENT-schizophrenia.html)     the oort cloud is outside the solar system?    say wha??  Bicycles don't even move at the same speed as other vehicles and are not typically found amongst them in the middle of the lane.  They are not motorized so they are not approaching at the same speeds as another vehicle.     Most people do not ride them in places where the traffic moves faster than they can.   In New York City, the bicycles often move faster than the cars because they have the luxury of fitting where no cars do not, and dropping to the sidewalk (even if illegal) to avoid snags.   That doesn't stop them from being killed.  They have all the dangers of a motorcycle with none of it's advantages.       So bicycles don't even belong in the same comparison as motorized vehicles.      The end point is: motorcycles are **immensely** deadlier than cars.  I'm not really understanding how someone who claims to have been riding since the mid 70s is trying to assert otherwise.    The risk of dying in a car is still present.  But that doesn't mean equal.        And stop blowing your enlistment bonus and deployment money on cars and motorcycles!

In which case you'll do chapter 13.  which does waive some debt, you just have to repay a percentage of it.... which is a lot better than 100%.   Many people end up just paying 5 to 20% of what they owe.      [Article I Section 8 clause 4](www.heritage.org/constitution/articles/1/essays/41/bankruptcy-clause)  [Wikipedia if you prefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States)  edit: why is the link not showing correctly?     What??  Bankruptcy is a constitutional right.   You file it with the courts and don't say shit to the lender.     Descent 3 did this to me.   They are downvoting me because it's kind of a douche baggery thing to do.    Although the banks are douche bags so it's hard for me to get angry over them getting fucked.   Which they aren't.... the taxpayers are.     Some people take the attitude that their taxes have paid for bankruptcies so they don't feel bad about utilizing their constitutional right.   And people really forget that... they look down and talk shit to people that declare bankruptcy like they are bad people.  But they forgot that its a goddamn constitutional right.   Its how our society protects itself.      Well I know of three people that did it from my time working in a shady lending center. I worked there for 1 month and saw 3 people that did this.    It's not a matter of securing the loan, but what interest rate you are willing to pay.   And if you're gonna do bankruptcy then the interest rate doesn't matter.     This is especially useful to people that are fully employed in the career field they were educated in.  So the income they receive is often more in line with the tuition they paid and therefore easier to lend on.     Even if your credit is shitty, you can get a loan.   While I worked there we routinely took 525 credit score.  And one guy, with a 495 score, received 25 thousand at 23% interest rate.     So, you can always find some shitty dirtback lender that loans out.  These lenders are counting on bankruptcy claims happening, because it allows them to do some tax jiggery applesauce where they still turned a profit.     Our company was a child company of Citi.

Declare bankruptcy and claim the car as an exemption.     Wait 10 years while you get to keep all your money as your own.

You die from the things that shred people in cars on a bike.  And you also elevate small taps to life threatening situations.    On a bike you have every single possible danger that exists for a car.   And then you add some to it by elevating non-life threatening events into ones that easily cause death.     I'm a motorcyclist and I've been riding for a long long time, I'm highly experienced, and even taught the motorcycle safety course that was required by the military to ride on post.     I also sold my bike yesterday because the risk is not worth it.     What the fuck are you even talking about?    Ok so A car you have the same danger of getting stuck by a 80mph truck and dying.    on a bike you STILL have that danger IN ADDITION to elevating minor fender benders into life threatening situations....which you don't have in a car.    I've been riding for 15 years and it's clear you haven't a single clue what you're talking about.     Could you violate Rule 1 harder please?  What's the matter with you?

 From Wikipedia  As of the census[10] of 2000, there were 5,920 people, 2,371 households, and 1,707 families residing in the county.

EDIT 2:  "Fidnee Lob". How come so many of the umpires are unable to pronounce the (very limited) jargon essential for their job? They could learn it in like ten minutes...  EDIT 3: Fantastic ralley at 2-2, 30:15  EDIT 4: Another Deuce in a Novak serving game. Wait, he's got it. Phew!  EDIT 5: Novak with no answers to Anderson's serve as of yet...  EDIT 6: In my heart of hearts I thought this would be a quick affair, with Djokovic coming out on top. Not looking that way right now...  EDIT 7: Was Anderson targeting Hawkeye with that return?  EDIT 8: Anderson could win it in the next game. Crazy...  EDIT 9: But he doesn't. 5-5.  EDIT 10: that's a bad double fault from Anderson. 15-30.  EDIT 11: Djokovic breaks and gets to serve for the match! Anderson self-destructed in this game...  EDIT 12: 0:30! Are we going to tiebreak?  EDIT 13: matchpoint Djoker!  EDIT 14: Djoker sews it up on the first try. Wow, how intense was this?!   I have this urge to hand him a pair of red swimming trunks and a safety buoy, and have him go to Malibu to save drowning people by day and lay with beautiful women at night.

I am so disapointed :(   Shhh.. ei siit saa puhua.   St. Petersburg is most european city in Russian. It is almost like Hong Kong in China, where ideas and ideologies dont really match with main country. It is also quite pretty city. It is also quite safe to travel from Helsinki with train.

But where the tits came from?   This should be in /r/aww   Is euro exit in Tsipras's agenda? Because looks like letter is Tsipras way to get Greek people vote no. And it is also possible "no" will end up in euro exit. Is this just way to add euro exit in to Tsipras's toolbox in negotiations? What are they actually voting? Is voting unreadable for reason? Are they building Tsipras "people support" with false voting so he can do what ever he wants and later say "you voted me".   Wow such political game, many plots. Tsipras gave "power" to people with referendum when there is not really anything to talk anymore. But what is the point of this letter? He wants to show people he is actually doing something when he is not?   Kinky unix porn!   Heavy breathing.   I was thinking that must been quite service because she is not even so attractive.   Fuck you, safes are serious shit.    ja on tysin eprealistista olettaa  Paitsi jos on lukenut sen ensimmisen artikkelin mys.    Alkuperisess kommentissasi viittasit siihen, ett kyht eivt hankkisi lapsia ilman sosiaalitukia.   Se oli vhn arvelua siit olisiko heill mahdollisesti yhtn lasta. Se perustui siihen olettamukseen ett heill ei olisi rahaa yllpit lasta ja siihen ett suomessa harva vastuullinen aikuinen hankkii lapsia taloudellisesti haastavassa tilanteessa. Tm siis tilanteessa jossa suomessa ei jaettaisi yhtn sosiaaliturvaa ja tm tilanne mriteltiin siell kommentti ketjun alussa. Mielestni tm on aika maanlheinen ja looginen tapa ajatella asiaa. Itselleni on hieman vaikea ymmrt minklaisten kiikareiden lpi asiaa pit katsoa ett kyseisest saa jonkinlaista rodunjalostusta. Kieltmtt olisi mielenkiintoista nhd kuinka vihamieliselt tm yhteiskunta nyttk kyseisten kiikareiden lpi.   Ei jumalauta. Anteeksi ett oletin kyhien olevan vastuullisia aikuisia ja harkitsevan lasten hankintaa siin tilanteessa kun rahaa ei ole.   Tunnen parikin siivoojaa ja ne tutkinnot on ihan tarkotuksella. Ne on meinaan aika myrkkyi ne niiden tkttimet. Ja jossei tied mit tktint saa kytt misskin tai ei tied mit tkttimi ei saa sekoittaa keskenn niin siin on niin siivooja kuin tavalliset ihmiset vaarassa.   Joo se taitaa olla ihan kaikkien tiedossa oleva fakta ett lapsiin yleens uppoo se euro tai pari. Mutta ei siin kyll mitenkn erityisen rikasta tarvi olla. Eik siit kyll edelleenkn voi johtaa jotain rodunjalostusta :D   En kyll keksi miten s tst syylistmist tai rodunjalostusta sait aikaseksi :D   Thank you.   I love the idea, but I am not really fun of execution. Like who is the actual user of this? It is sold as "plug it in" so i quess target audience is regular people? But who is going to update and maintain the box then? But if the target group is more advanced users why is this different than any other little box? I think this will bring just harm, because if this ends up in regular people homes and they dont understand how to maintain or update it, we will just end up with people condifental data leaking around.

Siin pmrll ei ole merkityst vaan niill onnistumisilla matkalla.   Itse mietin olisiko heill yliptns lapsia jossei suomessa olisi niin kattavaa sosiaaliturvaa.   Tm riippuu vhn rokotteesta. En ne mitn jrke olla ottamatta pitkn kytettyj ja tutkittuja rokotteita. Mutta sitten tuleekin joku uus "flunssa" johon ei olekkaan valmista rokotetta ja joka tehdn rokote mahdollisimman nopeasti ja jolla kaikki sitten pakkorokotetaan. Sitten tuleekin kaunista jlke. Yksi argumenteista oli mys se ett PAKKOROKOTUS ei ole yksi ja ainoa tapa ratkaista ongelmaa, on mys olemassa keppi ja porkkana.   Oon aina mieltny ett japanilaiset "mestarit" on jollakin tapaa omaksunut sen trkeimmin. Yritetn tulla parhaaksi siin mit tehdn ja tehdn sit mist nautitaan. Se kaikki muu tulee sitten perss. Tai lasimestarit tai oikeestaan kaiki ksityliset. Tosin voi olla ett se on vaan paulig mainoksen mielikuva.   Sitten yhtkki onkin rahaa ja elm ei ole sen yhtn onnellisempaa :f   Niin no miten mritelln "parempi".    Tosin eka pitisi saada se paha kierre poikki..    Joo voi menn kvelemn, mutta kuinka monta kertaa jaksat viikossa kyd vain kvelemss tuntikaupalla? Jossain lhiss?  No itse juoksen sen 1h x 3-4 viikkoon, viel en ole pariin vuoteen kyllstynyt.   Mihin jrjestihin? Tekemn mit? Kuka maksaa bussimatkat ja muut kulut?  Varmaan vhn riippuu miss asuu, kannattaa ottaa selv ni selvi. Ne bussimatkat on varmaan maksettava itte. Toisaalta polkupyrll psee jo aika pitklle.  Asenteen muutos auttaa aika pitklle.    Paitsi toisessa laitetaan kehoon jotain jolla saattaa olla pysyvi seurauksia.  	60

But you need this Polish proverb to realize that you need no accuser.   No wonder Tagore has won a Nobel in Literature.   What all of his have you read?   Heard of it quite a lot. But the length of the novel is making me hesitate. I'm yet to get into mainsteam large classics. That's why I started with short ones. Will surely read it but not in a while. That and also *East of Eden.*   Ever since I read Gitanjali by Tagore I understood the potential of writers who win Nobels in Literature. So, from then on every now and then I pick up something written by Nobel laureates. As of now I've read:  * Tagore (Gitanjali) * Herman Hesse (Siddhartha; Steppenwolf) * Ernst Hemingway (The Old Man and the Sea) * John Steinbeck (Of Mice and Men; The Pearl)  I realized that I prefer short novels of such people which gives a glimpse of the kind of work they do and the type of stories they tell.   From the above list, only Ernest Hemingway's book *The Old Man and the Sea* bored me badly (sorry, fans). Rest of them were somewhere between good to great reads.

Because of this, I think that an author's level of accomplishment often lies in their capacity for empathy. It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who has experienced something that you haven't, but being able to understand their experience (or try to at least) is an invaluable skill.  Spoken like a true genius that you are.    Something Wicked This Way Comes  I think I'm going to pick that one up soon.   I'm an aspiring writer. And I also want to develop my storytelling skills. By 'storytelling' I mean actually telling them, not just in text but in voice, by speaking it out, by narrating it.   I'm sure many of you guys are not only great writers of stories but also engaging tellers of those stories. I sincerely believe that there is a fine bit of difference between writing a story and telling it out for others. The biggest difference that I can argue about is that a written story is usually for people who read, and there are many, many people around the world who don't read (novels and such) but I'm sure no one is possibly averse to listening to a great story that's being told to them. (I also think this is a reason that makes movies differ from books, in a way.)  Please help me by giving some suggestions on:  * how to develop this skill  * what kind of story suits better to be told than to write (if) * what body language affects people in storytelling process * how to engage your audience better when you're telling them a story  and anything else that you think would be important for a good story teller.  I'm really counting on this as it's very important for what I'm trying to do.  Thank you so much, guys.

Thoreau is a remarkable milestone of a person in my life. His *Walden* has changed my life forever. No kidding.   Those lines were awesome...    DO THE SHIT BRO. DO THE SHIT THAT GETS YOU SOMEWHERE IN LIFE. EVERY GODDAMN MORNING WE WAKE UP AND GO AHEAD LIVING THE SAME LIFE IN THE SAME MISERABLE FUCKING WAY. WE GOT TO TAKE THAT SHIT AND BEND IT AND SHOVE SOMETHING UP ITS ASS SO THAT IT KNOWS WE'RE NOT ITS TITTIES.   WAKE THE FUCKING UP IN THE MORNING BRO AND GET THE SHIT RIGHT FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. PLAN THE DAY AHEAD AND FUCKING STICK WITH IT BRO. THAT WORKED FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN GREAT OF IT. HOPE IT HELPS YOU TOO. JUST TRY IT OUT.  STARTING AN ONLINE BUSINESS IS A PRETTY FUCKING COOL ENTREPRENEURSHIP VENTURE. LIVE UP TO IT. I HOPE YOU WILL FIND ALL THAT IS NEEDED FOR IT TO GET UP AND RUN.  KEEP DOING GREAT THINGS BRO. EVEN IF YOU FAIL TO do MANY DO JUST AS MUCH.   I'M 25 AND VERY AMBITIOUS AND ASPIRING. BUT THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE NOT IN FUCKING UNISON WITH ANYTHING. THAT'S THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING PROBLEM I'M FACING RIGHT NOW. I'M FIGHTING WITH MYSELF. I MUST.   I WASTE A HELL LOT OF FUCKING TIME BY GETTING LOST IN A BUZZ OF THOUGHTS IN MY MIND THAT KEEPS MY FROM WORKING TOWARDS MY LIFE'S CONCERNS. I REALIZED THAT IT IS MY FUCKING PROBLEM. THE BUZZ. I SHOULD CONTROL IT. FUCKING TIE IT DOWN BY ITS NECK AND HANG IT TO DEATH. SO THAT IT WON'T TROUBLE ME IN ACHIEVING MY CONCERNS.  I HAVE THE FOLLOWING CONCERNS FOR MY BEAUTIFUL LIFE. THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT MY HEART ALWAYS WANTS, AND THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT MY LIFE. I WANT TO DEDICATE THE NEXT FEW YEARS OF MY LIFE COMPLETELY TO THESE THINGS BY ABANDONING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS PETTY.  * **MBA ENTRANCE EXAM**- AIMING FOR SOME PREMIER INSTITUTES * **JOB** - TO DO WELL IN THE CURRENT ONE AND LEARN GOOD DEAL OF SKILLS * **READING BOOKS** - I NEED THIS BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER * **WRITING** - OH THIS IS AFTER ALL MY LIFE'S WHOLE POINT AND PURPOSE. I GOTTA WRITE. FICTION. NON-FICTION. POETRY. SHORT STORIES. I JUST WANT TO WANDER AND FLY AND DIVE IN THE WORLD OF WORDS.  WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS IN LIFE, BROTHERS, AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S STOPPING YOU IN THE JOURNEY? LET'S TALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THEM.   I'm from India.. Heard that they're not going to come out here in a long long while :(    It's just as good as the real thing.  That's very encouraging actually. Thanks, buddy.   My favourite bad book covers are those novels that have real photographs on them for covers. They just repel me.   Harry Potter series.   Sorry for coming out as harsh in my comment. I didn't mean that at all. The story ended so well in the sense of plot and writing. No doubt about that.    No. I didn't think like that.     I never saw Interstellar in a real theatre  Oh oh oh buddy! I can't tell you how sorry we all are to hear this.    This film needs IMAX.  *IMAX* needs this film.   After the movie was finished I just kept reciting the F-word many, many times for myself, out of pure inexplicable awe of the story and the places it took me as an aspiring writer.    we sold the house to a young couple who yanked out the pole and the sticks and left them by the road on garbage day.   This sentence should've been written in a new line. It seemed a bit too continuous with its previous line. Apart from that the story is hauntingly deep. Thanks for sharing.   :/   I'm stunned.    I didn't really enjoy the book  Oh... Sorry to hear that.   That exact cover was the reason I didn't buy the book and preferred to read it on my Kindle. I mean, who comes up with such a shitty cover replacing the awesome one??   I'm reading only 11th and 12th books of the year right now:  * The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman * David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell  I really got to pick up more books soon.   **Can somebody please suggest me some short story collections in the *quantum fiction* genre?**      I NEED TO HEAR THIS SHIT, BROTHER. THANK YOU.   They are.   I WOKE UP EARLY MORNING AT 5AM AND STUDIED FOR A LITTLE WHILE. ONLY FOR A FUCKING LITTLE WHILE. AND THEN AT 7AM I HAD TO TAKE AN ONLINE MOCKTEST FOR AN EXAM I'M PREPARING. THE TEST WAS OF NEARLY 3 HOURS. I REALLY FELT THAT I PERFORMED WELL IN ONE SECTION OF THE TEST. SO, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE RESULTS. BUT WHEN I SUBMITTED MY TEST, THE GODDAMN SERVER FAILED. IT FUCKING FAILED. AND LIKE THAT BEGAN MY ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING WEEKENDS IN THE RECENT TIMES.  AT 12PM I WENT TO THE COACHING CLASSES THAT I ENROLLED INTO FOR THE EXAM PREP. AND SLOWLY AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF CLASS I STARTED FEELING SLEEPY (BECAUSE I WASN'T HAVING ENOUGH SLEEP OVER THE WEEK DUE TO WORK AND STUFF LIKE THAT). AFTER 2PM A NEW CLASS HAS STARTED WHERE AN IMPORTANT MATH TOPIC WAS GOING ON 'PERMUTATIONS   COMBINATIONS.' AND I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN DUE TO THE GODDAMN DROWSINESS. BY TRYING TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SLEEP IN THE CLASS, I STARTED TO GET HEADACHE. AND LIKE THAT I LOST THE ENTIRE LECTURE AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.  FIRST THE TEST'S SERVER PROBLEM WHICH LOST ME MY PERFORMANCE CHECK. AND THEN BEING A SLEEPYFUCKINGHEAD PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH.  ALSO RECENTLY MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE GOING BAD. MOSTLY THIS EXAM THING. MAN, I'M SO NOT DOING JUSTICE TO IT.   A linguistics professor says during a lecture that, In English, a double negative forms a positive. But in some languages, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative. However, in no language in the world can a double positive form a negative. But then a voice from the back of the room piped up, Yeah, right.   *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho. This book has been a great life changer for me. The concepts that it dealt with, such as *following your dreams* and *reading omens,* have become a crucial part of my life ever since. So, I just want to pass on the word.      I don't know.. I just thought this is an interesting idea that I stumbled on the internet today.. so posted it here.       Which is why you need to wield it with great force.   Ok. So, becoming wise can be depressing.   And not on Reddit so much.. I mean, it keeps coming up here so much that if you're a skinny guy you wonder if you're useless in life.      Maybe the part of his heart that deals with the human loss doesn't let him be just because he saved her kid.    Looking at all these insightful posts that carry a perspective from my most loved book series in my life I strongly feel that I need to give them multiple rereads to understand them this well. Thanks :)   Good, one :D   What a deep insight!     this, almost perfectly.  I strongly believe that comma is not necessary there.   To me this shot seemed like a satire on the Mankind. We fight one another no matter what world we live in.   BATMAN    I wonder why he's not at Reddit anymore...  Dude. He died on Jan 11th, 2013. He hanged himself at last in the fight for internet freedom.   Oh sorry. There is a similar line from his *Carrie* as well. I just mistook it. Thanks for the clarification.  	122

Thank you!   http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium illust_id=50079925      another failed building project from Brazil. Abandoned in the 1970's. As though it was miraculously transported from a more urban area, the abandoned Viaduct Petrobras rises out of the lush South American jungle, a testament to mismanaged government spending.  Construction on the Rio-Santos Highway began in the 1960s and by 1976 the stretch of road was due to be linked to the existing highway. However, the plans were altered at the last minute so that the existing road was linked to a coastal route and the newly constructed, but never used viaduct was simply abandoned. Over 40 meters tall and 300 meters long, the elevated roadway features tunnels, retaining walls, and a massive concrete foundation all being slowly taken over by the surrounding greenery.   While the abandoned civic project seemed wasteful at the time, it is now a popular tourist attraction for travelers looking to do some rappelling and bungee jumping. The abandoned Viaduct Petrobras can be accessed from the Salesopolis Caragua neighborhood in Porto Novo via a thin country road, but the structure must be approached on foot or motorbike for the final stretch.

 Ok, let's discuss.  I made 80k/yr and my engineers made 65k/yr, and I have a GED.   I managed data centers for one of the 2 biggest banks in the US. I did it well, and my engineers did a good job as well. We worked for a company that is still making good profits and was back when I worked for them.   But a new VP of operations came in and decided that if he saved money he would look good. So he undid what had been done (moving from outsourcing to IBM to insourcing) and fired all the engineers in data centers - and replaced them with people making 12.50/hr.   These guys had mortgages, car payments, pension plans, etc - but hey, let's save a few bucks more. Oh, and now - about 6 years later - there is a new vp in place who is struggling with issues this has caused (replacing good techs with cheap labor).  Now...you may be asking yourself, what does this have to do with minimum wage and such?  Good question. Thing is, too many companies are run by people with short term ideals. Yes - you can train someone else to flip those burgers. But that takes time and resources away from people who have experience at those jobs.    Companies get a few people in power who want to please a short term financial goal and will ditch well trained people already working there because they have attitudes like yours. It's all a numbers game to them - cut some costs real quick, get a bonus, and screw the long term because I have a business degree and can get another job.  Long story short, these little people are the ones out there doing the day to day work that needs to be done that no one else will do, is it too much to ask that they get a piece of the benefits of that labor? Again - why the hell do we praise the people not doing the work when they get the rewards from the company's profits but vilify others when they want to get back what they have invested (their labor/time).    Nice try. There are all sorts of regulations that you can play this with. Like, you can't dump raw sewage into the river. OOOhhhh scary, now company has to pay to have it properly disposed of.  Naw, the right just likes to whine when the people who do the actual working get a little more. They wish we could pay wages like in Vietnam or have child slave labor. Sorry, society progresses over time away from such things.   And then there is this:   Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, with assets of $1.2 billion, notes that Chipotles same-store sales have been rising by more than 10% annually, **but about six percentage points of the growth comes from price hikes that could cost the chain customers.** Theyre opening 200 new units a year, says Lieberman. Its very hard to find that many good locations and sustain such a rapid expansion without cannibalizing existing units or accepting less-attractive locations.  So they have been raising prices all over the place, pumping money into new stores, and keeping the investors happy by kicking up prices - but yeah, no one complained about that did they?    Meh. Their cost of renting there is double elsewhere so their costs will be impacted more, so it's more of a one off scenario for them.  Their stock has been going down, competition is getting more funds. But here is the funny thing....  When companies like this, and others, raise their prices, or in case of groceries put less ounces in a box and charge the same, etc so that investors can get more money I don't hear the right complaining at all.  Funny how they only whine like babies when the people doing the actual work get more of the pie. Watch - this story will be all over the con blogosphere, and yet not a peep from them when other prices go up because the wealthy wanted more profit from people.  Funny how that works.         More like she got ran out of town on a rail. Good riddance.       Mr. Jones, however, said he was defending his wife, who was also working at the polls. Mr. Jones said the veteran got aggressive with his wife during an argument, and she called her husband for help.    This man threatened my wife. This man assaulted my wife. This man charged at my wife, Mr. Jones said.  If he was a cop the republicans would pat him on the back, set up a gofundme, and send him a pizza from a place in Indiana that won't serve gays.  ;)                                        So, basically, he is auditioning to be Trump's running mate.   So, indeed, it is the end times.   Writer misses the point. No shock there.   According to Trump though he didn't work hard enough, so let's move him a hundred miles away and make the dog do it again.         I think, perhaps, there is a reason they call them 'talks'.   People talk, negotiate, etc - and if they are anything like corporate meetings I have been in when it comes to IT spending I can see why they are dragging on and would probably shrug myself.                                          Nicely written. I am sure you are not alone in your situation.   Are we supposed to see a lot? Good lord, what were things like before TV?   As opposed to running based on ideals and principles to benefit the US. I guess she is saying that the repubs don't have those things so go for whitey only.   And people in hell want ice water.                                                      I am sure we could agree on a lot.  As far as the teach the man to fish meme - that works well until you realize that a few big fishing companies own the boats and have nets while all the person has is a single line and there are less and less fish to catch.  When the lake is controlled by the few then the many won't have enough fish to catch.  Add to that how conservatives claim on one hand that there aren't any jobs because obama sucks - then they turn around and claim that if they extend unemployment benefits it will make people lazy and they won't look for work it gets fun. Either there aren't enough jobs or there are.  Then they claim all the new jobs are just crappy low paying part time jobs. Well, people in those jobs could certainly use aid.     Oh I see the virtues. But then you don't need religion to have virtues.  The people over there not condemning this (and you won't hear about them in the news if some did) are complicit IMHO.  Which leads to - is the same true here?  You have mostly christians, who tend to be conservative, fighting against helping people here, wars, etc (as mentioned) - and instead of churches saying it's crap and wrong, they are joining in on the conservative messages.  As far as the attack in the church - think about it. It wasn't a cop who did it. When cops do things they get away with it. An individual is not a government employee - and he was arrested and charged, not given paid time off. So yeah. A difference.   223 link karma, -100 comment.   Yeah, not clicking on your troll crap - obviously, you are a conservative :)   Yeah, I can. I didn't, but I can.  When you have a group of people who deny climate change cause 'jeebus' i see them as loony.  When you have people who will fight against health care for people, food for the starving, and promote corporate greed as next to godliness I say they are loony and hurting many people.  These same christians were for a senseless war and the killing of over 100k people in said war.   Oh...I guess it is different when you kill people from afar, or don't see the person suffering in illness or hunger.  But when you use your religion to accomplish those things to please your god (out of fear he will kill us all, like with gay marriage/hurricanes/etc) you are as damned loony as these people.   Silence? How do you know they are - you really expect fox news to tell you if they aren't?    Good old religion - people hating others because their god tells them that the other people are sinners.  Now, where have I heard that before?   I like label free alcohol. We call it moonshine.   He knows the dog whistles. Blame immigrants. Blame blacks. Blame everyone who is different than your standard white person.   It's always been that way with conservatives. They blamed the irish immigrants and demonized them. The Jews as well. On and on it goes because they always need someone to scare people into voting for them so they can be saved.   They all want to be the Jesus and save people - except when it comes to health care and hunger, you know - the things people are actually needing.   No one seems to whine when investors want more return and prices go up, productivity up, wages down, quality down, etc.  But god forbid the people who do the actual work and aren't sitting on a beach sipping coronas wants a little more money for their labor.   I have watched as products in stores shrank and prices went up, as fast food prices have went up over the decades but wages didn't match. Seen companies outsource American jobs to save money but kept prices the same or higher.  Funny how the right only complains when the hard working people want more.                           Out of 360,000,000 people in the us.  Worried about crime are you?  According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 467,321 persons were victims of a crime committed with a firearm in 2011.     Sheriffs don't get to decide that, the courts do.     You mean like those sheriffs that said they would ignore new gun laws? Okey dokey.   Personally, I think it's funny.   On the other hand, when you are in a public business and have yourself out there on tv, magazines, etc you should probably have enough sense to not act in a manner that will get you attention you don't want.  I liked her show and think she seems like a nice enough lady.                  Probably not, they are probably running around killing and raping people right now.   So, he took her domestic batteries out of her vibrator?      Well, if he thinks he can keep immigrants from coming over here but he can't even keep illegal ones off his own projects....well I don't see him as being as competent as he believes himself to be :)      The Berkeley County Fire Department has confirmed that a pilot did eject from the F-16. A search is currently underway to locate the pilot.  This is a developing story. Additional details will be posted as they become available.  http://wtkr.com/2015/07/07/f-16-jet-cessna-plane-crash-near-charleston/                           Let's all get some free tickets from the link :)                        More: http://www.wusa9.com/story/news/local/maryland/2015/07/06/walter-reed-report-shot-fired/29766793/   shot was heard at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda and police are now investigating, according to Montgomery County Police.  11:15 a.m.: Montgomery County fire assisting police at Walter Reed, according to tweet.  11:09 a.m.: Addition MCP officers responding to help federal officers. Incident still not confirmed.                   The guy is a blathering idiot. Worse than hannity and beck combined, maybe he is their love child.                        Someone call Agent Cooper.            Republicans and science don't mix - they prefer religion and belief like their isis brethren.      People are getting older and retiring, the boomers. So there will be less people to work. AND maybe less are working because they can afford not to (pensions, 401k, etc - stocks have done well under Obama - can you say that for the last president?)   Could not connect to database 'allnewsp_sope1' (localhost). Your database server may be down or your database setup may be wrong.  LOL. I guess the boogeyman got em.            Conservatives hate good news - they wanted Obama to fail since day 1, they pray for America to fall so they can say "Told you so!".  Such patriots. Or more precise, sore losers.                  Guess we need ISSA to investigate the DOJ now :) Where is the MSM on covering our government?   ROFL - where does the right find these people?             Blackface....in one case you are talking about the race of a person, in another a choice in their belief system. Not the same thing.   I'm straight, and I don't support straight marriage.  Guess that is supposed to mean something.   LOL 'first ones to resort to violence' like the shooting at the church, the wars the right drags us into, etc?  Riiiight. Okey dokey.   Well, you know it had to be by folks who were more liberal, they spelled it right.         The core values work out like:  "I don't like something, so if others do it jeebus will kill them all to death and destroy the country. Now I will rush off to my bible to justify it with some verses."  And that, my friends, is what religion is about - forcing others to live like you do and justifying the only way you can, claiming the god you made up doesn't like it.   I am sure she handled more than one marriage that had a person in it who had been divorced - not to mention most of them all probably had premarital sex.   You mean 'conservatives' opposed it.  I don't care what party a person is. But face it, cons have a bad history of fighting progress.            I am loving the right wing being so butt hurt over this. Cry me some more tears to drink. You lost the battle forever in this country, from here on out get used to the change.   It's not about parties. Conservatives, through history, have been pro-slavery (as they are now and ship jobs to places that have slave labor), anti-gay, wanted to keep women down, and are pro-religion running countries and making laws.  It has nothing to do with party and never has. Currently the cons are mostly in the republican party, before that isn't relevant.   OMG HELL NO! It's the end of America. Now sheep will marry dogs. This will upset god...Jesus is on his way back right now on a unicorn and he is shooting a sword of flame out of this mouth to consume our sinful country. We need a civil war and to impeach the scotus...and  Oh wait. I had my conservative hat on and thought this was gay marriage. Meh, government overreached and got smacked down.  Carry on.                           The south is rebelling again. They got their confederate flags raised yet?      Yeah - conservatives have been hypersensitive to gays for a long time - wanted them banned from serving their country and being able to get married.   I have never seen so much whining and crying an outlandish gibberish as I have seen from any group in my life as I have oversensitive conservatives. "omg, gay marriage is our new 9/11, there will be a civil war, god will strike down the US, our time is over, etc".      All I can say is:  http://imgur.com/lHBDCFD      Last guy we had in office who was banging some chick on the side turned out pretty darn good. I say we vote for Gary.            No, but I think we might see a clinton/bush ticket and the merging of the two parties into one finally. I mean, who ya gonna vote for then?   They got off easy, can you imagine how much they would have lost if she had them marry her?   Because there are less bigots in politics here than websites like The Blaze, Free Republic, and Deadbart.  Conservatives are against gays serving their country, getting married, helping the sick, aiding the poor, and feeding the hungry - all because they believe their god will get all mad if they do and America will be punished.  Now, when it comes to spending money on wars, weapons, Israel they will gladly spend our money.   I am guessing many folks in politics lived through the bush years an remember the tax cuts for the rich, republicans pushing for spending more and more on wars (off the books to some extent), bailing out corporations and giving them a tax holiday, etc and so on and saw how that played out.  I was, up until 2003 one of those people who voted for republicans was pretty conservative. I will never, in my lifetime, vote for another republican. They have moved so far to the right it shocks me - they would run reagan out of town for being too liberal.  Don't ever trust a conservative - money comes first for them, then using their god for laws (except when it comes to shrimp eating, working on the sabbath, etc...then suddenly they laugh at their own bible and slam it shut. But lordy, when it comes to gays and the poor they will find em some verses to use).   You fail right off with the education thing. The system wasn't broken - folks told others it was broken so that they could 'solve' the issue (by using vouchers/charter schools to funnel money from public to private hands).  That is what I am talking about - fear, etc. Tell someone there is a problem and then offer them a solution. And people buy it all the time.   I am 49 years old. As long as I can remember people have said the economy was bad, education system was broken, Iran was getting a nuke, someone was going to kill us all, and jesus would be back any day now.  You would think after 49 years those problems would have been solved. But just wait, this election, you will hear all those problems still exist. And they always will because it gets people to vote for others to 'save' them from said problems.   That is your problem - you believe it is the word of god with no proof that there is even a god.  And hey, if you want religion to rule your life and you want to live by it - fine. Go for it. Just don't involve everyone else.  Guess what? Those isis folks believe they have the word of god as well and want people to follow it - why aren't you jumping up and obeying their god? Maybe for the same reason I am not wanting to obey your god and his rules. And I don't want folks of either faith making laws here based on their beliefs.   Did such questions come up after interracial marriage was allowed?  Anyway, christians would say that since it was in the bible it must have been god's will. Heck, there was a lot of incest, polygamy,  and lying in the bible by the jews in the OT - Adam and Eve had kids, and since they were the only two people ever made there had to be some weird stuff going on there.  Noah and his family? I mean, really, just read Genesis for starters - the right does what they do because of their bible, it's why they so protested gay marriage (but they are ok with dumb wars, letting the sick die, not feeding the hungry or helping those in need...yeah, I don't understand the right either).  So my view is a societal one. Do what you will just don't harm others. Consenting adults want to shack up, not my business.    Cons believe God is in control. Well..unless it involves defense. Then, suddenly, they don't trust their god at all. Ask em why they send so many tax dollars to Israel (but hate helping out Americans in need and tell em just to work harder).  Conservatives use god, day in and day out, in an effort to control others - they hate people being different than them and will do anything to try and force their ideal of 'normalcy' onto people (they are, indeed, like isis).   LOL. Yeah, right. Ok.  You should crack open a history book something and look at things. I am guessing you might find that some people couldn't get a divorce because they coded into law that men had the power. Same men who were sleeping around on their women.   Kings, barons, leaders, etc - all through history they "held marriage together" by force of law and keeping women down so they had no choice but to stay and obey.  It really pisses off the right that women got more rights and didn't have to be virtual slaves.   I get why the right is mad - they don't have the power to control lives of others like they desire.  Your religion is showing.   Because the right knows how to use fear to control their own.  It is always some new enemy they must defeat. They scare people into believing they are the solution. From muslims to gays to people on welfare, etc people on the right are always afraid (and part of that fear is tied to their 'god' and how he might kill us all).  Education: The peddled fear for years on it. Said it was failing, America was failing, and the best way to solve the problem was to turn things over to private companies (charter schools, etc).  Terrorism: We just need these wars, patriot act, etc and we can stop the terrorists from killing us all. So let's grow government, remove rights, and increase spending. But still....they say we are under more threat today than ever before. Sell fear, sell a solution.  Climate change: OOOPS since this isn't local to America and scientists all over the world are talking about it isn't real. But what is real is those evil scientists want to take your hard earned money. So they sell fear of science to people and propose a solution - ignore it and spend money on weapons instead.  Health Care: This will just cost us money and save lives of Americans. Money is good. We should tell people instead the only thing they have to fear is terrorism/isis/iran and take their money to stop them instead. Who cares if you die because you can't get needed care? Not conservative Christians....  People who vote for republicans do so because they cannot think for themselves and are always afraid that some god is gonna hurt us all. Republicans claim they can 'save us all' from our sins. Why do you think fundamentalist christians, racists, etc, vote for that party?   Wow, you sure are butt hurt over people gaining their freedoms.  Wanna know who has hurt marriage? Fundies with their 'wives need to submit' and all that BS around such sexism.   And speaking of monogamous - are you saying people having been diddling others for 6000 years (age of earth according to RW scientists)?  No, marriage was destroyed alright, by the right wing, long ago. You treat women like property, blacks and indians the same, and you cower behind a bible and claims that this is how your god wants it and if we don't conform he will kill us all.  You lost, you will always lose to progress. Get used to it.         I'd rather have live rattle snakes wrapped in barbed-wire shoved up my ass than watch another tron movie.         Where you gonna go where there isn't gay marriage or single payer?  Oh wait, you going to the middle east to hook up with your isis brethren? Okey dokey.            Yeah, well in 2000 the scotus gave cons what they wanted. And now they have taken away.  Suck it up, buttercups. Don't be 'sore losers' :)  I am going to enjoy the sweet sweet tears of the right for a long time.        	200
                                              Stunning photographs. Thanks for posting.   This is definitely an important issue. Benzene and other chemicals from these sites are known carcinogens. Undetected leaks occur too frequently, even at local gas stations. Having citizens team up with scientists to monitor local air and water quality makes it possible to sample a wider range of sites and detect problems.      	18
 There's lots.  I'd suggest anything small batch and expensive ($40 +).   Not just whiskey, but GOOD bourbon.    Stay out of the well and you'll do yourself a favor.    Stop drinking cheap booze.  I'm 36 and started drinking good bourbon two years ago, and never have hangovers.    It's clear that 90% of the people in this thread have never worked in a auto shop.    lol  Ok, so was the guy trolling or serious?    If they have a good pace of play that is enforced, I'd join!    After a quick YouTube search.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jBZOohlK4vU  Go on YouTube and watch and practice.   Like I said, that's all arms. He needs to swing with his shoulders.    Horrible angle. Should be straight on or straight behind, on an angle doesn't do much good.   But lucky for your friend, his first flaw is really easy to see...  He's swinging with only his arms.  There was no hip or even shoulder rotation. He needs to form a triangle between his arms and shoulders and maintain that through the swing.  The swing should be with shoulder and hips, the arms just go along for the ride.    Darn, I missed the story.    No, I'm just saying that if oversteer is only thing, then the RS is the answer.  The ST is already faster and has more room.    Then why do I meet so many out on the golf course?    If everyone had your attitude, the range would not be able to keep up with the damage and repair cycle, and the would have to shut down the grass tees to allow them time to repair.   Just hit in one straight line, not that hard.    The more I thought about it, the less I believe.    Your point?  You think the guys racing are racing stock? You can't talk about one car beating another on a autocross race track, then cry about budget. lol   So, I'll see you in autocross with the RS, in the rearview.   I almost down voted this comment.    The one I read and always remember...  Hogan was known for getting his 7 iron to stop on a dime.  Some guy asked him how he did that, to which Hogan replied with a question of his own. "Well, how far do you hit your 7?"  The man replied that he hit it about 130 yards, then Hogan said "Why in God's name would you want it to stop!?"   True, and the RS is the answer.  Which I'll be getting in 2017, and modifying my ST.   I have no hope for a girlfriend.   I'm married.    Current 2014 Ford Focus ST. Soon 2017 (I'm going to wait a year) Ford Focus RS. I'll be keeping the ST and upgrading it.    Brazil?    A turbo set up would of added a grand to the sticker price.  Hell, my ST was the same price as the base model.  If they wanted to make that car fast, they could of.  Instead they made it look fast and spent their money on marketing.  But hey, if you like having a small fasy looking car that isn't fast at all, then good for you!   Just don't cry when I blow your doors off.   And God help you when I start to put upgrades into it.    Proudly. What does your car have that mine doesn't?  Yeah...   Ok, still doesn't mean that the FRS/BRZ is under powered.  It COULD of been a great car, but then they put a small engine in it.  Why make something small, light, and RWD if you're not going to make it fast?  It's like putting tits on a bull.    Just because CEO's and investment bankers are working less hours, doesn't mean the rest of us are.   What an asshat.  I'm usually republican, but this current batch of idiots is worse than normal.  Paul is ok, but I'm actually for Bernie.   500 lbs heavier, but still is faster and handles better.    You drive a FR-S...  please don't be hating on the tank that is the crown vic.  Parts are easy to find and inexpensive, plus it's really easy to turn it into a go fast sleeper.    My FoST says that 200 IS under powered.  And the up coming RS just laughs.   Then I believe you.  I'm jealous, but I believe you.  You're probably a natural athlete and it sounds like you're putting in lots of practice time.   Keep up the good work.  Don't neglect your short game and putting.    Did you play baseball or another sport before picking up golf? Did you take lessons?   Yeah, I can see doing this on the 8th hole, but 18th?    Yeah, that's completely wrong.    Sorry, I've heard those are good little cars.    Reminds me of something Stephen King wrote in the beginning or end of one of the Dark Tower books...  Some old lady wrote him, telling him how she was dying of cancer and wanted to know how the books would end, and she swore she wouldn't tell anyone.  It broke his heart to know he couldn't tell her, because at the time, he had no idea how it would end.   George R.R. says he has an idea on how it will end, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's just saying that to keep us from completely losing our collective shit, or if it doesn't change on him in the process of writing it.   And the best part is, we'll get to see/know, if he finishes, because he's told D D how he thinks it will end.  So we get to compare, one day, maybe, hopefully...   Actually, that probably plays a bigger roll.  I don't build race cars, so I'm not 100% sure on any of my answers.  Just from my background, reading, and educated guess.   I'm thinking it's a combination of heat, turbo lag, and old school racing mentality.     Turbo lag.  When they are running less than 10 second 1/4 mile, turbo lag is a serious draw back.   If you have a "normal" car, the top end power of a turbo is a fair trade off for the half second of lag.   Good for you!   Without knowing how to drive stick? So, how much do you love it?    I wasn't sure if those came with auto options or not.    Thankfully Ford has our back, by making models that ONLY come in manual.  Focus ST and RS.   You truly are sad.    My feelings are fine. I just find it funny that you call me an asshole, then try to resort to unfounded personal attacks. So, feel free to try again, little man.    It is if they don't repot the tow.   I agree, that irons are important, so are wedges and putting, but I feel the driver is the most important.  If you can't put the ball safely in play, you're not going to score well.  I'm hitting my highest fairway percentage ever, and it's lowered my score a ton.   But, I think the key to everyone's game is: Spend time on the range!  LOTS OF TIME.    You can go back to your sad life now.    Did you happen to "find" those in someone's car? lol   No, I read it on an online magazine, before the Hellcat came out.    Some of the biggest track monsters that are our there are twin turbo charged mustangs.  All tuner guys know that the free HP you get from turbos is better than a supercharger.   Manufacturers use Superchargers because they require less piping, easier tuning/programing, and most "regular" people prefer the instant power of the Supercharger, and the dual scrolling turbos are still relatively new.    Plus, you call me an asshole, yet you're the one trying to make personal attacks.  Sounds like you need to take a good look in the mirror.    The head engineer of the Hellcat said they used the supercharger because he liked he sound.    No, a wife of six years who lives with me.  And I'm an asshole because that's how I was raised.  I don't need to change, you just need to accept that.  Please don't try to reflect your shitty life onto me.   	53
 I rode the bus to school from the time I was in kindergarten until I was 16 and started driving myself to school. The one exception to that was a month when I was nine years old in which my mother drove me instead. That month began on November 3rd, 2003. After November 3rd, the school didnt have a bus to drive us to school in. More importantly, they didnt have a driver.  Up until November 3rd, our school owned only one school bus  it was your traditional number-2-pencil-yellow bus that seated 36 screaming elementary school kids. The bus picked my older brother and me up every morning from our neighborhood bus stop, which was about a block away from our house. I could just barely see my house from where we would stand when we waited for the bus. Nobody got picked up at our bus stop except for my brother and I, but the bus came by anyway.   I dont remember riding on the school bus very well, but I remember my elementary school bus driver. His name was Thomas Blackford. Nobody called him that though. Everybody called him Mr. Tom. Mr. Tom was a big, fat man with a great grey beard and a bald head. He had one of those comfortable smiles that youd expect Santa Claus to have. He always played the radio stations that we liked and on the last day of school he gave everyone who rode the bus a bag of candy to take home. Everybody who rode the bus loved Mr. Tom.  I guess I should tell you now, Mr. Tom is dead. He died in 2003. He was murdered. I dont know exactly when he was killed, but it was sometime in early November. This is the story of November 3rd  The day I didnt get on the bus.  I was in second grade. Because the 3rd was a Monday, my brother and I hadnt ridden on the bus since the Friday before. It started like any Monday morning. That is, it started with my mom banging on the door to the bedroom that my brother and I shared and yelling If you dont get out of bed in the next five minutes, youre going to miss the bus! And theres no way Im driving you to school!It gets pretty cold here in November, so my brother, Bryan, and I had no intention of trying to walk to school. I slipped out from between my covers, groaning as I went. I got dressed and brushed my teeth. It was cold that day. I remember shivering as I slipped my blue down coat on over my shoulders. I always hated waiting for the school bus when it was cold out. Especially if it had been snowing.  Unfortunately for me, not only had it been snowing all morning, it was still snowing. There was about 3 inches of wet, slushy snow covering the street in front of my house, and more on the way. The second I opened the door so Bryan and I could leave, I was struck by a gust of frigid wind that blew wet, stinging snow into my eyes. I was already shaking by the time I stepped outside. Like I said, you could see the bus stop from my house, it was only about a block away. But in that weather, that block felt like it could have been a mile.   Before I could suggest to my brother that we shouldnt wait for the bus in such conditions, my mother yelled Close that door, youre letting the cold air in!   I didnt grow up in the kind of house where you argued with a comment like that. Bryan quickly shut the door behind him, pulled his hat down over his ears, and trudged past me, through the dirty snow that lined the sidewalk. I followed Bryan, who was grumbling quietly under his breath.   The school bus usually arrived sometime around 8:30. When Bryan and I got to the bus stop, it must have been a little before that, based on what I remember. Sometimes the bus got to our stop a minute or two late, so we werent surprised to have to wait a few extra minutes. Looking back now, everything would have been different if it wasnt snowing. My brother and I shook in the freezing snow and waited for the bus to pull around the corner at the intersection to the south of us.   At around 8:35, I could feel my toes growing numb - my teeth were audibly chattering. I wondered if we had already missed the bus. I didnt wear a watch then, I was too young, but Bryan had a cheap, old timex watch that mom had gotten him.   Bryan did we get here late?  No. The bus is just running a little late.   I frowned. Bryan was not a morning person.  Are you sure? I dont think Mr. Tom has been this late before.  Yes. Im sure. Be quiet.  My hands were beginning to lock up from the cold. I could feel the joints in my fingers turn stiff and tired. Despite my down coat, I was shaking all over my body.  Thats why I felt so relieved when I saw our school bus as it turned the corner at the bottom of our street, and slowed as it pulled towards us. I was finally going to be in the heated bus where my frozen body could thaw. I couldnt wait for Mr. Tom to open the door and greet us with a hardy Good Morning and a warm grin.  But when the door opened, there was no warm grin. There was no Mr. Tom. When the door to our bus opened, I didnt see the husky frame sitting behind the wheel of the bus that I expected. I saw a small, thin man sitting on the seat. He had the bus drivers uniform on him, but it didnt fit quite right. It looked too big, like he was completely engulfed by it. His hair was thinning and covered in grease and dirt, not shiny and smooth like Mr. Toms bare head.   The drivers smile filled his whole face. His teeth were yellowed and his gums brown and black. The most striking thing I remember about his face, however, was his eyes. They were huge, and his pupils were dilated so large that they almost completely covered the irises of his eyes.   Wheres Mr. Tom? I asked hesitantly, as I climbed onto the first step leading up to the bus.  He called in sick today. The man spoke softly and with a disconnected rhythm. It sounded like he was straining to produce the words. I looked past him, and saw that there were only a few children sitting in their seats on the bus. Only three or four. Usually the bus was almost full by the time it got to our stop.  Where is everybody, mister? I was getting nervous, but the bus was so warm that I was drawn towards it. Bryan, who was standing behind me on the sidewalk complained loudly.  Will you just get on? Its cold out here.  Well mister, where is everyone?  Not sure. Guess they must be sick. His smile slowly faded and his lips curled into a cartoonish frown. Better get on I think were a little late.  I was still nervous, but I was only nine - young enough not to question something that an adult had told me. I put my foot on the second step of the bus and started to move forward. The bus drivers dopey frown transformed into that sick smile almost instantly as I started to move forward. I was only a few feet from him when I felt a strong hand grab my shoulder from behind.   I was pulled back to the sidewalk by a tall woman in a bathrobe. Before I could protest or try to resist, I realized it was my mother. She had her arms wrapped around Bryan and I, and she was pulling us away from the bus.  Mom, whats wrong? Bryan asked, as she pulled him and me closer to her.  Who are you? She stammered at the driver.  The drivers face quickly melted back into a frown and his giant eyes narrowed. He didnt say anything to her.  What do you think youre doing? Who are you? My mom insisted. Her voice was shrill and full of confusion.  The driver didnt reply. Instead, the same horrible smile from before spread back over his face. He pulled the lever that closes the door, and stepped on the gas. The bus moved forward quickly, and made a sharp right turn at the end of our block. My brother, mother, and I stood in the snow, shivering, watching the bus slide slightly as it careened around the corner. Before we could ask any questions, my mother pulled my brother and I back to the house. She was frantic. Her skin looked pale, especially in her dark purple bathrobe. She looked nervous, almost scared. She just kept saying-  Hurry up. Get inside. She herded Bryan and I inside and sat us down at the dining room table. Stay here She warned.  Bryan and I were confused, and our mothers visible fear had made me scared as well. All sorts of thoughts ran through my head  maybe grandpa had another heart attack, or maybe Bryan and I had gotten in trouble for something. Why else would Mom walk all the way out to the bus stop and stop us from getting on the bus?  Bryan and I listened as she called the school district from the kitchen. I could just barely make out what she was saying.  The bus was definitely out there! No, it wasnt the usual driver! She listened intently to whoever was on the other side of the line. After a moment, she said Okay I will.  She hung up the phone and began to dial another number.   Whats going on? Bryan asked.  Not now Bryan. I need to talk to the police.  Our mom stayed on the line with the cops for almost 20 minutes. Bryan and I looked at each other in silence as our mom told the officer on the phone about the man we saw driving the bus.  I would learn several days later that while my mom was talking on the phone, the new bus driver picked up five more children. The bus, which had eight total children on it, all between the ages of seven and twelve, would abandon its normal route at 8:52, after its 12th scheduled stop, and drive onto local highway 78. The driver would accelerate to over 100 miles per hour, according to eyewitness reports. The bus would begin violently weaving in and out of its lane, coming close to hitting several different vehicles who would later call 911 to report its erratic behavior.   At approximately 9:17, despite the desperate pleas of the crying children aboard the bus, it would drive onto the only bridge in Gilliman County. It would cross about half of the bridge, according to the bridges caretaker, Kris Lopez. Mr. Lopez would later tell reporters that the bus made a violent right turn at the center of the bridge. He would explain that he could see the terrified face of a little girl screaming from one of the windows as the bus broke through a metal guard rail and fell into the icy river.   The official police report would state that all nine bodies were found. Dead. The bus had crashed through the ice at the top of the river and floated approximately a mile before it became stuck on a patch of rocks and a downed tree. All of the occupants of the bus had intense bruising, blood loss, and broken bones.  The police officer who went to the home of Thomas Blackford to ask him about the incident would find his door unlocked and the inside of his home completely trashed. When looking in his bedroom, they would find his corpse horribly mutilated. The Giliman County Coroner would tell reporters that Mr. Tom was most likely murdered by an intruder while he slept. The cops would find that his bus drivers uniform and keys to the bus had been stolen.  This is all the information Ive been able to find about the day that I almost got on that bus. Theres probably a lot more information out there about November 3rd, but I imagine a lot of it hasnt been released to the public. Ive read almost every newspaper story, eyewitness report, and police document that I could bring myself to. None of it has answered the question that I cant seem to stop asking myself.  Why wasnt I on that bus? I had been a step away from joining the kill count of the horrible little man who murdered Mr. Tom and those eight children. I was so close to dying in that crash. I still wake up in the middle of the night, imagining that little girls crying face as the fender struck the ice, going god knows how fast. I cant stop imagining the way the drivers disgusting smile as he drove the bus off that bridge. My survival haunts me. Why wasnt I on the bus?  The closest thing I have to an answer to that question was what my mother told when she got off the phone with the officer that morning, on November 3rd.  I asked her- Mom, whyd you stop us from getting on the bus?  Tears started filling her eyes as she told Bryan and me the truth.  The school called. Today is a Snow Day. The bus shouldnt have been running at all.  [J.L] (https://www.facebook.com/Jlaughlinhorror)  	1
 I went grocery shopping with my ex a few weeks ago and someone she knew greeted her and asked if I was her boyfriend. I quickly replied that we're just friends so she wouldn't feel bad about breaking up with me. Still feels bad man. Deep inside.   Awesome! Thanks for the reply. I haven't seen or heard pretty much any of the words from Rocket so I'm out of the loop. I appreciate it!   Am I the only one who was shocked to find that Aaron's belt has his name on it?  Great sketch regardless! Keep it up!   As a human that has lived with sight for at least 20 years of my life, I can confirm that the moon does in fact illuminate the world by reflecting the light of the sun. According to DayZ, the moon is a large white dot in the sky that hardly does anything else. I would understand the extreme darkness of the night during a new moon, but there would seriously be MUCH more light, even in the woods, when the moon is out.  Source: I've been outside where there are no other sources of lights (buildings, lamps, etc.) and I could see things.  Okay I know I'm joking a lot, but really. Any word on a *little* bit more light for us night walkers?   Haha right! Thanks!      That's the same thing they told Copernicus.    I'm sorry, I feel like I should add to the conversation now that I'm at a computer. Connor, if it's not too late, here are my suggestions, and the way my team does it:   - First of all, if you're going to use DayZ Database, be warned, it's not 100% correct. We use it, but we're careful. Here's what you do. Go to the wiki entry ([UAZ dayz wiki](http://www.dayzwiki.com/wiki/UAZ)) of a particular vehicle, let's say the UAZ. Scroll down and look to the right under the picture where it says rarity. This tells you how many to expect. If it doesn't give you an exact number, just make an assumption. If it says rare and their are 8 spawns on the map, assume 2 or 3 exist.   - Second, use your dayzdb map to search for the UAZ only. Hit each of the spawn points. This is slow, and not perfect, but it's a good way to check if vehicles are on the server. If you play a low pop server then they will most likely be there. There is a chance they will already be gone, but that's just something you'll have to deal with.  Another way to do it is to uncheck everything except vehicles on the dayzdb map and follow the south coast starting at kamenka, and check every spawn along the coast of Chernarus. A friend and I did that and we didn't find one until we hit Solnichniy. Finding vehicles is a slow process, just keep at it. If you think you are just absolutely not finding vehicles that should be there, it's the server. Find a new one.   Pretty reliable locations for me: Vyshnoye for the GAZ and the south, slightly west bicycle spawns. GAZ has always been there for me, and the bikes are usually there.    Comments like yours will be deleted because they don't answer the question or add to the topic. As I'm sure mine will too. This is what happened here.   Regardless, it happens every day, constantly. Many, perfectly fine questions are not allowed here because of the insanity of the rules. Just about anything can be asked of science to explain, no matter how ignorant the one asking may be.  And in regards to layman speculation, if someone posts, "I think," or "I'm speculating here," it should be perfectly fine! I mean, where do we get new science? People speculating! People ask questions without proof! This is the core of science! Obviously a comment should be deleted if it says "The Earth is definitely flat. Believe me, I'm trustworthy," DELETE IT. But come on, AskScience is killing the foundations of science, people hypothesizing.    I was on my phone, and it showed you replying to a reply to OP's comment. I  didn't think you were talking to OP here. This is my mistake, I apologize!   What the fuck? What is he supposed to ask? Everyone was removed because he didn't have proof that cats are compelled to return home? His proof is in his own fucking cat, jesus. He is asking for the scientific reason. He is asking the scientists of Reddit why *his* cats are compelled to return home, is that not enough proof? I don't understand these two subreddits anymore, AskScience and AskReddit. It's like, they're called ASK reddit, ASK science. Your rules make it nearly impossible to post anything on these subreddits anymore. I apologize for my lack of civility here, but this is outrageous. This is one of my favorite subreddits and, when there is a question I want answered, IT ISN'T ALLOWED TO BE ANSWERED. Oh well!   ~~He did, his post was connected to a comment op made~~  EDIT: Phone Reddit confusion, my mistake dumble!   It's also a perfectly fine way to respond to everyone if you don't want to individually reply   Is their a subreddit where these kind of posts belong? Not trying to start a fight, I'm genuinely interested. I enjoy these posts when I take the time to read them. If their is a sub I can subscribe to where they belong, that'd be great!   Hey, you give me hope. I'm dealing with some people who are close to me who are depressed, and seeing you have so much hope and prospects for the future cheers me up considerably. I hope everything goes great for you man! You deserve it!      This is amazing.

I experience that crippling fear every day at school. I'm a pretty good student, and usually do fine in my classes, but this semester my grades have tanked, all because I don't understand the material at all. I'm afraid because I'm going to lose my scholarships, not be able to afford college, and then my student loan debt will start asking to be paid. My fear drives me to do better so that I'm not put in an impossible situation. Take hold of it and use it to take charge of your life. I know when you're physiologically predetermined to have a hard life, it can be almost impossible to fight through it, but I bet you can make it through the fear if you fight back. I hope I don't sound like a cheesy PSA right now... Message me if you want to talk about anything!   I was cracking up at your list! Especially the "strangers are people too," and the "eventually seduction" bits. Maybe I'm easily amused, but you're a funny guy. Become a world famous comedian! Easier done than said.  My friend lost 170 pounds once. He told me the thing that helped the most was watching his diet closely, but he also took thermogenics.

Plywood is already coated in Polyurethane. The liquid resin sounds like a good plan, yet I'm worried about mixing it to purity. Follow instructions though, right? haha   I checked out your table. It looks very smooth! The problem is the cost. I put two coats of polyurethane on this table and that took a full bottle. I don't own any tools so I would have to rent the orbital sander. Thinking ahead this may prove cheaper than my other options though, so I'll keep it in mind!   How much does MDF cost? And what method would I use to attach it to the desk? Nails? I haven't worked with it before. I'll look into that as a possibility, thanks!   Don't think "I haven't got any strengths or skills," think more, "I have the drive to learn new strengths and skills."

It happened near to me. Spurs youth lit it and threw sideways into row s. The 47 year old guy arrested was in a suit and wore glasses. The smoke bomb fell at his feet. It was horrible, my 13 year old was gagging as was everybody in the vicinity and it stung the eyes. The guy in the suit picked it up and threw it out of the way much to the relief of all those around him. After that further down someone else would have done the same to get it clear of them. They would not have been able to see where they had thrown it. IMHO neither of them should be charged or banned. They had to clear it from where they were. It was very sad that it hit the linesman but it wasn't a hooligan issue it was a safety issue. We were searched going into the ground so I have no idea how those who took it in managed to get the smoke bomb in.   another:   The fella who threw it on the pitch (and unfortunately hit the linesman) is a mate of mine. It originated from the Spurs fans in the upper tier and landed in the lower tier. My mate tried to lob it underarm on to the side of the pitch because the people around him were struggling to see / breathe. Unfortunately he mis-judged it a bit and hit the lino, just an unfortunate accident. Plod and the Villa stewards had a word with him and to be fair the stewards were really good, they realised what he was trying to do and told the old bill not to nick him. He was back in for the 2nd half so presumably the two they have nicked are the ones from the upper tier who threw it in the first place    [Boris disposing the evidence of his latest sex scandal](http://i.imgur.com/Ey8b3XK.jpg)         Exactly!

You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.      [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/OJRMQNr.jpg) a higher res version if anyone is interested.   What a lovely cat :-)   Describe your perfect phone?   This is either going to be the best thing to happen to Android ever or the worst thing to happen to Android ever?!   *double facepalm*   To be fair, the photographer is credited in the title!   Just saw a Facebook group: "Hi, I'm a bra. I touch your girlfriend's boobs every day... Jealous yet? ;D"  Joke's on them, my girlfriend doesn't need a bra yet.   Looks like the perfect place to live during a Zombie Apocalypse    [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK9C9VtCypE) video goes into more detail   Nice boobs, terrible film!   I thought people just aimed into a cardboard box these days?   It looks like it's been sliced in half!   This is what /r/WTF is all about!   *You + I   Rivaldo used to be my favourite player, i had the up most respect for the guy! Pretty mush idolised him and formed my own game around his style! Then [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4oUnpcmws)is happened and my opinion of him changed dramatically!   Sooooo....Madonna, enough with the crotch already!   Universal Serial Butt  	71

 Yeah we turned it on and the light and fan came on but we didn't think to check if it heated up. Hopefully we can sort something out. Cheers    Nah the house is established. House is maybe 25 years old but the ovan wouldnt be more than 7 years old.   Well when we turned the ovan on at our final inspection the light and fan came on so we figured it was fine.   same thing happened tonight, lights and fan came on but very little heat.   Anyway thanks for the reply ill check through the contract and maybe see a solicitor.    Ok, so around three weeks ago my partner and i moved into our first home that we have brought.   Tonight i used the ovan for the first time  and to my suprise it doesnt work. Turns on but does not heat hup. Took 3 hours to heat up frozen pasties. not cook, just warm them slightly.   Anyway, does this land back on the original vendor or realestate agent? Or am i boned?   Cheers in advance.  Edit: Thanks heaps guys. Ill try my luck with the agent tomorrow otherwise ill cop it. Hopefully its not something major! It's been so long without a roast dinner :(    Sounds good! I noticed a few flavours did not do too well in beta, will the juices available at launch be the revised recipes?    Good luck with the launch!    Drink up! And thanks :)    That sounds like such a horrible way to go. I'm sorry    Nah he croaked. He was well into his 80's.   I remember my dad coming into my room laughing before he told me. Seemed fitting for the old bloke, he was a bit of a joker in his day so i'm sure he would have wanted us to see the funny side of it.    My great grandfather died while he was taking a shit on the side of a road. I imagine this must be how he must have looked. I never really thought about it.    I'm in the middle of watching 248. When its on ill keep an eye out for it...   My 7 week old son is kickin arse and my partner and i have brought our first home!   Life is good!    "I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our houses!"     :0 this is a thing? awesome   Thanks!   Yeah there was a few good ones in B W, i liked this one because he had his hand in the beard haha   	13
 I hope he died later.   Thom Yorke. Radiohead.   Get Rich *AND* Die Tryin'   totally   If a kid hands you a toy phone, you answer it.   Thoooooom   What do you mean, they were "eradicated"?   Not sure where you'll find them, but: Alien (more sci-fi), The Thing (my favorite), In the Mouth of Madness, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A lot of Twilight Zone episodes. And apparently Roger Corman made a bunch of good movies in the 60's that I've never seen  	8
 What's up?   Double comment! :O   Double comment! :O   My mouse sometimes scrolls further than I want it to, does that mean I should be punished for not spending extra money on a good mouse?   Do you have them set by class? Do you put all your super cool Aussies and unusuals on page one? Maybe you have all of your stranges on one page and hats on another?      I'm about to try to organize my [badly sorted] (http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198049118645) backpack and want to look at some backpacks to get an idea of some ways I could set up mine.      Thanks in advance I guess :]   I think I've used 2,147,483,647 on this sub at least 10 times.   Nah just make the hitboxes bigger and then people won't be staring at them for 5 seconds.   *Please note: I am only including deaths that are specific, so no "Killed by Scout" or anything of that nature.*      **Times backstabbed**: 14   **Times headshotted**:17   **Times airshotted**:2   **Times Reserve Shootered**:1   **Times Flarepunched**:4   **Times killed by environmental hazards (Sawblades, Train, etc)**:2   **Times airblasted into hazards**:2   **Times killed trying to pick up somebody else's gun**:2,147,483,647      So yeah if Valve could increase the size of the guns when trying to pick them up that would be sweet.   The good outweighs the bad though.   Let's imagine a new weapon that can do 300 damage as it's only upside, but it has much less ammo, much less speed, and some other downside.   The upside on that is a hugely overpowered damage buff with some downsides that don't even matter.      Now we can apply this to the loch.   Upsides of faster speed, more distance, and more damage to Engineer crap.   The downside of less ammo in the clip doesn't matter because the extra distance means you can sit back and fire from a distance and reload.   The extra speed makes it much easier to hit *direct* shots on one person making the lower radius not matter at all.   The lack of rollers doesn't matter much anyway, those are mostly for taking out nests which you can do easier with the extra damage to buildings.      Loch isn't overpowered anymore but that doesn't mean it's bad.   Sounds like you got Puff n Stung, son.   The cases weren't dropping so to fix this another contract was given out to let people who already did the contracts for this week could get a case.      Sorry if this has already been said but I don't want to read through 198 comments to check.   Wow that's the first time I've ever had somebody say that to me, you're such a funny guy!   Yesterday, you said tomorrow, SO JUST DO IT!         Maybe it belongs in a Muslim's butthole or something?    Here's how to solve this problem.   All rockets are trying to kill you.   What a nice way for you to try and get your comment karma back. Your attempts aren't futile at all.   ITT: People have them and won't tell me how I can get one.    "How many buddies would I need to kill to get enough cash to buy one?"?      2,147,483,647 people who all have at least $23 dollars on them.   How did you check these out? I tried to go into itemtest and I didn't get an option to add unusual effects on the guns.   Found like a timed drop or what? Can you give me a link to your backpack.tf so I can check it out?      [That is a community reference, right?] (http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120618043638/fantendo/images/1/1a/Troy_and_abed_handshake.gif)   counter b0ss: global ramen   Twice a week I think.   Only Medics that didn't get an bersaw yet used that thing before, Valve's just letting Medics get better.   Use a skill based weapon?   If you throw a killstreak kit or some other modification like a name/desc tag then the stock becomes tradeable.   Lookadaflickadawris!   It's worse than the can of Pepsi that's been sitting on my desk for a week. I used to want to drink it but now it's something I want to throw out.   I don't mind paying for the challenges or anything, but from what I read they're weekly for three months. I'm not math master but that's probably like 10ish drops.   The item skins are pretty. Paying to do the challenges is lame.      VALVE YOU RUINED THE POCKET PISTOL I HATE YOU WHY WOULD YOU RUIN MY FAVOURITE THING!?      Boxtrot taunt is radical.   Didn't see that last one until you pointed it out, thank you.   "Better sarcastic than stupid" would be another way to put it I guess.   Buddy you did a double post, you should probably delete the one I didn't reply to so people can see your original post.   Yeah yeah whatever who cares, I don't see any hats in here...   Here's how I deal with hackers.      Complement the hacker like "Yo dude those Amby shots are on point, do you play CS:GO or something?" or "Duuuude you are amazing" because then they're like "Oh thanks man really means alot to me." and then I say to the team chat "Lmao that dude is hacking."      Then I say "Hey I got a pizza on the way so I'm gonna leave now, peace out." and leave the hacker to do his thing.      You really can't do anything about them but leave and they mostly want to get reactions of rage, so being cool, calm and collected about it and leaving for a different reason than "AY FUCK THIS GAME I HATE YOU LMAOBOXING FUCKS" doesn't give them the satisfaction of a reaction.      Or since LMAOBox is VAC undetected I use my own VAC...cinator. Throw that bad boy onto my homeboy Pringle and let him go to town with some 1337 AWP skills.   The first one is probably Baby Face's Blaster, the second one is probably me torrenting anime while I play because nobody can hit you when you do that, permacrit doesn't work on any hacks that I'm aware on, those Snipers are just shooting you when your head pokes out.      This isn't CSGO you can't shoot through walls.   Why do so many people use the Pain Train? It's garbage on Soldier.          Oh yeah that's the problem, it's to combat phishing bots.   If you're like 13 or something just ask your parents if you can put $5 on your Steam account, if you're old enough to have your own credit card then throw down some cash and you can start looking cool as hell with your new hats.   *cuntface*   Peachie is nerd doesn't even let us listen to Kill la Kill x Sonic the Hedgehog remixes.   If your account is like less than a week old or something adding everyone will give you this error IIRC. But I doubt that's the problem.   [Yes] (http://i.imgur.com/IHO4iBd.png) [they] (http://i.imgur.com/W1AC5Bp.png) [are] (http://i.imgur.com/qpUXB5x.png) [also] (http://i.imgur.com/FDx8fHR.png) [click] (http://i.imgur.com/HLiJKKW.png) [every] (http://i.imgur.com/83HHVHw.png) [word.] (http://i.imgur.com/G8vT5nu.png)   Specail needs, maybe.   Post to rule34, there's nobody there going "Nah, I only like girls with curves." or something stupid like that, I have 1,690 from /r/randnsfw and posting whatever I needed to post.   I have the BFB, BONK Atomic Punch and the ability to play Scout. Now I only need friends and I can do this myself!   cool   I went to the market yesterday and picked this pile of shit up. [blah] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440_2_3884772027)   If you want karma go to a porn subreddit.   I'd say you should give it away here or /r/randomactsoftf2, I wouldn't recommend scrap.tf because I've heard that there are bots that auto enter all the raffles and then give all the winnings to their mains.      You could also do contests for some of the items, maybe the person who can get a strange to the highest level first or something gets to choose an item.      Also you probably shouldn't give that Max's head away for free unless you're feeling very nice, that's like an $80 item.   [Got it] (http://i.imgur.com/dygxJxj.png)      If this counts then Biggie Smalls - [Hypnotize] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk4ftn4PArg) has a version that I [hate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEiPXAYE-U src_vid=wk4ftn4PArg annotation_id=pfc%3AglEiPXAYE-U feature=iv) so much.   omg never knew   I don't know why these two weapons get such a bad wrap together, +2 hp per second is laughable when you consider that he's losing a Shotgun, +15 hp on hit is a fair balance for losing a shot. How is basically +17 per hit broken?      It's maybe +21 hp back between the time it takes for you to hit him again, it's really not that big a deal.   Big Black Cock Soldier?   Google tf2mate.      It will help greatly for this and help even more if you want your crosshair to change on different weapons.   Also if you use a laptop or low end pc then you can lower your graphics to trash tier for higher fps.   I was wondering why this had 0 points, but then I saw that wall of beautiful items.      You're banned from my kitchen you aussie-hatin' twat.   i-it's not like I came here to s-shitpost or anything.   *Anta baka!*   There aren't really many mods that can make your game look better, I guess you could use tf2mate and choose the movie settings for the best visuals.      Mods are mostly disabled in Valve servers though.   It's much easier to hit with this thing but people don't use it because splash is too good. I just like to play my game like I'm always in a frag video so I need to hit airshots all the time.   The masturbating or filthy franking?   Filthy Frank is like masturbating, you can do it alone and feel great, but I don't want to watch you do it.   If it were in the Soldier's voice there's a high chance it would be trash tier, there's a parody of that Mulan song somewhere and it is basically my name.   Dude this shit is fire, that's goin' right into the folder!   You have the 33rd highest post in this sub ever. [What the hell!?] (http://i.imgur.com/LGlflC4.png)   Yeah that nerd, he's got like the 40th highest post in the sub.   At least my name can be *relevamt* at times, unlike you Mr. FGHIK.   One dude got Reddit Gold and like 5,000 upvotes for      I love seeing spies disguised as me.   My taste in hats is so fucking rad   I tend to use these parts as a default if I want random things.      Players Hit   Kills While Ubercharged (Replaced with Headshots if it's a Sniper)   Gib Kills on guns that gib, Critical Kills on weapons that I feel will crit often like a melee or something, or if it's something else I'll go for Damage Dealt.      I don't know if Loose Cannon can gib or not so whatever I guess.   I'm pretty sure Double Donks counts as 1/3 strange parts so if it does go for Players Hit and Damage Dealt.   This is even worse than a Lime Scout, honestly I've had some some good times with Lime Scouts but this guy looks like a total wannabe that's also a buzzkill.   I've watched LMAOBox streams and been to the fourms a few times, apparently every copy of LMAOBox is different and that's why it's harder to find. Even if Gabe Newell himself decided to buy 30 copies of LMAOBox to shove into the VACBox they'd just be banning the versions they got.      Imagine going to the beach and knowing that every grain of sand is unique (They aren't really but pretendsies) and that it's your duty to make sure that all the sand vanishes for your master plan of crashing a plane.      You create a machine that can take something, scan a large area for copies of that thing and it will *poof* remove all of them.   So you use it on a grain of sand and direct it at the beach. But nothing happens because they're all different apart from maybe 7 grains that are very similar.      Obama is an attractive man.   It doesn't but they are cool to make people more likely to stay for that one extra weapon.      New Meta, stand next to Gunboat jump and shoot man. He is now using a useless secondary.   The cream rises to the top!   I heard that unusual mtm taunts can lag servers due to how many particles they make. I've only seen it with Holy Grail but I have been told all of them do it, does yours lag servers sometimes?   Only male or female? Oppressive shitlord I identify as a Pyromaniac.      "Soccersteve22" and someone with some generic name but like "Genericname SMemes 1ref"    They are overpowered though! The moment a plat level Scout/Sniper/Pyro picks it up they are using a broken weapon that the UGC Iron teams can't do anything about! ^^slash ^^s   If you are good at the game you can counter the thing that is easy to do for other players. Gunslinger is a simple "Press 4, then 1, then mouse 1. Get kills." type of thing. If you need to be good to beat something a bad player can do it's unbalanced.      [Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EitZRLt2G3w) is a video which talks about balancing for skill, something Valve can't do very well.      Valve seriously hand the game over to this subreddit we'll take care of it like it's a newborn child.   *If it dings; it rings.*   ITT: Scottish people put too much salt into their booze.   Well you are right, it is very hard to use splash damage with the Loch in the same way the stock Rocket Launcher does.      What the hell is that meant to mean?   I think he meant to link this one because the dude's name is Tim. Maybe he's trying to sell me an Aces High Texas Slim's Dome Shine?   I just realised something, Rock was scammed which means his TC became dirty, right? So how many clean ones remain at this point, like 2?   Listen, I don't know what you think an airshot is but it isn't this.   [Childish Gambino - Sober] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx96Twg-Aew)   [pinkomega - dumplings] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mWh2NdVmDE)   [Sonic Adventure 2 Greatest Hits Revisited] (https://sonicisreal.bandcamp.com/releases)      So pretty much whatever has a beat I can headshot to.   I'm not even kidding I tend to only shoot on like a drum hit or something of that nature, it's like all of my gameplay is a Sniper frag video.   You... I like you.   I'm liking how this looks, strangely enjoyable.   What.   What did you do?   Why would you ruin a perfectly good math bo- I'm just fucking around math is worse than the FF fanbase.   This is basically a LMAOBox Heavy.   I do this too sometimes, just so that if a comment gets deleted I can show other people.   I only go good Sniper when somebody else is doing something annoying these days. I used to be that pubstomping AWP holding Australian Longshoot Man but now I just play him to counter Mini spam, RS Pyros and other Snipers.      I also have binds for these three.   And that's for piloting that stupid robot!   Even a gibusvision wm1 would work better than you!   Play a *real* class, Snipey!      Boy does that last one boil some potatoes.   I'ma let you finish, but Beyonc just put on the Danger Shield.   Any other Sniper wearing this fashionable piece of trash basically forces you to wear one yourself.   It wasn't me, I don't say ''EZ'', I say "And that's for piloting that stupid robot!"   Become satisfactory, obtain ChuckleContainer.

 I used to smoke almost daily, but only a joint a day. I stopped for a little for finals week and school and began experiencing insomnia. I'm not sure if this was because I stopped smoking or I was stressed because of finals. Either way: everything in moderation.    Just to confirm:  I Googled it and the same thing showed up for me. Thanks for that.  Cheers.   I get mad at that, too. I also get upset when people hold the bong/joint/blunt/bowl/etc and don't pass it. It bothers me when I'm passed a roll and there's 6 inches of ash hanging off and then it lands on me or in my car. It's annoying smoking with paranoid people because then I get paranoid. I also dislike when people don't know they're limits and then you're forced to babysit someone who is having a panic attack.    I dream quite a bit actually. I have chronic night terrors, too.   I'm looking for a smaller stash box that I can just throw in my bag and go. Any suggestions?    Necessity.  I'm a college student and worked as an RA for a year (shh don't tell my supervisor) and had little money left over after purchasing my little supply. I also didn't want to be going around with a piece and obviously couldn't smoke indoors. I opted to going with the blunt/joint route. It's cheap, simple, and when you finish your sesh you don't have any incriminating paraphernalia on your person. Albeit rolling is much harder than packing a bowl, but I learned to roll well in only a little while. I suggest starting out with blunts or wraps as I feel they are easier to roll than papers - but it's certainly a personal preference.   Definitely a good stoner-skill to know!   Can you fit blunts in there? If so, I'm buying it right now   Whatever you like. I've been listening to a lot of Trevor Hall recently. Really chill and relaxing.   Music is the best thing while high. Just enjoy yourself!    I'm sorry I wish I could tell you haha. I have two coils and I think it's 26ga. I'm new to this and I still have a lot to learn!   The first couple times I smoked nothing happened; it became frustrating for me. I wanted to know what being high was like. I then started to get high and understood what it was like.   Just be careful when you first start out. You may see that people smoke more than you. Don't worry, that's okay; it isn't a contest. Being *too* high is a thing and it isn't good if you're first starting out. I also suggest doing it somewhere safe around good company (or alone. There's nothing wrong with smoking alone). Just enjoy yourself. Welcome to the community and happy toking!    	11
 of course they will adopt the boat turn back policy it's what voters want and the last time they changed the policy there was a rise in arrivals by boats with many deaths at sea.  abbot was able to capitalise on that so changing it now wouldn't be a good idea.  i know many people on this sub would want to see a greens style approach to it but that's not what the greater majority of voters want and it could lose votes for whatever party tries to do it.   dr google wins again   great video awesome view  honest question though that i've been thinking about recently how long till drones are banned or heavily regulated? wanted to buy one but i have a feeling there will be new laws with them soon enough     No one will give anything back to the aboriginals    NFl is so exciting with the 3 seconds play between 5 minutes of commercials and play reviews i fall asleep within 2 minutes of trying to watch that crap sport   no i like soccer and the world cups are 4 years apart not going to miss it because of a flag   that's still way to much  your healthcare system is a joke     people need to stop crying so much about it so many people are becoming such precious little babies about everything  are they supposed to be goody two shoes so you all stop whinging? who even cares what they do off (or even on) the court  if they are making the sport money they will not get rid of them     why is your healthcare so shit that someone without insuance would have to pay that much money?   that has to be fake how the fuck could your healthcare system be that shit  so glad i don't live in america  i broke my neck a few years ago and even needed a helicopter to the hospital a week stay with all the xrays cat scans physiotherapy etc.. cost me $0 and i didn't even have insurance    game would suck if everyone was scared of you.. who would you kill besides monsters if everyone was like hail Geralt please don't hurt me  it's the same in Skyrim you fus ro dah someone off a mountain and his bandit buddies still try to attack you   Williams isn't winning anything as a customer team he's knows that and will take a offer from Ferrari  Mercedes won't dominate forever, Ferrari looks the best next option unless red bull gets there shit together and gets a car that doesn't explode almost every race. Mclaren won't be a challenger for at least 3-4 years and it seems they have a driver line up for the next few years     i think haas will be better than manor   many people (Americans mostly) are prudes  blood guts and murder is fine but if they see just one tit they lose their minds   this is why the game needs a new game+ mode where you keep everything but the difficulty is much higher   yer that was a massive disappointment as well i had a sword i got from a chest or monster that did like 50 more damage or something i just ended up selling it   not the point it should of given something decent and unique not witch hunter armor given how witch hunters are evil and hated by players  i know you can now craft witcher armor but it would of been nice to get a decent reward armor instead of that crap especially if your not crafting witcher armor   they should of made the reward witcher gear   i thought that at first but after about 10 mintues i got the hang of it and it was a solid game from then on  i was close to uninstalling it because i thought the combat was stupid lucky i didn't   just wish it was better that archgriffin was a bastard to fight  don't know why they thought witch hunter armor would be a good reward   haven't got it on Xbox but it's one of the best games i've played in years  better than skyrim IMO   the stats and what not are great but i wasn't expecting it be witch hunter armor  witch hunters are cunts and i don't want to look like a cunt  don't know why they thought that would be a good reward   your military spends trillions and you want to complain about a small space mission costing under a billion that will make new discoveries  not to mention countless other shit in US and worldwide that has millions/billions wasted on it  stop your complaining it's a small amount of money   it's more than just photos it's a scientific mission that will learn new things  there is plenty of things on this world that could be considered a waste of millions of dollars but no one complains about it but when it's a space mission you all come out of the woodwork   roughly 2 billion on baldness treatment worldwide a year (probably more)  people just see space as useless so it's a waste of money in their eyes   why does everyone always say this?  throwing some food at the worlds hungry people solves nothing they still have no food when that runs out in day or two     what good would that do?   you feed them for a day or two but they still don't have access to food after that   always annoys me when people say things like it's a waste of money etc etc when it comes to things in space  billions goes into hair loss treatment but not for malaria and other life threatening things but you don't see people complain about that     i'd say the same about the hipsters who wear skinny jeans   there is a lot of young people that don't vote greens don't think just because people are young they instantly vote greens  green voters typically are in inner city areas outside of that i don't think the support is as high      if the streak is 5 years long and it like this with Mercedes on the podium every race F1 will lose a lot of people who are already saying the sport is predictable and boring    a new much harder game mode that let you keep your end game stuff would be great for those that want a bigger challenge     the reason is ISIS is a threat that's happening now which people can clearly see slaughtering people and encouraging terrorist attacks worldwide it's also manged to brainwash people worldwide to join them (including schoolkids)  Climate change is a threat but one that is slow and changes happen over decades  humans tend to react to immediate danger not one that takes years   Its not essential but it helps so you know the characters from the last two games and some of The back story about the wars and what not  Though if the 3rd game is the first one you played you might not like the first two (game play not the story)  movement is completely different like no jumping or climbing unless there is a press whatever to jump or climb,  plus combat is different as well   Never a good idea playing a game series backwards there is huge differences between the 3 games  Before I bought witcher 3 I made sure to play the other 2 first far better idea   the greens are too far on the other side of the spectrum that people won't vote for them because of it  howard and abbott both got a lot of votes over border control policies which shows the majority doesn't want relaxed polices like the greens would bring   those countries have been fucked for years the wars are nothing on what the Taliban and Saddam did the difference was people couldn't just leave as they can now   don't like it and i don't even bother playing it  i liked the dice game from the previous two games better it was quick and a nice way to make some extra coin   most people always carry ID on them it's not rare these days to not leave home without it as we carry them in wallets   this is what i mean it's a good mechanic but the game relies on it way too heavily that it's overused  most quests end up using it at some point some way more than others     i was fine with it at first but it got annoying towards the end  every single time i heard Geralt say gotta take a look around i knew i would be spending the next few minutes following a red trail towards something   have more witnesses to beast attacks which can narrow the search field so you don't have to follow blood trails and scents every single time or something like that  i don't mind witcher sense i just feel they really overdid it    i think they really overdid the witcher sense in this game almost every quest has you following a blood trail or scent  i know it's part of a witcher to have these abilities but they really overdid it just like Assassins creed used to overdo the trailing/eavesdrop missions  it's a great game (probably the best i've played in years) but the witcher sense part of it got tiresome considering how much they use it   if you're just getting one gram in Sydney it's typically $20 but i don't buy one gram at a time because it's a waste of money    if much easier now to get drugs but it's pretty easy to get booze as well if they have a older sibling or someone at their school is 18  i used to get booze of people i worked with at maccas when i was 16 as many of the people i worked with were 18+   if you mean kids worried that parents will see a video of them drunk or something they typically have accounts the parents doesn't know about or they are on a different website as well that parents don't use like twitter or something   it's actually much cheaper to get drunk  chateau d'cardboard $12-$20, cheap vodka (or bourbon etc)- $22-$30, bottle of cheap wine - $10-$20, 6 pack beer $16  weed is $20 a gram $50 for 3 and typically around $80-$110 a quarter  a kid can get a cask of goon and a 6 pack of beer cheaper than they can get 2 grams of weed     most people are going to be in support of this  we all have ID on us all the time anyway if you drive, most people keep ID in their wallet (even if they don't drive) and always have it on them so whats the big problem that a cyclist needs to have it   because people just don't like them and think they are a bunch of loonies  people will always vote labor/liberals reguardless of the shit they do because they don't want the greens in power  this is highly unlikely to ever change   it will never happen   that's a great way to get fucked with by the cops especially if it's a shitty area  why are you running etc etc.. you'll get searched and have your time wasted or probably shot if you're in America   ugly as hell   10 year old's know fuck all about the world and the current situation with the government  it's pretty clear the parents pushed him to do it   this!  voters don't want boat people which is one of the main reasons Howard and Abbott were able to win  no matter how loud the support refugee people are the vast majority don't want them and will vote for the party that tries to stop it  	54
 Some kid did that in my kindergarten class. Then the weird kid that no one liked went over and sucked the pee out of the carpet. The reaction on the teachers face was priceless now that I think about it.   The only thing that bothers me is that the tit she uses is no longer in line with the other from all the stretching.   His headline is from a Lady Gaga song   You are beautiful   I didn't know the Westboro Baptist Church did anything other than signs.   I went to hang out outside of school with that guy and when I brought it up, things got awkward. Never talked to each other again.    I went to hang out outside of school with that guy and when I brought it up, things got awkward. Never talked to each other again.    I was drinking vodka primarily then got talked into a game where I drank wine and beer. I then went back to vodka. My morning did not go well.  Edit: I drank a shit ton of vodka.   Well I'm not at school for the time being. I live in a town of 10,000 where gay is still a major taboo. All of the gay guys my age have been smarter and moved away.  I hope it looks up for the both of us soon. Thank you for listening.   It's hard to get out of here. I was going to college last year, moved three hours away from home. I was really close to my boyfriend at the time with him only being less than an hour away at a different school.  I went to reapply for this past semester of school and had some issues with my loan and financial aid which forced me to stay this semester. I'm trying to become a forensic entomologist and my small junior college doesn't really handle people in that field which is why I'm trying to get into a major university (Shooting for A M). I found out last week that it's probably not going to happen because the advisors at my school got me into the wrong classes and I have to stay under a minimum 45 cumulative hours in order to get into the department at A M. They literally told me to forget my degree. So that has only brought me down even more.  My mother also broke her arm this past July so it was fortunate I stayed home. I got to take care of her because my father has a job five hours away so he's only home on the weekends. I'm stuck right now.   Hello everyone. I am 20 years old, overweight, and gay. Every time I meet someone and things go well, they end up rejecting me or saying they shouldn't be dating right now. I've only had one actual boyfriend. My friends all know that I'm gay, as well as my siblings. My parents are the people I'm working on. Please don't tell me they already know, that's not what I want to hear since I hear it so often from my friends and dates. For everyone else, it's not their business unless I want it to be. I don't care if someone else tells them, but I won't if I don't want to. To get to the point, I go on dates, talk to various guys, meet wonderful men, but can't get someone to take me as theirs. This is what makes me so down and low. Especially right now. I had been seeing this guy for 2 months, and things were so good. I couldn't believe I was able to find someone like him. Then things took a bad turn when I thought to bring up the conversation asking where this was going. Needless to say, I've been rejected. To make matters worse, my bisexual ex, who I have become very good friends with, has met a girl he really likes. He talked about moving to where she was, marrying her in the next few years. I would be fine if I wasn't so jealous that he's doing better than me. I've been to my lowest before, where I twice tried to kill myself. I'm scared about going back down. Every time I meet a great guy, it turns out to be nothing. I'm so tired of being tossed about. I'm so sad and alone, I don't know what to do. All I ever wanted was a companion to be with. I was alone growing up gay in a small rural Texas town, and as an adult, I'm lonelier than ever. I can't stop crying. I just want my pain to stop.   I too am from Fredericksburg.   My nana is very content at the nursing she's at. As she's said to me many times, "I got nothing to squawk at." She turned 91 recently and has been in the worst stages of Alzheimer's for the past couple of years. When we went to go see her for her birthday, she called my mother (her daughter) by name instantly. I could've cried. She hasn't known my mothers name in two years. Sometimes it all comes back to her, other days she's lost but happy. All she does is smile. I always bring her chocolates because they're her favorite. She doesn't know who I am but she knows she trusts me and when I look into her eyes it almost as if she's remembering me, but then the moment passes and she goes back to the chocolates. I don't think about her forgetting who we are. I think about if she's happy or not. I always ask, and the answer is always "Definitely."   I've all about given up even bothering to date anymore due to my fear of rejection. I personally haven't ever handled it well, and lately being as lonely as I am, I honestly am not sure what would happen if I got rejected, no matter how politely they said it. Yeah someday I could get a yes, but I'm too afraid. For you rejection might be easy. It's not for me. Not by a long shot. Being gay, I could just wait for someone to ask me, but I've had no offers.   Aw congratulations to the both of you! To many more wonderful years together!   :) nice   I just want to let you know, this gif made me laugh for so long, it started to hurt. It seriously made my fucking day.   My sister, her boyfriend, and I are all struggling with quitting. It's just so satisfying. I started smoking socially while I was drinking, and it evolved to a point where I used to smoke a pack a day. I'm 20!  I usually smoke now when I'm bored. I was so close to quitting last year. It would take a week to two weeks for me to finish a pack. Plus, being a broke college kid and not being able to afford them helped. I'm looking into some alternatives. If anyone had any suggestions, things that have worked for you, I'd be glad to hear some.    The hairy chest, the smile, and that butt. Mmmmm   The top is Kris Jamieson and the bottom is Rick McCoy.    Contribute more often please :)   Imgur link if you can't see it:  http://imgur.com/GGFQBHh      You weren't there either. Who are you to say otherwise? Regardless of the actual situation, whether the photo portrays abuse or humor, the statement made in the photo is sick. Don't talk about jumping to negative conclusions when you're jumping to one wirh me.   Practice what you preach and keep your opinions to yourself then.   Yeah because that totally makes what he's doing ok...   If he wants to draw a ballerina slipper that looks like a penis, let him.   I have this shit in my pantry.   Indian Pootie Tang   Mango worms   I had to use my hand once...   I believe the scientific term is "Repost"   I would've said yes.   Yup   I could care less about downvotes. Just thought I'd share.   About two months ago I met up with this guy, hit it off, went back to his place to get it on. We started making out and we were having a good time. Then I noticed there wasn't much to grab a hold of while I was exploring. I figured it was just because of the way his dick might've been positioned. I went to go down and unzipped, pulled it out and just looked. This guy had a 2 1/2 to 3 inch dick. I am not joking at all. I wish I was because this guy was really cute. I'm a bottom and so there was no way I thought it would do the job. I didn't say anything, I just blew him, let him finish, pretended to look at my phone and was all "oh shit, I have to go! There's an emergency with a friend of mine!" Didn't see him again.   Horrified because you're jealous she's got a bigger dick   Looks like its already been done. Good job everybody.   Mother of god   There's plenty of chaser where I am. Problem is, they're almost all AT LEAST 20 years older than me. Finding someone around my age who isn't into a "daddy" type is hard.    I think OP went full retard.   His brother plays Thor, not him.   *whipped  ftfy   How 'bout a dollar to make you holler.   She'll touch your pickle for a nickel.   Having a hard time finding a video but these two are Jonah (the red-head) and Chris from Dirty Boy Video. I'd have to pay to see the video but there are some more photos.

My first time was fantastic because the other guy was very experienced so he knew what he was doing. Anybody after that hasn't been that good and last time I had sex it hurt a lot.   Big boobs   Repost   *sabbath   I live in Texas, which is home to two "Body Farms", belonging to Texas State University at San Marcos, and Sam Houston State University in Huntsville. I'm actually studying to become a forensic entomologist! I am so jealous (as bad as that sounds) that Stephen Fry got to visit one! In Texas, the "Body Farms" are very hard to get in to. They are very strict as to who is allowed in. I heard from a professor of mine that you even need express WRITTEN permission from the Dean, various department heads, etc. My professor has been trying to get into one of them for years with no success, even though she has her PhD in entomology. They had a problem a few years back with students taking cameras, phone, anything that takes photos, into the farm. The bodies are all donated and so the privacy and dignity of the decedent have to be protected, so when that was violated, they tightened the reigns. I'll hopefully be able to get in good words with a few people and maybe one day get in myself! Fingers crossed. If I can't get in, I can always wait until after I die. I plan on donating my body for research to one of these farms. Still, these farms are not just cool for a person like me, they help investigators and researchers out a lot.    Some girls are like that. They will do anything to avoid messing their nails up.   Awesome people   The males are harmless, yes. Females have the short pincers that can hurt.   If you want to know, this one in particular is a male. They have large pincers that obviously extend way past their heads. They are practically useless. The females on the other hand have short efficient ones that can hurt you, even draw blood.   I've never had a boyfriend who lived closer than 2 hours from me.   Think of it this way:  Either have parts of a dead rat spread about  Or  Have a live rat somewhere in/near/underneath your house   All I see is trash   Here goes!  S1: Can't say because I haven't seen it! (Yes I know about the rewatch parties. I'm too busy to ever watch)  S2: MARRY-Jujubee, FUCK-Raven, KILL-Tyra Sanchez.  S3: MARRY-Manila, FUCK-Raja, KILL-Mimi Imfurst  S4: MARRY-Willam, FUCK-Willam, KILL-PhiPhi O'Hara  S5: MARRY-Jinkx Monsoon, FUCK-Detox, KILL-Serena ChaCha   She's younger than Mother Dust   We're still beating this horse?   Transvestite, transgender. Transvestite is just so people can directly understand. The meaning of transgender can be pretty confusing for non-LBGT people. It was confusing for meand I'm gay. I use either interchangeably.   Looks like a transvesite. Clue is the hands and the face. Silicon injections and the hands are pretty darn manly. Someone's tucking a secret or is post-op.   Depends on what version/translation you read. In some it does say children and that they were killed.   Lana Del Rey is actually pretty pleasing make out music.   2 Kings 2:23-24   Do you really have to pee in a girls mouth to make babies?   There are worms several feet long on other continents.   No   I'm so jealous. Fuck.   If you find a wound on the animal, there's a good chance that flies laid eggs in the wound. The main concern is that they can carry disease into the animal, making it sicker. In some cases the maggots actually help, eating the dead tissues (which is what they do) and clean up the wound. Doctors do it to humans, but they of course have access to sterile maggots. Still have the animal checked for infections and such. Another theory is that it's bot fly larvae which burrow into the skin and incubate until they are ready to fall out and turn into adults. If you find small holes in the skin at central points (spaced/grouped fairly close together) could be bot flies. Have your animal checked just in case though. Hope this helped.   YESSSSS. Jill Harkness, reporting for duty.   Congrats! So jealous! I'd be focusing on Jinkx the whole time. I have a huge crush on her. I watched all the "Drag Becomes Him" videos and it made me love her even more. So happy you get to see them!   I never thought it a funny read because I loved Sharon, and at that point in the season, I could care less what the fuck PhiPhi thought about anything. That video just pisses me off. She's so unprofessional. I never liked her, and I never will no matter how much convincing someone did. She's just ugly on the inside.   I LIVE!    If you can carry your groceries in a small basket like that, they can out them into a bag and you can carry it like that. There's really no need to take it outside to your car.   I've seen this in places far from the ghetto. It's just so the baskets don't leave the store. The store I worked for didn't allow the carried baskets to be taken outside.   I agree. It's pretty darn cute.   I couldn't either. A week ago.  	79
 You run across those guys every once in a while. Really, 5 tours just means you've been thru it a couple times, no real difference if you're trying to do good and interested in learning. Playing with triple digits is where the fun really starts, you can goof around and try stuff, and your ass is constantly covered.   But I've only been kicked once, and it was because I was taking a bathroom break real quick, but it was a team of tryhards, so whatever. I have kicked a few, but never because of the number of tours.   But I have found, that until you start to get an idea of the roles, playing the meta classes will help keep you from getting kicked. The meta is definitely over-rated, it's more about roles than classes, but folks generally are much more patient with meta classes.    couple a quick engie tips: The robots will instantly destroy anything they touch except the sentry, so place teles and dispensers wisely.  Put exits in spots that are still useful if you're pushed back a bit.   First thing you should upgrade on the first wave is dispenser range. Max it out right from the start. Personally, I also max out canteen instant upgrades as well right from the start, and keep them maxed.  Dispenser building and movement is the priority over your sentry, get it up first, your team mates will love you all the more (unless you need to quickly block.)  Rescue ranger is awesome, but make sure you try to keep over 130 metal so you can move stuff quick.  Never waste credits on the mini sentry, unless you have a ton o cash and kinda make it known that you have the extra cash so folks don't bitch, cause they will.  The jag only adds 15% speed, not 30%, so it's not a necessity.  2 way teles are only really needed on a few maps, so don't sacrifice the cash for them unless they're needed.  Try to block with the sentry, it's a huge asset in dealing with giant scouts, remember the robot needs to see a bit of room between it and the corner or object you're blocking with, otherwise it will go around, give it just enough room for you to walk through, they are bigger than you.  Upgrade wrench speed before firing speed, because when you bang on your sentry it adds ammo before it repairs, so if you're firing too fast you'll be doing far less repairing, and it's much harder to keep it up when it's getting bombed on. I never upgrade firing speed completely, only 1 or 2 in that upgrade.  As you get a bit of experience, and learn where people are attacking from, don't be afraid to move your dispenser around a bit. It's mostly ignored unless they don't have another target, but don't put it in the middle of everyone since it'll get splash damage. Make sure you put 1 point in metal capacity at the start as well, you can build both a sentry and a dispenser at the same time when you're full up.  edits: oh yeah, while it's the scout's (or whoever is being the money collector) main duty to get the cash, it's actually everyone's job. Grab the cash around you as you can, but make sure to get it if you're away from others. And remember, you can still get your credits back before the first wave starts. The minus signs are still there, so if you need to change things and have the time, you can.   The odds that you're being kicked only because you're a zero tour is really low. It's rare that I see a zero tour kicked just because. Almost every kick I see is from someone not listening, or don't have settings on to hear mics, or something along those lines. When I see a low tour with funky upgrades, I'll mention it. If they get defensive instead of asking about it, it's a pretty good indicator that someone will throw up a vote at some point. Sure, there are asshats who will kick just because, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as you seem to think.     Want to not get kicked? Listen to high tours, or if no advice is forthcoming, ask. Read through forums, do a bit of research first. People trade for or pay a dollar for every mission, so it kind of pisses people off when someone won't do the legwork to be a contributor. Look through your friends' profiles and check out their badges. See who has some experience, ask for invites when you see them playing.    Research, listen, ask, and you should very rarely get kicked. And don't take offence when a 4 tour wants to kick you. He knows about as much as you, and you'd probably have a better time on another team anyway.    I think you're completely wrong. Seems to me, if someone didn't have a phone or computer or tv these days, they'd be completely lost as to how to cure boredom. Before all that, we actually got off our asses and found things to do. So there was always something to do.   Other than magazines and newspapers?   Be kind and rewind.   Or newspapers?   The TV guide was hardly a pain. It was pretty damn easy to see what was on. Easier than to find out what's on then than it is now, methinks.   I think that every time I've seen 2 right turn lanes at a light, there has always been a sign saying "right on red only from right lane" or something to that effect.   The law everywhere in the US I've lived is that it's illegal to pass on the right. Same vein of thinking, but I've never read of a law that says you MUST drive on the right.    Slightly related, I'm somewhere on [this page.](http://www.27bslash6.com/guarantee.html)   I rarely watch anime, but I watched this one. Gotta agree with you. SAO1 was pretty good, and SAO2 just got kinda wonky.   ugh. I really don't like having to click to read every line of some story.   I just got my service disconnected. I had plenty of credit, but they were taking even more out of my account. I didn't see it coming, didn't go over my usage. I finally got tired of working for the savings with support and told the rep to just refund my credit and drop the service. Basically I paid $25 bucks for a crappy  phone, and I don't know how much in cheap, experimental  service with lag and variable quality.     I tried something new, it didn't work out, but at least everything was fairly cheap all around and I didn't lose that much money.    My advice to others who ask about it is to just skip it and go with Straight Talk or the like. In the end it's just not worth the hassle.    End of Rant   It's uncapped, but gets throttled after a gb. Says it in the sign up ads for their "unlimited" plan.    "You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here."  These words are forever burned into my brain.   Not a text adventure, really. But yeah, those Sierra games were great.   I didn't think it was that bad. I got through it reasonably quick. Leather Goddess of Phobos and Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative games, however, stuck me good.    The worst thing about HHGTTG was that if you didn't feed a sandwich to the dog at the very beginning, you could play almost to the end before you found out that you couldn't win.  Microscopic space fleets. Getcha every time.   Well, that and the one place where you had to "look" three times before you found something (don't remember what). Still, it kept me amused/frustrated for months.  On the Heart of Gold. You had to try 3 times to enter a room as the game tried to talk you out of it, then look 3 times as it tried to tell you nothing interesting is there. "Ok, the *are* a few interesting things in the room. You see ..."   Nice try, Snoven.   [FTFY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c_5v3YFxnA t=1m18s)   Also, a lot of app devs are on xda, maybe dev has the apk in a thread there.    2-4 months? Most of us don't have baby hair. 2-4 weeks maybe, if I don't shave every day.   I see a different wall with the same title every month or two. But, between the new and casual readers, it usually does well. That's reddit.     Sparks from Sealab 2021 truly doesn't give a fuck.   BOOGER!    So were you trying to be as clever as Douglas Adams with the title and just failed? You copied him with the only response you have on here, so I kinda assumed that's what you were shooting for.   ...I hate /r/askreddit anymore. I mean, WTF kind of question is this?    Here's one for you: In 48 hours your arms are going to be amputated and you will be blind. What will you fill your fridge with while you still can?    Sound fucking stupid? Yeah, that's what you're doing to us all. For the love of god, just stop.   How can one know a game is perfect if one has never played it? So perfect that it was pre-ordered 3 times? It's one of those posts that make me think "moron."    It is so flawless that you pre-ordered it? That's some GOP logic there.    The best way would be to move stuff onto your computer so you have space, make your nandroid, move the nandroid to your computer and put your stuff back on your phone. However, you should probably keep your most recent nandroid on your phone. It you don't have space for it, you're just overcrowding your phone.   "Restart the button!" "It was a glitch!" "It should count down from natural causes, not technical issues!"    Yes, it died from a glitch instead of a natural lack of pressers. But that's life. We don't get do-overs. We don't get to chose to restart from scratch. Once something is dead, mourn it, but don't disrespect it by reviving it (and I'm betting they will find another excuse later on.) It is tainted now, it isn't what it was, it's life from here on out will be accompanied by a *footnote.    It died. Sorry it didn't die some grand death, with thousands of people trying to remember their alt account's password to scramble to keep it going. Sometimes things just leave us unexpectedly and suddenly, without preamble or fanfare.    Deal with it, or keep cheating the button of the awesomeness it deserved. I was grey when it died, and had planned on trying for red. But as far as I'm concerned, I let myself get stuck with gray, so gray I shall stay. It's only right. I'd rather not be asked "did you click before the crash or after?" anytime flairs come up in the future.   Yes, the button should be done. I personally want to see it keep going, but if it stops, for whatever reason, it stops. Restarting the button means that from this moment on, anything done with it will always have an asterisk after it. It stopped. People didn't want to see it stopped, so they restarted it. Now we know they will do this any time they wish, whenever they can find a decent argument for it. It's tainted now. Press if you wish, but as far as I'm concerned it's all a big cheat now.    I played with a heavy who had aimbot (it wasn't that I suspected it, it's that he was constantly turning until something was shootable, then he would blast them. It was the most obvious thing in the world, I have no idea why people do these things.) Anyway, I went ahead and stuck around to see what would happen for drops. I thought no one would get anything. Not only didn't tf2 not notice the aimbotting, but he got an aussie minigun.   A dirty, dirty cheater flair.   I'd like the source for that.   Snap.   When I click anywhere on a comic, it goes to the next page. Somewhat common feature. But GG also has a bookmark feature. While I was catching up on it, I could simply click "Save Bookmark" and click "Load Bookmark" anytime I wished to continue at a later time. Is there some reason this isn't everywhere? It actually was an incentive to keep reading when I had started from the beginning. Reading a webcomic from a previous point shouldn't be a chore.   Congrats, this is the only post today to make me laugh. :)   DEATH-RACE!   This is, it would seem, apparently true.   Source?   Pretty sure that same racer wasn't out to kill his opponent.   Really? Got a source for that? Cause the only thing I can find about why it's legal to hunt elephants is that by hunting them legally it lets hunters kill for ivory legally so they have more money to keep from poaching. In essence, it simply changes their title.   Well, there was a difference. He wasn't out killing, and it was a freak accident. He did risk his life and knew he was always taking some sort of risk, but at least he was always trying to help. Irwin was a good guy, you're going to get downvoted for not loving the good guy. The rediquette is a pipe dream.   Screw him. It's also legal for cops to kill unarmed folks, the rich to take from the poor, and for courts to take your property when you break no laws. There is a distinct difference between legal and right.

I guess I can see how it could look neat, but it just looks obvious to me.    Be careful, bricked phones are a real thing, and the likelihood of it happening varies greatly from device to device. Do more than read forums where you find your phone. Create accounts and ask questions, pick brains, see what kind of issues others have come across. XDA is usually my first stop for Android questions.    I love digital, but the albums I had seemed like they were meant to be heard on vinyl. I listen to the remastered stuff, and it's just as good, but it's just not the same.    Urinal.    I loved Kanye when he first blew up, hated him when he was shown to be a selfish asshat, then loved him when... oh wait, I still hate him.    You can buy or trade killstreak kits, find them in crates, or get them as drops in Two Cities MVM tours. TF2 wiki can tell you all.    Says the filthy presser.   It's not unlimited data, they throttle at 1 gb.   ....huh. You're right on the money.   Is there any type of pattern, or is it just too random to make any educated guesses?   C'mon, let it run down. Not only will this bring up new flair, but it creates a larger area of time that will cause fewer people to hit it at once, thus less unintentional purples.    I still have mine too, in the collectors edition box I bought at circuit city, along with the manual and dvds, but I lost the figure that was included. Statesman, it was. This was issue 3 I think, right before the big nerf. As soon as I heard about them talking about it on the radio I grabbed it on the way home after work. One of the greatest buys of my life.   	62
 Because it gets Democrat votes.   He finally tells the truth!  We all know those American-made Tow missiles wreaking havoc on Syrian armor didn't grow on trees.      Don't take my word for it.  "The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of islam"  -Barack Hussein Obama, born Barry Soetoro   Who cares what this physicist says? I'm a redditor with a Bachelor's in Urban Studies and i just *know* global warming is real.      TIL: Redditors want to ban ideas.   ISIS fighters out on bail in the US.  Fundamental transformation complete!      But....Bush!!!!   Do you know Obama has been President for **seven** years?   More cultural enrichment brought to you by the Democratic National Committee!      Too bad peasant.  Someone in government knows better than you do.  Now go read a book in the dark under your carcinogenic CFL lightbulb.   Looks like you can't tolerate a viewpoint contrary to your own very well.  Now that's bitter.   Socialism is causing the collapse of Greece right before our eyes.  However, for some reason, the Social Justice Warriors of Reddit think it will work in the US.           Because having a centralized government in charge of educating children has never gone wrong.   110k African immigrants being placed in Minnesota.  Fundamental transformation of America?  Yes we can!      This is what happens when you have a rogue President who orders ICE and the BP to stop enforcing laws.     But...but..all the super smart redditors say that immigrants who begin their stint in America by evading federal authorities will actually be peaceful, productive citizens.  Trump was right.   The progressive left will side with radical Islam over Christians.  You can take that to the bank.  It's already happening in Europe       Another example of progressive totalitarianism, where even children are subjects of the omnipotent state.      The free market used to work well in health care before the federal govt got involved with Medicare/Medicaid and prices went through the roof.  Doctors used to make house calls. That is what the free market is capable of.      Every news story happened in the past.   This article was about people attacking Christians for simple holding signs.  Feel free to comment on the article.  I'll leave you with a quote re: leftist violence.  "I want you to argue with them and get in their faces" -Barack Obama  Not exactly the words of tolerance.   If a black/gay/liberal person was beaten at a Tea Party rally on video the state run media would be orgasming 24/7.  Everyone is equal, but some are more equal.   Beaten for holding a sign.   The left is very tolerant, given you have the same opinion as them.      Anti-NRA liberals who say they own guns are like people who say they have a black friend to prove they aren't racist.  It's a desperate and pathetic plea for legitimacy.   No one here even knows what Trump said that was so offensive.  Everything he said is true.     What exactly did Trump say that was so offensive?      9 out of 10 redditors have no clue what Trump said.  What he said was fact.  Trump is on target and that's why the left is so hyperdefensive about this.    Correct. Liberals are usually humanists. Nothing is more important to them than their own whims. Kids and fetuses be damned.   He did not pull out of Afghanistan.  75% of military casualties and 92% of Marine casualties in Afghanistan have occurred under Obama.              You know it's actually okay to not believe in something but recognize people's Constitutional right to it?  American progressives seem to have a problem separating what they personally believe and what they believe should be a federal mandate    This is the Stalinism of the American left and it is only getting worse.      They are millions of separate lone wolves with a coincidental religious preference!   Once you start banning symbols bad things happen.      The cowardly left has never stood up against Islam and never will.  They are too busy embracing subservient collectivism and denouncing disparate ideas.  Sort of like Islam....   Liberals do best in herds.  They are intimidated by the rugged individualism needed to survive in man country.      Excerpt from the Dissenting view:  "But this Courts two decisions on the Act will surely be remembered through the years. The somersaults of statutory interpretation they have performed (penalty means tax, further [Medicaid] payments to the State means only incremental Medicaid payments to the State, established by the State means not established by the State) will be cited by litigants endlessly, to the confusion of honest jurisprudence. And the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites."   And the "Give me my free stuff" crowd goes wild.  The Republic has 30 years left, max.   Massive child rape by Muslim immigrants coming soon to a neighborhood near you!      Because the Confederacy was like the worst thing that happened ever in history bro.    Are there any symbols out there that don't offend anyone at all?          Celebrate Diversity!!   The Gadsden flag, a symbol of the American revolution, is already reviled by the left.  It will be next, because it's somehow "racist".  All non-conformist thought will be deemed racist, banned and the purveyor will be "re-educated".   Just like bakers are free to regulate the content of the cakes they create?   The left is showing their true fascist tendencies on this one.  Don't ignore it, turn it off, change the channel, try to debate it.  If you disagree with it, ban it!      What flag do we ban to stop the EPIDEMIC of black on white violence in the US?   "The future does not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam."  -Barack Hussein Obama      Sanders is an outright communist and will not win a general election.  By all means, support him in the Democrat primary!  -Your local conservative   Not with that attitude.   In other shocking news, the Reddit mob doesn't criticize the actions of someone doing a job they have no clue about.   You are so naive.   "Bring the human population down"  Why don't we start with you?   College kids: They are unaware they are unaware.   Has Jon Stewart figured out the difference between the national deficit and the national debt yet?  Don't get your politics from an entertainer.   Unbeknownst to the naive college students of Reddit:  Sanders can not win a general election.  Hillary can not win a general election.  Keep pushing for them, please!   We do have a real problem.    We prescribe  SSRIs to children.   The FCC, making up Constitutional powers as they go.          I'm really enjoying the Obamabots doing logic somersaults trying to change the meaning of this sentence.  **"At some point we have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."**   You do know the 'Americas' is referring to North and South America?   The left loves to discriminate against people based on their income.   There have been plenty of spree killers in other countries.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers):  Africa/Middle East 85  Americas 107  Asia 127  Europe 94  Oceania/Maritime Southeast Asia 124  Has Barack Obama **ever** said anything nice about America?      That very policy would have prevented the Boston Marathon bombing.   But just think of all the cultural enrichment they'll provide!      This is more naive liberal outrage over a reality that conflicts with their worldview of fuzzy unicorns.  For some strange reason, Reddit was silent about Obama using the term "typical white person" in his book.   Democrats do this all the time.  Reddit is silent.   And the left's revision of history continues.  Can't have any of those evil white men being idolized any more.   Funny.  There is criticism of Trump on Reddit, but no criticism of Elizabeth "I have high cheekbones so I can lie about my Native American ancestry" Warren.  	92
 Her poor husband.   did someone say buttdart?   throw that all day long!  it will make for good conversation - better than on the wall IMO.   What kind?  I need some wizards.  More details please.   When I was a cable installer and I was having to crawl through dog shit to hook a modem up....inside the house.      http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/2l2bb9/my_friend_also_took_a_drive_to_the_head_oc/         As the series continues you'll realize that each MC is divided by race.  The Whites, The Blacks, The Yellows, The Browns.   LumberBoss   I should have been more specific on 'drive'.  It was a fairway drive not from the teebox.  He was still only 5-10 feet away.   perfection.   Breakfast - Jerry's Diner Brunch - Beer Kitchen  Medxican - El Camino Real    We were at Waterworks in KC.  I heard what sounded like another friend hit a tree and when I looked my other friend was laying on the ground wondering wtf just happened.  The guy throwing had a very late release.  Lots of laughs that day.   I wish it didn't float and would simply sink to the bottle so I don't have to throw it anymore.  So understable.  	16
 Pueblo is like the asshole of CO.   He was in the first season of Peaky Blinders on Netflix!   Oh my god, it happens to me too xD   Seriously, you don't even need to use ward. I used Spellbrealer.   A punchcat is a Khajiit that is unarmed because they have a bonus for it due to claws.   19 year old student with no motivation and barely slipping by in college.    11 year old WRX. Student still not sure what he wants out of life.   I don't believe in them  \#whatsababycloud   I have a 60 too, but that's because I wanted to be the 200,000th press. And I fucking was.    Dude, I fucking love the Saabaru. Seeing one is like seeing a unicorn.   My dog stole one and hid it in my pillows a couple years ago.   ME ME ME   Mac because my name is McCoy.   Update the WRX/STI engines!   No. You were close, though. It's Bendydick Bandersnatch.   Such an underrated letter.   OMON, actually.   I wouldn't know about him.   I think the thing with that is that he genuinely seems to be happy with whatever he's got. He's not super picky.   DeVito can be anything you want him to be.   That would be hilarious   I'll bet you wouldn't regret it, dude!   I want the DeVito thing.   Man, that sucks. I haven't seen Silent Planet, but I've seen Defeater before and they put on an awesome show.   I've currently got tickets to go see Defeater and Counterparts and I may go see Silent Planet this month.   Not much, but my great (x6) grandfather fought in the Texas Revolution. We still have the deed to the land he was given and everything. That's really the farthest we've looked into our lineage.   My friends tried to kick my sister out of our prom group because they didn't like her boyfriend at the time, so I put them on the spot and told them how shallow and rude it was to do something like that. Stand up for yourself, dude. They're being immature. If they can't see that, then fuck them. Go to prom without them and enjoy yourself.   I love the shit out of this car. No question, I would buy it again.   I absolutely agree.   I personally think the AW11 kicks both their asses.   Heh.   Pfft. Who needs that shit anyway?   Lincoln Town Car Rally Sport Package   If that's usually the case, I feel lucky that my major prof gave us the book for a $1 and another prof gave us one of the books for free.   Worth it.   It was awesome. They were in a small-ish venue and it was perfect.   I'm not a huge TWA fan, but they definitely put on a good show.   The new song is a lot like the newer albums how it was a little slower then the earlier stuff and heavier.   They played one new song and it was actually pretty good. If you're talking about the newer stuff that's already out, they actually played a pretty even amount of songs from all of their albums, so there were only 2 or 3 songs off of 8:18. They still sounded great though!   I just got back from the Denver show. Probably one of my top 3 shows.   Prada fucking killed it in Denver.   Same. My old vans are perfect.   Have you read the Sandman graphic novels?   Me too!   I fucking love Listener.   I'm 19. I haven't been in a relationship since middle school and I don't count that.   I was just thinking the same thing. Sandman could only work if it was very high budget and would need to be cast really well.   I'm going to see Defeater for the second time on their headliner and couldn't be more excited!   The Honda Element has a pretty good amount of space and can be found pretty cheap. I also used to have a Suzuki SX4 and it was surprisingly spacious for what it was.   I agree. I loved that movie as a kid. Haven't seen it for a good while.   I was at that show, dude.  Fucking awesome!   I hope so, I'm a pretty big Mad Max fan so I'm looking forward to this game. :)   Here's some gameplay from 2013. That's all I could find. http://youtu.be/ON6MEqe8Lrg   Really?! That's awesome!   Honestly, that's what I would prefer. I just think Bioware is more likely. I loved KotOR 2 though. Even with the unfinished story, it was awesome.   I really hope that EA lets Bioware do another KotOR. Like so bad.   My school didn't have FSAE which is what I was looking for, but they had SAE Baja. Which, in my opinion, may be a little more fun. ;)   I always liked racing games and car shows, but I never really got into cars until I actually *had* a car.   Simulacra.   How did their hats stay on their heads then?   Am from Boulder. Own Subaru.   Wait.   I just restarted my computer and now it isn't working again.  Damn. :/   I saw Of Mice   Men on their first headliner.  They were with ISMFOF, Woe, Is Me, Sleeping with Sirens, and The Amity Affliction.  It was pretty awesome.   That worked! Thanks so much!   My laptop says it's connected and some sites (like reddit) are loading, but almost all of them just load for a minute and then time out. I just did all the driver updates my computer said it had, restarting, scanning for malware, and checking my most recent installations, and I can't really think of anything else to look for. This on my school's Internet and I checked my friends computer and it loaded everything just fine, so I don't think it's a problem with the school. I'm using windows 7, Intel i7-4810. If you need to know anything else, just ask. Thanks for any help.  Edit: I forgot to mention that my computer says my connection is fine and a speed test says I am getting 15 Mbps.   Toyota FJ has a manual and you get a bonus windshield wiper at no extra cost!   If you click on the no photo available, it actually shows you the cover.   My friend had fucking DOOM on his calculator. Math appliances have come so far.   Oh, I do. :)      I used to drive one. They're great little cars.   I read something that put it perfectly. It was along the lines of "Drive is so stuffed full of obvious symbolism and themes that they couldn't even try to fit in substance or a plot."   If you're in Denver, I was at the Periphery show too! That entire show kicked some serious ass!   Anything by the band Fun.   My mom used to have one and they're about as comfortable and spacious as it gets for road trips.   Definitely. I kind of hope they become rivals like the Evo and STI.   The rarest I've seen was a Noble M600.  Haven't gotten to ride in any rare ones. :/   The new Focus RS is AWD and should have at least 320 horsepower.   Seriously. I was wearing a purple hoodie and a girl said purple was a good color on me. It was honestly kind of alien to me how much it upped my mood.   Pfft, Tokyo Drift is the best one.   Fuck, I still listen to this album regularly.   I actually just finished In Bruges, finally. I actually really liked it. I thought I was going to be disappointed because it seemed to be getting overhyped here, but I was pleasantly surprised.   To clarify, it's 4 *seasons* it's actually got 88 episodes and then a movie.   Go for it. It's hard to go wrong with Brand New.   Now I'm alone in bed since 7:30 on New Years Eve, still kind of freaking out.  This sucks.   Get a clown horn.      Jesus, like 100k+ mile STis can still go for US$20k or more where I am.   The worst part is that I swear I've read this fucking story before! How did I not remember the end?!   1 lb   Thanks, that means a lot :)  	91

Lets feed perfectly good food to animals and then slaughter the animals so that we can get back only a small fraction of the food. That will show those starving people how much we care!   Okay, so supposing that is true we ought to take the suffering of plants into consideration as well when deciding how we ought to behave.   Which do you think causes less plant suffering: Feeding plants to animals then eating animals or consuming plants directly?   One thing I have been pondering doing is getting a bunch of vegan cookies then going to a college campus and offering them as free samples. However, I would put them out on two plates titled "regular chocolate chip cookies" and "vegan chocolate chip cookies".   I would set up cameras to record the whole thing and tell people that I'm hoping to get feedback on the recipes and ask them what they thought about both. I think people's reactions would make for an interesting video.   My organization Berman   Co is all about protecting consumer freedom.

All those in favor of swallows being vegan upvote this comment.   Good news! You actually don't need any nutrients from meat! You can live a happy and healthy life as a vegetarian!  According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):  It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:  Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.  Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.  The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:  Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.  Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:  A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.  This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.  A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.   I feel like I had [a very similar discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3d0yof/til_the_daily_water_footprint_of_a_person_eating/ct0z06t?context=3) with someone else in this thread who tried to make everything about me instead of actually looking at the consequences of their own actions.    You might find /r/vegrecipes and /r/veganrecipes to be useful resources for finding meal ideas. Everyone's tastes will differ, but if you look through the top posts you can see what a lot of people have enjoyed.   It must be due to lack of fiber.   I'm not forcing you to do anything. I will give you reasons why choosing to cut out animal products is a substantial and important thing to do to lessen the harm you cause to others, but that is all.   Causing less harm to others is better than causing more harm. It makes you a better person to choose the former.  I don't care if I'm better than you or not. You should care about trying to be the best person you can be.   Animals suffer as individuals, not as a species.   Imagine we lived in the world of the Matrix where humans were bred by the tens of billions to be used for energy. Our concern should be the well-being of humans as individuals, not the fact that we would go from a population of 50 billion humans down to a more reasonable 7 billion if we stopped humans from being bred excessively.   Our concern for other animals ought to be the same. There is value in preserving biodiversity, but our primary concern should be for the well-being of the individuals.   Any diet needs to be planned appropriately in order to be healthy. No dietetic association is going to say a certain diet is healthy without caveats to ensure that it meets all our nutritional needs.

Nothing you do can overcome all of the biases people will have against veganism. You can do some things to overcome a lot of it, but there is nothing you can do that will make everyone open to fairly considering what you have to say.  Appearance plays a big role in getting people to take you seriously. You will do much better if you have a clean haircut and decent clothes.  Another important aspect is to use as mainstream of sources as possible. Don't use Freelee as a banana girl as a source to support why you think vegan diets are healthy, reference the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  Finally, act like you understand where people are coming from. You don't need to condone the consumption of animal products, but if you acknowledge people's experiences and beliefs they will be much more willing to hear you out.   Well since you're asking... [Here's a picture of my package](http://i.imgur.com/HX4AKLU.jpg)   But fewer slaves would have been better than the alternative. In fact, while people were pushing for abolition, they were also abstaining from products like tobacco and sugar that were produced by slaves, choosing alternatives instead.    not just for the people who were freed, but also for people who would never be born to suffer the injustice of slavery.   When Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807 the only people who became slaves were people who were bred and born to be slaves. I think we can both recognize that it still made a difference to abolish slavery outright, not just for the people who were freed, but also for people who would never be born to suffer the injustice of slavery.   It makes a world of difference for the animals who are not suffering and dying as a result. This has made more difference for these animals than increasing cage space or slowing growth rates ever could.   /r/vegetarian  /r/VegRecipes    [Americans ate 400 million fewer animals in 2014 than in 2007](http://www.mfablog.org/americans-ate-400-million-fewer-animals-in).

I will continue to eat ~~whatever~~ **whoever** I want  Animals are not objects. They are individuals with desires and interests of their own. An ethical person needs to take into account the impact their actions have on others when deciding how to behave.   I'm not a big fan of Chorizo, but I use their ground meat product often to make homemade chili or a meaty pasta sauce.   The food chain isn't an ethical theory. It doesn't tell you how you ought to behave any more than the water cycle tells you not to dam rivers or build canals.   There is more to determining how you ought to behave than simply stating what you enjoy. You also need to consider the impact your actions are having on others.   The issue is that people go to the store and see packaging with green pastures and happy animals and believe that is how the animals are raised. People see terms like "humane" and "organic" and are similarly deceived into picturing unrealistic conditions. However, when undercover investigators go and film the facilities behind these labels the resulting footage is always cramped conditions and incredibly cruel treatment.   They are amazing!

 I- i was being serious...... damn dude.   Hey writers,  Working on a comic-book script based on a cartoon I drew in high school a few years back. It's about a young sous chef who discovers that he's an alien from a race of hyper advanced species who's cooking can warp space and time. Now my question is, what power related to cooking or food in general could I give the protagonist, Riley?   Thanks!   Hey Writers,  A week ago I wrote a short story that I realized could become a seasonal series. I'm wondering, are there any mode of distribution where people can pay for a five story 'season' or pay individually for a single story?    Wow! Thank you for the help! So your saying he could be like Batman, someone who hides compliments behind criticism? And also, he's raised both Leoric and Rysich from infancy, Athroben came along a little ways later.   You know, Reddit is like a family. We look out for one another and sometimes our parental figure walks out on us.   Leoric is the oldest at 16. Athroben is the middle child at 15 and Rysich is the youngest at 14. Silas was once a top tier Rider until an accident happened with high level magic, obliterating an entire city. His best friend, Jazen, was the one responsible, but Silas blames himself for everyone who died that day. He became an alcoholic, but his life began to turn around when he adopted the boys.   Hey Writers,  I'm asking the above question because I'm working on a fantasy novel about dragon riders. In-universe, the rider organization takes young riders at the age of five and places them into 'family' groups to help train them. The three protagonists, Leoric, Athroben and Rysich are taken in by an veteran rider named Silas. I'm wondering how I can write this relationship and make it seem natural.   Thanks!   Haka could be like a form of 'bending' a spell into a more powerful form by synchronizing it will your movements, then shouting to cast it. Or the rhythmic chanting would be better suited towards defensive spells. It would be a good exercise for the young practitioners to practice together to learn how to weave their brands of magic together to be more effective.    Hey Worldbuilders,  Working on a new series that takes place in a world like ours, but magic is real.The world of magic is hidden from normal humans. Practitioners are found and taken at a young age to focus their abilities and train in small groups around the world.   Now, I want the magic system to be different than most. I wanted to somehow include magic from different cultures, not just the typical 'Harry Potter-flick the wand' magic that we know. The 'international magic' theme would fit with weapons, because each practitioner would have a weapon from the culture that their magic steams from. For example, a Egyptian magic user might use a crook or Keopesh (curved sword) as a focus for their magic and hand to hand weapon.   So, any ideas on how I can make cultural magic work? What kind of weapons could be added?     Done by the same special effects team that does The Flash and Arrow, a Percy Jackson Netflix series could be amazing.    I have, but I was imagining that this game would be more like Minecraft in terms of no set plan, like in Evil Genius. The player would be in full control of their character at all times.   Hey Redditors,  Had an idea for a game. The player makes their own supervillain and rival superhero before starting the game in a randomly generated main city. The player then can begin aquirring a base, money through bank robberies, and start building gear based on their theme and powers. Once the player feels like they're ready, they can go after large scale goal. This can be whatever they desire, such as stealing a dinosaur skeleton, robbing the local gold depository or even just causing mayhem. Their rival superhero will spawn and engage the player in a boss fight. Upon defeat, the player can escape or be arrested, if they didn't think ahead or have some other plan.   Aside from this, I would like some input or ideas!   Hey World Builders,  I'm working on a new science fiction/western series, and I was wondering, what interesting aspects from the Borderlands Games do most world builders like, that I can consider tweaking?       Any ideas when it comes to boss battles? I can see Cobalt Blue and the Reverse Flash being standard run and punch fights, but the Rouge's would be different because they don't have powers.   Hey Speedesters,  Since the Arkham series is wrapping up, I've been wondering what character Rocksteady could focus on next. I figured the Flash could be interesting because of his Rouges Gallery. So my question you all is, what rouges would you like to see in this hypothetical game? Any ideas on gameplay or story?    I have and I post there frequently, but I would like to get paid, as I can create whole storylines for those who need it. Poor college student here.   Hey Redditors, I'm a short story writer and I have some ideas I'd be willing to sell or I can contribute to your own idea if you needed the help! Private message me if anyone is interested, I can work through social media or Reddit.      Some are. Others are tied to elements, some are tied to emotions, it varies. For example, a there is a storm demon that can control electricity through a cities power grid. There's a demon who's based around greed and fused with a man's soul, making him act like Larfleeze with an insatiable hunger. However, all demons can't exist on the material plane without a body to possess.     Well, for the first novellete, the first demon the team faces is a demon that can control cockroaches that make up it's body under a skin suit. I'm thinking they lock him in a cell that's designed to emit subtle pulses of electricity to keep his bugs under control.     I love this idea. Like the entire city is built solely to keep this thing locked down.    Hey Redditors. How can I creativity contain demons in an urban fantasy setting?  -Edit: Wow, thanks everyone! I've come to a conclusion on what I can do. For lower demons they can be simply sent back to wherever they came from with a banishment spell and some salt. Stronger demons or those who are bound to a human host must be imprisoned in a premade cell at a warehouse designed to hold different types of demons.       I personally hate the whole 'salt shotgun' idea. It works on the show, but in other stories, whenever it's mentioned, it takes the tension away. Supernatural is one of those shows that had a unique idea, but the fans sometimes take it way too far and say it works for everything. Stuffing rocksalt into a shotgun doesn't work. Just....no. Listen, I don't mean to offend any Supernatural fans, I enjoy the show too, but please don't apply their rules to this story. Thanks.   Ok, I think I'll throw my hat in the ring and make a character.   Name: Axotl Lore: Axotl is a mutant similar to Fish and Chicken. He is a mutated lab salamander who was raised with other young mutants in an abandoned laboratory. One day, Axotl found a combat robot in the lab basement and reprogramed it to help him look for the legendary Nuclear Throne. Axotl's appearance is similar to a Spotted Salamander, but with the gills and tail of a Axolotl.   Starting Weapon- Crossbow  Passive ability- Child of Science: Less rad's are needed to get a mutation. However, the mutations will be limited to only two choices.   Active ability- When Axotl's active is used, his combat robot, Rust-O,will be spawned, taking up 2 rads. If a player's rad supply is low, health will be taken instead. Rust-O will behave similar to Rouge's allies, fighting off enemies until he is killed. Rust-O has a energy ball attack similar to the bandit's.  Throne Butt:  Rust-O will only cost one rad and he'll stay on the field longer.   Ultra A: Child of Science will instantly allow a mutation, even without rads.   Ultra B: Rust-O get's upgraded with a laser weapon.   Loading Text  -Rust-O is the coolest  -Science rules  -No more home  -The Throne will ease the pain  -Where is my mother?   I know that, but you guys deserve all the thanks! I'm not even that good at horror.   Wow, thank you guys for all these upvotes! To me, an aspiring writer, this means so much in ways you all can't imagine!    Hey Throne Hunters!   Just for fun, if you could create an original character for Nuclear Throne, what would they be and what would their backstories and abilities be?   Last summer, I was able to get an internship at my hometown's radio-station, KVW, outside of El Paso. During the day, things went well. I got along with the other interns and enjoyed my duties; making coffee, cleaning the bathrooms, ordering the files and placing calls for special guests. But that was during the day.   See, in my small town of Dune Acres we have a story that get's passed around. Dune Acres was once a thriving prospecting settlement, and most of it's population consisted of both Caucasian and Mexican people. They got along fairly well until a Mexican man was falsely accused of raping a white woman. The Mexicans, knowing that the accusation was false became enraged and according to some, summoned a being from Hell to get revenge. But the summoning went wrong, and after blood was spilt, the demon was trapped on our plane of existence, bound the the woman who summoned him, becoming a demonic hybrid unable to cross into heaven or hell. But on the full moon, she makes her presence known at midnight and says a rhyme. If anyone listens to it through all four verses or looks into her eyes, she takes them away.    But these were stories my older sister told me for a scare, and as I got older I disregarded them. But when Shock Jock Lock, the station manager told me and a few of the other interns that we'd be working nights next week, my mind began to wonder about that story. My friends Seth and Jenna were working with me on the night shift, so it wasn't that bad. In fact, an hour after we got to work, we were cracking jokes and playing Cards Against Humanity, so I completely forgot about it. Then, at around eleven fifty, I heard a thumping sound from the hallway outside the breakroom where I was making coffee. I assumed it was Seth or Jenna having a rubber band fight or throwing the football we'd found earlier. But then I heard a shaky voice that sounded old and muffled, as if someone had filled their mouth with dirt and tried to talk. The weird mumbling voice seemed to get closer, and as it did, I swore, I could almost make it out what the voice was saying.   *The Grandmother arrives at midnight* *To address the town* *Give up the good children, let me take them down.*  I froze and the 'Welcome to Nightvale' mug slipped out of my hand and shattered against the linoleum floor as the light's began to flicker. That was the first verse of the rhyme that my sister told me. The thumping sound became steady and seemed to pick up speed, coming down the hallway. I managed to shake myself out of the grip of fear and lunged for the door, slamming it shut just as the noise rounded the corner. For a few agonizing seconds the doorknob was rattled and jostled before it stopped. I held my breath as something metallic was ran over the door right where my back was positioned.   *It's been so long grandchild, you never come around* *Why don't you, why don't you* *Please come down*  I felt my blood freeze when I heard Seth's voice in the hallway.   "Yo, hermano, let's have that coffee already, I need the caffeine!" A wave of relif washed over me. Seth! Thank God, this *was* a prank! I wrenched the door open, but screamed at what I saw. A gnarled *ancient* woman, wearing a ratty prairie dress speckled with what appeared to be blood and bits of sinew. Her bare arms were pockmarked with tiny holes and jutting out from them were black spikes, a few of which were pulsating and undulating, as if worms were writhing under the skin beneath them. Her lower jaw looked as if it was dislocated and hung, unnaturally wide, with two twin slashes across the sides of her mouth.  But the worst part was her eyes. They were empty sockets, with deep cuts around them, as if they had been ripped out. She extended one gnarled and bloodied finger and pointed it at my chest.   *I have my grandchild* she said, in Seth's voice. I don't remember what happened next, but I ran before she could grab me. I ran as fast as I could, away from the station, away from my home and friends. I know she'll be after me. I haven't slept in two days. Right now, I am hiding in a truck stop bathroom in Colorado and the lights- well the lights are flickering.                   Yeah, Ziz has a human form he manifests for Eli to see. This form can be seen by selective people like Eli's friends or be detected by some forms of cameras (he gives off tachyons and specific energy waves that can be detected), but cannot interact with physical objects. Ziz's form isn't a construct of Eli's mind, but the product of Ziz's own desire to have a real body.      I've checked it out before. I'm not a big anime fan, so powers from anime tend to be something that I avoid, simply because they can be extremly overpowered.    That's interesting, but Eli is a young man at the start, around 14 years old, I find it really disturbing that his bones would have to be replaced with a metal versions for Ziz to work. I think the metal bones would be great for the major villain, who's a shadow archetype of Eli and Ziz.   It can be whatever you wish!   	33
 Now, I'm really interested to know how many taco bell restaurants he is worth.    This is awesome! I love hourglass pieces and this one is really unique!   Dating sites, bars, activities...Friends are overrated!!   Being blind without a doubt, I can't even handle closing my eyes around other people...   I'm in love with this.    You're welcome! :)   They're actually glass with a 'cracked' pattern in them! I got them from arctic buffalo: http://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/plugs/products/purple-cracked-glass-plugs           Also in pink: http://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/plugs/products/light-rose-cracked-glass-plugs   That's awesome! Most people really want realistic photograph quality stuff and I actually find the tattoos that aren't to be more interesting!    Okay, good! :)    The quality of line in this isn't on par as far as crisp and clean goes...did you want it in that 2D hand drawn style? If not I would consider going else where.    Not trying to sound snarky at all by the way, I apologize in advance.   Feel like I should take a drink every time this has lice listed as another item on the list. :P    Seriously though this sucks,       I meant combination as in using crochet for maintenance! I need them to be very neat(as neat as dreads can be) because I work in a business casual setting on a daily basis.    Please refer to title, and I have fine relatively straight  shoulder length hair BUT I already use dollylocks bar shampoo and sea salt spray! :)    You should really ask the artist you want to tattoo you...Look at their work, if you like their portfolio book a consult. Tell them exactly what you want in as much detail as you can with a defined budget. Then, they should show you this design before your appointment.    Also, if you do this just as a tip taking the design someone draws for you and getting it tattooed elsewhere is a no no. And give them as much warning as possible if you need to cancel...   This really is porn, holy shit. I would sell my soul for an apartment this nice.    I just pull my bottom eyelid enough to get it slightly open and dive bomb a bunch in. it works because the bottom lid will catch all the visine! Be prepared to spaz after though, that shit stings!   Dammit Dynamite, this is totally me...How do you know this, are you the one watching me?    I use bedhead, dirty secret dry shampoo and it works perfectly...I tried tresemme, dove, and other brands before this! Only one I would even dream of recommending. Dove also stained my brown hair white.    Also, make sure you're holding it far enough away from your hair and that you're spraying it through the layers if its longer...    This poor fucker, what did they eat... the table? I can't imagine dealing with that many food allergies daily.   Makes me want to get real cuticles tattoos, so nice! Good job OP, on the nails as well.   	20
 You think that was hot fire? He has a mix tape droppin next week.   Name checks out.   Because we are backing the cartels. We've givin them weapons, had our CIA agents party with them, and have allowed them to operate so they can feed us info on other cartels we don't like.   Plus without cartels we wouldn't have a war on drugs. No war on drugs means no asset forfeiture, less people in jail, less work for cops and prision guards and most importantly no reason for states to recieve money and military grade hardware from the fed.   I'm probably wrong, and I hope I am l. But givin what I've seen done by our government I doubt I am.   Body massage.    No.   Crazies gonna crazy.   And I would of gotten away with arresting them too if it wasnt for that pesky constitution.   Now if we could ge rid of that lying, manipulate cunt Pao we could have another 10 years.   I'll give her the $2.7 million, if she steps down as CEO and fucks off reddit forever.   Just imagine if someone wrote this type of letter to the police. Just think about what they would do to that person.    This is not a political or racist terrorist attack. Not at all. This is just another attack on the Christian faith. - Fox News   YOU FINALLY DID IT TWC! YOU ARE OFFICIALLY NUMBER ONE!   I don't see the issue here. Our black president said "nigger" while talking about racism.   Just imagine all the people who have called Obama a nigger over the years, but yet when the black president says it, its national news.   Ah yes the hypersensitive sjws are at it agian. Making everywhere a "safe space" free from those icky truths that are so very problematic and triggering.   Thank god these people exist to protect my poor little feefees from the harsh unforgiving world. I'm so glad that after I've finished my degree in gender studies, these people will always be there to tell me how to act and what to say so I don't unintentionally trigger someone.   /s   Beat me to it.

When I borrowed it from a friend I could only fight that big black ball thing twice before I realised that the whole point of the game is to grind and hope you get good rng.   Now bungie is telling people "If you want the true experience buy the game agian for more money and get these emoticons :)" No thank you bungie. As someone who went to a halo 2/3 midnight release and supported bungie by buying Halo 1-3 it hurts to say that I will not ever buy anything made by bungie again.

Some set out to be hateful and crazy echo chamber that is so fragile it must ban anyone who doest toe the line or deviates from the group think.  And then there is 4chan.    2015   not knowing   I shig a dig as I dance a jig.    ghazi  standards   Hold on, I'm gonna need a ladder for this kek.   If found guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt, with solid evidence I'm all for it. Especially crimes involving mass murder, spree killers, rape of a child, or things like those.    Well years and years of failed policies and brutality from the LAPD have created the threat of public backlash against them. So the fear of that causes them to shoot first bcause "they were in fear of their lives".      You forgot the parts about not having to reload and bad ass 80's  metal blasting over local P.A. systems. Oh and everyone has bald eagle that hovers above while carrying an American flag.    This actually happened to a friend of mine from my home town. I dont remember exact details (its been years), but basically he was taking care of his two sons after the mom left them to "start her life over" a state away, and somehow she managed to still have custody and wouldn't give it to my friend.   So he had to pay child support to her, which went on a card, that he had. While the whole time she was a state away giving fuck all about them.   I'm a single father of my four year old daughter since day one. Her mother didn't want her and still doesn't want anything to do with her.   So around the time my daughter was five months I get a call from the child support agency. I was told I had to come in and set up payments for her or jail.   I made the appointment and took my daughter. Along with evidence of doctors visits, my wic, insurance, food stamps and letters from coworkers/friends/family all proving that I was doing it without her mothers help.   The child support lady looked at all of it and told me that they would close the case against me and start one on her mom. Fast forward a year or so later and nothing. So I call and I get told that the case was never opened on her mom and that I'd have to go through courts to get one started.  I said fuck it. Now years later still no support or bday cards or Christmas gifts or anything from her mother. And that's fine she can have whatever life she wants and if that involves not being a parent thats her choice.   But to think if the roles were reversed and I was the one who didn't want my daughter I would be paying child support or in jail.      Its like sleepaway camp all over again.    This is the state of our country, the line between satire and real life has become one in the same. I am not even surprised anymore.  We have politicians who are bought by the highest bidder to shove an agenda that is bad for everyone but a few rich assholes. Democracy is dead, killed by backroom deals and corruption.   In the "Land of the Free" we have a government that has implemented some of the following in our name.   Rampant violations of the fourth amendment by the NSA.  Proxy wars orchestrated by the CIA (including drug smuggling and overthrowing governments).  Using the biggest tragedy in American history to start two failed wars, hundreds of thousands dead, billions of debt and a even more of a bad situation then when we went in.  But the biggest part of this that destroys me about this is using the horrific deaths of thousands of innocent Americans, to pass the Patriot" act, that takes away our rights.   Internal check points where citizens are told to prove citizenship (papers please). Not only that but these constitution-free zones are within 100 miles of our boarders, thats most of our population.   A militarized police force.   A failed, expensive and pointless war on drugs. That not only makes nonviolent people felons (no more vote), but turns people who have been doing what people have done for thousands of years into a crime.  There is so much more and these are only from my lifetime (28 years).    I love my country. I love the rights granted to me as an American. I am thankful for the blood that was shead for these rights.  But when I see that rich fucks run for leader of the free world I can't even be phased anymore.    Triggered.    A collective "no shit" rings out across the land.   Sweet release. Rip in pepperoni birderoni.    That ending wcw promo got me right in the feels.   INB4 hypersensitive cunts.   I see the problem, you zigged when you should of zagged. The best way to fix that problem is by simply gettin good :)   That I'm gonna somehow sit on my balls someday and its gonna hurt.  Or that somehow I manage to turn out to be a bad father.   Mostly the balls thing though, ouch.   I bet she would answer this if you had 2.7 milli.    Cruz is a fucking idiot.   THE GOYIUM KNOW.

God help you if you are driving and it happens to rain. People loose their minds, expect delays.  If your into smoking cannabis for medicinal or recreational reasons California is great for that.

I'm with ya, having people in jail or even in the legal system at all for cannabis is ridiculous.    What a thrill.   I can but not with as much swag as Bill Gates.         Im asking everyone who reads this to go show your support for the school and students right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.

Unless they are high profile pedophiles.           I knew I fucked that up. I haven't had my coffee yet.    I'm just pointing out the facts.  Fact is this fucking cop is going to get away with it. There is nothing to investigate, piggums bashed someone in the face with his fucking gun. Or are you saying they will find out that the gun he had on him jumped out on its own and proceeded to smash in guys face?  OP is the one with all the answers and is either using multiple accounts or a brigade.   Yeah that's totally it. Ive made over 200 accounts just to upvote this. Its not like people are starting to wake up to the growing brutality and double standard cops gets away with.   Palestinians deserve their country back.    Whats this a sensible drug policy?! In my America?!  *edit Spelling is hard.      You and I both know damn well that's why they did it.    Its exactly what happened.    Donald Akers says, He held the gun first, I didnt know if he was going to shoot us or what.  But instead, he hit me right across the nose with it. Broke my nose, my sinus cavities, broke my teeth.  Once that happened, Janet Akers admits she fought back.  Bystanders broke up the fight.  She then called 911, and took some photos to document the scene.  So the police came, and went over directly to them. And were talking to them, laughing, joking around, recalls Janet, We feel like they knew him right off the bat.  If a regular person did that you know damn well they would of been arrested and charged on the spot. The fact this cop and his buddies joked around about assaulting a man with a deadly weapon shows you just how serious the "investigation" is going to go.          Fuck Police.   [House](http://www.amazon.com/House-Leaves-Mark-Z-Danielewski/dp/0375703764) of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski  I recommend everyone here go get it.    2015  Still trying to flim flam the zim zam   All kinds, here is a list of some of them.   A single mom who lives in a house. Only drank wine.  A white chick covered in tats who carried a pistol and sold/used hard drugs.  An Asian girl who was a total hippy, loved taking doses and shrooms.   A mixed (black/white) collage girl who became my babys momma.  There is a buncha others.   But now that Ive been a single dad for four years all I really want now is a woman who is an amazing, caring, loving mother type. Who has ambition and motivation. But she has to have an edge, quick to call me a cunt face fuck nugget and knows how to fuck like a porn star.   Should be to hard to find right guys?   I watch more streams on twitch and e sport events than I do regular sports.  Ive never really been into watching sports even though I played soccer, baseball and three years of football as a kid.

I prefer to sacrifice a goat and let the blood fall onto my gay husbands buttocks, while I speak in toungs and smoke the devils lettuce. It gets the point across but man do I go through a lot of goats.   I don't get why these people are so against abortions. All they do is send babys to God and Jesus faster.   The NSA is about protecting the government not the people. If it was truly about protecting the people it wouldnt violate the people's rights on a daily basis.   Old white people. And billionaires who have bought them.  The American people are more or less sheep lead by tv news (who is told what to say by the goverment) and distracted by irreverent celebrities. The people here on reddit are a minority who loves to scream about the travesty our country is taking but none of us are willing to be the martyrs. Not one of us is willing to pick up a gun and go take out the trash, because it wouldn't matter. Some other shill will take their place while the news will spin the story into "Domestic Terrorist hates America we need more gun control/spying to keep us safe from the people in our own country who hate us." Also the voting system is rigged and rich politicians don't go to jail.  No we don't, we don't have enough money to buy one.   Welp looks like I'm going to forget paying taxes this year.

 A persons conviction is true to them from their experiences. The fact others don't agree is what makes it unpopular. For example, my opinion is that every man that drinks alcohol has small genitals. Drunk men will not agree. Tough shit.   You're not obligated to read this subreddit, which is specifically labeled as a collection of unpopular opinions. Just letting you know, not sure if anyone ever told you that.   So as long as the unpopular opinion isn't really unpopular we're cool. Got it.   I'm of the opinion you're a cunt. But it's based on very educational formulations of hypothesis based on the principles of the scientific validation process.    Protip: close your browser  	5

 Yes. As a young arrogant teenager I thought it was school that needed to change, that it was the schools fault I wasn't succeeding. But actually it was my attitude, and looking back I needed a wake up call or two.      Yeah but turfing it on to neighboring suburbs isn't the answer with a kick/lock out isn't the best option. I only hope the bar owners take some responsibility here, however if their track record is anything to go by, it'll be the usual "we're not doing anything wrong, stop punishing us" mantra, where the blame is entirely deflected to a preloading culture rather than addressing the root cause.               I get what you're saying, and perhaps I'm being too harsh, let me explain further.  I know I probably would have failed School cert, I certainly failed NCEA.  I know I'm not a fucking idiot as I'm not doing too badly in the game of life, but to fail and have beside the failure "Did not achieve" was insulting to say the least.   I mean look at HTC for what happens everyone keeps telling them: "You tried your best, and that's ok" in relation to the M8.  then they think mediocrity is acceptable, and release the M9.

You're quite right!  Edit: again for the TL;DR people:  **Para 1.:** On April 23, the New Zealand Herald published, front-page and online, an article about Amanda Bailey and the controversy over her reaction to the Prime Minister, John Key, when he persistently pulled her ponytail at the cafe where she worked as a waitress.  **Para 3.:** Lisa Finlay, Bronwyn Hayward, Leanne Hermosilla, Josh Hetherington, Rob Stowell, Jasmine Taylor, Giovanni Tiso, Daniel Webster and Julia Woodhall complained that the article breached several Press Council principles.  **Para 2.:** The Press Council has upheld the substance of the complaints. This is a brief outline; for the full Press Council decision, in two parts, please see www.presscouncil.org.nz.   Ah, I recall that event.   I have to admit that it would 100% appear like the Herald are closing ranks around the reporter, as this piece of drivel posing as a 'apology' does not explain anything akin to what you've just explained. Thank you /r/Hubris2, fantastic ELI5.   No, and frankly doesn't actually explain what the complaint was about.  The severely disjointed flow of this article- especially between paragraph 1 and 2 are extremely discombobulating. I had to read it like 3 times, for thinking there are a sentence or 2 I was missing.   Paragraphs for the TL;DR crowd:   "On April 23, the New Zealand Herald published, front-page and online, an article about Amanda Bailey and the controversy over her reaction to the Prime Minister, John Key, when he persistently pulled her ponytail at the cafe where she worked as a waitress.  The Press Council has upheld the substance of the complaints. This is a brief outline; for the full Press Council decision, in two parts, please see www.presscouncil.org.nz."

No, they give you 15 minutes lee-way at the beginning of the fire process.  After 15 minutes, with most techniques you should have significant combustion of the wood.  Incomplete combustion, (and subsequently waste of wood) results in soot (carbon) in the atmosphere.  So if you have a good fire from kindling, and whack a log that's too big, or wet or contaminated for complete combustion to occur you get smoke/soot. This also causes expensive chimney blockages, and results in less heat being generated.   So yes it's a pain in the ass, but actually proper techniques, and keep your fire smoke free is significantly better use of your wood, and subsequently cheaper.

And even better it works in the dark without the need to stare the at the screen.   Even a 3 swipe unlock I reckon is an acceptable tradeoff between none, and a pass code.

Coming from the country [that put a woman behind bars for 3 months in **2009** for online harrassment.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1208147/First-cyberbully-jailed-Facebook-death-threats.html)  The register has thoroughly gone downhill recently.   I fully understand a bar is a place to socialize, and alcohol is engrained in or socialization culture.   However going to be the pub, preloaded and buy only 1 beer, you're contributing to the demise of that pub, I don't know what the $$$ per head need to keep a pub open but it just be quite steep, rent doesn't pay itself!   A few successful pubs like the Fox have a reward scheme, similar to a subcard, which seems to work. Perhaps if they liked further abroad than just jacking prices we may see more of a scene back again.   That being said they are giving an uphill battle, in Chch it's stupidly hard to get a liquor license to sell anywhere, but this again makes me wonder why more bars don't look beyond jacking up prices to stay alive. It's not easy to run a business, but it's easy to ruin one.    Well that's it, and I'm sure you went out and got drunk out and about rather than pre loading?    It's a fucking rort ay, then bar owners actually complain no-one is buying drinks. It's like are you fucking stupid?    Stupid me. Being a paedophile is exclusively a man condition.   It's the native trim app, comes pre-installed. Thank you!    Make him wear a sign on the side of a main road "I'm a dirty arsonist".   You stupid cunts.   Hi /r/GalaxyS5.  Google was no help, so hopefully someone here can shed some light on this issue.  I use phone as a dashcam, and trim a lot of videos.  Recently after upgrading to lollipop when playing back videos in the Trim feature it plays back at 1.3x speed, and doesn't accurately portray the video length you've selected to crop.  I've deleted cache/clear data from "Video Trimmer" App, and disabled, rebooted, reenabled. I've also cleared data from "Trim" app.  This happens on videos shot from my device, reading from both SD card and internal memory.  Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.  Cheers!   Indeed. I don't know if you recall but a school up north basically gave out Credits for wiping your fucking nose in order to beat the statistics and ensure they got funding!   I can't find the particular story, [this](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/latest-edition/318375/NCEA-battered-by-secret-report) is rather damning..  "THE FIRST major analysis of schools' NCEA marking shows many teachers are awarding better grades than examiners do with high-profile schools among the dozens suspected of marking too high.  This means students who shouldn't have passed NCEA may have. Others might have missed out on university entrance because their school marked tougher than others."  And you **really** wonder why this girl is complaining?   Indeed. I for instance failed miserably at NCEA, and my teachers constantly lamented, saying "why aren't you doing better than this!? I know you're smart, but you fail your exams!" my report is littered with "my name can do better" and I have done better since in the real world - I'm in good employment with a large multinational and earning a very decent wage for my young age.  I'm not saying I'm a special case, but I'm perhaps a bit too atypical  to fit within the NCEA curriculum, and as a result I was frustrated throughout high school as I felt like the exams weren't catered for different learning styles.   From what I understand there was that leeway under the old school cert that you there were more than one ways to skin a cat, however under NCEA it was just a decision process that was extremely binary and linear.   Again, fuck you Trevor Mallard (Education Minister at the time) you humongous cunt bag.   I came here with an anti vandal sentiment, and found the comments in here quite heartwarming and I honestly can't add anything meaningful or even add even more colorful language. Reddit you make me so proud sometimes.   Can we just realise for a second that most of the old timers here (well, those 28 and older) sat through a far more robust and time honoured teaching system.   Kids nowadays are sitting through NCEA, a far cry from the old School Cert system.  NCEA isn't about learning at all, it's about gaining credits through an arbitrary system of points that are seemingly granted at whatever discretion some fuck thought was adequate.  There is no 'teaching' just a series of decisions which leads to more credits, or less credits, which are the used to either pass, or fail a course.  NCEA has totally fucked over our learning system, and this is the culmination of 10 years of tweaking a system that should never have survived the first year.    Fuck you Trevor Mallard you fucked up you cunt.  I walked out of school in disgust back then, and would do it again in a heartbeat.    The law catches people who want to bludge off our extremely (by world standards) lenient benefit laws. This catches both the extreme criminals, and in her case perhaps someone too naive for her own good. Is it fair? Laws aren't designed to be fair, but to allow as many genuine people through while catching those who will be a (perceived) burden on the system.   It's literally a game of numbers, and if you have more stacked against you, that's it. Fairness completely aside.          Shit, let's hope Sonny Tau doesn't catch wind of this..   No, she was a well spoken 24 year old woman. However she said the old guy just gave her an extremely bad vibe from the beginning.   To prove it really wasn't her -She sat it two weeks later and literally got 100% no shit.. Unfortunately this puts the pressure on me when I sit my Full! God knows I won't hear the end of it if I get anything less..    ~~Mature~~...real ~~mature~~. Manure...real manure..  FTFY   I wish I was joking, but she was indeed declined for "using the incorrect terminology." Good to know, that makes me feel better for sitting my test soon.   How did you find "verbally identifying the hazards?" My wife failed to "properly identify the hazards" because she said stuff like "car coming towards me" instead of "oncoming". Then again she did take it at the Sockburn testing station, who have the biggest pack of old fucking stick-up-their-ass sexist arrogant fucktards with  a severe god complex.   NZHerald are really starting to scrape the gutter eh.   It's like, you **really** think your average NZ wants this girl who lied (*7 months in and out of NZ on a 3 month tourist visa*), attempted to cheat the system (*I'm going to be a nanny and be paid with food and board, but it's totally not work because I'm family*) and was found out and now goes crying to the media?  I understand ignorance of the rules, especially with the nannying, however ignorance is no defence of the law unfortunately.    Thanks, that's a good TL;DR.   It's locked m by Samsung. It's not something that can be enabled by jailbreak.    Will it be enabled by Samsung? Probably not because their marketing team are a pack of sanctimonious fucking assholes!!   They had the opportunity to release it with lollipop, but chose not to.   Furthermore when you look into Samsung's cunty decision riddled history you can see multiple instances of them being arrogant fucking douchebags and keeping the latest hardware agnostic software tricks to the latest galaxy rendition only, e.g. Themes on the s6.   So I would not hold your breath.   I love Samsung products, but fucking despise the piss poor level of after sales software support.   Then you look at HTC who readily enabled raw to their one lineup..      Added. My first random :-)      The media server can be to blame, in your battery usage you may see "media" or similar.  This process is extremely buggy, runs often and crashes frequently.  Do you have media showing up?    I've removed this post as it's needlessly angry. You're right, they're both important events, is the apathy towards one and sympathy towards the other that's frustrating    We do, Reddit /r/NewZealand does talk about tppa a lot, but most of my friends don't even know what it means, and frankly don't care.  It's fantastic America has finally seen the light, and can serve as another shining example of equal rights. This will also serve to further embarrassment for those countries (Australia for instance) who are yet to offer their citizens the same!    Have you taken a nice photo recently?   Fuck I know the internet is anonymous, but did no-one in your sheltered life tell you "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all?" Of course not, you were probably to fucking busy burning ants with a magnifying glass.   Shut the fuck up if you don't appreciate someone else's effort.  Edit: that's a funky photo op!    This makes me so gutted Samsung aren't being sporting cunts and offering themes to s5 users.    Have a look at your screen modes, his may be set to dynamic?    Don't get me wrong, I'm arguing they're stupid, impatient and dangerous, but not an immediate threat to anyone.    Yeah nah I was going 60km/h prior to him pulling in front and slowing me to 40 ish.    I agree they're not an immediate threat, but if they do that ten times, they grow complacent about driving on the wrong side and eventually make a mistake while doing so..    I have an example: the lady that hit me recently, when she turned into the lane furthest from hers without looking, "you're the first person in years to turn at the same time as me" was her excuse and she honestly blamed me for turning at the same time as her despite the fact it's the law to say I can do so..    Yeah, but the quality of the boxes is very shit, they tend to freeze, and crash   Indeed. Made me miss the lights cause he felt like cutting me off.  It was frustrating as all hell.   The other two came ignored the yellow solid line, for what? To get their jollies off in scaring the shit out of anyone who came out of a driveway?   True.       So.. this is essentially a wee case study for how TPPA works.   Oh the irony is palpable.   Inspired by [this promotion by T-mobile](http://www.gsmarena.com/tmobile_now_lets_you_switch_smartphones_three_timaes_a_year-news-12794.php) "At any point, you can just swap your existing handset for another one that's part of the program. **You do have to give back your current model**, and it has to be in working order, but that's it."   They are slow, but my i9506, released Q3 2013 was just updated to 5.0.1 lollipop 2 years later, that's not bad!      I had to create [this](http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/6-25-2015/tCTpR5.gif) after you made me an nostalgic.. I couldn't not!      Well played. Well played indeed.   And now I have the BruuuutttGGG noise playing over and over and over in my head. And now it's Adam's smile afterwards.. and now I'm smiling. Thanks! :D      To be fair, cloud storage is quite cheap and/or microUSBUSB flash drives are pretty cheap these days. But I see what you mean.      Ok, so someone who regularly blows through stop signs goes through every stop sign, except this one because he's warned him.  He does the same thing tomorrow, expect this time he hits you with his car because he wasn't looking properly.   But that's okay because he wasn't caught by the police and taught a lesson to not blow through stop signs??  Your logic is flawed.       So I don't make my title a contender for /r/titlegore I'll put the whole story here.  Dude who ran down family walking dog.   Killed dog, made multiple attempts to run over the man as well.  Locked up in Hillmortons in Chch (ironically where his victim works..).  Declared medically sane, and fit to stand trial.   Denying all charges.   I hope he goes away for a fucking long time.      SKY!!!!!! DO NOT TOUCH THE VODAFONE BOXES.  Sorry for the yelling, I have not heard **anything** good about the Vodafone boxes. Ever. They both use different technology, one's provided via cable (Ex-TC) and the other via Satelite (Sky).  The Sky boxes are infinitely more reliable from what I've heard than the TC/Vodafone boxes.     There's noone else in my country with it installed. - New Zealand.   YMMV but that was adequate to get a crisp shot last night on my D7000 last night. (Of nothing but light pollution sadly..)  If the aurora's quite dim then you may need longer,  but iirc 15+ seconds will get you star trails which may or may not be desirable, personal taste here :)   ah 18mm at ISO 200, for 3 seconds should be enough. You can also use multiple exposure options in your shooting menu to combine exposures. (may produce star trails.)   TeHokioi what's your camera model/lens?       Unfortunately as someone who worked in an electronics shop for more time than I care to think about, 90% of repairs was some fucktard who dropped their phone in the toilet and thought it was covered by warranty.   If in doubt I always checked the moisture detectors myself (typically under the battery - white pads turn pink) before sending it away. If it was pink I warned them it was guaranteed to come back water damaged and they'd lose their bond. Noone ever argued with me that they hadn't got it wet!   Can I add (having gone to the TDR myself) that they are an absolute last ditch effort, and can **only be raised once you've raised a complaint with your telecom company.**   Ironically this minor rant is actually playing right into their marketing..   Blimey.  Bishopdale wasn't that bad, still needed a whole jug of warm water to get the door open though!    He really fucking does. Always support your theiving fucking mates before someone who employed you ay?      Fortunate, I was lucky enough to get away by 7.30 so little traffic, but very icy with little cars having warmed the road! So trade off really      A spider's venom is incredibly precious and hard to make for a spider, and it doesn't need to eat very often.   So it's not going to waste this incredibly hard to make venom on just 1 thing that has to eat or it will go to waste, it would rather use it on 100 smaller things as it needs to eat.   I saw at least 5 cars run red lights, lost traction half a dozen times, and saw some incredibly stupid things on my way to work this morning. So just take it easy!  And of course, if you do get in a crash, pics or it didn't happen. :D   That's stupendous hypocrisy, Dunedin has a world renown culture of drinking, and it's more than reasonable to presume your reigning fat cats are  more than a tad guilty of milking this "fun" culture in their advertising campaign, while adding to it in their own youth. But hey, whatever keeps then in power eh.   I figured a whole lot of drunk people would cause the issue where they were ejected from, rather than travel to other areas to play up. However that's true, and the issue with staggered closing times   My 2c:  Advertising isn't fixing that culture, in fact given the freedom of our brewery giants with advertising it's a stark contrast, we have "no more Beersies" coupled with some pretty hard hitting alcohol advertising about partying etc.   Ultimately you can't trust your customers to know when to stop, and pubs make money from selling you overpriced booze, so there's a conflict of interest there.   I wish I knew how to address things, but seriously New Zealanders like their booze, and have a deeply engrained drinking culture that's going to take some doing to unwind the recent rise in statistics around drunken assaults, and strain on emergency services from drunken tomfoolery.   I'm no idiot, there is always going a problem, and old people who make the law tend to have stupidly short memories as to what they did when they were young, and that hypocrisy is adding to the problem.    I'm surprised it's not the suburb which enacted the lock out that suffers though. But yes hopefully it doesn't serve as a precursor for what they wish to enforce here in Chch, I suspect it will be.      Yes, because HP new Zealand are also participating in the Step up challenge..    Honestly banner ads are far better than suggestive full screen advertising. Uninstalling to avoid having "find singles now" with an ass in my face (well screen) every few seconds.  	131
 With your mouth.   Ask him for a bump. Best friends forever.   That might work once, they'll just tell you to quit taking anything that triggers a positive, unless it's prescribed by a doctor.   You should probably consult the food pyramid to ensure your meal is a bit more nourishing.   I know practically nothing about synthetic cannabinoids. I'm curious as to which ones are most popular. Also, there's brands out there such as "Good Times" and "Bayou Blaster", does anybody know which chemicals are likely to be in these two brands? Thanks in advance.   USER NAME CHECKS OUT, MOTHER FUCKER   Just shoot you a quarter gram of meth and blow a fireball up in his grill, you heard?   You're right. That had to be said. We all needed to hear that. Thanks for sharing.   Kratom Connoisseurs, I do believe.   No.   Oh. Well, still, I think starting the day with a toilet jerk will do you good.   "I still have a hard time in the mornings"  That's called morning wood, son. Hit the bathroom for a quick toilet jerk and you'll be right as rain.   1)no 2) they won't kill you, but you'll wish you were dead 3) IV, snort, oral, probably sublingual, rectal.... but IV is truly the only way to go, when it comes to morphine. Words simply can't do the feeling justice. You really might as well just get some heroin, though. A lot better bang for your buck and it's practically the same shit. Morphine pills are fuckin expensive.    I think he thought you meant you take Suboxone daily, not that you're on the kratom sub daily.   The bags HS uses actually keep light from affecting the kratom over time. They're superior to the clear bags from MS.   FUCK YOU ASSHOLE   I think he's just saying you could've worded it differently, is all.   Your friend is pretty gangster.   Jam it up your dick hole   This sounds lie my nightmare.  So how was it packaged? Was it just powder in a baggie/container with no label anywhere and no paperwork of any sort to be found? Or did they actually label it wrong and trick you into thinking you got what you ordered?   I've argued with people about the "less water you use, the stronger the shot" ideology. It just doesn't make any sense. A quarter g in 10 units of water is going to make you just as high as a quarter g in 100 units of water. The amount of water you use can't possibly make a shot stronger or weaker, less water doesn't equal more dope. The only explanation as to why it may seem like it makes it stronger to some people (not me) is because 10 units of water injects faster than 100 units of water, therefore the quarter g hits you harder, since it's hitting you in a much shorter time span.   So this may be logical for some people who have trouble shooting, you know the ones.... after 7 minutes and 5 different holes in their body, they finally get the whole thing pushed in, split into thirds between injection sites lol.   However, I believe it is a bad idea for those people to only use 10 units of water, because time is not on their side, their rigs start to clot up with blood and the less water they start out with, the faster their shit is fucked.   It's actually funny, my friend (who's an anny cook) sat there and tried convincing me that less water means a stronger shot. You would think a cook would understand why it's not true. Although, this is the same guy that calls pseudoephedrine "pseudophetamine" and thinks that MSM has methamphetamine in it because the first "M" in MSM stands for "meth".   He was actually the baddest anny cook around, though. Just goes to show you how simple the shit really is to make, any retard can do it. Lol. He just had the technique down is all. He couldn't actually tell you why the reactions happened the way they did, or what was happening, all he could tell you was that you were gonna dry heave when you jammed it in your arm... and he was right.   Hey man. No problem. Do you need an address to send my reward to or do you just wanna hit me off with some BTC real quick? Lol just kidding bub. Good luck in your manhunt for these scumbags. I bet they even got little Vienna sausage wieners. Did any of the missing packages contain ExtenZe?    Have you tried red vein Sumatran, red vein Thai or red vein Borneo? Maha Kali stimulated me too and Hulu kapuas didn't have much effect at all. The first three I just mentioned are the best downers IMO.   Well, they're gonna learn the truth quickly, I'm afraid.   Dirty socks will get a whole BTC from me.   Korean linen is best linen.   So what happened at court? Did you get them good or what?   Listen, they can ban kartom all they want. They just better leave our kratom alone.   Hmm. I have a feeling this guy is headed to Herbal Salvation.   I have no sort of heart condition but when I'm abusing stims I can almost feel the damage being done. Just don't go slamming quarter grams of crank man. Take it easy.   Well, that's how many  they supposedly stole, anyway. Maybe they didn't want to tell them anything they stole that was a felony to possess. That's just pure imagination on my part though lol. It makes sense though that weed is the stuff they'd be stealing, since that's likely the only thing they could actually detect by sense of smell.   I remember Smokey's saying something about losing packages in Chicago. Is this the same place?  http://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/7/71/604084/postal-service-employees-charged-stealing-drugs-packages-ohare   Yes. That is correct. Also, we don't want no scrubs.   "Always good to take everything you read online, most especially Reddit, with a big grain of salt. "  Especially when you're reading reviews posted by a throwaway account. Ahem.   "4 hours of trial and error"  Hmmmm   wat   As other people said, kratom will help tremendously.  I've been through a lot of treatment programs, and they always tell you to never attempt to quit things like smoking or coffee or fatty foods in the beginning of your recovery. It makes sense. Everybody has a vice, you're concentrating on eliminating your benzo use which is far more important than any of your other problems right now. After you get a little sobriety under your belt, then may be a good time to look at your other addictions.     He's a Skype stripper   I spill half a gram on the floor within five minutes of getting up, son.   He's got the fire and the fury    The Maha Kali did the same thing to me, even at a smaller dose. I just decided it wasn't for me.   Good one.   I thought this subreddit was in favor of using research chemicals as a way to improve our lives. Why everybody hatin, bro?   A chronic and debilitating urge to have hot sweaty wieners slapped against his face.   Lol positive. I've been checking up on it every day. He changes it every day.   No. Look at his site right now. He said it was open for orders until Monday, and now he says he's still shipping stuff tomorrow. He also said on his site everything shipped yesterday and the tracking numbers were sent out this morning. I just checked the temp.pm I sent him Saturday because it was about to expire, and he never saw it, so I resent another one. That's why I'm assuming his email isn't working for me.   Could you imagine the scores of fiends that would congregate in the parking lots of Wal Mart if you could buy dope there? Stealing stuff to return for gift cards is already a huge problem for them, imagine how bad that would get. They'd have to have security guards with guns all over the place, whippin junkies' asses and shit. It would be pretty awesome.   They're on the shady vendor list. Do not recommend.   honk   Thanks man. I may be retarded.   Thanks man. IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY STARTS REALIZING HOW GREAT I AM.   I had a batch of fuel left over after a meth cook which could have had no more than half a gram of meth in it total. They weighed the fuel as a whole and charged me for possessing 56 grams of meth or some shit like that. I got 4 years for it.   How is this the only post calling this guy out?   I actually got a boner   Damn man. That was a pretty unrelenting kratom review.      I've done some research, and I've come across several services, such as Shared Coin, BitcoinFog, and Darkwallet. But when I look at reviews of each, it seems they both have bad and good things about them, and I'm having trouble getting a definitive answer. What's the best/most popular way to go these days?   Do I need to use my PGP program to read this?   That's funny. K-pins wreck me the hardest, they were always my fave, with Xanax taking a distant second. Valium and Ativan never did anything to me though. Like literally, I wouldn't even feel handfulls of them. Funny how that works. I used to love benzos, they were my third DOC, but I find that I don't need them at all as long as I'm not doing uppers. They just make me tired and depressed now, as you were saying.   Benzos make you depressed? Or it makes you depressed to not be able to take benzos?   Oh yeah, absolutely, the engine has 130k on it. I'm not sure why I referred to it as new.    Fuck Kratom Korner.   Ok, I have a code reader for a laptop, I'll try and see if it'll show me a code. Sort of a pain in the ass to have to carry around a laptop in the car lol but I'll do that and see if I can catch it.    My old lady just had a new engine installed in her car. Ever since then, it stutters. It'll do it going up hills mostly, when trying to accelerate, but it does it here and there on flat land too. I did some research, saw some stuff about catalytic converter and whatnot, I've basically ruled everything other than the engine itself out because it didn't do this at all before the new engine. My best guess so far is the EGR valve? The check engine light comes on here and there, especially when it's happening, but it goes back off. Thanks in advance.   You're supposed to swallow the etiz before you actually take a bite of food.   Lol I was just fuckin with ya man.  	66
    haha   "I CREATE LIFE!....and then destroy it"    i loved Cars!      I for one think i'm not alone in saying that if the whole John Connor thing was kept under wraps until the movie, my jaw would've dropped at the reveal. It might have even brought the film up a peg or 2 (i didnt mind the movie anyway im just saying) - thoughts? (no hate)   Chappie for me too, i was like "was that ok or bad?"    I'd actually wouldn't mind a sequel to Origins. I think since there's 5 years between Origins and Asylum there's plenty of backstories and origins to explore in a Origins 2. Which ones would you like to see?  I'd love to see Dick Grayson become Robin and have him (possibly) as a recurring playable side character and allow dual play to return from Knight but it would be a main gameplay feature. I think that would be potentially awesome!   What would you want to see? (no hate please - keep it friendly)    1. it was raining outside 2. get better comments :)      Deathly Hallows Part 2 - an emotional, well-made and EPIC conclusion to the series. One of my all time favorite movies!   I loved playing as Red Hood in the DLC for Arkham Knight. He was bad-ass and also killed people! If there was to be a whole game with him as the playable protagonist, i'd be down! Anyone else?  	12

 I agree. Names make things funnier. Somehow the more common and normal the name, the funnier something becomes, Richard.   Vitamin E oil in excess on the skin any time it will be / is stretching like pregnancy or bulking up in any way will reduce the appearance of stretch marks even before they start. My mom had 3 kids and no stretch marks and she swears by vitamin e oil (you can buy it in capsules from the drugstore).   Helps with sunburns also because it moisturizes your skin like crazy!

I think we're done here.    yay an ad   Still waiting on what kind of statistics you'd need to admit there is a discrimination problem. Is there any statistic you'd consider good enough?  By the way, your STEM example is incredibly hypocritical, considering you're badgering me to give proof for my discrimination claims.   What kind of data are you looking for exactly that will satisfy your claim? Doesn't seem like a huge leap to me.   There are links with statistics in the article, if you bothered to read it. I don't support this agenda and feel like this is the wrong way to address existing issues, but to claim there is no bias at all in the publishing industry and everyone is judged equally? Naive at best...   you're banned from the internet    My point is if your a good writer with a good story no one cares what gender you are.  Your point is incorrect                  I enjoyed it. It's a fun book   Grit lit is probably my favorite genre.    I didn't like it, but you may - *Life After Life* by Kate Atkinson   I don't think you understand what racism is   Attempts to rectify systemic injustices are not examples of racism themselves.   Good for you? Does not giving a fuck about social commentary include making sure everybody knows that and handwaving off people that do care?   pretty sure racial issues aren't an American only thing   As a reader of SF/F, I'd hope you'd know that it's a wellspring for bringing social commentary to the reader under the guise of something more approachable, not just robots and dragons. Race is a  huge part of a multitude of novels in the genre.   I love that this sub would rather discuss things like who dog ears pages in their books before allowing one topic on race to reach the front page of the sub      The article shows poll results...   The entire point is that reading is not a gendered activity       That still doesn't explain why it's supposedly so encumbant on fathers  Because you're a parent and it's your job to do the best you can raising your children? Taking care of one aspect of parenting doesn't get you off the hook for others, that isn't quite how parenting works.   I think the reason is because kids are sponges, and what you do as a parent they will see and mimic. Especially important if you are raising boys and never read to them - what does that teach them?  I agree with the article, the more kids see you reading the better off they will be. Plus, it's fun reading to your kids!               There are definitely gender biases and imbalances in the industry that need to be addressed. However, this is really not the way to address those issues. This isn't magical fairy land, the author must know there is no chance of what she suggests gaining any kind of traction. *Winds of Winter* is finally done? Sorry George, no men this year!   All this does is give opponents of the issue an easy target, angers an entire gender where a good amount are on your side, and doesn't help further progress on the actual issue at all. Boo this woman!   Pretty sure not a single person on Earth has even come close to making that comparison   Answers to 1,1,1,and 2: the library   I think personally I'd opt for reading the book   Feast of Snakes or The Gospel Singer are both great. Still going through his catalog myself. Car is one of my favorites   Or if you're into short stories,  *The Third Bear*.   Harry Crews   That's James Gunn   He specifically asked if the list is too "chick friendly" - it's even in the title. Pick another windmill pal   I finished the book, but hated *On the Beach* by Nevil Shute. Boring as anything, and some of the worst written, unbelievable characters I've read anywhere, particularly the women in the book.   Definitely, great book. Her writing is fairly unique I think, but the Goldfinch is like a modern day Great Expectations.   I wonder if someone will mention Catcher in the Rye   Reading challenges are good for getting into the habit of reading. Someone who reads 10 books a year will find it surprising how easy and enjoyable it is to read 52 if they simply set aside the time.  Once you're back into the habit of reading however, they are pretty much a dick measuring contest.      I've read a handful of books published in 2014, and I think the book of the year is Smith Henderson's *Fourth of July Creek*   Maybe next time he should just rape somebody, this sub would be much more accommodating to him   I'm confused as to where you think this happens? Please point me to a list that has "token recommendations" that spoil the quality of the list for diversity's sake?   Haven't heard of him, but I'm a big fan of southern gothic. Any comparable authors?   In the 1980s, Italo Calvino said in his essay "Why Read the Classics?" that "a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say" and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): "*Your* classic author is the one you cannot feel indifferent to, who helps you define yourself in relation to him, even in dispute with him."                        Maybe next time you shouldn't make an ignorant comment without expecting to be called out on it then   Life is not nearly as simple as you make it out to be. There are a multitude of woman's issues today even in the most civilized countries. Maternity leave policies are bad or nonexistent. Birth control policies are still backwards and woman are losing legislative ground. Violence against woman is a huge problem almost everywhere, and we can make strides to protect women better. Many portrayals of woman in the media are still harmful. The disproportionate amount of woman in STEM fields... this is just barely touching on the hotbed issues.  "Women can do all the same stuff men can" is a very narrow way of looking at things.   Feminism isn't about giving woman "more rights". Feminism is about making sure woman are being treated fairly - be it economically, culturally, or politically. To be "against" something as basic as supporting someone else's human rights and fair treatment is simply appalling.   you disagree with equal rights for women and men?   can't roll my eyes hard enough...   *A Feast of Snakes* by Harry Crews   Hurrrrr   The book was interesting but the end showed the author really had no clue what to do with the supernatural elements she set up.   Book was still alright, not bad for a first novel. Could have been a lot better   I just finished Fourth of July Creek yesterday, great book! One of the best I read this year. Other contenders:  * *Car* and *Childhood: a Biography of a Place* by Harry Crews  * *Less than Zero* and *American Psycho* by Brett Easton Ellis  * *A Confederacy of Dunces* by John Kennedy Toole  * *Hill William* by Scott Mcclanahan    Wait a minute, people compensating for lack of real life power by abusing what laughably unimportant power they do have in the virtual world?  Say it ain't so   My bookshelf has zero organization and a lot of books                        there is  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16284947-narcoland   What makes your book stand out in the massive influx of epic fantasy we are seeing now due to the popularity of *A Song of Ice and Fire*?         Sounds like you won't like it   They are by no means offensively bad, but I agree that Annihilation is the best in the trilogy. If you're curious I'd say pick them up.          *Car*, by Harry Crews. It's about a man who attempts to eat an entire car on stage. It's god damn awesome   I mean, it's fairly obvious that he will explain the terms to you if you read more than two pages. ..I think Paul even questions what the kwisatz hiderach and a gom jabbar are in his internal monolog. ...   as i play bowling   **The Third Bear** by Jeff Vandermeer and **North American Lake Monsters** by Nathan Ballingrud are both fantastic collections of weird/horror/fantasy short stories. Vandermeer is most well known for the Southern Reach trilogy but I feel like this book is actually his best work.  **Eyes of the Dragon** by Stephen King is also very good - if you really want to be picky, it has loose connections to the Dark Tower, but is very much a stand alone book. Much closer to traditional fantasy than the short story collections as well.   Don't let the Fifty Shades reference in the title scare you, Angela Carter is the real deal.      That's the consequences of raping someone. ..      Verbal threats/harrassment are not the same as someone disagreeing with you. They are very much capable of being life ruining. Something can still be bad, even if there are worse situations in the world - it's not a contest.   yes, refn is ripping off hotline miami, not the other way around               Lol. I have 50k in my bank account, but I'm unable to make a 7 dollar purchase in the Internet. Right. ..   domestic abuse is always good for a laugh!      This site is pretty bad and buggy.  - Very slow. Lots of bugs and mislabeled entries for books.  - Lacking many obscure and non mainstream books. The site doesn't even have an entry for *The Goldfinch* (or if it does, it's totally buried), which won a Pulitzer in 2014...come on.  - Seems to recommend the same books to everyone - Hope you like *Maus* and *The Far Side*, this site sure does!  I don't understand why I see this linked all of the time in this sub, Goodreads is miles better.      r/suggestmeabook   The Wallcreeper is one of the few novels I just hated reading the whole way through   I had a claim in for a 4th Rd rookie receiver off FA, but in the process put in bids for about 4 other wrs I was planning on withdrawing in the morning before the spin to mask the one guy I wanted. Wasnt able to log in to get rid of the extra claims, so now I picked up 5 junk wrs while dropping rookie talent including my second round this year and future center. Not happy. Am I screwed here?    Same here looks down   People love to bring up Lovecraft whenever a bigoted author is mentioned,  but they are just not the same. Lovecraft was raised during the nadir of American race relations,  the worst era of racism after the civil war.  His racism should not be ignored, but it should be judged according to the times in which he wrote his books.  Card actively campaigns against gay rights and has no excuse for his warped, hateful views in today's society.    I highly doubt most people are censoring themselves - more a case of thinking "Wow, that guy is a huge dick", and by extension losing interest in the book.  I know personally this is the case for me. If someone like Card wrote something I wanted to read, I'd still read it, just find a way to do so where I'm not monetarily supporting the author...   I do too. Good thing there's a multitude of both written by people that aren't bigots.    Lol  Guys why didn't I enjoy this book written for thirteen year olds   Hp lovecraft isn't comparable to card. Lovecraft's racism is awful, but also a testament to the times it was written. Card has no such excuse, and is not only a homophobe, but one actively involved in bringing his stance to the public.    I think not supporting a vile homophobe is a fine and respectable reason, even if you don't particularly agree. I read Ender's Game personally but totally understand OP'S views   An interesting interpretation of the book - [here](https://italkyoubored.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/american-psycho-maybe-not-the-book-you-think-it-is/). Not sure I agree 100%, but I think it goes to show that the book is more than just shock value.   The book is smart and funny. It mixes social satire, black comedy, and slasher horror films effortlessly. It's deeply layered and has commentary ranging from the obvious in capitalist corporate culture, to the more subtle in things like the AIDS scare in the eighties. I think it's one of the best books written in the past 30 years.   It's not exaggerating at all. Sorry you're too closed minded to consider that something containing gore might actually have literary value as well. But please, keep telling me how pretentious I am while you compare what I like with Kentucky Fried Chicken   Or a modern day masterpiece, however you want to look at it      What modern day directors are pushing the limits of cinema? Nicholas Refn? Gaspar Noe? I would love to hear your thoughts.   That's a silly metric for picking books   *A Visit From the Goon Squad* by Jennifer Egan. Wasn't perfect, but the book had a lot about it that I really liked.     	132
 It was on my first try. I closed the app and reopended it, was able to skip the intro.   Yeah. 70,000 koins for 3 gear cards? Fuck that rip off, I'll just collect the rewards at the end of a season. And no option to buy Revenant Sub-Zero or Revenant Jax without buying the 850 souls pack? There's a decent amount of kontent in this update to be sure (althought the challenges they speak of aren't here) but wow, making everything so expensive is a real good way to... ah whatever. Everything's been mega expensive in this game since launch anyway so whatever.  Anyone else notice they didn't mention the fact that the gold kombat pack is now more expensive as well? It's back up to the original 150 souls. Gotta squeeze that money out of us somehow I guess.         I suppose, lol. It just blows my mind when I hear some music on the radio and I say "Wow, this person/group has a record deal. I mean, someone paid them real money to make this and release it."      I've never suffered trauma and I don't have PTSD or high anxiety or anything like that. Therefore I have no opinion on the matter.   I never said all modern music is shit, just MOST of the shit in the charts. Boring repetitive lyrics and uninspired melodies rule the day. There's plenty of modern music I like, but most of the popular stuff really doesn't appeal to me.   Didn't CJ betray OG Loc though? Helped him get Madd Dogg's rhyme book but later chased him down and extorted a shit tonne of money out of him for releasing a song using Madd Dogg's rhymes?  You better check yourself before you wreck re-wreck yourself.   The first part is wrong, the second part is pretty much right, minus the stupid part. I wouldn't call someone stupid for their preferences, but if I think they enjoy shit then I'm gonna say it.  But then again, at the risk of sounding like a massive douche hipster, I find lot of mainstream stuff to be shit, music especially. [Am I so out of touch?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAuR5bkIlQ)    Shhhh! Spoilers!  Seriously though, regardless of what Smoke did, every time I see him in cut scenes it's like seeing an old buddy of mine, since I've spent way more time in his company early in the game than I have near the end of the game when, well, you know.   1. Maybe you don't want to spend all day running across the desert and a vehicle is too noisy.  2. Maybe you don't want to use the somewhat OP buddies.  3. Maybe you want to experience all the game has to offer.  4. Maybe you want to see if the hilariously unrealistic looking horse shit has been made to look less cartoony since we saw it last year.   Good isn't subjective though. Quality of a product is objective. Too few people realise that something you like and something that's good aren't always the same thing.  Example time.  I don't like Coldplay's music, but I recognise that they are in fact a good band.  I like one or two of Dizzy Rascal's songs, but I don't think his music is technically good.  See?  if a few million people think it's good, that probably makes it good  Nope, that's the appeal to popularity fallacy. The amount of people who like something has no bearing on the actual quality of the product in question. Millions of people (myself included) love McDonald's food, that doesn't mean the food is good, far from it, the food is bad, but we still like it.  Conversely, millions of people HATE iPhones, that doesn't mean iPhones are bad, on the contrary, iPhones are pretty fucking good compared to most phones on the market.  So you see, quality isn't subjective, but how people feel about a product is.    I would have done it myself lol.   Yeah. People en masse love to eat up shit in large quantities. Look at crap like X Factor and The Apprentice. The number of people who like something has no bearing on the quality of said product. If you think the only factor of success is quality of the product then you're mistaken. The right marketing can sell shit just fine.  I think I've gone too far now. I don't think Kanye's music is all shit, that would be unfair to say. I can definitely say his music isn't for me, and I can definitely say that I prefer most of my music to his, but then I'm slightly biased so that doesn't mean much.  But I can say with certainty that I believe his music (and his shitty attitude) don't justify his success.   Straight busta. And get yo' self a haircut. Embarrassing to be seen witch you.   I know they can notice, but they never seem to in the videos I've seen. The whole thing just looks absurd to me. I know MGS has always had zany moments but they were usually few and far between. This game seems to flip flop between being realistic and a cartoon every 5 minutes.  Don't even get me started on that fucking flying fist bullshit. No amount of saying "nanomachines" is going to get me to accept the absurdity of that.  Looks fun though.    I mean seriously how hard of a question could I have asked at 7 or 8. I don't even remember the questions I asked  I think the point is you asked questions at all. That's the trouble with religion, it all too often discourages questioning because when you start to question religion the whole thing hilariously falls apart.      Lol. You think the quality of someone's music has much to do with getting platinum. Most labels don't give a shit if the music is good, they care if the musician is marketable. The two are not entirely related.    I don't mean right behind the train. I could have been more clear. What most people do (myself included in the past) was ride beside the person we wanted smoke to shoot. What should be done is ride behind the enemy so they're on screen but close enough to shoot. Always worked for me.    Oh, that's what that annoying sound was?   I'm sure it is the user spurring the horse. But if you want to get somewhere quickly you'll be spurring like mad, as they guy in the video did.    Thanks to social media and apathy it's a losing battle. I keep going in and out of trying to correct people, but in the end usage is the arbiter final when it comes to language. If enough people are wrong enough for long enough they eventually become right. Just look at how the word literally is used by the youth these days.  I'm sure Shakespeare would tell me I'm doing English wrong, lol.    I've made some music on my phone that I believe to be better than some of the shit I've heard from Kanye. Admittedly I didn't talk over my music so I guess he got me beaten lyrically, even if loads of his lyrics are just shite.   He's a rap star. You speak as though rock stars don't exist any more.   Ah I see. No I didn't see it. I stopped acting destiny the minute I realised it was not so much a game, but a money making platform.    No. If you unexpectedly find yourself out of the house you just put the watch into power reserve mode.    And now that's the way I'll do it if I ever play it again.    I find it jarring and it pulls me out of it. At least it did in peace walker.    Yeah I know it's a real thing. But it's presented weirdly here. The way they hover then zip up quickly, the way no-one seems to notice it. It just pulls me out of the relative reality of the game.   Edit: Again, downvoted for voicing my opinion in a polite manner and not insulting anyone in any way. Well done reddit.   I just make sure I'm far enough behind the enemy I want him to shoot so the enemy is on screen and I've not had any trouble with this method.    So just because a smart watch uses electricity or cannot be considered good engineering or art? Is argue the apple watch is much more appealing to the eye than many dumb watches of the same price I've seen.  I get that some purple like old ways of doing things. But I'm not one of them, if there's a more modern (and usually better) way of doing something (like tell the time) I'm all up for it.    I got a stand from a third party. The cable discreetly fits into the stand and the actual charging disc is presented in such a way that I can just place my watch onto it and it'll charge while remaining the right way up. Imagine the way watches are displayed in shop windows, it looks like that when charging. The charge easily lasts a day, even with heavy use, I'd still charge every night though as it'll run out half way through the following day of you don't. Or just have another charger at work, but it's better to charge at night so you can actually use it during the day.    I'm glad I'm not alone with my line of thinking. Imagine riding a horse for 5 minutes in that game.  *mute*   I can make a beat on my phone, doesn't make me a rock god.    Yeah, I'm sure he's deliberately pretending to be an arrogant annoying cunt most people can't stand.    He's a rapper. He talks over a beat for a living. And he thinks he's gods gift to music.    Don't take the words of a delusional man too seriously.    Because he's an arsehole.    But hardly any of them do it as loudly and with as much self assurance as he does. Most do it for show, rap is 90% appearance anyway. Kanye genuinely believes he's god's gift to music, and thinks everyone needs to know.    Kanye is a big headed prick that needs a serious reality check. That's why people hate him.  He literally thinks he's god's gift to music, if not humanity. His music is largely shitty. His attitude is shitty. He is a shitty.    That's good then. I guess it's good that they're showing us all the different things you an do in the that you may not even think about if you were just playing it.    At least in red dead there was a variety of sounds john made while on a horse. It wasn't just the same "Hyah!" Every 2 seconds. I got sick of it in this video, if it stays like that in the finished game I'll probably avoid horses.    That's good to know, thanks.    That's all good then.    The Fulton system seems out of place to me. I know it's been in since peace walker but still, it just seems too comical given the circumstances it's usually used in. I find it a little jarring, which is a shame because it looks like it's used a lot in this game.    Seems awful that when you're riding a horse you have to listen to the same "Hyah!" Sound bite over and over and over again. I hope they fix that before release.    I've been avoiding all these 30 minute gameplay demos because I don't want the entire game to be spoiled for me. But I'm gonna cave and watch this one. Surely most of the game has been shown in demos at this point? So many trailers it seems.    Am I the only one who thought the Iron Giant was a so-so film? Everyone seems to hail it as some timeless classic. What did I miss?   I've only played with him for about an hour so far but yeah, if you win a match and you're far enough away from the opponent as to avoid the walking away while scanning the blade animation he seems to imitate his opponent's laugh. I've only heard him laugh though.   I'm not telling you what to do. I'm not telling Citadel_CRA what to do either. I'm just letting him know I disapprove of people trying to make funner a word. Which I'm allowed to do. If you disagree, that's cool, I won't hold it against you or anything.  It's all opinions man, isn't that what reddit comments are all about?      I used to have trouble too. Once I realised he can only his enemies when they're on screen the mission became infinitely easier.   Downvoted for using "funner" like it's a word.   I used to feel the same until I realised I was the one in the wrong. I used to pull up along side the train because that would make sense. The trick is he can only hit enemies that are on the screen. Once you know this fact the mission becomes insanely easy. I always have the Vagos killed before the train enters the tunnel these days.  Edit: Downvoted for letting people know how to do the famously hard mission easily? What the fuck?   Wow. It's like playing the PS3 version again.   Wat?   Well, if the only reason you buy a watch is so you can sell it later for a good price then I guess you won't want a smart watch. I don't have a watch because it will hold it's value, I have a watch because it does cool things.   You only need to buy a smart watch every few years if you want to keep using all the nifty extra features that a smart watch can do (which you'll obviously want to do, but is by no means necessary).  If you don't buy a new watch after 3 or 4 years and it stops being able to do the fancy stuff you're still left with a nice looking watch that tells the time, same as if you bought a dumb watch, only you got 3-4 years of smartness out of it.   I woulnd't pay the money for one, mine was a 30th birthday present. It's just cool. I love the way the screen is blank until you raise your arm to check the time, then it lights up. Also being able to create and send text messages/hold phone conversations using your watch is futuristic as fuck. Joe 90/Jetsons futuristic.  Plus I've still not seen anyone else wearing one, so I guess the exclusivity is nice, if you're into that sort of thing.  The watch is also basically a remote for your phone. If there's any video or audio playing you can play, pause, or skip tacks using the watch.  When I'm walking down the shops I can put my headphones in and just say to my watch "Hey Siri, play Muse" and it'll do just that. Or just saying "Play random music" is pretty cool too.  If I'm playing games and I get a text I might miss it because I use a gaming headset, but with the watch I don't miss texts because I get a subtle tap on the wrist telling me I have a notification. I can then glance at my watch and read the message without having to pick up my phone, unlock it, then read.  If you're in a quiet place the voice recodnition software is flawless, easily the best I've ever used. Outside in the city, well, you might as well text on your phone.  Overall I wouldn't say they're quite worth the asking price, yet. More apps are being developed daily, but like I said, mine was a birthday present and I love it. One word to describe the Apple Watch, cool.   This is the first time I've seen one in the wild since I saw that video telling me that such a thing existed. Upvoted for use of interrobang.  Side note: Chrome doesn't recognise the word interrobang, lol.   I just take my watch off every night anyway, so nightly charging isn't an issue for me at all.    You need to re-buy smart watches every few years  Source?   I hate it when I check the time and someone says "I'm sorry, are we keeping you?"  I'm like: Uh, no. I just wanted to see what the fucking time was you tedious prick.   Do you take your watch off at night when you go to bed? That's when you charge it.    garmin vivofit  Those are some nifty features. Shame it's ugly as hell.   Then they won't be buying one, just as they won't be buying a $350 dumb watch.   Do you take your watch off when you go to bed at night? I did with my dumb watch, as I now do with my smart watch. The only difference being that now, the stand I put my watch on charges the watch while I sleep. This whole having to charge your watch complaint is entirely redundant unless you NEVER take your watch off.   No-one needs an expensive anything, but some people want them.    What's gonna happen when my watch doesn't get updated for gmail, gps, and any other useful function?  Then you got 2 good years of fancy watch uses, now you can go back to your phone and you're still left with a cool watch that tells the time. You could probably still make calls and send texts using it too.    They look at things like the history, the craftsmanship, the details of the finish, the innovations, the complications, and of course, the brand itself.  Can all these things not be appreciated with smart watches? Ok, maybe the history can't, yet, but I couldn't care less about the history of the company that made my watch, that doesn't affect my usage of said watch.   I don't get it. People seem fine with paying $400+ for a watch that does nothing but tell the time, yet turn their noses up at a $400+ watch that tells the time, contains a calendar, can tell you the weather, can play games, can access social media, is basically a remote control for any audio/video playing on your phone, is supported with OS updates, manage emails, has maps and can direct you to a destination via subtle taps on the wrist signalling when to turn left or right, can access photos on your phone, can show you the stock exchange, and CAN MAKE CALLS AND TEXTS LIKE THE FUCKING JETSONS!  It also looks cool as hell IMO.   Or, you could buy a smart watch, use all the fancy features a dumb watch doesn't have for at least a couple of years, then if your watch is outdated by a new OS (unlikely since you can update a watches OS too) then you're still left with a watch that tells the time, just as you would a dumb watch.  As for a "horrible" battery life. I always took my old watch off every night and put it on my bed side table, I do the same with my smart watch, only now it rests on a charging stand. The battery life is not an issue.    It makes no sense  Welcome to the world of religion!   I'm surprised some people never noticed the giant ship that makes noises when he does a brutality. I love the way he laughs as he walk away, so badass.   I really wish they'd given him some lines at the beginning of fights. I'm really disappointed that the DLC characters all have only one costume each, and their dialogue is seriously lacking. I know Jason can't talk so he gets a pass. Tanya's dialogue usually boils down to:  Tanya: [Enemy's name.] Enemy: Tanya! Tanya: [a line that just someone's name]   This is just ramping off a mound of sand/rocks. If you watch the video you'll be able to see where it is. It's near the prison.  http://youtu.be/gfsKirun0ss   I'm capable of understanding that people like it. I'm just saying that I don't.    Totally worth it if you like MGS.       Yes, they're the special editions you mentioned. MGS3 even has Metal Gear 1 and 2 included, so it's really 5 games in one!   Ah, now you've given me that sage advice my mind is at rest.    It's near the satellite dishes in Sandy Shores. Me and some friends had fun trying to land our cars in the dishes.    That's different. French Fries may not be French, but their name is indeed French fries.  A barrel roll is not an aileron roll. To say it is is to be wrong.    Then you'll be wrong every time you call something that's not a barrel roll a barrel roll.    And I agree.   WAAAAAA!!!!!   I don't want to buy a shitty hand held system just to play one game though. And as I've mentioned in many other comments I did get the HD collection, and was thoroughly disappointed with how crap Peace Walker was.    I can over it, for the most part. It doesn't bug me too much when playing Ground Zeroes, but I'll never forget/forgive kojima for fucking up so royally.    Me too, until they released the HD bundle on PS3 a year later that included MGS2, MGS3, and MGS Peace Walker, all in HD.    Nearly interchangeable, but not quite. If one pilot said to another "Do a barrel roll", but he did an aileron roll, there could be dire consequences.   It's not a bad style per se, but when you compare it to the cutscenes from any previous MGS game they're an embarrassment. I didn't know a storyboard was going to tell the story before I bought the game. When they started I was like "I really fucking hope this is just the intro and the whole game's story isn't told this way."  And so I was disappointed from the get go.    Yeah, it's all my opinion. I'm not tying to say that these things are objectively better in previous games, just how I feel about them.  And you mentioning technical limitations takes us back to my initial point. If the game has to be crippled mechanically because it's being released on a hand held then maybe just make it a console game and fully realise the glorious vision, and save the hand held for some non canonical game like MGS Acid.    But the border detailed in the diagram kind of sort of almost looks like a barrel shape, nearly.    Keifer did do a good job, even though in Ground Zeros he constantly sounds like he's in a recording booth, sound design dropped the ball on that one IMO. Sounds like he's in a small box every time he speaks.   My point is they could have replaced Hayter with anyone and it would have been worse, because Hayter's voice is Snake's. It's like if Dan Castellaneta was dropped from the Simpsons cast and was replaced by someone who did a voice that sounded nothing like Homer's. Change an iconic voice and I lose all connection to the character that had been built up over the years.   MGS1 is the only one where I felt the character moved sluggishly. After playing the first 3 Resident Evils and the first 3 Tomb Raiders the movement in MGS2 and 3 was anything but tank like. I never felt like the characters were uncooperative in their movements in MGS2 and 3.    I know making a MGS game on a hand held was inevitable, they already did it with Acid. My gripe comes from the fact that it was canon. I felt like I was missing out on the latest chapter in my favourite game story, because that's what WAS happening.  Sure they released it later on consoles but it was still a shitty mobile game, one that I didn't bother finishing because it was such a step back from the previous games. They could have made Acid 2 and 3 for all I care, I wouldn't have been missing out on a brand new fully featured sequel to (at the time) my second favourite game.    Yeah I bought that, I got to play Peace Walker... eventually. Was disappointed greatly by it.    Here's a list of things PW did worse than previous games, in my opinion.  Graphics  Cutscenes  Story  Characters  Shooting Mechanics (ok, they were better than in MGS 2, I'll admit that)  Incredibly tedious base building  Story separated into individual missions like an arcade game  Lack of any cinematic feel  Weird boss fights set in obviously-only-existing-to-support-a-boss-fight arenas  I'm sure there's more, but it's been 3 years since I played PW and I don't remember it all that well. I don't think there's any aspect of PW that improved over previous entries.    What would you call the move if done in, say, a car? It's still not a barrel roll.          True. But I think this is one of those instances of "When enough people are wrong enough for long enough, they become right." That seems to be how language evolves.  Like when most people say laminating they actually referring to encapsualting.   What was an accident?   This STILL happens? Wow.   I still think it's dumb to cut out a huge portion of your fanbase (i.e. everyone who didn't own a PSP) of the franchise. I wouldn't care if it weren't canon like MG Acid. But to make a canonically accurate direct sequel only available to a tiny portion of the people who love the series, and also make it easily worse than the two previous installments just bugged me for years.   True. But then again I don't even really consider this to be the Snake I know and love since they dropped David Hayter. Dave IS Snake.    keep in mind that it's meant to be a psp game so there are a lot of stuff that might seem shitty compared to older games like mgs2 or 3  This really bugged me.  Konami: Let's make a direct sequel to the best MGS game to date. And let's make it canon! And let's gimp it by making it a handheld title so it's worse than the previous 2 games in every respect.  Second biggest disappointment in gaming for me.   I got Peace Walker with the HD collection on PS3 and was hugely disappointed, worst MGS game I've played.  The way the story was presented was a joke. No actual cutscenes (something the series is famous for) and instead they gave us shitty scratchy line scribbles, thanks Kojima. That totally ruined the whole experience for me. Then the gameplay was pretty shitty too. Coming off the back of the amazing MGS3 I was so happy to finally, after years of thinking I'd never get to play it, play PW. And wow was it a step backwards. You can say "But it was a PSP game so you can't expect much." or something like that, and to that I say they shouldn't have made a PSP MGS then, if it's going to literally be a step back in the series in every respect.  Did not finish, read the story on the wiki, probably won't go back to it, bad MGS game IMO.   I missed him the second I started playing Ground Zeroes.  Snake is dead, this is as bad as when they changed the actor who played John Connor from T2 to T3. Can't connect with the character, or rather I should say the connection has been severed.   Wasn't he trying to escape the "honour" of the title Big Boss because of his mission in MGS3? I figured he went back to being called Snake because it was his "name" before he **[MGS3 SPOILERS]** killed The Boss.    It seems like a lot of the ideas they're expanding in MGSV were ones that started off in peace walker.  Probably because MGSV is a sequel to MGS Peace Walker.      Got any links to share?   I know very little of the situation. For obvious reasons they're not discussing the details of the firing.  From what I can piece together from the backs of packets of mustard it seems people are more upset about the way the firing was handled (or not handled), rather than the firing itself. They have no notice to other mods or something. I think this is just the latest in a long list of reasons people have to hate Ellen, someone is not heard of until the previous debacle happened.  Luckily I'm currently down the Winchester having a nice pint waiting for this to all blow over.     Glad I could help.    I know you don't want to, but trust me, it's for your own good.    I don't read the comics, so I thought you were on about the actual blood code lmao.    I never said you couldn't ask for him in this game. You said you wanted some Spawn action, I told you where you can find it. I wasn't diminishing your request or coming at you with any attitude. Chill out and perhaps don't read attitude into comments that contain none, you'll be happier that way.    Noob Saibot is all I want.  But if I have to choose, I'd say:  Noob Saibot.    Go play the Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2, he's in that.   Those are great ideas, sincerely.   I used Spawn in Soul Calibur 2. He was the most boring of the 3 guest fighters by far.   Tanya though.   A, B, A, C, A, B, B.      I started out using Unbreakable because of the sweet ice mask. But as soon as I realised Grand Master  was simple a better version of Unbreakable I made the switch and never looked back.  I do miss the ice mask over the dumb medallion, but the message is clear, there's no reason to ever choose Unbreakable Sub-Zero in MKX.   This sub is the worst I'm subscribed to for random downvotes. If it ain't a sexy cosplay or some new crazy combo you can be sure people will be out in force with their downvotes.   I hate the way Sub-Zero seems terrible for combos compared to pretty much every other character in the game. I laugh when people call me a spammer for using a the klone a few times (a lot).  They're all like: "Spamming scrub!"  And I'm all like: "I'm using the tools provided to Sub-Zero, sorry I can't 40% meterless mid screen like [insert most other characters] can."   Hmm, perhaps.   Whenever I see characters busting out mega long combos I cry a little that Sub-Zero has fuck-all combos that go past 32%.  I mean, 46% METERLESS? OP much?   We'll see.      Didn't this come out starring Jim Carrey, and wasn't it really shit?   Enter Konami.    It's actually staggering how little I are about all this. The sooner normal service is resumed the sooner I can actually enjoy visiting reddit again.     Does anyone even know what Victoria did to get fired?  Downvoted for asking a question. Gotcha.    So it's a case of: "We don't like the way this organisation we're volunteering our time to is treating us. So instead of, I don't know, us leaving this site because we're dissatisfied with the way it's managed,  we're going to make it as unusable as possible and hope the site goes under. And fuck anyone who just wants to use it as is."  Gotcha.   How am I contributing to you supposedly losing the right to free speech? Surely making subreddits private and removing places where people can speak is harming that right more than me not giving a fuck about some woman being fired.    Wait until NRS gives you the skin. They can't not do it now the other ninja all have their klassic skins.         They really do. The amount of detail is much improved, there's way more foliage and the grass isn't just a flat blurry texture anymore. Most notable though is on the PS4 version the city doesn't struggle to load when you're going mega fast, on the PS3 version that was common place. And the frame rate is usually a steady 30fps on the PS4 version, the PS3 struggled to reach even 30.  Long story short the PS3 was barely powerful enough to run GTAV, and that was with low detail compared to the PS4 version.    Something on the Mega Drive I'd imagine. The first one I can remember though it Tony Hawk's Skateboarding on the PS1. Trying to beat a top score on one of the levels. Wow, that was the first time I think I experienced genuine rage at a game.  Like real, actual rage.   Layman's Terms/TL;DR version of the ramifications please.   I keep hearing how good the DLC for New Vegas was, never got any of it though. I did get all the DLC for FO3 and enjoyed most of that.   Yeah, looks that way. If it is a direct sequel to 3 it stands to reason that water has been purified, allowing communities to thrive more easily, and therefore be more populated and perhaps more technologically advanced.   I think the 3 copies of Fallout 3 I currently own will suffice, thanks.   Not a lot I could do about that. I saved the pictures from the socialclub website, and this was as big as they came.   I'll have to take your word for it, lol.   Click to enlarge.   Sometimes it seems like they don't really care if the game works properly, given the amount of shit that's gone wrong since launch.   Thanks. I should do some more on PS4 version sometime. These photos were taken over a year ago.      These are the teams I rotate through on faction wars:  Bronze:  Lin Quei, Shirai Ryu, Monk  Silver:  Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Farmer Jax  Kano, D'Vorah, Reptile  Jax Briggs, Sonya Blade, Kenshi (sorry)  Klassic Kitana, Ermac, (waiting for another silver to join them)  Gold:  Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion  Stunt Double Johnny Cage, Possessed Kenshi, Sun God Kotal Kahn (sorry)  Warlock Quan Chi, Assassin Kitana, Raiden  Venomous D'Vorah, Injustice Scorpion, Bojutsu Kung Jin  Demolition Sonya Blade, (need Cassie or A-List Johhny), Balanced Kenshi (sorry)  I also just got Grand Master Sub-Zero and I plan to team him up with Hat Trick Kung Lao and Cryomancer Sub-Zero when I eventually get those.  All the gold cards were attained from gold kombat packs.   I really need a load of koins. When was the most recent koin challenge?   I maxed out the x-rays on my first gold team (Ninjutsu Scorpion, Shaolin Kung Jin, Inferno Scorpion) but never them because of all the power drain specials out there. So now I just upgrade character's first and second specials and leave it at that, since they're mega powerful anyway.  Is there any good reason to blow money on upgrading x-rays?   The answer is NOT.      Upvoted for the word gimbal.    [SENBAZURU!](https://imgflip.com/i/njv23)   **Man Wins Lawsuit After Neighbor Shotgunned His Drone**  That title. This is the world we live in right now.   Well, there's 10 unfunny minutes I'll never see again.   True, but they have story and dialogue, and a reason to be out in the wastes AS WELL AS picking up junk. Going out just for junk picking is the part I'm probably going to pass on.  Probably.      Running around picking up junk doesn't sound that fun to me. Doing quests is better.   But will they give us an encumberance limit that will accommodate the all the crap we'll need to be picking up?   Only in America. People in the UK tend to say one hundred AND twenty, or four hundred AND fifty nine. Americans seem to leave out the and altogether.   I also know that if you hold DOWN after throwing blanche (and after two interactions) she does a much better brutality.  Thanks for the info.   Yeah you can mute mid game in COD. But when you're playing a tense games of Search and Destroy and some moron joins who thinks people want to hear his shitty tinny music it can cost you the match sometimes.    you should have the option to mute people when you are playing  I've been saying this for years now. More games need an option to auto mute everyone by default, COD needs it badly.   It's totally annoying. I just go into a private party, that seems to stop their annoyances.   Would like to see.   Damn.    In England?   Ah. It makes sense to me now. Thanks for clarifying.    If GTAV wasn't sold out when I turned up to pick up a copy then Fallout 4 won't be. I don't think I've ever gone to buy a game on day one that was sold out.   Running into an immovable object is a real good way to get blown up. The trick is to approach from below, just getting to the top at stalling speed, then you don't need to slow down to land.   Why pre-order though? I'm just going to walk into my local GAME shop and buy it.   That's not flying, that's falling with style.   People still play Dying Light? I enjoyed it but never finished it for some reason. Haven't heard anyone mention it in months.   Same thing happened to me yesterday. Someone said if you uninstall then reinstall it should fix it.   It's not that hard to land a plane up there.   I don't get it. I know this that show full house. What does it have to do with generic brands and why is it funny?   I'm already bored of this game. It was great for the first week, but now I've got 97 dwellers and all rooms unlocked besides the Nuka cola one there really isn't anything left for me to do.    Anyone know when pred drops?   Too late. It hurt. The door was spiked you see.       Yeah, I just had to get it off my chest.         Isn't that modifier for infinite meter?   Or when Sub Zero uppercuts the forzen opponent's head clean off then tells them to "Feel the chill of despair".   I literally don't understand any of the comments I've read here. Something about Game of Thrones?   Skyrim.   I didn't know. Not everyone keeps up to date with all the upcoming content. I didn't know about the infrared skin until today either.    I don't like the way the article claims the Jurassic World is a reboot to the original when it's actually a sequel.    Well that's just awesome then.   	198

 Just think, to today's teens, the 90s music is as far away from them as the 70s music was for me. The first Iraqi war is as far away from them, as Vietnam was for me. The fall of the Berlin Wall is as far away from them as the Moon landing was for me.   Where can I get Catholic shoes? BTW. 1996 called, they want their slang back.   Nobody has "came back from the dead".  what's your point?   Show me an EEG and an EKG that are flatline.  Prove it medically.  When "miracles" are the cited source, PROVE IT!   I've seen a lot of shit on Saliva.  Doesn't make it true though.  (and I've seen some wild shit).   I had a seizure and remember this:  "We're taking you to the hospital"  "Take off your clothes."  "Strip.  Chain too."  "QUIT MAKING ME DRUNK!"  "Follow my finger"  "Sup?"  That's it.  When I was halfway there, I don't remember much at all.  Other than I almost decided to fight the doctor because I thought he broke into my house.  I never thought I would get ID'ed by my dog tags, but I guss I was laying on my wallet.  Good thing I have them.   I wasn't trying to kill myself, and I don't think I'm fat and ugly because I'm fat, and if I only weigh less I'll be better looking.  I was just feeling like shit, so I didn't eat for a while, and then once a week passed and I was feeling OK again, I was waiting for the "I'm hungry" signal again to eat, but it never came.  Hence 19 days with no food, and ending up in the hospital for seizures.    All my step mom, (that is basically my mother since she and my father raised me since I was 2), was "Why do you always have to learn things the the hardest way possible, I have tried to tell you numerous times about the importance of eating, but no, you had to go get yourself hospitalized for starvation."  That didn't make me feel very good.  Another friend besides the one who threatened to tell her mom told me that she has a room that I can move into and if she needs to treat me like one of her kids, she will. :(  I never realized how many people cared what I do, even if I did it completely unintentionally, and didn't intend on killing myself through starvation.  It's not like I intended on passing out in the middle of WM and being hauled off to the hospital.  My truck was still in the WM parking lot when I was discharged, and I left the windows down and the keys in the ignition.  Yes, my truck was still there, (but the interior was wet because it rained).  Thank dog my seats are leather, I was just able to wipe it off and sit down to drive it away.    I don't think I have anorexia, but yes, I have 2 appointments with mental health professionals, an appointment with my physician, and now I have to take Keppra, and make an appointment with a neurologist because I had a seizure. :(  One good thing about Keppra, my hand tremors have stopped, and now I don't have dry heaves in the morning when I wake up, so it is doing some good. :)   Nobody who has had "Near Death Experiences" has died.   Yeah, you get high out of your mind by a DMT dump as your brain is dying, then you have euphoric pleasure and everything is awesome, (or intriguing, or scary), and then you die.  Show me a person who has a flat EEG and EKG, and came back from the death, and I'll show you ET.  Medical proof needed.  Thier body must have assumed room temperature.  (complete death).  "Near death" is not "death".  I was "near death" when I collapsed because of starvation.  I didn't see shit.   So have I, it's called Salvia Divinorum 20x extract.  Want to be transported to a different planet?  I have some shit that will take you there for about 20 minutes.  Still doesn't make it real though.  (PSST:  DMT dump; your brain gets you high to make death pleasurable).  Hell, I have a KILO of it.  I can send you so far out, you forget what Earth even is.  Does that make drug-induced psychosis real?  Of course not.  [Mystery of Death Solved: DMT is the Key ](http://wondergressive.com/death-solved-by-vestigial-gland/)   Wal-Mart.   The first two things in your last paragraph did happen.  My friends are pissed off at me and concerned.  One is threatening to tell her mom who is a refugee from the Viet Nam war.  She'd be pissed off because she fled that shit, and here I am in the USA doing it to myself.    I've already seen the documentaries on TV, (I'd leave too).  I really don't want to hear a first hand account of them boiling bark just to make soup so they can eat *something*.  She says if I get much worse, she's going to tell her, and I'll likely get forced to eat. :(   I sort of have to.  I got prescribed Keppra to prevent seizures.  :(  I have to make an appointment within the next 14 days.  A good part about the medicine is that the shakes in my hands since I've had forever, and my dry heaves that I've been having in the morning for the last decade are now gone.  :)   I felt like shit for a week, so I just didn't bother with it since I felt like if I ate, whatever went down would come up. Then after a week, I felt OK, and I wasn't hungry, so I just didn't eat. I figured I would eat when I felt hungry, (like I usually do). That hungry feeling just never came, so I didn't eat. Wrong decision. I had to get IV feed for a day because I physically could not eat for the first day. The second day, I tried eating, and tried to eat a cup of clam chowder, a small saucer of apple sauce and a soda. I couldn't finish it. The day of discharge, I was eating a normal sized meal for a 12 year old, (half a plate of spaghetti), but still got full. I still can't polish off a whole can of denty moore's beef stew. I can only eat about half of it.  Now my friends are pissed at me, and one is threatening to tell her mom who is a Viet Nam refugee because she outran that shit, and here I am "in the land of the plenty" doing it to myself.  She'd be pissed, and give me a first hand account of how bad it was there.  I've seen the documentaries, (I'd leave too on an inner tube), so I really don't want to hear a first hand account of it.

I was recently in the hospital because I had a seizure in WM, (turns out you can't not eat for 19+ days and expect to function normally), and collapsed to the floor.  I remember getting batteries, standing up, and then waking up in an ambulance.  Then passing out again.  Then getting told to strip in the ER and put on a gown, (my chain too).  Then "you make me feel drunk", and then waking up in a hospital bed.  Did I have any "OOBE", or anything between those periods of consciousness?  Nope.  Nothing.

Then when entering your service area, you had to enter ANOTHER code, turn your phone off, and back on again, and now you're not roaming anymore, so it's only $1.00/min.

The format was (011)+(country)+(area)+(phone).  So if you were in England, and wanted to call Moscow ID, it would be 011+1+208+882+4571.  But if you're in Colton WA, (since it is in the same country, it would just be 1+208+882+4571.  There also used to be other trunk codes such as 00 to relay by satellite. Cellular phones, (for domestic calls), automatically insert the 1, so you don't have to.  Remember station to station calls?  $2/min in the 90's.  Hell, I bet you're too young to remember long distance, and 10-10-xxx codes dialed before the number. :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdS0cwsSQOE  They actually still exist for international calls:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTu7rn9oCAM   How about TWC?   Dude has a friend who found out, and her mom is from viet nam, and not only outran the war, but also starvation.  She'd be pissed off if she heard about the dude being too lazy to cook "in the land of plenty" and emanciating himself like was common in viet nam during the war when they had no choice.  Dude doesn't want friend's mom to find out.   But why an IV drip of saline and nutrients because for the first 24 hours the dude can't physically eat at all, (but somehow still has to shit because of the IV feed), (and needs help to the john because he's too weak to walk by himself), and not allowed out of bed unattended for 2 days).  And why did when one of his friends find out is she threatening to tell her, (not the dude's), mom [who is a Viet Nam refugee] exactly what's he did to end in the hospital, and is she going to hit him?  Dude's already seen Viet Nam on TV, and doesn't really want to hear first hand accounts of it.   And then when human gains consciousness, he can only eat 1/2 cup of clam chowder, a small saucer of applesauce, and half a soda before being "full" to the point of not being able to physically eat any more; but does better the second day and can eat a normal sized meal for a 12 year old; even though he's a 32 year old man?   Any official one for 10166 yet?      Sweet!  When is it advisable to sfc /scannow ?    So, you're saying I won't have to worry for a while? :)  And by that time, Win10 will likely be old anyhow?    I prefer the 70-95 era.  I don't like the modern trash on the radio at all.  I listen to classic rock because it's the most enjoyable for me.  I don't like the talk hosts, but the songs are awesome. :)   Frisbee golf, tennis, and swimming competitions.  For the elderly folks, just a nice tree with some shade, and some playing cards.  BYOB.   Yeah, but if it's going expire, then why stay with something that will die?   It only really disturbs it if you don't mulch-mow.  If you bag, you won't build up the turf and recycle the nutrients into the soil.  For the healthiest lawn, mulch.  Also, Don't mow in the same pattern twice.  http://lawncare.about.com/od/plantnutrition/a/The-Benefits-Of-Mulching.htm   At this point, once RTM is released, (wow, that's redundant), might as well either just go buy a Windows 10 lisence, or switch back to Debian.  (or wait for the crack).   We already are.  We are time travelers right now at the rate of 1s/s. :)  Unfortunately, it's a one way trip.  Want to "time travel into the future" beyond everybody else?  It's just physics.  Approach c, or orbit a black hole.  Unfortunately, there's no way back.  http://i.imgur.com/I7UjXwF.gif         It still works, so why change it.   I actually still use all of that technology.   It's taking forever and a day to download.   Weed.      And there is always a natural explanation behind the "supernatural".   He's found sleeping with a half eaten burger and a soda, and passed out behind the wheel.         Isn't there a master reset jumper on it?  My desktop has one, (duh), but my laptop from 2009 does too.          It would, if we EMPed it first, then sent in ICBM MIRV's :D Or you know, just leave them to their own devices. Fuck 'em   Why didn't you just pull the BIOS battery? Leave it out for 30 seconds, and put it back in? Its easy.   Gave them blankets with smallpox virus...  False.

Then full out nuclear war.  *"Strange game.  The only winning move is not to play"*  **--: WOPR, on the movie WarGames**   The American population would soon forget that they even exist, and ISIS would form their own nation state, just like every other nation state borders were formed.  Through war.         Reddit has a circle jerk orgasm of sadness, and /r/politics will be filled full of news exclusively about him for a week.  Then he'll be forgot about, and they'll go to sucking clinton's back dick. It would get a mention on the news channels, but nobody would really give a shit about some old geezer socialist having a heart attack.   That's why they come with cargo reention straps.  If you strap down your cargo, (properly secure your load), then there is no increased danger. Anything not stapped down will become a flying object and potentially lethal.  It doesn't matter if you're in a 89 Mustang, or a 1997 Blazer LT.  I got injured by my sub flying forward in my 89 mustang, because I didn't have it secured down.   I don't care if you're a space jew that stole all the moon money.  But if you don't trust Wikipedia, here you go:  https://books.google.com/books?id=OfPOBAAAQBAJ pg=PT134 dq=Islamic+conquest+of+Persia hl=en sa=X ei=15adVebWNo3soAS837SYBg ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage q=Islamic%20conquest%20of%20Persia f=false   I was on the tractor because the fields aren't going to plow themselves, and yes, I did fix the fence.  I fucked up, so I had to fix it.  It was just the property line, so I decided to "do it later"  Um yeah, 2 hours later when my dad found out.  I didn't get any punishment beyond having to fix the fence there.    I wasn't let allowed anywhere near the torch for a year but I did get hit there.  I deserved it.  I'm never using a torch near a dry field again.  After seeing how fast fire spreads, I won't even light my cigarette in the field, because one careless spark, and the whole fucker goes up in flames.  Of course, it does help that not at 32, I kind of learn a life time of lessons on shit not to do.   Um, yes it was.  Read your history.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania         Muhammed was just trying to "spread the word" on God as he understood him.  It was his followeres that were the problem.  I don't remember where I read it, but they were very advanced for the time, and there was a proposal to build the the Suez Chanal almost 1600 years before it was actually built, and shut down because it would be a military risk if actually constructed.  The ME used to be the center of science and development, then the age of enlightenment happened, and Europe took over  https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Suez_Canal   He actually hijacked the existing Moon god Allah, and used it for his own purposes, so he had a captive audience at the time.  (ME peganism).  Once it was "revealed" that "The Moon God" was "true god", he had an instant audience of 75100 people.

Oh, and I'd leave behind one of my military escorts to make sure you didn't detract from the faith either.  Detraction = death to the rest of your family, and to you.  Conversion at the point of a sword is very persuasive.     I have a digital converter, and I get 4 channels.  Yay?  PBS, CBS, and ABC.  But ABC is turning off soon.  Mandatory cut off for repeaters.  Hence, I hooked up my TV's to satellite and cable.  I only have cable because I have the exact tools that TWC has, (except for a ladder truck and safety gear).   Having to deal with that if I want more than 4 channels, (one I'm about to lose), without cable service.  I can get K40EE, and KLEW too.  Other than that, I get ... PBS.  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a   Which I am.  Back before the transition, I was basically living **in** an antenna to get decent reception.  I had multiple loops of wire, and strings just to get a decent signal.  I turned my entire room, (and later apartment), into a giant antenna just to watch TV.  Now without using extreme measures like that, I get ... 4 channels), and one of them is going dark at the end of the month.  K40EE is turning off at the end of the month.   http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a  Before the transition, I could get 2,3,4,6,7,10,12,22,24,28,35,40,48.  Now I can get 3,10,12,40.  And K40EE is shutting off in a couple of weeks.   I still do use an analog TV upstairs, and did think about it, (my ex gf saw my media collection, and says I have enough to run a station for several years).  I'm not doing it though because I'd get nailed by the FCC.   I mean the poor people recruited get no tangible benefit.  I'm not talking about the charity cases reliant on the food bank, but just minimum wage workers that see a local church in town, and decide to go, and then the hat is passed around and you feel like a damned tool if you don't put at least a couple cents in the hat before passing it down the line.    All for nothing that can't be proven.  (unless you can send cameras to the afterlife).  But there are more Christian denominations than passages in the bible.  Destitute people need the churches for charity works, and I understand it's an out reach program.  But the working poor don't need it.  I'd have no problem with charity drives, like standing in front of a store and passing out fliers that say "food for the needy, this is what we need" to every customer.  Hell, one day, I gave over $200 in food to a church that did exactly that.  (I had extra money that month, so what the hell).  They were kind of surprised when they asked "what's here for us", and I just said "The entire buggy". and walked off.  Somebody did it for me a long time ago when I was in need, so I did it for somebody else that I will never even meet.   Then why is my TVFool so shitty?  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a   I sort of already have cable and satilitte because I have tools, but to do it legally:  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f09ad6fb825a  I get PBS.  That's it.  If I can somehow get on my roof, I'll get 4 channels.  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f061e8d1035a   You're really going to have a logical discussion with a a 12 year old on why he should watch where he's going when backing up?  Really?  Fuck that.  Make him fix the fence he backed over.  He fucked it up, he fixes it by himself.  Yes, bring him water and food, but "You fucked up, you fix it".  That's completely reasonable.  Burn down 1.4 million dollars of ranch land, and lose some cattle and a barn?  I deserved it.  Never trust a 14 yo kid with a backpack blow torch.  Bad mistakes can happen. Dad running for the tractor and going to make a fireline to save what crops remain then coming home isn't fun.  I should have known better, but it was my first time being let loose by myself with the torch.      Can you tell I'm still pissed off about the "digital transition"?    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uwkchAmilw   OMG, my fucking truck is training me, and I'm basically a beaten dog.    I don't see a need to reverse with a seatbelt on (because I'm going like 5), but I keep it on because of that annoying  BEEEEEEEEEE" that never ends until I put back on my seat belt.  I'm not scared of the beep though, it's just annoying.  BUT WHY IN REVERSE?  I now take off my shoulder belt to see where the hell I'm goiing, but leave my self buckled in.  Ever hitten a blow up doll so hard that it won't stand up again?  I have. :)    That explains it!  I've wondered that for a while.  I'm a full grown man, and that look still sends me the message that I fucked up.  But my punishments were a little more severe than a swat on the ass.   Depends on how much you mean, "short" and "long".    Immediate future?  A lof of calls from collection agents.    Intermediate future?  You'll get sued and have a garnishment order against you.  You WILL repay.  You can't outrun the IRS.    Long term future?  You ruined your credit score for 7 years.  You can't bankrupt it.  You can't outrun the debt unless you leave the country.    Longer term future?  (10+ years), Nothing.  I suggest /r/personalfinance       They are large gaseous objects that gather together under the force of gravitation and electromagnatism.  Then because of the heavy gravitational forces, they collapse upon themselves and form a star and planets.  They are destroyed by the collapse into a formation of several stars, (usually), and they drift away according to the spin that the underwent while the nuclear reaction went critical, and formed planets, and debris and shit.  They are made out of mostly hydrogen and helium, but also a few other elements going all the way down to uranium.   Minimum time?  A pico second as measured by the official time clock in Boulder CO.  Maximum, about 10 billion years from the Hubble.  It means nothing other than we can measure the speed of light, and can see that far back into the past because the speed of light isn't instantaneous.    FTL is impossible as known to the laws of physics as we currently understand them, but if you can figure a way around it, you'll get to be a billionaire, and win the nobel prize.    Hypothetically, if you could build a telescope the size of the Moon, and send it out 65M LY away, yes, you could watch the destruction of the dinosaurs.  Fun fact:  It takes about 1.25 seconds to contact the Moon one way, and 15 minutes to mars.  (speed of light is about 299,792,458 m/s)  If the sun burnt out right now, we wouldn't know for about 8 minutes.   Best of all sports man!  But I wouldn't know what to call it, or how to play it.  Oh shit, I fogot basketball hoops too. :)  That would be fucking awesome! :)         Honestly, I'd like to run them through with my Ka-bar, and let them die on the ground while I kick their heads in, and burn them with my cigarettes, and hook up jumper cables to their genitalia while starting my truck.  I can be pretty sadistic in revenge.   At least you weren't blowing your cat. :)   These thugs should be shot in the face.   Please daddy, not my bum bum bum!  I'll be a good boy"  No daddy, please stop"   /s  Like this:  *"Yeah, you're so smart that you should go for MENSA. :) /s"*  Problem solved      The W33 is a dinosaur now?  Hmm.  Me thinks dinosaur wouldn't last long in a cannon. :D   I wasn't trying to shill or troll, I was just trying to have a good time, and I thought everybody would have a good laugh at it.  I guess I failed there.  What started as a joke post very quickly turned into a serious discussion.  I know trolls just post asshole shit to get people angry, but what's a shill?   Davey Crocketts are tactile nuclear weapons low yeild. 100T payload.  Set it not to launch, and detonate on a timer, (much like an IED).  Have 4 vans parked in the garage, and one at each exit/entrence.  Blow them both at the same time. Total failure, and explosion.  Wait until noon for mass casualties 70,000 people per building.  Then blame it on some rouge terrorist group from somewhere.  That would work much better than a few dumbasses with box knifes flying airplanes into buildings.  Doing that would cause a complete massive uproar and a move to join the military, and kill whoever they blame it on unseen since forever.  If I wanted to stage a terrorist attack, it wouldn't be too hard as the President, and the effects would be long lasting.  EMP the USA. That would take about 2 days to plan, and cause hundreds of millions of people to die, and decades to fix.  This report was released the same day as the 9/11 commission report.  Yes, they were hiding something, but it wasn't 9/11.  http://www.empcommission.org/  **EDIT:**  It wouldn't even take a semi-automatic weapon to get mass casualties.  Just the stampede effect.  Get a couple dudes into the Superbowl with a string of firecrackers, and shoot off 1 round each from each position.  Set off the strings, and shoot one random person.  Stampede effect, and then the media could blame "maniacs with machine guns" for the thousands of people being stomped to death, when what? 4 people are killed because of hostile action?  That's how to terrorize a population.  Can you imagine that reaction?  Not only several thousand people being injured/killed because of the stampede effect, but also millions of people watching on TV live?  That's the way to do it.  Even if I was planning a terrorist plot, I can think of better shit than 9/11 to do.  The airplanes would only be the start.  Then the car bombs go off at every entrance, then the parking garage bombs would go off, and set trains to explode when the pass under it. 9/11 was run by somebody that didn't know what he was doing.   I know exactly how I would do it.  Ever heard of "car bombs", and 2 Davey Crockett misslies planted to detonate at an exact time.  Then forbid examination by presidntial order because it's just too dangerous", and then let FEMA and emergency personell in?  It wouldn't exactly be hard if it were a government consperacy on 9/11.      LSD is a hell of a drug. :)  I've seen some pretty wild shit too. :)  But do I think those 2" tall people are truly running this machine that only see as an end table not on drugs?  Nope.  It's just acid man.   Nah, I just thougt y'all would get a laugh.  While I hate to quote a blowhard, "Illustrate absurdity by being absurd".  There's a difference between not believing that U93 was taken down by civillians, (doesn't add up, and I'd shoot it down); v. Lizard men living at the center of the earth and Obama is a shape shifter and also the queen of england because you never see them at the same place at the same time)   I don't believe that it was a malicious plot that was founded by the bush administration, (too much of an idiot to pull it off), but I honestly do think that United 93 was shot down with justification but credited to the American passengers aboard because to give them a "silver lining in a dark cloud" on that horrific day.  I'd do it to, and they had reason to be shot down.  Building 7 fell down because of the massive fires that were raging in the tower for over 12 hours, and when I think they said "pull it", they were referring to "let it burn and get the hell out".  I didn't see any cranes that day, and it takes several weeks to set up a demo team..  Ever heard of the think known as "collateral damage" from shrapnil?  Shit happens man.  Sometimes that shit sucks, but it's still shit.  Just because you accidently stepped in a cow patty, doesn't mean it was set there on purpose.   1 I saw it on facebook and thought it was funny, so I thought y'all would get a laugh from the stupidity.  2.  Sort of, my old HS bully showed up and treats me like I'm her kid (all over again), but that has nothing to do with it  3. Nope.  I just think that the 9/11 people are full of shit.  4.  I wish.  5.  No, I'm not a racist, (by definition, segregation of a group of people based on external appearances or color is racist).  6. No, I do investigation, but I don't believe in fake moon landings, lizard people, 9/11 being operation northwoods in practice, or the Regan fake murder, or all the school shootings were faked by liberals, or that bill clinton was in contact with the mafia, or other bullshit shit.  7. You do have a lot of shit that is worth considering.  I do believe in restricted areas around nuclear power plants, (I've kind of been chased out of one), I believe in Area 51 because I can find it on Google Maps, I think more than one man was behind JFK, (but who), and that if JFK would't have gotten into a pissing contest with the russians, he wouldn't have "saved us" from the missile crisis, and that clinton started Kosovo on purpose to distract from the lewinsky thing).  I think I'm the first one to think up the last two, but I think it's true.  United 93 was shot down by the USAF.  Just listen to the tapes.  That's all you have to do.  Who is that executive aircraft?  It's the USAF.      Me light m1000, me throw and seek cover.  I don't want to be anywhere around those when they go off.    What did that dude light off with the burnt arm?    M1000's are very dangerious, and I won't hold them beyond to light it, and then I throw it "away from me", and duck for cover.  I set one off last night, and the closest cover was behind my door.  I didn't even get to see it blow up, so I don't know why I lit it at all.  I cracked the sidewalk though.  Oops.  I lit it and realized "I'm holding dynamite!"  Oh shit!"  I threw it and ran.            jacking, boosting, 5 finger discount, stealing, etc.      Drove drunk.   Terminator 2.  I thought it was boring.  For a while I thought "R" meant "Really dumb".  I was 8, and didn't get it.  Holy shit, most of y'all weren't alive when I watched this movie the first time.   Christmas day, 1991 to be exact.   The USSR would admit they are full of shit and don't stand a chance against the USA.      Holy shit!  What did that guy fire off?  That's disturbing!  I'm trying very hard not to puke right now.   Blind luck I guess.  I only shoot fireworks off holding them because my dad did, and he survived fine.  Roman candles have a kick, but as long as you keep it well away from your head, it's fine.  Powder burns from bottle rockets are painful, but the rockets are fucking painful.   Ever seen 3 bottle rockets go off at once.  That hurts, but it was cool to see. :)  I shoot them out of my hand. :)  (yes, I know they aren't called hand rockets or roman candles for a reason)  Yes, I hold those too.   Oh, I did, believe me.  My right hand still hurts, and I'm lucky I didn't lose it.  A mortar exploded on me (twice), a bottle rocket had a FTL, and just blew up on me, and I had a premature detonation on a firecracker.  I think I'm explosived out for the next year.  Oh, a roman candle kind of blew up on me too.  I dove for the nearest cover, (a parking berm), and got missed by what looked like an inch.  It's amazing how slow detonations are when you're running for your very life after yelling "FIRE IN THE HOLE!  RUN NOW! and running yourself.I made it 5ft before I had to jump behind the nearest thing for safety.  I'm lucky I'm alive after tonight's escapades.   Some dude just traded me a smoke and some fireworks for a beer.  I took him up on the offer. :)  I told him, "just don't kipe my fireworks or radio."  He was impressed with my radio setup and looked at it with his phone flashlight.  He was rather impressed. :).  I intended to give it to him for free, but he insisted on giving me a beer in trade.  I took him up on the offer. :)   Because I can, and know how to use my armament?  Havent really thought through "what if the soviets launch, and you have 15m before impact.  1.  Get them to safety.  2.  Lock the door.  3.  Train them somehow in a fallout shelter??  4  take back our town.   well I have an armament for other reasons, (havent exactly though about how to train my neighbors though in case of "bird away", yet though, but yes, mostly for fun, and rounds are expensive.   http://www.eadassociates.com/fa-235-508.pdf  They go first.   Only if 7.5" limp (according to my tape measure), is small.  I think I'm rather well endowed, and your dad does too. :D   Esp since I'm not in a war zone, but am armed to the teeth like I am in one.  I have enough armament to equip a fireteam.  Now to go watch explosives. :)   68 magazines and 5 drums.  I still have a few magazines unloaded, because if I get into that big of a firefight, I have a severe problem that I really cant fix.   I have over 1500 rounds ready to go, all loaded into magazines and 5 drums.  It would literally take me 2s to get it into fire mode.  (cock the handle and take it off safety, (but not the middle position because I don't need suppressive fire).  It would only take so long because I'd have to reach to my right and get it.   Somebody did that to me, and I would shoot that fucker out of the sky.  AKM v. civilian drone.  I wonder who's going to win?   You've never been on an aeroplane?      Today is my favorite holiday, because explosives. :)      Nope.  I don't even own any.  Yeah, my sex life is non-existent beyond Mrs Lefty Palmy and Righty Handy.   Yeah, plot line is "dude is scared out of his mind and thinks we're about to be vaporized, so he runs naked outside of his house to the neighbors thinking we only have 15m to get to shelter".  Then the porn ends badly with 15 people standing around seeing his bum and pillock flapping in the breeze while he walks home.   Good point.  I still don't like it when the air-raid siren goes off.  Last time it did, I ran out butt fucking naked to figure out what's going on.  It was only a drill, (obviously).  I'm sure the people didn't like it much seeing my pillock and pounding on thier door to let them know "WE HAVE INCOMING!"  He came out with me, and listened to the siren and announcements.  He just said, "It's a drill you dingus.  Go put some pants on."  I was relieved and embarrassed at the same time.  I know where the evacuation site is if it ever does come.  BTW, I was never allowed dessert.  "If you have enough room for dessert, you have some room for dinner.  Get seconds."  I was only allowed dessert on christmas, thanksgiving, easter, and the 4th of july.   They are.  When a vessel goes down, women and children are evacuated first because children are the weakest members of society, and they need their mothers to raise them.  Men are after women and kids because most children can't swim too well, and need to be evacuated.  Women go with the children.  Last, the men, then the crew.  It is the captain's responsibility to make sure everybody is safely off of the ship before leaving himself.      It's a "socially acceptable", way of saying "My god", without having to worry about being blasphemous, or violating the third commandment.   Because children and women and disabled people are the most vulnerable members of society, and not as strong as a full grown man.  Therefore, they are the first to be evacuated in an emergency scenario   Not just A delorean, THE delorean. :)   Getting a DUI in 2008.   Life is too short to be drunk all day.   Go fishing with your dad, he's going to be dead in 7 years, and you're going to regret that you were "too busy" go spend some time with him.  This is going to haunt you the rest of your life.  Work can be put off.   The back to the future car. :)      Going out in the parking lot across my house with me and my radio, and some beer, and watching the city fireworks show.   Remember friendster?  Like that.   Me too.  I'm aborting this conversation now.   Nope, can't do that.  I'm not a surgeon.    That's just so sad I don't know how to comment besides, I'll do it for free if you pay my airfare. :(   I tied in psychology, but they don't allow test posts.  My ex wife thinks I should tell my counselor, but I don't know.  I don't want to start any shit over shit that doesn't need to be started.  Should I do like she always said, and just keep my mouth shut?  I really don't want to get her in trouble, because it's been 14 years now.  I should have gotten over it, but my ex wife thinks I still act like a beaten child just trying to stay alive.   I've gotten in contact with my ex-GF from HS, and my ex wife deosn't think it's healthy, and I"ve reverted to a battered child again since contacting her, because I seem to cower when confronted with any conflict, and try and back out anyway that I can.  (well, back in 2012, I literally picked a guy up, and threw him out on the street to end a knife fight, but I only did it because I thought I had to.  It was either that or shoot him).  I think that's just dumb because I'm armed to the teeth, and have several ways to end a threat if I really need to.  I can shoot, I can fight with my knife, I can pole fight, and I can fist fight if I must.  Ideally, I'll never have to do any of it, but I can if I must.   My ex wife thinks I should tell my counselor, but I don't know.  I don't want to start any shit over shit that doesn't need to be started.  Should I do like she always said, and just keep my mouth shut?  My ex-wife thinks that I have PTSD over my ex GF from HS, but I don't think so, because only raped people and combat people get that.   Well, it is a skill that you could learn to make some free extra money on the side.  It's remarkably easy if you have the tools. :)   That's why when I smoke with a kid, (or a non smoker), in my truck, I keep the vent on high, and crack the window at least half an inch, and keep the burning part of my smoke outside of the truck.  I do exactly what my dad did, and I never noticed it as a kid, so it must work.   Nope.  Just saying that I know how to get free cable.  :)   There, you have to have some tools, and the cover of night. ;)  I know exactly how, and have done it a couple of times for friends. :)  Hooking up analog cable isn't exactly hard.   Not in most of the Union though.   Setting up a TV antenna to get as many channels as you can for free.  /r/cordcutters    My cat being in my bedroom with me.  She's my BFF, and I swear she can sense when I'm sick or having emotional issues.  She always cuddles with me, and makes me feel better. :)   Same here, but at least I could open up a window.  My mom did it all the time, but my dad always made sure his window was at least cracked so all the smoke would go out.   Therefore not illegal.  http://app.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=2086 year=2013   What's the RCW?   I already did.  It's called coloboma from birth.   Just think, now you could potentially have night vision, or zooming vision, or xray vision.  The future is now here.  Now where to get that 100,000 USD to do it, I have no idea.               Blow cigarette smoke in kid's faces, or drive around with a kid, have all the windows up, and chain smoke after engaging the child safety locks on the windows.   Yes, I just drove him into town because his car broke down.  They paid me $50 for my efforts.      I never got rid of my FDDs until 2011.  Yes, I had more than one. :)   That's why he had the nickname "The Intimidator".  Yes, he was a bully on the track.   Everything.   Pull out my pistol and shoot them in the head.   The weather.   Slang.   Nothing.   Well practiced in the Fine Art of Fellatio.   I started watching in 93,  Sunday was "raceday", and that was my dads and I "church".  18 Feb 2001 was the last day I ever watched it and was enthusiastic about it.  It didn't work in 2010 when I tried to get back into it.  The Daytona 500 in 2001 was the last complete race I ever watched.   Why would you put a full restraint in a semi?  You have a lot of mass, and even a piddly ass seat belt would do you fine.  Do they have semi races now?  O.o  All I know was in my 77 impala (dual quads) dropped in 454, NV4500 with corvette servos. (14s QM)  I couldn't reach shit beyond my stick and wheel.  Yes, I had more power than I would even know what to do with now as a 32 year old man.  Yes, I can still roast my tires if I really want to, (actually not even trying, I've done it by accident), but a 16 year old kid has no business with that much power.  I was getting 301.1 BHP as measured by dynamo.  I "only" have 290 now, according to the spec sheet of the 350 I dropped in with a 700R4 tranny.   Seatbelts are obsolete.  And yes, they are more comfortable than a full track setup.  I'd like to see you to even try and change the radio station, or reach your map in a full restraint harness.  Not gonna happen.  The last time I was strapped in, (in 1999), I could reach the wheel, and the stick.  Nothing else.  I may as well have not had a radio.  (well, I was racing, so I didn't use it anyways, but you know what I mean).   I was 17 when I saw that race.  My dad turned changed the channel in the livingroom when the wreck happened, so I went to my room to see what was going on and who won.  IIRC, it was about 40m later when the news came that earnhardt was killed.  I ran out of my room as fast as I could, (literally running in the house).  "DAD  EARNHARDT IS DEAD!"  "What?"  "Earnhardt?"  "yeah"  IS DEAD!"  "Bullshit"  "Come into my room, it's on TV now!"  "Oh my god"  Then starts crying just sitting on my bed.  He left.    Never watched NASCAR again together.  I tried again in 2010, but it just wasn't the same.  The cars looked different, and one of the best drivers in the world got killed.  It just didn't work.  I think I lasted for an hour, and then changed the channel, it just didn't feel right.        My ex GF sent me that video after I told her that I have "the need for speed" and asked her about the nearest track.  "Before you go, you might want to watch this.  You were crying to me in HS over it."  I watched it, and now I don't have a "need for speed" anymore.  I completely forgot about it before she reminded me.  Sorry, I was just trying to spread the word, that speed kills, and be responsible.  I know it's not LEO related, but I didn't know where else to post it besides /r/cars   Yeah, my ex GF just sent me that video.  Thanks. :(  If you gotta race, keep it on the track, but don't race, because that's still dangerous.  I remember telling my dad that day, he didn't believe me until he came into my room and saw the live news broadcast.  He just sat on my bed and cried, and we never watched NASCAR again.  I tried in 2010, but it just wasn't the same.  One of the best drivers in history got killed, all because of a $140 piece of equipment, (HANS restraining device).  Now I don't want to race at all.  I guess she accomplished her goal.  I had a "need for speed", now I don't.  Pretty morbid video to watch, but better than a "serious discussion".   I broke the news to my dad that day, "Earnhardt is dead!". He didn't believe me until he came into my room and watched the broadcast. He was crying. We never watched NASCAR again I remember that day well. He said "what?" I said "Earnhardt?" he said "yeah?" I said " IS DEAD". We walked back to my room, and I still had the TV on, and he watched for about a minute, sat down on my bed, and just started crying. I tried in 2010, but it's just not the same. One of the best drivers ever got killed, and I can't watch it anymore.      Why punish the users?  Isn't this a bit like dad having a bad day at work so he comes home to hit his kids?         It wasn't something I did, is it?  Great, now I feel like I'm 12 again. :(   Not illegal, but SWIM got laughed at a couple of times, and feels like an even bigger ass because SWIM basically said "I saw it on TV" to the aeroport administrator.  And SWIM called because I don't think they would really SWIM SWIM showing up with cutters, and opening the tarmac for a drag race.  SWIM doesn't really want combat patrol coming over the horizon and re-enacting the Saigon surrender, without anywhere to swim off to, or a boat, or a batallion off of shore to flee to)   () | ^ | ()  That's what I got to say about that.   Because old habits die hard with a vengeance?  (Yay, I actually used a movie title in normal conversation!)   That's what my ex GF said, and my mom too.  I thought I could because the BBC does, but Now I'm just trying to find a closed road so I can.  (I'm not going on the aeroport tarmac without explicit permission).   The last time I was up there, I saw a jetcar explode.  I'm not really sure I want to go on that track.  Yes, the dude was alive, but barely.  I sort of chickened out after seeing that, and I only had a 10M wait until I was "next up".  Seeing a giant fireball 20M in front of me kind of made me put it into drive and leave the track.  Plus, it would cost me about $50 in gasoline to get up there.     Pullman WA.  The nearest one is over 100 miles away in StateLine ID.  **edit:** and now you know why I street drag. My old GF says that my truck is in no condition to race though, and "remember dale earnhardt?  He was a professional driver."  I remember that race well, thanks  Killed with 4 laps to go during the daytona 500 in 2001.   God damn it.  Even exhibition permits (close down streets and race), are $175/hr.  My old GF says that I should just let it go, and if she catches me me going to have a "very very serious discussion" if I do it unlicensed. :(  That explains why top gear can do it but I can't! :)  I thought I could because top gear does.  Nope.   SWIM = Someone Who Isn't Me.  You probably don't know because you don't go to https://drugs-forum.com/forum/   OK, I can't rent the aeroport either.  :(  Any closed roads around?   Shit.  That explains it.  The lady on the phone just laughed at SWIM and said "I can't let you do that". and started laughing again.  SWIM even told her about Top Gear, and they race on tarmac all the time, but that generated even more laughter. O.o.  	200
 I've run into a deadly, shadowy figure. Some call him the Hash-Slinging Slasher based off the Spongebob Character.   What Podcasts? I love PKA, TPS, Movie Fights by Screen Junkies, and the Dubl D's podcast.   Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, etc   I transform from huge robot with mechanical guns attached to my shoulders to a seemingly normal human body (Upgraded version of my current body with abs and more muscular contour). They will call me 'FuckBitchesAquireRiches Prime'...still working on the name.   Don't be fooled. I thought skating would be much easier than it looks but I learned I was wrong and thank god it wasn't the hard way. People still bring up that girl's unfortunate fall and we're about to be seniors in highschool...   Could've been great at music producing at an earlier age, born into a more richer family to buy necessary software, and make it big on youtube. 16 and still got some time left tho.   We went to San Francisco for an 8th grade trip and one of the things we did were go ice skating outside in the middle of the city. Keep in mind, I can't skate period, and I remember holding on the the side railing the entire time on the ice as I slowly walked around the rink one time before deciding to get off the ice, regretting the wasted 20 dollars renting the skates. Just as I was about 5 feet away from the exit, I look to my right to see a girl who had seemingly got the hang of skating until, and I shit you not, her skates completely malfunctioned under her feet and let me tell you...there was no time inbetween this chick skating perfectly and her face planting while sliding in the wall head first. Never wanted to laugh so hard in my entire life...I'm going to hell.   I'd be careful for those who decide to take your girl out ice skating.

Sleek but interesting that I could use on all my instrumentals, images, and profile pics on social media. I'm a music producer.   I saved a frog from near death. It was trapped inside of a 2-liter plastic 7-up bottle.   Me as Batman paired with unlimited money for amazing special effects, the best writers/directors on the damn planet, and non-stop advertisments everywhere. Upon release date, Billionaire Status. Become Batman in real life.   You might be right.   What kind of accent? I've heard people who speak proper english say both all the time.   That shit is annoying too hahah   I use toilet paper, but think about it. If you got shit all over your arm, is the best way to clean to wipe it with a paper or to wash it. Whole different perspective. I still use toilet paper only though :(   Interesting...   Not sure if both pronounciations are correct but one of them just sounds incorrect and it irritates me. Its honestly a pet-peeve of mine. In my mind:  * Correct: Sen-air-ee-o  * Incorrect: Sen-ar-ee-o  Edit: The latter is used in Britain most likely, but is cringeworthy when an American with no distinguishable accent pronounces it.   Fuck you, Trump.   Scenario   What is something that you like that isn't very Mainstream?  * Movies * TV Shows * Websites * Music Artists * Online Clothing Stores * Sub-reddits * Photographers * Podcasts * ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF!   Tory Lanez   ??? Believe it or not, I haven't seen Park n Rec. Saw first episode and thought it was a rip-off of 'The Office' which I loved. Everyone was annoying and I only laughed once in the episode in the very end when the dude with the mustache said something about a gun or maybe something about the flag idk I forgot. Seriously though, I'm talking from experience about my fecal situation. You've never had a dry shit?   Most people who claim to have insomnia don't. Usually they're doing something that stimulates their brain which can be anything from the emission of blue light from your Iphone or laptop (which actually stimulates you the most of different light types which I won't get too deep into) or even having a simple source of light like a lamp or nitelight which could confuse your brain into thinking it's still day-time and prevents from certain chemicals in your brain which help get you drowsy. I have sleep problems too. Sleep at 4am, wake at 2pm depressed that I only have a couple more hours of day light to be productive. Vicious cycle.   Why?    I've seen Dexter and Breaking Bad twice through     I liked the Office better   Christian Bale. He's actually quite a douche if you've seen some videos or heard stories of him behind the scenes. He's the guy who will cuss you the fuck out because you brought him a bowl of green M M's when he likes red.   Piano   Wait for the boner to go down.   My pocket.   So your wife...   Reddit-ing. Hours gone, too deep in to leave now.   Gif has slow motion option. Your welcome.   Seems to be a problem though. From what you have said, it sounds like you brush at night, mouthwash in the morning, and brush again after lunch. So, you're brushing two times a day which can be bad like you said. I would skip brushing after lunch and just brush at night but then I feel like my breath would stink even with mouthwash throughout the day.    No, they moved to /r/Dumponmychest    Birds eat worms, eventually shit and provide nutrients to soil that in turn grow into humans that get chopped down by birds to make human houses for trees, right? Explain to me, I'm like 5.  	36
 Top notch post   I'm on my phone so maybe I can reference an article later. Essentially, I think Mexico should do something to make their country a more attractive place to live. I also think they benefit from the drug trade as evidenced by helping that drug lord escape. I appreciate your honesty.   Yeah I learned about it a bit in my one quantum physics class, we talked about harnessing solar energy. We're just really bad at keeping it and storing it efficiently. The transistors that we use need to be more advanced. Elon Musk is the great innovator of our time.   Yeah we need to get off fossil fuels for sure. Pollution like in Beijing is abhorrent. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable. Actually here's one of my favorite facts. The sun creates more energy in one second than mankind has ever used. Just imagine if we could harness that. It'd be amazing.   Good. Oil is more efficient and has higher energy density right now. Allow the free market to invent green power, keep the Feds out of it.   I might listen to that podcast or read some ridley articles because I'm honesty a neophyte in debating this. Essentially, I believe the climate is changing, I just don't think we know to what extent it's changing.   I was just thinking how Obama gave $500m to Solyndra   There's phony/deceptive science on both sides. I think the difference here is that the green Movement is state supported, and we live in a generation of activists.   CO2 also promotes plant growth, since it is their food.    There's nothing glaring really. There's just a lot of money and incentives for scientists to prove their points right. Ridley talks about this one graph (forgive me for forgetting the minutia)  that was influential in climate science. In this graph there was a set of points that were in the graph inappropriately to skew the way people interpreted. They did it knowingly. Ridley found this out and removed the false data and it wasn't as scary as once made to believe.   Aright I'm doing this from my phone so bear with me though typos and formatting.  First off, I don't think using Wikipedia as your main source of argument isn't that damning, but I entertained it. Wiki says, "usually by not slowing police or municipal employees to inquire about an individual's immigration status." That's fine, I understand why they wouldn't.   However, the article referenced in [Ref 1](sfgate.com/bayarea/article/newsom-says-s-f-won-t-help-with-raids-mayor-2600450.php) says Mayor pledges to discourage Feds' immigration sweeps. Essentially, he will do nothing to stop illegals from wanting to come to his city. They are illegal immigrants and actively defying US law by residing here without proper citizenship.  In my eyes when you defend sanctuary cities like this, you are endorsing illegal immigration.  You can begin to cut murder/violent crime rates by removing illegals. Having illegals certainly won't increase the crime rate! It's a crime to even be here. If you think illegals keep the crime rate down because of all the vigilante-like crime reporting they're doing then I'd love to see that source.  You can also argue they want a better life and I empathize with them on that. I think US needs to do something about it with out Mexico relations. Shame on them for turning a blind eye and complete unwillingness to help out their own citizens. The Mexican government is smuggling their drug lords out of jail and refusing to extradite them to America where they can be convicted and proven guilty without a doubt.  In SF, it is a get out of jail free card. It just is. It's not even about inquiring about every single Latino person, it's that they are actively inviting laws to be broken.   I have nothing against Latinos. I have a problem with breaking US laws whether you be white, black, yellow, green, or any other sort of color.  Deportations have dropped by 35% in SF in the past 3 years and in the USA alone it has been the lowest number in over 40 years.   Here's how I feel about the whole climate debate. Matt Ridley actually has a lot of views I like. He's more of a climate lukewarmer. I think humans are affecting the environment negatively, however, I think politicians and powerful people are exaggerating the immediate effects of it.   Matt Ridley has studied this extensively and has called bullshit on a lot of popular things that climatologists point to as "evidence". I recommend listening to the podcast EconTalk that features him.   Common practice for most large cities? Not true. They don't turn you over to immigration in San Francisco. That illegal immigrant that killed that American was arrested twice and released from jail in America. In what world do you live in that you want people illegally invading our country? Liberals preach about the wage gap yet support illegal immigration. It just fuels their arguments and it's bull shit.   I wouldn't be shocked if he didn't. John is a weird dude. I think he said when working on Stadium Arcadium he used to listen to 36 chambers by Wu Tang Clan everyday ha   So you honestly believe Mexico is doing anything to deter their citizens from leaving?   Where is Obama when the sanctuary city issues comes up?    Thanks, I'll remember to call Bruce by his proper pronoun next time he comes up in conversation.   I couldn't agree with you anymore.   It wasn't a typo.   True that homie! Life's too short to be anything but happy. Keep riding Spaceship Earth.   I'm a huge sports fan as well. No way I'm watching.    It's embarrassing that he is winning that ESPY award for bravery.   Yeah, no other way I'm gonna be making a million bucks a year   FUCKIN SICK BRO   You're awesome man, I'm not suicidal. We need people like you being a helping hand. Good stuff brotha.   I like that video, thanks for the show    Foods have a common ancestor, much like animals, no?   Hmm. No questions about extinguishing the Jedi. I'm calling bull.   They are two different sports. It's like asking why lemons taste sour if peppers are spicy. Yeah they're both food. But completely different foods.   Thank you for being the voice of reason to all the liberals circle-jerking to conservative bashing.   Government oversight thats out of control   Once got 36 sprinkles. We used to count them.   Generator, in case of natural disasters and you lose power.   Wait for government handouts.   RIP Whitney   I got Rand Paul, but I'm also a big supporter of his. I think it's decent but shouldn't be used as your definitive response. Lucky for you though, because you have over a year to make an informed decision. Since the primaries haven't begun yet, you're in good shape. Listen to debates as they happen, find positives and negatives about each candidate before you decide. Don't judge the candidates based on their media perspective. Judge them primarily by their actions. Words are usually empty promises. See what they have actually done or tried as a judge of their character.   Yeah that's kinda what it is. Basically faking attacks to give you reason to enter war. So it can be tied in with the Military-Industrial Complex  So. My point is. I don't believe in 9/11 conspiracies but that could be viewed as a false flag operation. Basically, we planned the attacks to invade the middle east for oil and $$$. So the people in power were positively effected by this, people could argue.   That heaven exists.   Huh? I realize it's only a theory... but hop off a cliff, tell me how that works out for ya   /r/politics   Petered out. Nice.   Myself   My biggest recommendation is not to get your recommendation from Reddit on a particular candidate. That's not going to help you. Voting history helps and I would also see if they have their platform on their website. This site also works too, (www.isidewith.com), however, I don't know if it gives more options for one party than the other.   "Only My Couch Pulls Out" -- We came in 2nd at the Tilted Kilt   False Flag Operations?   You're right. Not about the right-wing blogger stuff. But I'm not gonna try to keep it going for the sake of the argument when I see your point. Deal 1 is done, onto the next one.  Did the release the specifics of the deal yet? I couldn't find any hard numbers on it.   I just want the administration to address the issue in some sense.   I would never be a part of occupy Wall Street. I believe in the free market way too much. Why won't Obama or Kerry even acknowledge the hostages? Why won't they assure the Americans that they are even attempting to bring them home? And this deal is being overblown by liberals when it does nothing to prevent Iran from attempting nukes in the future.   I'm as upset as you, I can't believe it wasn't even on the table.   This is sickening. I can't believe you would actually think that the hostages shouldn't be a part of the deal. They are AMERICANS! How can that not mean anything to you? You can say that these talks are just about nukes, but holy hell, I'll be damned if you ever hear about these hostages for a while. They are AMERICANS being held against their will without committing any crimes as far as I know. This is unjust and I can't believe this isn't even a topic of discussion. Since when does America back down from protecting its citizens? Since when does America not ensure to its people that they won't be prosecuted without reason? Unbelievable, this a joke.   EDIT: Being downvoted for caring about the American people. Suits reddit. Over zealous it may be, but damn, I just want to hear anything from this administration.   Eh different guitarists will do that to ya   Hmm I wonder if this opens the opportunity for me to start one. Except I have no idea how to run a subreddit or spread the word.   They like to crawl into different crevices to get out of the heat as far a I know. They used to come into my house by the AC unit. Since you're not at home I would just continuously throw them out of your car I suppose without killing them. But if you get them in your house, I always would flush them down the toilet.   Just another move by the New York Slimes   I want to have honest discussion with other redditors without fear of being downvoted into oblivion or condescended to. Also void of any half-witted jokes or memes.   I think he nailed it out of the park and left no stone unturned. I think, as a reader, it's really satisfying when an author does that.   I loved it. I'm an aero major w/ a minor in physics. So my opinion may be skewed since I have a stronger physics background than most of the general population. I thought it was goo background and introduction to people who aren't that familiar with theoretical physics. To be completely honest, If you're interested in that sort of stuff I wouldn't start with this book. There are hundreds and hundreds of videos that will bring you up to speed quicker, and then you may wanna revisit this.   American Gods is a good read, I read it 4 years ago, and want to revisit it when I can. I love mythology though, so that helped.   **Taking A Stand, Rand Paul**    Great book. I loved all the modern day mythology in it. Sort of, what would todays gods look like?   If there is any republican that I think democrats would respect, it's Rand. However, I don't know how you feel about him. Clinton is way too much of an untrustworthy politician.   I'm not saying who I think will win or anything like that. Just wondering who you guys would support.  Would you still vote? Would you vote for whomever gets the democratic nomination? Maybe vote for an independent or a moderate republican?   I had to do an english paper on it years ago. I saw it at a bookstore asked my teacher if I could do it, he said yeah. I never heard of the book before, but thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did.   Thats the kind of company I want to work for hah   Yeah I have a fear of commitment anyway   And We Won't GET FOOOOOOOLED AGAIN, since no one else recognized your reference.   I support gay marriage and I'm against the ruling. So many liberals look past a major reason for conservative arguments. It gives the federal government more centralized power and chips away at the first amendment for the sake of marriage, which shouldn't be run by the government in the first place. So please take all your easy upvotes from slacktivists on reddit, we all appreciate it. There are dozens of us! Dozens!   FREE SM LETS GOOOO   Two Attici   You act like you've carried your team anywhere, let alone the EU LCS.   Technically, light can't turn :O   This is the height of emotions for me when listening to TFC.    Oh man, come over to /r/pinkfloyd we love it over there   This is making me feel uncomfortable just to look at. Feel like I'm falling!   Fuck if I know, prolly about LBJ dunking a shit post in a shit basket   Hmm fucking a giant catfish is on your checklist? To each their own.   Man in Motion!   Reposts   Forget the immense length of The Wall, and no songs had to be taken out in order to have a longer CN. Would you still keep it the same?   Yeah I said to my friend once that I wish the solo was longer since I could hear the fade out. He's like dude, go listen to the Pulse version NOW   My question can be simplified. Would you rather have Comfortably Numb from The Wall to have that really long emotional solo that features in Pulse or not? I've been listening to the Pulse version a lot lately and wonder how it would sound on The Wall, you could also argue that hearing the long solo version live for the first time was so much more impactful. I don't know. What're your guy's thoughts?      Then you're doing it wrong   I think this is a simple solution, so I will keep it brief. A lot of people have issues with Riot's transparency or unwillingness to keep us updated on promises made long ago. What if each developer team would produce a weekly update/blurb about what they were working on and how it was going. It wouldn't have to be much. For instance, while working on the death recap (Finally btw) have the team say, ran into issue X, Y, or Z still figuring it out or something. I'm not sure, I just feel like if the community had updates, they wouldn't feel so left out at times.   But I loved getting Thresh souls from WAY DOWNTOWN!   He should vote for me too! I've never been in national news ever!   I realize they are one in the same, but why the sudden change in language? And ISOL doesn't sound as threatening and we're still fear mongerers, no?   Whoops! You're right! Haha, I'm keeping it.   And what's mine is yours and yours is mine absolutely unmotivates me.   I'm a constitutional libertarian and still in college so I don't fall in the old conservative stigmatism. And I can honestly say that reddit being liberal by majority (not sure if that's true; vocal minority effect) is really annoying to me. I'm friends with liberals without much issues, but the anonymity of the Internet gives these people a megaphone and a rooftop. I'm not trying to call everyone out, but it's just the way I perceive it. I'm also a spiteful person so I'm looking forward to all the Bernie Sanders supporters to have their hearts broken at their delusional expectations. However, there are many Sanders supporters with reasonable expectations and are hopeful in a rational way. But when I see everyone vote brigading every time he takes a shit, it's really annoying. I also find solace in knowing that if he's labeled a Socialist (which he is) not many conservatives will vote for him.   Sorry about this bitter post and it felt good to get it off my chest honestly. If anyone is willing to have a normal peaceful conversation/debate that's fine by me.   Apes because massively stronger than humans while still being able to use tools   	91
 Scooter (left) is a 17.3 hand Saddlebred.  Rillo (right) is a 14.3 hand Morgan.  Also, I'm only 5'3".  Rillo and I enjoy being vertically challenged together in a barn of tall people riding Saddlebreds and Friesians. :)      It is Flying E!  They have such a nice facility.  My boy is digging it there, and everyone at the barn is in love with him!   A Morgan, actually.  In a barn of Saddlebreds and Fresians!  He's the smallest horse in the place, lol!         You're still laughing about it, and now I'm laughing about it too.  Fantastic!  Thanks for replying.  See you in Minneapolis on 10/29!   What is the most inappropriate thing you've ever laughed at?  Bonus points if it was in a situation where no one else thought it was funny.  I find myself laughing at inappropriate things often...in public.  Then the staring by innocent bystanders begins.   You are my hero.      It looks like Kim is getting a lovely shoulder rub.   Upvote for using the phrase "slab sided nerd."  Lol!   Doubly hot -- great forearms AND you were vacuuming!   I have multiple pairs for riding, and I also own their gardening and work gloves.  I love them!  They have a great feel, even when I'm using a double bridle, adjusting tack, etc.  And when they get gross you can just throw them in the wash with your barn clothes!  I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and they really help my hands, especially if the horse I'm riding is strong.  I can't recommend them enough!   Omg that last photo of him in his party hat with his tongue out is PRICELESS!  What a lucky horse he's been to have you for so long, and to have such a great life.  He looks great for 27!  Happy birthday to both of you, and tell him he doesn't look a day over 15!   I have a riding pair, and also a gardening pair and a work pair!  I swear by them and tell everyone I can about these gloves.  They have a great feel even when I'm riding in a double bridle, and when they get gross you can just throw them in the washing machine with your riding clothes!           So sorry about your loss.  She was a Morgan, right?  If so I know her breeder.   VERY true!  In this case you're right, I'm likely ok because it's obviously a brassica.  I normally wouldn't bother trying to eat something like this but there is such a large amount of it that it seems wasteful to not try!      Your dad sounds incredible!  I love that you still have coffee with him every Saturday morning.  I wish my dad was geographically closer to me so we could do that.        So jealous you got to meet him!  And is that Call Me Regal?   That's just the way the barn does it.  I don't own the barn, just ride there.  Most of the barns I have ridden at have shavings in the aisles unless the aisles are paved.   She's not thrilled about pastures.  Paces the fence, etc.  this is just how she's happy. :)     Glowie is a 30 year old Morgan mare.  She sound of body except for some arthritis you would expect at her age, but is rather senile.  She has a stall but prefers not being in it, so the door is simply left open and she comes and goes as she pleases.  She wanders around the barn, the indoor arena, and around the farm grounds.  She is slow moving and never strays too far.  She is usually found napping, watching lessons, or raiding people's bags and purses for goodies. :)  It can be a shock to new visitors to just see her strolling around on a sunny day!      Tiny cute fuzzy environmentalist!  (the best kind)   Hah!  That's exactly why I don't like it!   Cushings is a tough thing.  It's great that Lenny has made it so long though!  I think Cushings is the one drawback about Morgans -- some of them just seem to be prone to it.  When we put Baby down she still looked pretty good, but was having problems moving around and walking comfortably.  Winter was on its way, so we made the decision to put her down before she got really bad.  Definitely do pictures with Lenny this summer, you'll treasure them forever!  We also had a bronze commissioned of Baby, and that is a very special thing to me.   I'm in MN too, so I seriously feel your pain!  And now this morning it's snowing again.  April fools?     Yep English.  I've done some Western at a very casual level, but I can't get used to the saddle!  There's just too much under my butt!   Saddleseat is fantastic and it's how I started out.  The two reins are just a double bridle, or full bridle.  They're used in lots of disciplines.  And lol about your horse running loose at shows.  My horses are all business about shows, but then are afraid of stupid stuff at home.  Rillo is deathly afraid of baby powder (even if it's on his butt), garden hoses, and COWS.   Actually none!  Baby's lines are here: http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/baby+ruth+mhf.  Rillo is her son, by Whispering Whamunition.    Baby started saddleseat but was then more comfortable as a hunter, so she became my first hunter pleasure horse.  Rillo was obviously built to be a hunter from the get-go so that is what he is too.  My 3-year old is now going to be my new saddleseat horse, probably English pleasure.  I go back and forth between seats all the time because I love them both!   Seriously!  Baby had abs, lol.  And Rillo is like riding a freight train even though he's not even 15 hands.     Nope, both Morgans :)     Thanks RonRonner!  We kept her happy and comfortable as long as we could.  She'd had IR problems since she was about 10, and I had to stop riding her about a year before we put her down at the age of only 16.  She had some problems keeping weight on, but never got too bad.  The farm and their staff is incredible, and I credit their expertise and diligent care when it comes to how long she stayed sound and happy.  She is buried on the farm, under the pasture where the new foals play. :)   Baby (the chestnut on the right) died a few months after this photo was taken from issues due to Cushings.  We did this photo shoot knowing she wouldn't be around for much longer.  I'm so glad I have this photo of the two of them!  Rillo (on the left) is her son and only offspring.  He is still my show horse.      Oh of course!  I know him.  Super cool horse!   He looks awesome!  What's his show name?     I deleted the first version of this because I messed up the link.  All fixed now!  Enjoy!      I didn't live in Melby, but had plenty of friends who did.  Yes, it's quiet, but you don't have to sneaking around.  Playing music in your room, talking with friends, watching a movie, etc. are all totally normal!  It's not freakishly quiet, don't worry.  Thorson is great too, and is a bit more boisterous, but not to the point where it's annoying.    Just don't live in Rand.  Never, ever, live in Rand.  I lived there as a sophomore -- blech!   Let me know if you have any more questions!   The barn I'm at now has 3 friesians, and I'm DYING to ride one!    He came to Minneapolis to speak and promote his book, so I went.  Got a free copy of his book, some great entrepreneurship advice, and an autograph!   I met him about a month ago and he was the NICEST guy.  Way taller than I realized (hotttttttttt), and genuinely interested in what I had to say.  I will marry him now please?   I just...I can't even function right now.  So good.   My horse hasn't had a lame day in his life, and my young colt has also had no issues at all thus far.  My mare, who we lost last year, did succumb to chronic laminitis.  This is probably the one "problem" Morgans have.  They are prone to laminitis, insulin resistance, and founder.  However, most Morgans I know were hale and hardy until their mid to late 20s.  They are indeed tough, while having beautiful refinement.    As for ants in their pants -- I can really come down to breeding and training.  My horse can be rather fire-breathing, in the respect that he always wants to go as fast as possible!  I never really ask him to go forward, just to slow down.  When we do our extensions, I simply stop trying to slow his body and off we go!  So many Morgans I've ridden are like this -- go go GO!  But they do have great brains as well.  My gelding is often TOO smart for his own good.  He even has a full understanding of the music they play at our shows, and will try to transition into the next gait when he hears the key of the music change!  Well, when you rebuild your wallet, and if you want to look into a Morgan, you know where to find me on Reddit!  Depending on what part of the country you're in, there could be some really great opportunities.  Have you ever considered taking lessons at a Morgan barn just to try out their dressage abilities?   Morgans are great little dressage horses!  I have several friends who use their horses for dressage, and now Western dressage is becoming really popular as well.  If you want any Morgan dressage connections, PM me and I can get you in touch with the right folks.  Even though my horse competes in hunter pleasure, we do a lot of basic dressage exercises with him at home, especially now that we're trying to get him better with patterns.  He overthinks everything and jumps to conclusions!  The dressage work is slowing his brain down a bit. :)  Here's a pic of him doing his thing in the show ring because, well, who doesn't love more horse pictures? :)  http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg   Thank you!  He's a Morgan. :)   Cool!  Also your horse is adorable and I want to squeeze his face and give him kisses. :)   Well, I'm not sure if this will clarify much (as reins just tend to look like a tangle), but here is my horse wearing the aforementioned rein configuration.  The bit he's wearing in this picture isn't the same one we're discussing here, but the reins are run in the same way.  Snaffle rein goes directly from hand to bit, and is clipped to the ring of the bit.  Curb rein goes from saddle, through bit ring, and doubles back.  http://imgur.com/PPwAtGI  Closer up:http://i.imgur.com/3YmYWU7.jpg  Hope that clears things up a little!  EDIT: the curb rein also goes through the martingale.  Forgot to say that!   Well I would certainly love to know what she called it!  That's been the main obstacle in searching, simply not knowing what it's called.  The closest I've come is a Four Ring Bolt Bit.  	56
 it's only fun when you can battle it out to the death with another person in a public forum..... ;-)   but it hasnt hit 50 yet tho                                                                  well.... because they ARE an example of everything to NOT do when your children have been molested.                  i know plenty of NASA engineers who list Star Trek as the motivating factor for them getting into the field of engineering. Science constantly takes its cues from Science Fiction. Science Fiction is nothing if not a dream of what could be possible. Engineering is then the pursuit to see those dreams fulfilled.                                                           yay!   crazy, i know, but i also meant to use it as a headline   Did you ever think that you would see the day where we hit 20k subscribers?                                                               yeah, i remember the amount of grief you got for that. i always say that you and others like you just goes to show that there is no ONE way to be trans. gender is fluid, and we're all just along for the ride.                                       just to show that the crazy wingnuts are completely losing it. the more ground we gain, the loopier their rhetoric                                                                                                         what i took away from it was that each of us pretty much walks our own path. sometimes they intersect for awhile, but essentially, each journey is unique                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	189
 But not just anyone was allowed to enter.      That's a pretty major catfish. That's also really weird for a 13 or so year old to do. Sext with 50 year olds? Did she actually seek them out?   Dammit. I was hoping to never have to relive that.   *In enters the most useless type of person on the internet*      I defiantly would've felt better knowing that Serial Killers scope out my house.   My main goal right now is to model a weapon/firearm for the game Fallout: New Vegas. So hard surface modelling does not seem like the way I will achieve this.    I am very very new to 3DS Max, and I was wondering how do I learn how to model. Is there any good tutorial series? How do you self teach 3d modeling?   **INB4 FAKE**   Gosh, fix game plz.   The cops arrived and found him hiding in one of my neighbour's front yards. So the situation is resolved.   I was already in the closet when I was writing this. It is literally one of the first results I got that looked somewhat like the car.   I took all of the precautions such as phoning Police, calling parents and asking a friend to come check it out. Yes, I wrote it on Reddit because I thought people might be interested about this encounter. Also, yes I am writing it on my cell phone.   I live in a fairly small town so we don't have a lot of Police Officers around. Although I just called my dad and told him about this, He just came home. He found the car, but he didn't find the guy.   He isn't entering or anything. When he pulled in and I saw the model of car, I ran to my room into the closet.    I already have. My parents aren't home. I am sitting in my walk in closet behind multiple layers of clothing.   So back along time ago when I was young around the age of 8 or 7. I was a really intelligent child, but I was also athletic so I played alot of sports. So one day I decided to go down and meet some of my friends at the basketball court near my house. It was a short walk I went down the street, took a right, then a left and I was there.   Except, this day was different when I was on the way there. I was stopped by the sound of the Ice Cream Truck's music. I took a look over my shoulder and saw a car following up behind it looked similar to this: [This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Volvo343DL1980.jpg)   I took a closer look but it was still far away, I was trying to get a glimpse of the driver. I saw his face and some of his details he had a huge nose, a fairly sized mouth but his eyes were terrifying to my 8 year old self for some reason.   He pulled up right next to me looked at me and said "Would you like some of my Ice Cream?" He was fairly tall to be driving that car so he looked quite squashed inside. I was warned of stranger danger constantly so I knew to walk faster and faster.   He followed me for a good 2 minutes, every 5 seconds his questions turned into shouts. He saw a car coming up the road then shouted at me. "I know where you live, and I'll be back!" I quickly turned around and ran back for my house and when I got back, I locked the door behind me and peaked through the blinds. Luckily he didn't follow me.   There was one small detail I didn't realise about this event because I was 8 years old, he was furiously masturbating in the front, and I no longer wish to know what he meant by "Ice Cream".   The reason I posted this is because I am now 17, and his car just pulled up in my driveway... **Please help me...**   No, everytime I go to the window I think that that guy will be there.   Teamspeak is the ultimate VOIP. Nothing can match it.  	20
    The poles shift. Bigfoot gets his own reality show. The Prime Minister of Canada turns in to a werewolf on live television. Cats and dogs living together. Miley Cyrus elected to Congress. Chaos.   I'm not as pessimistic. This is one issue where committed liberals and conservatives are pretty much in agreement. Yes, the "mushy middle" and "think of the children" people might support forfeiture, but politicians quite often cave under pressure that comes form *both* sides of the political spectrum. For every 10 soccer moms who vaguely support forfeiture, there's two left-wing and three right-wing activists who hate it with a passion. Passion often wins out over numbers in politics.    Before becoming an officer you must complete extensive firearms training in terms of safety, skills and tactics in most jurisdictions. No one is issued a badge after firing 50 rounds at a range. Even probation officers who rarely carry are required to do far more training than that.   I doubt that's true. However I have no problem with civilians owning firearms if they pass a rigorous background check and training program first. The point of this article was that even a pro-gun group found that just a "random dude" with a weapon can't stop a massacre. Someone with proper training, either police or civilian, might have had a chance.   There is nothing wrong with training police in military tactics. The problem comes when untrained officers are given military-grade equipment without knowing how to use it or when it is appropriate to deploy it.   No, *trained* people with guns did, not amateurs.         That subreddit sucks, actually. It's 90% "HEY GUYZ I JUS HAD MY FIRST LUCD DREAM XDDDDD"  Plus weird taboos. There was a whole discussion about chakras and and the third eye in which even some of the mods participated, but so much as mention shared dreams or dream characters having their own personalities outside of your subconscious, and it gets deleted immediately. I fail to see how one topic is any more or less New Agey than the other.      Negative numbers don't get equal treatment in mathematics. "-2" really doesn't get the respect as a unitary entity like "2." Instead, it's tradition to read it as "-1*2," so when you see -2^2, the tradition is to read it as -1( 2^2 ) = -1(4) = -4.  I personally consider writing -2^2 to be "bad grammar," since its meaning isn't clear as you've demonstrated by asking this question.  If we mean to say "the square of negative 2" we should write (-2)^2, and if we mean to say "the negative of the square of 2," we should write -( 2^2 )   Using combinations, since there are 13 animals total, therefore P(no cats)=P(all dogs)=(7C4)/(13C4)  So P(at least one cat) = 1- P(all dogs) = 1 - (7C4)/(13C4) = 0.9510  If you haven't learned about combinations yet, you can find P(all dogs) by doing (7/13)(6/12)(5/11)(4/10)           Zaman is part of the Gulen movement, whose leading figure, Fethullah Gulen has been exiled from Turkey and accused of Deep State - or State within a state - operations.  Yep. Another major activity of the Gulen movement is running privatized "charter schools" in the US with your tax dollars. They operate over 100 schools in the US, often with minimally-trained teachers brought over on work visas from Turkey.   Turkish politics overall is terrifying. There is not one "deep state" but several and they are currently at war. I remember one twitter quote from a few months back that said "unsubscribing from Turkish politics on mental health grounds." Anyone who looks into this subject will sympathize. It is one place in the world where pulp-fiction conspiracy theories actually stand a good chance of being not only true, but understatements of what's really going on.   His story feeds in to the "became great with no formal training or higher education" myth that people (especially Americans) love. Except that in his case it was actually partially true. Combined with the whole "paranormal" element to his story as I mentioned above, I think this is what makes him a popular favorite more than any "exoticization."   I am confused, what does this list have to do with Ramanujan?   I am surprised with all the awful "paranormal" TV shows around these days that there is not one that has devoted an episode to Ramanujan, as far as I know: *I'm not saying it was psychic communication with a Hindu goddess, but...*      This pasty white redditor who grew up in an all white suburb but then lived in iffy urban neighborhoods and then a suburban apartment complex with a lot of Section 8 housing for several years can tell you he's pretty much correct.   You make some good points, but as other readers have pointed out, Japan was prosperous when the Yen was less than half its current value versus the dollar. The CB has a lot of room to run before it encounters depreciation issues.   Japan was forced into the Plaza Accords, otherwise Reagan was going to give in to Protectionist pressure and limit auto and steel imports. The inflation and bursting of the real estate bubble did more damage to Japan than Plaza.   When that someone is the Central Bank of your own country, you don't really have any worries in that regard. Japan's economic problems come from epic mal-investment due to the all-powerful construction lobby and make-workism, not from a lack of demand for government debt.               By the time the bubble burst in 2008, the banks had a gun to the whole world's head, and our only choice was to either bail out the fraudulent bastards or suffer global depression and war that might have killed a couple of billion.  Or, you know, a rational restructuring that would have given equity rights to bondholders. A lot less dramatic than a nuclear holocaust, I admit, but far more sensible. Sheer corruption prevented this remedy, not the risk of atomic warfare.         There is the issue of information transparency, in that the Mexican consumers did not know that they were getting US goods instead of Mexican ones. The farmers in general did not want to leave their land.  [Here is a good summary of the impact of NAFTA on Mexico] (http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/11/24/what-weve-learned-from-nafta/under-nafta-mexico-suffered-and-the-united-states-felt-its-pain)   More like they are under a lot of pressure to pass kids who have a minimal level of knowledge or effort.   If I am ever in charge of a school, I would immediately ban crosswords, word bubble searches, coloring-in maps and PowerPoint "presentations" that are 90% pictures as homework assignments in high school. It is astounding how meaningless these assignments are - and how long they take. I hated them in school and thought they were on their way out (well besides the PowerPoint stuff).   Sadly, as a teacher 10 years later I see they are just as prevalent as ever, if not more so.   I guess it depends on whether or not you think 20% of a country having their way of life destroyed overnight and being forced into factory work is worth the other 80% having marginally cheaper food (in a country with a huge obesity problem already.)   Trying to limit trade will only decrease the tariff revenue.   Tarriffs impose an inherent limit on trade by raising the price of foreign goods as opposed to domestic goods. There are more marginal domestic producers in the market with a higher tariff than a lower one.  ut if you're trying to put more limits and regulations on trade that will actually be a bad thing.  The only regulatory limits to trade I support would be ones outlawing child labor or slave labor conditions, and egregious environmental pollution by the importing country. Supposedly the new trade agreements being negotiated have these regulations, but I'll believe it when I see it (and see it enforced.)   In the bizarro world of the inner city, a lot people make this choice for real (not endorsing it, just pointing that out.)    Completely orthogonal issues. You can have trade and free education if you want.  I don't think that they are. A badly regulated free trade regime makes it much easier to avoid taxes, starving the state of revenue that might have otherwise gone towards education health.      A subsistence farmer relies on his own crop for food, that doesn't mean he (or she) doesn't sell any of it. Even subsistence farmers need to sell some crops to buy fertilizer, pay rent if they are tenants, and buy equipment. Often they "pay in kind" for these items which means they pay in crop, but if the price of the crop decreases they can buy less than they used to, and may be and in Mexico often were forced off the land.   products get cheaper, that means that the people who live in the US can buy more.  Not if more of their income is taken up with essentials such as food, energy, education and health care which is what has happened.   [I thought this was parody... I guess not for everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QDv4sYwjO0)   I still don't see how the examples you cite show how the median household in the US has benefited more from globalization in the form of lower consumer goods prices than it has been hurt by it in terms of lower wages, higher food and gas prices and much greater job insecurity.   Rice and sunflowers? Those are niche products. Let's talk steel, textiles, tire and rubber manufacturing, electronics, all of which were once mass employers in the US but are now mostly gone.    Having had success with Monster, is there any way to distinguish the genuine job offers from the spam? That is the main complaint I hear about Monster, that 90% + of the postings are not legit.   When I used it in my job searches I had zero success. I had one callback, from a company that claimed to be Citigroup but was not Citigroup (instead it was a franchisee that had the right to use the Citigroup name for its financial advisory business), offering a job with no salary, only commission, when the posting gave a salary. From what I hear my experience is fairly typical of Monster.   Good things tend to come with some uglies, but there is no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  Agreed, but pour in too much water too quickly, and you don't wash the baby, you drown it.   Spengler was a pessimist like Schopenhauer who thought European civilization was ultimately doomed. He's part of the romantic Western tradition of the glorious loser who cannot prevail but fights on anyway because he is spiritually superior even if physically weaker. Once you're aware of this trope you see it everywhere in Western culture, from the religion of the Norse to Rorke's Drift to the Alamo. This attitude comes from the long history of Europe being less developed and less populous than the great Eastern Empires, and always in fear of being overwhelmed by them (especially the Mongols and the Ottomans.)  But like Schopenhauer who inspired a Nietzsche who was willing to "fight to win,"  Spengler has legions of fans in the fascist and far-right worlds who accept his diagnosis of history but not his prognosis. In my view Spengler has now become part of the "rhetoric of decline" that is used to justify right-wing views (our society is corrupt and decadent, it must become more disciplined because a big fight is combing with those other guys who don't look like us, etc.).      You are speaking as if free trade was literally sustained by violence   The sad fact is that this is often the case, from political repression in China to assassination of union officials in South America, to cocoa plantation slavery in Africa.     It's been around for a while, but one of the sides of the "dual" being conservative Christians is relatively new. The studios saw the pile of cash ol' Mel made with the Passion of the Christ and decided to get in on the game.   I would imagine a conversion, false or not, might stop such a person from torturing. Certainly this is what jihadists do. One of the reason ISIS is rejected even by other extreme groups like Al Qaeda is they have executed people even after forced conversions to Islam.   Also subsistence farmers are 1 draught away from famine, so it's not like it's all roses.  Somewhat of a myth, at least in Mexico. Africa that might be closer to the truth. There is (or was) enough community/state support in Mexico to counteract famines.   the borders may be a sad necessity in terms of order but it doesn't follow that arbitrary trade restrictions need to be bundled with it.   Not arbitrary. I do favor the gradual lowering of tariffs and immigration restrictions over time, but do it too fast and you risk a political backlash, economic panic, and collapse of the integration project.  If restricting speech and banning certain kinds of porn by people who claim control over pieces of land is considered bad, why is restricting/banning certain products good?  If you want to go with a porn analogy, right now we are allowing abusive porn where it is obvious that the women (workers) are being exploited/raped but we (investor class) get so much pleasure (profit) from it that we look the other way.  Full open borders would be like legalizing child porn and would be a moral and political disaster.   Almost all cars are made in high-wage countries (US, Germany, Japan). I fail to see the parallel.   Cheap gadgets is not real prosperity. A lot of families would trade in their computers and cell-phones in an instant if they could have affordable health care and college education again.  I agree that the billion people lifted out of poverty is a very good thing, but trade integration is happening way too fast. A neo-fascist actually has a good chance of getting elected President of France. Genuine Nazis sit in the Greek parliament and the Greek elections might lead to a radical left-wing government that has promised to cut Greece off from the global trade and finance system.  Yes these are extreme cases but they are also canaries in the coal mine. If there is another crash like 2008 we could see similar things in the US and that would make all the progress we've seen for naught. A Buchananite or far-left political party arising in the US if there is more economic chaos and inequality is not out of the question.   Cool, please share this with TracyMorganFreeman   why are you hating on poor people who would spend decades longer working in subsistence farming and in hardcore sweatshops?   No hate towards the sweatshop workers, but the subsistence farmers who are often forced off their land into sweatshops by free-trade deals that dump subsidized US agriculture products in their country might not agree that free trade helped them all that much.  In fact from purely utilitarian perspective it's better to lift billions from true poverty than to spare millions of special snowflakes some hardship.  I agree, but free trade doesn't always do that (Mexico is the country I had in mind above), and even when it does (such as China) if the disruption is such that it imperils economic integration through the rise of nationalism and ideological as opposed to pragmatic (and phased-out) protectionism then in the long run it is counter-productive.  Without lines of the map and people enforcing bans on shit, free trade would be a default state of the affairs.  Without those lines on a map, total chaos would be the state of world affairs. If you really want to see a race war, declare open borders tomorrow. I want to abolish those lines too, but it has to be done slowly. The past thirty years has seen this process proceed too fast, and it risks a big crash that will set humanity back.   Depends on who you believe and how you interpret certain passages. However, hell as a place of eternal torment is what most conservative US Christians believe, so that is what matters pertaining to my question, the cultural assumption, not what's actually in the Bible.   I fear your "proportionate to interest and ability" is merely a charitable perception of Title IX you've been led to believe, and not its wording or what the HEW's interpretation of it is.  Perhaps so, though I think that's what the third prong says. Like I said, time for an expert opinion. Knowing lawyers, they will probably disagree on the interpretation just like we have but it's worth a shot.    Well maybe we can get AskLawyers or something to weigh in on this because we're obviously not getting anywhere with this discussion because we don't agree on what "proportionate to interest and ability" means. I don't think the law operates the way you think it does but make a post on there and see what the experts say.   The recent torture scandal has me wondering how much of our acceptance of torture comes from having a mainly Christian religious background in the US. At first glance, torture would seem to be very un-Christian, love your enemies and all that, but what else is Hell but eternal torture for "bad guys"?   And if torture is something that God does, can a Christian say that it is categorically bad? And if a Christian meets someone (say a terrorist), that he is sure is going to hell, what's wrong with giving that terrorist a little foretaste of what he has coming to him, especially if you might also get some useful information?  Obviously this critique applies to all religions that believe in a hell, not just Christians.   If all you're able to show is that the average female athlete gets 10% more scholarship money than the average male athlete, I hardly think that's an injustice worthy of such outrage. Yes it should be equal not 10% more for women but that's no reason to get rid of Title IX.  You should read your own link: Schools are in compliance with Title IX if they meet *any* of the three prongs, whereas you are arguing as if they have to meet *all* of them.  Also an interesting tidbit in the article: Title IX has been used, though rarely, to increase the number of male sports or to give more funding to male sports as in the Kentucky case.   No they don't. Further the NFL does not do that at all; you're referring to a particular source of revenue that is shared among them; it's not the case for ALL revenue.  Nor is it for college athletics under Title IX. The salaries of the football coaches alone often equal the entire budget for female sports.   I'm not as equally productive as you. Paying me like I am doesn't prove that.  No, but nor are women's sports "paid" equally to men's. Only the *opportunities for participation* (proportionate to interest) must be funded equally. Like I said at some schools the football team alone is more than half the budget. If Title IX really meant an equal division of revenue, that would be illegal.    I spent under 5 minutes searching a single job site (monster.com) for the man's chosen title. After culling unrelated jobs I came up with 10 jobs within 50 miles posted in the last few weeks.  How many are spam postings that a company is required to post either because of internal policy or federal regulations? In the case of the former, the job has already been "filled" by an insider but they have to go through the charade of a public posting, in the case of the latter, it is usually so they can qualify to bring in a foreign worker under H1B or another visa program.  I don't know anyone who got a job through Monster, do you?   Hollywood has been doing the "dual marketing" thing lately, where they market the same movie as an action-adventure to mainstream audiences and as an explicitly religious film to evangelical groups. It has led to a bunch of Bible-movie stinkers in recent years (Noah, anyone?) because they have to appeal to both groups, kind of like those bland romantic comedies with some gross-out humor thrown in to get single men into theaters.  The success of a rather mediocre band called "Creed" comes to mind as a similar example from the music world.   but why would the third world slow down its economic development so the feelings of the well off west are not upset?  They wouldn't have a choice. Growth in third-world economies could have been constrained by a tariff system geared to some level of continuing median wage growth in the rich world. Tariffs could have gradually been brought down to converge the wage lines so that both still sloped upwards instead of the current race to the bottom.   Free trade agreements and open borders aren't a force of nature like electricity, they're a conscious policy decision. People are waking up to the reality that the impoverishment of middle America was not some kind of inevitable process. It was the direct (if perhaps unintended) result of government policies or lack thereof.     Equitably to them meaning either similar portions of either sex, or women guaranteed their interests met but men not provided that same guarantee, which means only thinking of one sex, which isn't equitable.  Women are not guaranteed anything under Title IX except that *if* they are interested and *if* male sports are also funded, then female sports must be funded equitably.   Disallowing the same rate of expansion that females have by mandating women's interests be met first  There is nothing in Title IX that says women's needs must be met first, only that they must be met concomitantly.   If you need special inducement-which by virtue of getting disproportionately more funding as I showed earlier-then you don't prove equal interest.  You did not show disproportionate funding, nor does Title IX require that. In fact quite the opposite.  Division I football is a huge revenue source  Right, and nothing in Title IX prevents head football coaches from being paid for a single game more than a lot of coaches of female sports will make in 10 years. Nothing in Title IX would prevent a school from taking all that money and using it to build a science lab either. All it says is that if that money is going to be put back into athletics, it must fund male and female sports equally if there is equal interest and ability.  I tell you what. Let's start a business, and as a rule no matter who works more or sells more, at the end of the day we'll split the profits 50/50.   Sounds good to me. Lots of law firms operate like that - as does (gasp!) the NFL, the biggest and malest sports league of them all.      I disagree that the law is a quota, because quotas mandate percents and Title IX does not, but that comes down to semantics. You don't have to fund *any* sports under Title IX, but if you do, you must fund them equitably.   There has been a huge increase in female athletics at all levels since Title IX (with no concomitant decrease in male participation by the way) which makes me think that millions of girls enjoy and take athletics just as seriously as any boy.  Look at viewership, participation, and funding of athletics outside the education system. People by and large value male athletics more.  When athletics is part of the educational process, the number of *spectators* is irrelevant, just as the number of people who watch the Math Olympiad vs. a Shakespeare play says nothing about how math classes should or should not be funded compared to English classes.   If you read the article carefully, he is staying in the union so that he has a shot at a pension, not out of some "brotherhood" thing.   Actually yes it still can be. If your quota for hiring is "X% of employees must be female unless none apply", it's still a quota.  Not really. It would only be a quota if there were mixed teams, but with separate male and female leagues for everything but ping pong, you can't call that a quota. It just says you have to fund male and female teams equally.  Well if you cut a female team you're not longer in compliance  If you cut *just* a female team, you're no longer in compliance. But if you cut one of each you're still in compliance. Title IX just keeps athletic directors from *targeting* female teams for cuts because of the perception that women's sports aren't as "serious" as men's.    Looking at the numerous sports leagues that don't rely on funding enforced by Title IX suggests otherwise. Title IX's quota mechanisms masks male interest.  You have not shown a single quota in Title IX - because there aren't any. A school where girls just don't want to do sports could have zero female sports teams and still be in compliance with Title IX. That's not a quota system.  And when budget cuts happen in athletics departments, they can't cut female teams.   I see nothing in the law that precludes cutting female teams for budgetary (as opposed to exclusionary) reasons. In the past female teams could be cut in tight budget times because "girls don't really need sports" or some such sexist rationale. Now there needs to be equitable treatment which I feel is a good thing.   "Responsive to interests and abilities" means that females at a school have to show an interest in athletics and ability to take part before Title IX kicks in, which is just what I have been saying. The huge increase in female participation in sports since Title IX shows that this interest is there. I would not say that males are vastly more interested in sports - watching sports, maybe, but not playing them.   This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.  This means a school is in compliance with Title IX even if they have more men than women in sports as long as those women who are interested and able can participate.   Please show me where in Title IX these requirements exist, I have not heard of the law being implemented or interpreted in this way. From what I know funding is on a per participant basis, not a pre-set quota.   Like I said, I don't think Title IX works that way. It simply says that if girls *want* to play sports, their teams must be funded out of the same pot as boys' teams, not that at a school with 10 male teams and 1 female team, that the female team gets half the money. If that were true it would be illegal for all-male schools to have sports and they obviously do.   All of that might be true, but it doesn't explain why this would cause a stock market crash. Why should a fall in the oil price mean that companies overall are less valuable? Aren't cheaper resources good for the economy as a whole, leaving long-term environmental issues aside?   If that is true I agree, but to the best of my knowledge Title IX only requires equitable funding *per student*, not that if a school spends $x on athletics, that "x" must be split evenly between men's and women's sports.       They may not be allowed, but when has that stopped anyone from doing anything, ever?  I don't know, maybe the chief saying "where's car 6?" and the reply being "Barry took it to Vegas for the weekend" isn't a good way to keep your job.   Probably not DDT since it's still such a notorious chemical, but there are plenty of EPA and OSHA regs ignored by companies in states like Texas. Especially if they are small they figure the Feds don't have the resources to come after them and the state does not have specific laws against what they are doing.   It does mean that if there are female sports teams, mens teams get cut, and since not all sports require the same kind of equipment, it doesn't equal out like people expect.  Big equipment costs relative to other sports are really only an issue in football as far as I know, and most football teams have active booster clubs that take care of a lot of these costs. I have not heard of any school cutting football because of Title IX.   The manager is afraid that the high-skill person will leave after a couple of months for cleaner, better work.   Or take his job. Or report him for a labor violation like overtime laws that his other employees are too ignorant to even realize exists.    Why are the people in the first world countries entitled to a better living standard?  We're not, and as far as trade improves the median well-being in the world, I am for it, but a decline in rich-country living standards imperils the political stability of those countries that are crucial to the political stability of the world as a whole (and imperils the whole free-trade project to boot.)   It's stupid policy in the long run. Third-world wages could still have been increased in a more gradual way to converge with those of the first-world without causing an absolute decline in first-world living standards.    Title IX legislation that functions in reducing boys sports teams when not enough girls are interested to form a girls one  That's not how Title IX works, it simply guarantees equal funding per student for male and female sports. It doesn't mean that the football team gets no money because there's no girls' football team.  synthetic phonics yield better results for both boys and girls than analytic(suggesting that those pushing for it merely wish for girls to outperform boys than optimizing education for children in general).  That's the first phonics-based conspiracy theory I've ever heard. I hope it is also the last.    GDP per capita in 2009 was $600, one of the lowest in the world. No accurate data available after 2009, as the country slid into utter chaos (aside from a few bits that managed to break away Kurdistan-style.) Funny definition of "healthy" from our buds at the CIA.   Nowhere in my post did I even mention government intervention to fix this problem  Or maybe we could talk about how we handle post secondary education in this country?  I hate to tell you, reforming that sector's giant debt drag on the economy will require massive government intervention, even though it was stupid government intervention (loan subsidies without price controls) that helped to create the mess in the first place.      Maybe, but cops on duty are rarely in a rush to get anywhere unless on a call. Remember, they're at work, on patrol. They get to the end of the patrol circuit all they do is turn around and start again. Unless it's a very small town, it's very unlikely that they're allowed to use a patrol car as a personal vehicle when not on duty.   And FOP licesnse plates/stickers = no tickets. I am one of the rare pro-cop liberals around these days, but that is one that has always bothered me. Some cops (especially state cops) don't like it either and may even go out of their way to pull over cars with FOP tags, especially if it looks like it's "just" a family member trying to use the plates to get away with reckless driving,    Of all crimes in the USA, armed bank robbery has the highest conviction rate... At 60%. Crime doesn't pay? For 40% of bank robbers, it does.   Unless they take enough to set themselves up for life, they're going to have to keep robbing banks. Chances of pulling off just 5 robberies without getting caught at a 40% individual success rate is just 1%. Most bank robbers are desperate drug addicts or people with a debt to organized crime and are quickly caught. There are a few exceptions (like the North Hollywood shootings) where an organized gang still attempts a bank robbery Bonnie and Clyde style, but those days are mostly gone. In the era of swipe cards the amount of physical cash at banks isn't that high anymore. A lot of the more knowledgeable robbers go after the safe deposit boxes and try to break in after hours.   The smart ones are in Congress.    I see at least once a month- a cop with NO lights on and NO siren speeding 20+ over- a huge safety hazard for all other vehicles on the road.   This means they're on a stealth call or pursuit and have been ordered to approach with lights and siren off so that whoever they're after doesn't get tipped off.  And don't say "could've been thru the light for a call" no he pulled in to Burger King.  Did he go to the drive-thru? Otherwise that could have been a call. Lots of drama goes down at BK, Wal-Mart, etc.      The comments on the NYT site give some very good reasons why people don't do this.  [I've summarized some of them in another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2p3d0q/the_vanishing_male_worker/cmtbb90)   We probably don't agree much on politics I'm guessing, but you make some very good points about the counter-productivity of *means-tested* benefits, ones the article and the comments on the NYT site also touch on, namely:  1.) Child care + cost of car + commuting would cost more than many of these low-wage jobs pay.   2.) "Job lock" syndrome where taking a low-paying job makes employers in your former industry far less likely to hire you, and also severely cuts down on your time to search for a job (witness the one guy who was fired for asking for a single day off to care for his dying mother.), and, if you get fired again, the fact that you had a low-wage job even for one day can reduce or even eliminate your unemployment benefits (I know this is true in Michigan.)  3.) "Abuse" of the welfare system by people making phony disability claims. The fact that SDI is welfare for white people is an open secret in Washington. There are counties in West Virgina and Kentucky where almost half of households get the majority of their income from SDI. You never hear the GOP screaming about cutting SDI, and for good reason, it's their most loyal voters who are on it. I know a woman who gets physically disgusted whenever someone so much as mentions Obama, and yet has been on SDI since 9/11 for "psychological trauma" from the event (she did work in New York, but not in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Towers). She uses her income in a so-far futile attempt to launch a singing career.  My solution would be to have a *universal* Basic Income and a *universal* health program and child care, this removing the economic dis-incentive to work that many of these men face, rather than just slashing these programs which will probably only increase the social destruction.  Fat chance of that happening in the current political environment, but one can dream.      The Christianization of the Viking kingdoms coincided with the end of the raiding period, but more than that I do not know. The pagan Viking religion emphasized strength and cunning, so I doubt that there were many moral qualms about raiding prior to the coming of Christianity.          I've never heard that way of explaining it before - I like it! I know that "rifleman" implies function (rifles only fire one projectile at a time), but you might want to make that clear to the OP.  Come to think of it, we can extend this metaphor and say that in non-function mappings at least one shooter has a shotgun instead of a rifle.     This is more like the Franklin Affair in the US then the Satanic Panic. Shady, shady shit that was never fully investigated. It might have been delusional people making up stories, or it might have been that some very powerful people were pedophiles and murderers. In the UK you also have the Libel Laws where journalists are guilty until proven innocent (opposite of US) which could explain the very careful and low-key nature of the reporting on this.    Putting downward pressure on mortgage rates helps regular folks.   Only those that already own homes and can trade on that equity, assuming that any gains they get from that aren't outweighed by the negative effects of financial repression on other forms of investment.  Any decrease in the interest rate just drives up (or maintains artificially high) real estate prices. QE is welfare for both the rich and the property-owning upper-middle class and unfortunately it has become the primary welfare channel in recent years. It is far from an ideal way to to help the real economy and has a ton of negative side effects.   I will agree with you as far as the treasuries go, but for the MBS side I really do see QE as fundamentally different - in my mind it's the difference between purchasing healthy cows for more than their milk is worth and purchasing potentially sick cows that give toxic milk (thereby encouraging the issuance of more sick cows - bad mortgages.) Both are bad, but one is far worse.   I think we're at the semantic lower bound of this argument.   It is a giveaway to banks greater in scale and different in kind than previous giveaways. Whether you call that "special" or not is up to you.   It is not special in terms of the monopoly aspect. It is special in that for the first time the Fed is acting as a purchaser of non-government assets and has circumvented the zero-interest constraint on monetary policy, allowing for a far more massive intervention in the markets than ever before.    Interest is a policy variable and doesn't have a natural rate.  So there were no interest rates before the government started setting them? Please...    Sure smells Ron Paulish in here right now.  I think you are confusing Paul's perfume with that emanating from us who want *fiscal* stimulus that supports median income, not *monetary* stimulus that, while staving off another crash, really only improves things for those who already own a lot of financial assets.   Its always Fed policy. That's how the system works.  QE is not always Fed policy. I have my issues with "normal" Fed policy also, but QE is something we haven't seen since the 30's, and never on this scale.    But you can't then argue that the public is getting screwed when they can purchase for the same price.  Yes, the public still is screwed because the price is higher than it should be. My (saved) dollar that I earned through actual economic activity can't earn its natural rate of interest as a result. It's called [Financial Repression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_repression).    The Fed announced that they will spend $1,000 on cows every month. Every month, an auction is held, and the Fed buys $1,000 worth of cow from whoever highs the lowest price in the auction.  And if there are not $1,000 worth of cows out there, sick ones still get bought. The mere fact that the Fed is in these auctions means the natural demand is not there, implying the assets don't really have these values.   In any circumstance, it wasn't the bulk of the purchases  37.5% of a multi-trillion dollar program is big enough to be considered bulk in my book.  As long as the values track over the life of the bond, who cares?  Because if this happens it is only because of Fed policy, not because of actual demand for the asset.    So when the Fed can put any value it wants on a financial asset, the meaning of an "equal-valued" swap is not the same as if these prices were solely determined by market forces.   To dredge up an old analogy from the 2008 crash, if I owned some sick cows and the Fed announced that it would give me a healthy cow for every sick cow I handed over to them, that would be an equal-valued swap in your book, because I could also sell my sick cows to other institutions on the open market for a healthy cow, since those other institutions know they could turn their sick cows in to the Fed for a healthy one.    It means that other institutions purchased it at the same price.  Based on the expectations these institutions had about Fed policy... Surely you know that when the Fed announces that it will purchase Asset X at Price Y, the price quite often automatically adjusts to Y and the Fed ends up not actually making any purchases at all.   Only the first mortgage purchases can be argued to be this, but I've seen no evidence to back your position  That's why I said "who knows what" quality. I have my suspicions but due to lack of transparency in these financial instruments we will probably never know.   They traded an interest bearing dollar for an interest bearing reserve.  They traded a bond with a fixed payment structure for a demand deposit. These are not the same thing even if they both bear interest. You can't argue they have "equal value" when the "value" on one side of the transaction can be arbitrarily determined by the Fed's authority.   So as you can see from your chart, QE was mostly treasuries.  Yes, but also almost 40% mortgage-backed stuff of who knows what quality...  It was a dollar of reserves for a dollar of bonds. Its a swap, like four quarters for a dollar.  What defines a "dollar" of bonds, their current market value or their face value? Only if it is the latter do you have an argument that it is a swap, and even then not really because the sellers in QE traded a future dollar for a present dollar.   QE did not just buy treasuries, it bought mortgage-backed securities as well. As for the treasuries, their value is determined by demand for them which while QE was underway was determined by the Fed. You can't say it was a swap for equal value when the Fed could put any value on the treasuries that it wanted.  [Here is a chart from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#mediaviewer/File:U.S._Federal_Reserve_-_Treasury_and_Mortgage-Backed_Securities_Held.png)   I got an unexplained $700 check of "helicopter money" from the government in either late 2006 or early 2007 - labelled as an advance on future tax rebates or something like that to keep things legit.   I think the majority of Americans got between $400-800 in that early stimulus from Bush, which was arguably more "socialist" than any of Obama's policies.    Its not free. QE was an asset swap of equal valued assets.  Equal-valued like all the supposedly safe AAA-rated CDO's that were bought with the bailout money? I doubt the swaps were really equal valued assets. I agree with Krugman on some points, but QE was a continuation of the bailout by other means.   I think he knows that, but does not want to criticize the "only game left in town," even if it worsens inequality, since it is the only thing left propping up the economy.       I suddenly started getting lots of scary visual images of a woman with a monstrous face saying she is going to eat my soul :(.   If you are a traditionalist, that would be a manifestation of Mara, the demonic power in Buddhism, trying to impede your progress. But yeah, I would just stay away from nosleep.   You seem to be right, it has dropped recently (though is still very high by European standards and is above the US native birthrate.)   And the reverse tragedy too: Too many are forced into higher education who don't really want or need it but see no other way to get beyond the McJobs level due to a lack of apprenticeship and training programs.    I'm not going to rush out to have a child, a life impacting decision, because the government's willing to write me a check.   Maybe not, but it might convince people on the fence, especially if there are strong services as well. The only European country to have an above-replacement native birthrate is France, and no surprise France also has basically free childcare. (This is not an endorsement of French economic policy in general, just saying they have it right in this particular area.)    Fewer people equals more resources per person. ipso facto.  Not really. Fewer people decreases the supply of labor, which is definitely a resource, and, depending on the type of immigration, of technical skills and innovation as well. If you are bringing in more working-age people which increases the worker:dependent ratio, the supply of labor/skills/innovation per person will increase.  I am anti-H1B because it is exploitative to the immigrants themselves and unfair to American workers who paid for their higher education (as opposed to countries where it is state-funded), but your argument isn't very good.   The savings will go to the shareholders as increased profit.  To the company acting as the supposed agent of shareholders, to be more accurate. And considering that Apple is already sitting on a huge pile of cash, it will flow right into one of the biggest "dead zones" of wealth out there instead of continuing to circulate in the real economy.   Only half of STEM majors work in their field - they may not be unemployed, but they are underemployed. Granted, not all STEM grads are engineers.  Also, sometimes the unemployment rate for engineers is calculated using only *certified* engineers. This is a selection bias because most engineering grads don't bother to get certified until they get a job (certification is time-consuming and expensive.) It's not like teaching where you need to be certified *before* you start work.   He willingly conflates the quantum mechanical definition of the "void" with physical laws and probability distributions already baked in with the philosophical definition of pure nothingness (which implies a state with no physical laws), and when called on that conflation, he responds that philosophers are not qualified to talk about physics. That seems pretty arrogant to me.   It's a shame because I used to admire him, but recently he's been adopting some really extreme positions - I think because his religious debate opponents have scored some points off him on the old "ex nihilo" debate.     I mean, when you combine super easy money with cheap oil it really ought to lead to increased economic activity.  Unless of course you massively raise consumer taxes at the same time...   He claims to have answered the Ultimate Question, but when you read the book he wrote about it... not so much. His theory is pretty much the same as the one in this article - it presupposes certain laws of physics that logically precede spacetime.   Assuming something cannot spring from nothing by definition, then 'something' always must have existed.  I would not assume that by definition. I actually think the eventual philosophical answer, if we ever find it, will be similar to the physical answer, that is, that nothingness is somehow unstable/impossible, and the logical fact of that is synonymous with what we mark as the first moment of time, whether that was the Big Bang or something further back. I don't find it tenable to hold that something has always existed.   I would disagree. Even if we accept the cosmos as eternal/infinite (which I don't, due to problems with Actual Infinities), there still remains the question as to why that state of affairs pertains instead of others.  If by "level IV" multiverse you mean ontological maximalism, the idea that all possible universes exist, that has numerous difficulties besides that of onotgeny.    The theory tries to show how spacetime itself can arise from quantum mechanics, which is fascinating from the standpoint of advancing knowledge in physics, but doesn't explain how the laws were established to begin with (the philosophical issue.)   ontology = the nature of being  ontogony = the origin of being   So according to this chart a Lithium-6 fission reactor would be theoretically possible? (though obviously not practical.)   This "nothing" already has the laws of quantum mechanics baked in - it might explain why the physical universe came in to being, but not why it was preceded (logically if not temporally) by these laws.  The theory in this article has little or nothing to contribute to the philosophical debate on fundamental ontogeny, unfortunately.         Well, that's what the Mormons believe...     it makes a lot more sense for their to be consciousness first and a universe created from it  I agree, but...  instead of a universe spontaneously creating conscious beings through a series of evolutionary missteps.  Both of these propositions could be true, they don't necessarily conflict. The Universe could be the product of a primordial consciousness, and our own consciousnesses could indeed be simply the products of evolution.  The interesting question is - why would the primordial consciousness generate thought-forms in which material simulacrums of itself come into being?         Pretty thin comfort.   Good. The cyber schools in my state (main company owned by a brother of the state senator who pushed the bill legalizing them) have curriculum so bad that I couldn't have written it worse if I'd tried.   But the relative cost of a mortgage only goes down *for you* if you experience wage gains that exceed the inflation rate.          The people in this riot are not the forefathers of the people that live in Istanbul right now.   Actually they most likely were. The Turks didn't just kill everyone in the Byzantine Empire when they conquered it. They interbred with the local population like most conquerors. More than one historian has pointed out that Constantinople/Istanbul has always been an unusually riotous city, right down to the present day.    And how do you know that Justinian didn't kill one trillion people? You weren't there, man.   Neat, I was unfamiliar with that notation - thanks for sharing!   I think you are right there is some ambiguity in what the sign means. It can mean "is not an identity," for example you could say a^b  b^a without raising any eyebrows, even though that statement is false when a = 2 and b = 4, for example.  On the other hand, a statement such as x  x + 2 is always true, and would seem to employ a stricter meaning of the  . I think you are on to something that the way to avoid this ambiguity is with logical quantifiers:   a,b such that a^b  b^a is always true, but it is a much weaker statement. The original statement isn't just true for some values of a and b, it is true for almost all values of a and b.  x, xx+2, on the other hand, doesn't seem to lose any of the strength of the original statement.  I wonder if there is an extended logic system with a symbol for "almost all." Someone wandering by these parts will probably know.    Is below-target inflation good for the poor?   Yes it is. When you don't have any assets that tend to move with inflation, and food and gas are major expenses, inflation is a killer.         There are a lot of conflicting interpretations of mahaparinirvana. It's curious that animuseternal identifies himself as Mahayana, as the interpretation he gives of "final extinction" is certainly not what is found in the Mahayana Parinirvana Sutra, which you should read if you are interested in this subject. The Wikipedia article isn't that bad of an introduction and there are some good sources to explore further from there.       There is a sad background to this quote - everyone in his family had died very young, like barely into their 50's. Mickey assumed it would be the same for him and as a result didn't restrain his drinking and partying.   parameters?   Classism?    Doesn't work that way for me, for some reason.   I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this. In lucid dreams I've always been tempted to touch or smell things and I'm always amazed at how "real" they seem, but unfortunately engaging more senses seems to make the dream dissolve.  Last night I had a good (if boring) lucid dream going where I was walking through a forest. I resisted the temptation to touch or smell anything and I noticed no dissolution setting in. Then, to experiment, I touched a birch tree and almost immediately woke up.  Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, have you found a way around it? I'd love to be able to do more than just look at stuff.      Or Fulton Street - going back there now and seeing upscale suburban mall style stores mixed in with the old used clothing and sneaker shops that are still around is surreal.   I think Lonelobo was referring to his blanket dismissal of all philosophy and metaphysics as useless or nonsense after being criticized for his "universe from nothing" views and not really having a good response to the point that presupposing the laws of physics is not "nothing" in the philosophical sense. Rather than responding with a real rebuttal he basically said philosophers are not physicists and should not be able to comment on cosmology - which is what got him called anti-intellectual by a lot of people.   Dune 84 is one of my all-time favorite films, I cannot understand the hate for it either, or why Lynch had his name removed as director. No, it does not do the book justice, but even a ten-hour movie could not do that. It is a different vision of the story and it is spectacular. I think the sheer weirdness puts some people off, but to me it is original, bold and peerless. No movie even remotely like it has been made since.   I hear it more in the opposite context, when someone is describing something new. For example, I know a "nature guide" who uses it a lot to describe animals or animal behaviors that his audience is not familiar with.   I would agree. It is definitely more rare in the city, but it's not particularly southern. Rural men tend to use it the most.   I've never come across a good explanation of this, or even what the phenomenon is called, but I hear it all the time in casual speech, especially when an "expert" is addressing an audience. For example, on a nature show, the host might say "That's your yellow-bellied sap-sucker" instead of "that's a yellow-bellied sap-sucker," or a political radio host might say "That's your Republicans, always saying [whatever]"  Does anybody know a name for this and how it might have developed?      If they asked you to use binomial, and then said you are drawing without replacement, that is a mistake. The proper distribution to use would be hypergeometric. Do you have a copy of the test with the exact wording?      It's gotten some negative reviews (including on this sub), but I found [Eyes of the Mothman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fmkz_RrQxU) to be quite good (age restricted sign-in required.)   I figured it had something to do with "e," and this explains why wolfram couldn't find a max when clearly it never got bigger than 1.4 something - thanks!   A question I am curious about...   Yep. Same reason China sees Tiawan as a threat. They can't use the "Chinese culture and democracy are not compatible" argument nearly as easily when a counterexample is starting them in the face.      I think in this sort of situation exceptions would be made. We saw how fast the government invented "emergency" powers out of thin air during the financial crisis. It would be even more inventive in the case where the President was killed by his own VP.               Weird... so he placed a paragraph by a fictional character he created in one of his other books, and didn't explain it? That would clear up why I can't find references to this person, but that's bizarre.  Edit: Actually, it says "a novelist" called a character "based on him" Emery Heywood, not as I first read your response to imply, that De Voto himself wrote the novel. Still this is intriguing and that result did not show up in my original search. Thanks!!   I saw that result in my previous search. I am sure it is a reference to the same person. I am not inclined to buy this book though just to see the footnote, because I am 99% certain it will just be a reference back to the Course of Empire.      Yep, nothing except links to the book itself (which tells me nothing about who he was.)   In the introduction to de Voto's "The Course of Empire," there is a very strange and poetic paragraph about the Age of Exploration attributed to an "Emery Heywood." I figured he was a writer or a historian and his writing style was so unique I decided to look him up to see what else he wrote. I can find no trace of any writer or historian by that name on the Internet.  Does anyone here know who this person was and what his (or her?) connection to de Voto was? I am quite curious now...          save them hood   Nope, I'm sure it's still there. It's a series of videos and the girl who created them is obviously trying to make a name for herself as a "teen advice" specialist or something like that. She has a whole channel. The video had like 60,000 views or something like that when I watched it.   Blond hair, long and curly, more than that I don't remember. She talked like the stereotypical "valley girl" which made it all the more funny.  	186

 The full expression is "deus ex machina", and it is a character or thing that suddenly enters the story in a novel, play, movie, etc., and solves a problem that had previously seemed impossible to solve.    Scarface.   Brits can't even spell "pedophile" properly.   We've done several city/state projects; I hate that lowest bidder rule.   Depends on the contractor, but yeah.  When doing above-ceiling inspections, I've seem some shady shit.   I'm caucasoid, yes.   Pretty much.  Lighting design is part of my job.   Man, just looking at that gives me [heartburn](http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/photogallery_heartburn_and_foods_dos_and_donts_01_full.jpg).   I laugh every time I see video of someone thinking a pendant light's support system could possibly support the full weight of a human.  People have no common sense anymore.   This GIF made me want to watch that movie.  I'm 34, but I've never watched it before.   Nope. Haven't tried it.   No kidding!  I think [Batley](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/73/78/1b/73781b667c5f69dbc9f003ab5bc8de49.jpg) was modeled after [R.L.

Have a pity up-vote.   Hey, look--a lot of people I don't find particularly funny...   I work in AutoCAD 2015 every day... but never in 3D space.  That's badass.  Might've been easier in Revit.   The U.S. government having orchestrated the 9/11 attack.  Too much plausible evidence supporting it.   More songs:  ["Bless Your Beautiful Hide"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5v76vifE8E)  ["Goin' Courtin'"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xxT0glNsQ)   When I first heard the plan that Maine was going, I cheered for them.  I wish every state would do it.  Force people to TRY before you give them free handouts on the taxpayer dollar.  No wonder Democrats hate it, they will lose their control over their voters.   There is no "right" way in math.  Math == getting_correct_answer   [This is part of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TygmMPbwfjA)   The songs, but the barn-raising scene (s) are the best!

My Fair Lady  or  Seven Brides for Seven Brothers      Bwa-ha-ha-ha!  What a stupid teaser.   f(x) = [x^(2+4)]-8  Just move the entire graph down vertically by 8 units.   I laughed when I read that America doesn't have a work ethic problem.  They clearly haven't gone anywhere in the service industry where I live.  Most workers just don't give a crap.   I think they are completely separate from angels.  They co-exist with human spirits in Heaven.  While human spirits exist in Heaven only to worship the Holy Trinity, the angelic masses server purposes or roles based on their level in the angelic hierarchy:  1st Triad - Seraphim  Cherubim  Thrones  2nd Triad - Dominions  Virtures  Powers  3rd Triad - Principalities  Archangels  Angels   Funny enough--it was me that misspoke.  This post is my fault.  I'm so, so sorry.   Reminded me of [this scene](http://www.tboake.com/images/film_images/fifth_element/fifth5/fifth5_web/cap161_resize.jpg) from Fifth Element.   Technically, all the beings God created had free will.  Lucifer wanted to be like God and create life to worship him.  THIS is what he started the war in Heaven over.  He convinced masses of other angels to rebel with him.   Not true; no one prays for demons or evil spirits either.   Christians pray for human souls.  Lucifer never was, and never will be, a human soul.  He was created as an angel directly by God.  He desired free-will, and turned away from God.  Prayers by humans could never reverse what was done.   For the lazy -- It's a link to "Let It Go" from Frozen.   I'd say he was 2nd best.   Nothing that useful.   Best character in the series portrayed by the best actor in the series.

Everything else is lagniappe.      How sad!  It's an epidemic!   "Wish my heavy husband would spend more time at home than with that zooka partner of his..."   Seriously?  Good to know.   That is freaking insane.  Another reason to tell my 3yo and 4yo to stay away from the cable and telephone pedestals in our back yard.      Yet another reason why I like Microsoft over Macintosh/Apple.  Steve Jobs was a huge, asshole-ish thief.   Electrical designer.  I design the electrical systems (e.g., lighting, power, mechanical connections, special systems, etc.) of buildings.      It's just the track-record of his shows.  My original post was meant to be sort of tongue-in-cheek.  I like that article though.    I know it was renewed after episode 1, but that can be changed if ratings don't keep up.  See my original post:  I know it was renewed after episode 1, but that can be changed if ratings don't keep up.   The not feeling empathy was a side-note.  As for Summer Glau, the only things I've liked her in were where she's playing robot-like characters (Firefly/Serenity and Terminator).  I wasn't a fan of her in The Arrow.   But he shows so little emotion that I don't feel no empathy towards him.  I care more about his psychiatrist than I do him.   Yeah--that's retarded as well.  That's why I don't watch pro sports.  Grown men/women getting paid millions to play a kids game... *smh*   Every television show that stars Christian Slater has never made it past Season 1... some didn't even complete a full season before it was pulled.  I know it was renewed after episode 1, but that can be changed if ratings don't keep up.  Don't get your hopes up for this show.  I've watched all the episodes so far, and I don't feel a connection to ANY of the characters--much less Elliot.   What the fuck is wrong with this country when a no-talent, screaming, asshole like PDP can make $7.5M a year when hard-working, bill-paying, child-raising people like me struggle paycheck to paycheck?!   Why change what worked.  I never equated spanking as hitting.  It was punishment given to me by my parents for what I did--it wasn't them hitting me.   56% of Catholics support gay marriage?!  What in the--?!  Having homosexual urges == not a sin.  Acting on homosexual urges == a sin (i.e., adultery).  If Catholics accept homosexual marriage, it would no longer be considered adultery, and therefore would no longer be a sin.  This, in essence, would be changing church dogma.  How are any Catholics for same-sex marriage?   Not a terrible parent. I've done the same thing to an older child.  Only step you left out that I would have done was spanking. I was spanked as a child, and it was effing effective.      Anakin Skywalker did not bring balance to the Force, because Luke and Leia were still alive--thus tipping the Force to the light side.   Yeah--okay. You're real and everything--sure...   Not a bad idea.   I agree. If they're going to legalize same-sex, might as well legalize them all.   That's what I get for trusting auto-fill on my phone. Snrk.         I was 2...   Note to self: Never go to Northern Georgia.   Former Papa John's driver here.  I knocked on an apartment door, and when it opened, the smell of weed wafted out.  Some skanky-looking blonde says, "Hey--come on in."  "Uhhhh....," I replied, "...okay...".  They had porn playing on the TV, and not only were the visuals distracting, but the incessant moaning of the woman on the screen.  They said to set the pizza down on the coffee table.  I went to do so, and realized that I had to miss the lines of cocaine they had ready to go.  She hands a wallet to a guy sitting there, and he hands me cash.  With a wink he said, "A little something extra for being such a nice guy."  I walked back to my car shaking my head, and expecting a nice tip.  After taking out the price of the pizza, it was a whopping $3.05 tip.  I should've called the cops on the cheap bastards.  HAHA!   It's SFW... there's nothing there except a woman in a shirt.  Did you try /r/GrossFingernails ?   I thought along the same lines.  [Reminded me of this old Disney cartoon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqEVYbPw9lI feature=youtu.be t=55s)   No, I can't stand that.  I have an older guy we work with on occasion (friend of the family) that calls me "Stevie".  I'm a grown man with three kids (one of which is a teenager), and he calls me Stevie.  SMH   Well, that was SO not worth the wait.   Psh--I wish I had been a hacker.  I had downloaded a few "viruses", but had no idea what to do with them.  HAHA!  I was not a l337 h4xx0r.   Pretty sure they had started killing it (hence the bloody-looking neck wound and knife-wielding, blue-shirted man), and it decided to fight back.   What's with the link in the "f"?   No.  I'm a 34yo man with nothing to hide.  I don't need my 90's "hacker" alias of "CorruptShadow" anymore.   Holy crap--how did you know my name?!   Exactly, I try not to be a dick, and to just be myself.   Um...yes...because I do.   Odds are, if it wasn't seen on the show, it's fake.   In Louisiana, where I live, it appears to be the "black culture".  I can only attribute the harsher viewpoints on the fact that the black culture in this area is gangbanger. I'd assume a gay gangbanger would be labeled as a punk and not "hard".  What are your experiences?   Clean neck (just shaved this morning).  I just don't like bad movies.

 Krugman explains the standard Keynsian argument on this as "my spending is your income": http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/opinion/krugman-the-austerity-agenda.html  Reducing income during a recession (what "austerians" advocate) cuts everyone's income, cuts spending, and further hurts the economy.      http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/10/12/imf-austerity-is-much-worse-for-the-economy-than-we-thought/         A bunch of articles by Niall Ferguson.

For Niall Ferguson, the commission of error is more than a hazard. Its a cherished way of life.

I did a searches for "austerity worked in europe" and "austerity ireland",  "austerity spain", "austerity portugal", and came up with results like the following.  These stories don't exactly make austerity look like a success.  http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/irelands-austerity-success-is-no-model-for-greece-340662.html   GREECE is being told to follow Irelands crisis solution of harsh austerity and acceptance of bank-and-bailout debt. This narrative conveniently ignores that the Irish recovery has been built on major human rights violations and the undermining of long-term social and economic development.  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/13/economic-austerity-ireland  But under the heartening symbolism of a free state restored, a host of troubling statistics remain, after five years of budgeting by bludgeon. Previously low public debt remains well in excess of national income, and although Dublin is currently proudly financing this through private means, any fresh bout of market jitters could send it back to the emergency room. The unemployment rate remains in double digits, and in a few short years, one young man in every 10 has left the country.

A third of the under-25s are out of work. Of graduates under 35 with a job, almost half earn less than 900 ($1,000) a month. This is the 500 generation, referring to the minimum monthly wage that many earn on short-term contracts in call-centres or supermarkets. Emigration is at levels unseen since the 1960s.   ... Antnio Costa, the former mayor of Lisbon, who took over as PS leader last November, promises to turn the page on austerity, saying it has produced nothing but poverty. Despite the bail-out, he notes that the public debt has risen to 130% of GDP, a level many economists see as unsustainable.        Which ones are you thinking of?  I have family in Spain, and my impression is that it's been a disaster there.   Not my comment - it's a direct quote from the article.

You're not the only one thinking this: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/04/greece-isnt-the-first-country-to-have-a-debt-referendum-does-iceland-provide-useful-lessons/         Ok, then.  From my own observation, everything that comes out of Steve Moore's mouth is a lie.   First of all, let's note that the author of this piece, Peter Rogof, is part of some far right wing public policy organizations "Let Freedom Ring" and "Frontiers of Freedom". He writes for National Review, Fox News' opinion section, and The Daily Caller,  So Politifact finds that conservatives are liars.  Two possibilities - Politifact has a leftist bias, or conservatives are liars.  Here's what Rogof says:   The fact that, as the Lichter study shows, "A majority of Democratic statements (54 percent) were rated as mostly or entirely true, compared to only 18 percent of Republican statements," **probably** has more to do with how the statements were picked and the subjective bias of the fact checker involved than anything remotely empirical.  Emphasis mine.  I.e., Rogof doesn't like the conclusion, so assumes that Politifact is conspiring against the right.    Here he is  quoting James Taranto in an attempt to refute Politifact:   As the Wall Street Journal's James Taranto has consistently reported, the fact checking business often  too often for anyone's good  turns on matters of opinion rather than matters of "fact."   Taranto is another right wing polemicist who is no doubt hurt that conservative statements are being shown in a negative light, so it's hard to take this opinion seriously.  Even the study, by another conservative (Rogof's professor) admits that Politifact pays equal attention to both Democratic and Republican statements.    The worst the author can find is that "PolitiFact chose to highlight untrue statements made by those in the party out of power", but there's no evidence that this amounts to selection bias.  Around the same time the study came out, it was found that [Republicans get twice as much air time as Democrats](http://thinkprogress.org/media/2012/01/24/410742/sunday-morning-talk-shows-featured-twice-as-many-republicans-as-dems-last-year/ ).  By this metric, it could be argued that Politifact is biased *against* Democrats (possibly in an effort to show balance).  In fact, [some on the left allege just this](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2012_01/politifact_keeps_falling_short034982.php ).  **TL;DR - this critique of Politifact seems to be nothing more than butthurt conservatives being exposed as liars**     The problem is that austerity can't work: http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/austerity-arithmetic  There's evidence that Merkel knew this. http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis   So why did they put the screws on Greece?  One hypothesis is that they want to get rid of the leftist government.   Interesting.  I just perused [his tax plan page](https://randpaul.com/issue/taxes ).  He sounds like a complete loon:  My tax plan would blow up the tax code and start over. In consultation with some of the top tax experts in the country, including the Heritage Foundations Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, I devised a 21st-century tax code that would establish a 14.5% flat-rate tax applied equally to all personal income, including wages, salaries, dividends, capital gains, rents and interest.  Wow.  Same supply-side nonsense peddled by the same set of repeatedly discredited sources.    Arthur Laffer's curve has been totally discredited, and has a couple of statements on politifact, one false and one half true.  Steve Moore on the other hand achieved a remarkable score: http://www.politifact.com/search/?q=steve+moore  * 3 pants on fire * 3 false * 4 mostly false * 1 half truth * 1 mostly true statement  I.e., 10/12 things this man says are falsehoods.   And then there's this.   We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obamas policies.  He needs to take his meds.   Thanks!   Who is that?   What  policy issues does your friend cares about that cause him to select Rand Paul?   Nicely done, sir.      This is different. Look at OP's submissions and comments.  And before you accuse me of being an Israel apologist, know that I've posted my share of Israel-critical commentary here on Reddit.   HA HA HA you are funny.  Please tell more jokes.      David Frum, GWB's 'Axis of Evil' speechwriter:  ["Imagine, if you will, someone who read only the Wall Street Journal editorial page between 2000 and 2011, and someone in the same period who read only the collected columns of Paul Krugman. Which reader would have been better informed about the realities of the current economic crisis? The answer, I think, should give us pause. Can it be that our enemies were right?"]( http://www.frumforum.com/were-our-enemies-right/ )   As GWB said, ["uniquely American, idn't it?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIjo-dWE1Jg )         Donald Trump, like other white supremacists, is spreading hate speech.  The Charleston shooter didn't just invent his ideologies out of nothing.  Words have consequences.   It's a republished  Reuters article.      Hmmm... point taken.  I ought not to have repeated his name.    I think one of the biggest reasons to support her is the fact that the next president will likely nominate one, two or maybe even three judges to the supreme court (should they be a two term president).   Yeh, I totally hear you on that.   Forget all other issues for a moment.   That is exactly what the DLC is hoping we all do.  It's a devil's bargain.   Not voting or voting third party could easily hand the presidency to the GOP and we can't allow that to happen  You know, I'm genuinely torn on this.  On the one hand, you're absolutely right --- the Republicans will be a disaster zone.  On the other hand, so will Clinton --- just not as much.  And it's important we look at it from that perspective.    The American system has been tweaked by wealthy elites so that we now have two parties which serve the same basic interests, with small variations between the two to give the appearance of choice, like Coke versus Pepsi.  The more similar the two are, the more hot and intemperate the debate becomes on the side issues.    Gaming this out - if Clinton wins, it strengthens the hand of the DLC.  They'll argue that their economically right wing, hawkish policies are the only way that Democrats can win.  And the elites win again.  And from another perspective, pledging your vote to someone --- no matter what --- means that you've given up your bargaining power.  The reliable Democratic voter can be ignored.  That's why things keep drifting further and further right on the economic front.    Rachel Maddow had a great think piece on this several years back: http://www.salon.com/2011/04/05/democrats_51/   **The Republicans may not love their base, but they fear them and play to them.** The Democratic Party institutional structures of D.C., and the Beltway press in particular, not only hate the Democratic base  they think its good politics for Democratic politicians to kick that base publicly whenever possible.   Only the base itself will ever change that.    Yep, and no coverage of the Wisconsin speech, which was the biggest crowd by far for anyone in the 2016 race, but three articles on Clinton.   Donald Trump said almost the same thing as  the Charleston shooter before he gunned down 9 people.  It's now over two weeks since that speech. The reason no Republican came out and condemned him (notice Jeb had to be asked) is that the party is filled with racists, and they can't afford to piss them off.   Let me put it another way - women already deal with a lot of body issues.  A woman reading this thread (I'm a guy, in case you haven't already guessed) is going to see a bunch of men ganging up on a woman based on her looks.  And she is a CEO and was a partner at possibly the most prestigious VC firm in the world.  I mean - there are so many male CEOs who've done terrible things.  But the conversation never takes this turn for them.  For a woman looking at this thread, the message is loud and clear --- even a woman who has reached such a high level in her career will be subject to low blows. It's a culture of intimidation.  It feels like a bunch of animals in a feeding frenzy here.  **EDIT** Here's Sandra Bullock saying essentially the same thing: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/01/sandra-bullock-women-attacked-in-media_n_7707290.html    What makes you think that the same couldn't have happened had it been about a man ?   Because that *almost never* happens, whereas it constantly happens with women.     I get it the people are flinging way too much. On the other hand, people are rooting for /u/chooter . I suppose she is a female too.  Disagree.  That people in the community are rooting for one employee who happens to be female does not make misogynistic attacks elsewhere in the site ok.   Do you think that all this shitstorm is just because she is female ?  Absolutely not.  Her lawsuit combined with her behavior towards other employees at KPBC, her husband's lawsuits and shady dealings all cast a shadow over her.  Her mismanagement as interim CEO then triggered the storm.  She should go.  There are lots of things to criticize her for.  Her sexual attractiveness is not one of them, and should not be.       Dylan Storm Roof before he killed 9 people in Charleston, SC:  "You are raping our women and taking over the country."     He's in sync with Republican voters.   No. [Backpfeifengesicht](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Backpfeifengesicht ).   Reducing a woman to her physical appearance is a form of misogyny.  It undercuts women's achievements and suggests that nothing is more important that their physical appeal.  Once we go there, it opens the door to all kinds of degrading commentary, for example:   Maybe she takes it in the pooper like a champ.   This whole thing on reddit is degenerating into a feeding frenzy.  Now, we're going after the basest kind of attack on  women.  I don't like what Ellen Pao did, but I'm so not on board with this shit.    Not all Liberal issues are of equal weight.  To my mind, economic  and military issues are paramount, and Hillary is only slightly better than, say, a Mitt Romney on this front.    Elites have managed to control the left by throwing them bones on social issues, while working doggedly to cement in place the neoliberal program.  Hillary Clinton is a part of this.  Her role will be to manage expectations of the left.  The money she takes from Goldman, Walmart and god knows who else, is to protect their interests.  Her behavior on TPP was absolutely disgusting -- giving the impression of opposition, while actually being one of the actors who was pushing it through.  We've had 40 years of this kind of behavior from Democrats.  In the long game, it leads to increased cynicism (look at voter turnout and ratings of our government).  I'm uninterested in another liar in the bully pulpit.   Some good supporting data here --- http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/no-puerto-rico-isnt-greece/   Seriously 133 upvotes for this?  I don't like what Ellen Pao and her husband have done, but this thread is becoming pure misogyny.  Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves.   Painful how illiterate old media still is about the internet.   The paper has a pretty interesting take on this idea.  I couldn't do it justice in the title.         Show of hands: How many would prefer a replay of what Nader did to Gore?  Please explain your fear that the Democratic party will run two candidates for President.

The only person telling the truth right now is Sanders.         I think he ought to get attention.  He represents the views of a significant faction of the Republican party --- he is second in the polls, after all.   Let them own it.     I don't think it's possible to give this man too much attention.  Just ask him.   Ok, so are you saying that people of African descent are genetically predisposed to violence?   Just curious about the rest of your argument.  Do you believe that black people are genetically more predisposed to violence than people with other skin color, or do you believe that it is their culture?  I'm assuming you discount that poverty is an explanation.   [White supremacist who inspired Dylann Roof calls Charleston a preview of coming attractions](http://www.rawstory.com/2015/06/white-supremacist-who-inspired-dylann-roof-calls-charleston-a-preview-of-coming-attractions/ )   seems a bit more likely than your theory.       Ron Paul was a niche candidate. Did you watch the videos of him being booed?   I have! They're heart-warming.  Already this is pointless.  You're not reading any of the evidence I'm posting, making stuff up in response and giving me flip answers.  Like this -    assuming likely primary voters know his positions (which, at this point, they do!).  Just pure made-up nonsense.    http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/ps/ps06182015_Sk32gth.pdf http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2224  == Sanders is still largely unknown (50-59% "haven't heard enough about him" to make up their minds).  Done with this thread.        In the best-case scenario, this was mere oversight and some unintentionally poor editing. In the worst, it is an attempt to stifle opposition within the Democratic Party  I think it's something different, more subtle and more insidious.  The reporters and editors are part of the Washington insider culture.  They all tell each other that Sanders candidacy is something not to be taken seriously.  If someone suggests that his traction is an important story, they'll be greeted with a smirk.  That wouldn't be the case if it were Biden or O'Malley drawing these crowds, of course.  But that is how institutional bias works - weak minds are shamed into conforming.         Embarassed.  Busy day, on iPhone, etc.     Tweets are good too   In San Francisco, only personal experience.  Studies in other cities support my view though:  From a bike blog:   Thirty-six percent of cars and 71 percent of bikes failed to stop, which averaged 60 percent non-compliance among all vehicle types. The difference between the behavior of people when they sat behind a steering wheel and when they sat atop a bicycle seat was significant: 34 percent more people disobeyed the law when they rode their bikes.  http://bikeportland.org/2014/06/05/lifestyle-column-observing-analyzing-portlands-stop-sign-culture-106867  Bikers are much worse for stop lights:   The report [PDF](http://media.oregonlive.com/commuting/other/SCI%20201%20Project%202.pdf ) is available here, and shows that of the 497 cars observed only 36 ran red lights, while 58 of the 99 bicycles observed blew right through. That's about 7 percent of cars compared to 58 percent of bicycles.  http://www.citylab.com/commute/2011/12/uncomfortable-relationship-between-bikes-and-red-lights/623/     Cyclists are *far* more likely to run through stop signs, though.  In San Francisco, there are definitely a contingent of self righteous assholes that flour traffic laws and act rudely toward drivers and pedestrians.  These people create a lot of bad will towards bikers.  **EDIT**: "flour"  "flout"    They were both incredibly popular niche candidates, loved by the fringe of both parties  *Ron Paul* was a niche candidate.  **Did you watch the videos of him being booed?** I notice that you haven't responded to that.  Ron Paul's main positions were *hated* by  huge swaths of  GOP primary voters.   Sanders, on the other hand, takes positions that the Democratic base *loves*.  If you think I'm wrong --- **show me the evidence**.    And it's not just the Democratic base --- his policy positions line up with what the American public actually wants, but few in Washington speak about: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/  Ron Paul came in 5th in Iowa with 10% of the vote.  Sanders is already polling second there at 33% to Hillary's 56%.  Also, you point out how Ron Paul was popular here on Reddit.  Notice how /r/politics is liberal?  Being wildly popular with a liberal audience might just possibly explain why he had trouble in the GOP primaries.  A [Zogby poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul_presidential_campaign,_2008#Polling  ) seems to confirm this - " However, Paul was first when Democrats and Independents were included in the survey."  The place where the two are similar is in recognition by the media, so I agree with you, Sanders has an uphill battle on that front.  But on the issues and alignment with the base and the American public, the two couldn't be more different.  Hopefully, that still counts.     Ron Paul supporters also claimed that his views were massively popular, both within the GOP and the country at large. It's incredible how similar the campaign dynamics are  That is a pretty weak claim of similarity.  It's like saying "they both have gray hair too.  Will Sanders supporters not acknowledge this?"  The point is: read my argument again, and show us the polls.  Ron Paul *was* out of step with the GOP base on several core issues.  He was even booed on stage during the debates:  * [In South Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8qtZ3I5AM) * [In Tampa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWnFKB9yL08)  The opposite will be true of Sanders.       There hasn't even been a debate yet.  The primaries are won one state at a time.  He's jumped to 33% (compared to Clinton's 52%) in Iowa.     because reddit is an echo chamber and none of these people are actually going to vote   Reddit and Iowa. http://time.com/3943994/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-iowa/   Ron Paul took positions that put him directly at odds with the GOP base - on the military, the drug war and mass surveillance.  Sanders is the opposite -- he is voicing positions that are hugely popular with the Democratic base ([and the majority of Americans](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/ )).     He has a lot of supporters in the senior demo, according to the NYTimes: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html     Sanders made it an issue in the primaries by releasing a statement that campaigns should be publicly financed.  Clinton then started releasing vague statements against Citizens United, but offered no plan.      There are reasons to view Clinton skeptically on this issue.  * No record to speak of until Sanders made it an issue * Long and close relationships with wealthy political donors who are opposed to progressive values * first Democratic candidate [to fully embrace super PACs](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-court-donors-for-super-pac.html).   * stands to gain much so from current system that  Public Integrity named her ["The Citizen's United Candidate"](http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/01/21/14140/hillary-clinton-citizens-united-candidate) last year. * Her behavior on TPP shows she doesn't necessarily mean what she says (see below)  * *  *  Remember how she feigned opposition to the TPP and released a statement [urging Obama to "listen to Pelosi"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/14/hillary-clinton-trade-deal_n_7580768.html )?  Just days later, [Pelosi capitulated and paved the way for fast track status](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/24/pelosi-backs-taa_n_7654954.html ).  In fact, [Clinton undoubtedly knew what many Washington insiders already observed](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/white-houses-secret-weapon-on-trade-nancy-pelosi-118565.html ): Pelosi was actively looking to corral votes for TPP in a way that would minimize political damage.  That is how politics gets done --- dishonest insiders like Clinton are experts at misleading the base.  She got the benefit of appearing to be against TPP, taking soft positions, being vague, and ultimately inoculating herself on this issue for those who weren't paying attention.  As it turns out, though she tried to pretend like she was against it, [she was actually instrumental in negotiating TPP](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-trans-pacific-partnership-obama-aide-calls-her-out-tpp-past-1975980 ).                      http://www.wmur.com/politics/wmurcnn-poll-clinton-suddenly-in-a-tight-battle-with-sanders-in-nh/33776056  He's now within 8 points of Hillary in NH.       Agree with your take.  Many remakes of 90s action classics are terrible --- arguably, modern action films are often terrible. There's a great piece on the rise of Chaos Cinema that explains what happened:  [Chaos Cinema Part 1](https://vimeo.com/28016047) [Chaos Cinema Part 2](https://vimeo.com/28016704)   How is it possible to test this?    Finally?  I've been using that for years.      "Here are facts"  "Downvote"  Ah, Reddit.      [The moment when she realizes... ](http://i.imgur.com/jn6SEGL.png )      [Nice, Ron!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o_kH5tAggk )   Brutal.  Get rest!  Do you mean these Qunnipiac polls?  http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/ps/ps06182015_Sk32gth.pdf  http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2224  Sanders is still largely unknown (50-59% "haven't heard enough about him").  Still Clinton has commanding leads, and as retch-inducing as it is, 75% find her "honest and trustworthy".  What idiots.    The greatest public speaker of our generation  Where did you pull that one from?   I never thought Ron Paul had a snowball's chance in hell.  I grant that Sander's chances don't look great, but the fundamentals are quite different.   Ron Paul took positions that were diametrically opposed to the GOP base (and thus attractive to people here on Reddit).  Sanders takes positions which are wildly popular with the Democratic base, and which have been ignored for years by third way Democrats like the Clintons and Obama.  There is pent up demand for Democratic leaders to get back to their roots instead of being just another corporatist party.  From this perspective, the primaries are "in play" for Sanders much more than they ever could have been for Ron Paul.  He looked like the crazy uncle in the debates because *everyone* in the audience thought his positions were nuts.  That dynamic will be reversed for Sanders.  Clinton will be seen to be prevaricating and evasive on issues the Dems care about most.    When they happen, watch the debates then compare with what happened with Ron Paul and then see if you agree with me.   No contest.  Those 300 channels of high def TV, cell phones and the internet are far less important than the security of knowing you can own a home and send your kids to school.   Interesting -- do you have a link to those numbers?   Ron Paul was at odds with the GOP base on surveillance, military intervention, the drug war and other issues.  Not so with Sanders.   Nope!     % was missing.  Sorry.   His platform is what the majority of Americans actually want.  Look at the numbers: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/   She was the guaranteed shoe-in last time too.   Yeh, it was horrible - the middle class expanded and he had one of the highest approval ratings of any President.   Lots of people said a dude named Hussein wouldn't stand a chance after 9/11.   Only people who weren't paying attention thought Obama was a progressive.  During the primaries, he praised Reagan, built his platform on the idea that bipartisanship was the solution, sided with the telecom giants on mass surveillance, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive challenger Ned Lamont, and even jested about how progressives were fooled in thinking he was one of them.  And the list goes on.  People who were paying attention back them pointed that out (I was one).       A guy named Hussein for President after 9/11?    Nah.           I am not sure about are his support of universal healthcare (we're 10x the population of Canada, I don't think it's as simple as he thinks it is)   How does the size of the country change whether universal care will work or not?    I don't think it's as simple as he thinks it is) and what I think will be a permanent barrier to joining the upper class (huge taxes on $250k+ households, I think that number should be higher)  What are the specific numbers you object to?  To my knowledge he hasn't said what taxes he believes should apply to $250K+.  I know he's talked about taxes on the top bracket and mentioned the rate under Eisenhower, but he only ever used that as an example of what Republicans not too long ago considered acceptable.  His point: we had widespread prosperity under those conditions and we've drifted far to the right on this issue   The difference between him and Ron Paul is that Ron Paul was badly out of step with the base (and GOP donors) on a number of issues: mass surveillance, militarism and drug laws.  Sanders, on the other hand, is in lock step on all the major issues and the long frustrated desires of the Democratic base -- and to an extend, the American public.  It's a completely different story.  It's the reason he's drawing the biggest crowds of anyone in the race.   Let's get Sanders elected, then we won't have to cajole Clinton to "get serious" about climate change.  Her passions on the subject will only last the duration of the primaries anyway.         I think you're still not getting what I'm saying.  Protection of private property is not natural or given.  It tilts the playing field towards people who own property.  The Walton family can pay slave wages to people who do real work while they do very little real work because the government provides free protection of their property.  At the same time, the Waltons don't want to pay for universal health care, social security or other benefits.     You're misunderstanding me.  I don't believe in private police *at all*.  Quite the opposite.  My point is that the police are a socialist service that mainly benefits the rich.  The wealthy then turn around and hypocritically complain about socialist services which benefit the vast majority of the people --- like healthcare, free schools, environmental protections, etc.    TL;DR Government ought not to provide services which disproportionately benefit the rich unless it also balances this with equal benefits for the rest.   Hmmm - I might agree with you.  Hillary has already started shifting her position on campaign finance and lobbying to win the primaries.  Will voters be sophisticated enough to understand that she only started saying these things after Bernie made them an issue *and* started getting traction?  Will they realize she'll drop progressive priorities after she gets elected like Obama did?    I think Sanders's hypothesis is that he can activate people who've dropped out of politics out of disgust who will see his principled campaign as the only hope of avoiding, as he puts it, a slide toward complete oligarchy.  It's an unusual hypothesis to be sure, but some of the numbers --- the approval rating of Congress, low voter turn out, and the swelling crowds for his underfunded campaign --- suggest he might be onto something.  I agree, though, it's an unusual strategy.     You might be right, but  how does slinging mud win that battle?      I stand with the NRA in blaming the children for not carrying guns.   The most consequential socialist program of all is the police and judiciary.  They provide free protection for "private wealth" and contracts.  It is this free service that allows the Waltons to negotiate and maintain lopsided contracts with their workers, while they themselves do little real work.  Of course, the wealthy are big fans of that particular socialist program because it benefits them most of all.   He's drawing huge crowds because people are sick of the same old bullshit.   Could you unpack that a bit --- not disagreeing with you, just want to understand.  What are some examples of him assuming things about what people know, and how could he do better?   That's a sensible analysis, and without a doubt having the media and money on your side are a big part of winning the primaries.  However, another not insignificant part is whether primary voters actually agree with you.  This is where the similarities between Sanders and Paul break down.  Ron Paul, while wildly popular with Libertarian independents, took positions that put him at odds with GOP primary voters.  Namely, his positions on mass surveillance, drug laws and military intervention.  Large parts of the GOP base, and certainly the GOP money, found these ideas absolutely unacceptable - in fact, crazy-Uncle unacceptable.  Add to this the near total domination of right wing politics by Fox News, and it's hard to see how people ever thought he'd have a chance.  Sanders, on the other hand, champions policies which are what Democratic primary voters want, and this at a time when there is rising frustration with the direction the DLC leaders have taken the party.  Clinton's support for NAFTA, surveillance, war, and lobbyists put her directly at odds with the actual policy preferences of Democratic voters.  The "liberal" media, while still actually biased against Sander's brand of populist anti-corporate policies, is more diverse, and Democrats get their news from a wider variety of sources, many of which are online.  The debate is controlled, but less easily so on the Democratic side.    **TL;DR Many of Paul's policies were controversial with the base, but the opposite is true for Sanders.  Also, liberal media is more diverse than on the right, so Sanders has a chance of getting his message out.**   I guess you think the President is the one giving the orders?  Interesting.   Yeh, we should only do that to Muslims.   A waste for her to be in the VP role.  Much more she can do as a support in the Senate -- or in a role in the cabinet.   In general, I agree --- Hillary has huge "view negatively" numbers, which will be very difficult, likely impossible, to erase.  Sanders is low because he is unknown.  Still, the challenge remains for Sanders to get the word out to those groups - as it remains a huge opportunity for him to boost his numbers and carry his momentum to the next level.   Clinton has 72% minority support versus 5% for Sanders. http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/bernie-sanders-surging-among-white-democrats-others-love-hillary-n369251.      http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/bernie-sanders-surging-among-white-democrats-others-love-hillary-n369251   In a new Washington Post/ABC News survey, 56 percent of white Democrats backed Clinton, while 14 percent supported Sanders.     **But among non-white Democrats (the survey did not break them down by ethnicity), Clinton had 72 percent support, compared to 5 percent for the Vermont senator.**   Griping about the media isn't going to get Sanders elected.  If we want to see him as President we should confront this challenge.      I guess people needed a /snark tag for that one?   Capitalism polls at 39%, Socialism at 36%.   Totally ridiculous regulations, in retrospect.     You should also take a look at this: http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/06/like_it_or_not_sanders_socialism_is_mainstream_edi.html   You're arguing that Hillary is electable, so we should elect her.  But Clinton is a dyed in the wool neo-liberal, and many of her actual policy goals are directly opposed to core progressive values.  She believes in bailouts for bankers, mass surveillance,  deregulation and lobbying.  The electability argument is a canard that has lead to an ever rightward shift in our politics.  Clinton/Obama third-way Democrats have lead us to a point where the current Democratic Party is far to the right of Nixon, and Congress is viewed less favorably than cockroaches.  "Rape papers" and "socialism" seem like a joke compared to the litany of problems surrounding Clinton.  And let's remember that she has the highest net negative ratings of any politician currently running.  The inside-the-beltway media has poured it on thick to create an aura of inevitability around Clinton because she is one of them.  She is at her absolute peak now, and can only go down.  Negatives don't go away.  She's lost before (to a black guy named Hussein in the post 9/11 era, no less) and she will lose again.  On the other hand, the more people learn about Sanders the higher his numbers go.  Yes, he can and will win the black vote --- once they learn about what he stands for they will be his most loyal supporters.  It's just a matter of getting the word out.      Quite right.  I welcome Hillary Clinton's lies!   He and Mika are perfect representatives of the Beltway nattering class.        Floridians voted for this shit.   LOL.  Thanks for proving my point.      So no police in your ideal world?   Being forced to buy something doesn't solve anything except affecting your right to self-determination.      When the government stops forcing me to pay for cops that help the Walton family protect their enormous wealth, I'll agree with you.   LOL.  Politico is desperate for an angle to throw cold water on Sanders.    Show them this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEM2iDT-VAk   Dammit - that was a good speech.  No one has talked like this man in my lifetime.   "Can't afford police and judges?  We'll force you to buy it then!" -- the basis of our private property system.     Don't forget that [she's a proud board member of Walmart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoCPRSrScG8 ).  And that she wants you to know [that she will continue to take money from lobbyists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaAkcXynqLA  ). Lobbyists "represent real Americans", and thinks that "the idea that somehow a contribution is going to influence you" doesn't apply to her.     Don't be convinced by a terrible, short-sighted argument.  For example, consider [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/39aot7/bernie_sanderss_great_idea_free_public_college/cs2xyvx ).   The reason this is possible is the same reason that workers everywhere (blue and white collar) are having wages stolen from them: unequal bargaining power.  The rich have little need for money, so they can be all that more demanding in contract terms, which leads to workers giving up more of their labor for less, and the wealthy becoming wealthier *because* they are wealthy.  This is not a natural system --- it was created this way.  Wealthy right wingers argue that we should socialize costs for the protection of property but not for anything else.  Of course, this just happens to benefit them the most.    Who has articulated details of their policy positions at this stage?   Jail would be the preferred way to wreck Jamie Dimon's shit, IMO.   RTFA   The ability of Wall Street traders to "own" assets isn't free either.    It derives from the free protection given to property owners through our system of police and judges.  The state creates the ability for those trades to happen.  It ought to tax that non-productive economic activity.   If degrees aren't worth the time, people will stop going to college and start picking vocations.  But, currently, degrees *are* worth the time:  |        |         |        |       | |------|-------|------|------| | Type of Degree | Annual Median Salary (2011) | Gender | |High school diploma | $40,050| Men| |High school diploma | $30,010| Women| |College with no degree| $47,070 |Men| |College with no degree | $34,590 | Women | |Associate degree | $50,930 | Men| |Associate degree | $39,290 | Women | |Bachelor's degree | $66,200 | Men | |Bachelor's degree | $49,110 | Women | | Master's degree | $83,030 | Men | | Master's degree | $60,300 | Women | | Professional degree | $119,470 | Men | | Professional degree | $80,720 | Women | | Doctorate degree | $100,770 | Men | | Doctorate degree | $77,460 | Women |  What you're arguing for is maintaining the wages of high paying jobs by limiting the number of workers, and limiting those with access to those jobs to  the children of those who can afford to pay, which leads to an increasingly class-stratified society.    In any case, both white collar and blue collar jobs will come under pressure as robots do more and more of work.  The deeper problem is that our economic system produces more than enough for everyone, but increasingly only a tiny few reap the rewards.    Education is not just about creating workers for business owners to exploit.  That is only a relatively recent view that was put forward by conservatives in the 80s.  Personally, I think it is an extremely narrow and poisonous view.  It is worth remembering [what Thomas Jefferson said on the subject](http://politheo.com/thomasjefferson.html ):   An enlightened citizenry is indispensable for the proper functioning of a republic. Self-government is not possible unless the citizens are educated sufficiently to enable them to exercise oversight. It is therefore imperative that the nation see to it that a suitable education be provided for all its citizens. It should be noted, that when Jefferson speaks of "science," he is often referring to knowledge or learning in general. It is about creating a thoughtful and informed citizenry.  An educated citizenry capable of critical thinking is a precondition to a functioning democracy.    That is what this bill is about.  The people of the United States should be smart, educated and rational regardless of their social station.  In an increasingly technological society, it is imperative that voters can understand and deliberate the issues of the day.  That may sound incredibly old fashioned, but just 30 years ago it wasn't.     Make a condition for public funding: a maximum student/teacher ratio.   The financial transaction tax is a good idea all by itself: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120755/chris-van-hollen-financial-transaction-tax-would-curb-risky-trading   By this reasoning, we shouldn't pay for elementary and highschool so we can increase the value of these degrees too.     The real answer is that we ought to have an educated workforce.  To the extent that the market isn't interested in those degrees, it will be a waste of time to pursue them, which will reduce demand for those degrees.  Free education is about creating a level playing field.   I'm liberal and think that Obama's record on surveillance is illegal, virulently anti-American and ought to be grounds for impeachment.  That said, WTF does it matter how /r/politics happens to have voted on that issue have to do with this thread?  Nothing.   It's a separate issue - and you need to show stats.  How many posts have been submitted overall?  What is the likelihood that a post will hit the front page --- what if it hits the front page on a closely related reddit?  How many upvotes/user do Obama-bashing stories get on /r/politics versus r/news?  Bitching about some specific news item not getting traction is pretty meaningless.   RTFA.      I'm not a big fan of Dawkins, but this is little more than a hatchet piece.  No quantitation - just a lot of opinions of from the writer.   The guy who secured funding for the internet and identified global warming as a threat.  What a bore.   I'm sure he won't do it again.   Pay to play    - Clinton logic      He was known for silly gaffes, in a way that sometimes made him seem loveable and sometimes the butt of jokes. http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1895156,00.html   Here are the examples he cites:  * a student(s) complained he debunked the idea that policies helping black people caused the housing crash * a student(s) complaining that he "possessed communistical sympathies" * an abortion debate being cancelled because it might imperil the "welfare and safety of our students" * an Afropunk band's presence would not have been "safe and healthy"  Excuse me, but all of these sound explicitly like or hint at *conservative* oversensitivity, not a problem with "liberal students" as the title says.      I think he didn't attend the meeting where she told the rest of Wall Street she's just lying to win the nomination.      Snide idiots - they don't like that someone who's not part of the Washington insider crowd is attracting so much attention.  This is how they respond.   A famous economics news site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Hedge      Idiotic yellow-journalism bullshit from the NYTimes.  Sanders is out-raising and outpolling  many members combined of the Republican clown car, who mainstream outlets like this treat as Very Serious and deserving of reverence and respect.  Yet, we get this kind of sneering bullshit from "the paper of record".  They continue their descent into irrelevance.    	189

 One of my favorite things to do on board was watch for flying fish.  I work in the engine room, so i would make a point to get out on deck every coffee break and walk up to the bow.  To my knowledge, flying fish only jump when they're threatened, so we'd be sailing through apparently lifeless water, and intermittently we'd hit a patch of them and they'd make these zig zag ripples on the surface as they shot out in every direction.  especially in the Arabian Sea, where the water was crystal clear and always calm, we would go for days where I could count hundreds jumping out of the way of our bow.  I think that Planet Earth does a great job of showing what our oceans are really like.  While it is mostly open and void of larger life, there are always small things like plankton, krill or sea grass, and the oasis where larger life can flourish are plentiful and very different from one another.  Just the color difference alone between the different oceans is really significant based on the makeup of the water and the microorganisms that live there.  After doing a few 4 month trips across the ocean, I realized that I'd rather stay around the Coast of the US.  There's more money to be made on smaller ships and rigs working in the gulf, and I'd rather see land and have time off in frequent bursts than sail a few months and have a few months off.    	1
    Yeah as others have said, it's a huge pain in the ass to reunite dog and handler like in this case. I think I watched a documentary a while back where a former EOD soldier had an IED go off near him which paralyzed him from the waist down. His dog survived and it took them about 5 years as well to get the dog back to him. He described the situation to be extremely frustrating and that it was unbelievable how many loops you have to jump through and paperwork you have to fill out to get a service dog once they 'retire'.

The above-linked video has been circulating since 2009 and is variously reported as an audition for the television showArmenia's Got Talent,Poland's Got Talent, orRussia's Got Talentgone horribly wrong, a haplessly comedic "William Tell" act that ends with one participant taking an arrow straight through the head. No program by any of those names exists, however, and the set shown in the video curiously features only generic signs and props reading"Talent" in English  no fuller program name is displayed, no signage bearing anything written in the language of the country in which this program supposedly aired is evident, and no one in the clip speaks a word of dialogue.  The video can be pegged as fake for a number of reasons, chief among them that if such a horrible accident had truly occurred during the recording of a television show, it would not have been broadcast, and so we'd expect to be viewing the action "raw" as captured by a single camera. Yet the clip has obviously been cleanly edited (to include cuts to the judges' reactions) and has been subject to post-production (to add graphic overlays), simulating the appearance of something that was prepared or aired as part of a finished program. (Notto mention that the bowman fails to evince the least bit of horror or surprise at having "accidentally" shot his partner in the head.)  Some have speculated that this clip was a viral promotion for theCULT Colaenergy drink, a can of which the "victim" ostentatiously takes from one of the judges and places atop his head (with the label properly facing the camera) after failing at multiple efforts to balance an apple on his noggin. However, most likely it was merely intended as a spoof of the modern talent show genre.

 ah yes, was hoping for something like this :)      What if a consumer wants to own two watches?  You know, because fashion...   Glad somebody else sees this.  Putting the computer on the wrist is analogous to what happened with watches over a century ago when they moved from the pocket to the wrist.  I can only imagine there were similar Luddites back then who complained along the same lines..."why do I need a clock on my wrist when I have it in my pocket?"   Kinda reminds me of the "Other Music" skit starting Aziz Ansari from a few years back, except that skit was actually funny https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YN1mKiQbi4g  	5
 Kick-Ass was Icon, which is owned by Marvel.   Fuck that noise. Football stadiums should be loud.   Iggy wasn't even mentioned until he did.   In fairness on the engagement ring, that was his idea. If you want to wear an engagement ring to show you're engaged, you should either wear it or no. Don't go half ass.   At least a few years ago there was free food after most home games in the lafun ballroom with games and stuff to try to keep people from drinking.   Indiana still has a shot!   Largest for either team is 38 in 03 and 07. Could also change.   Tommy also managed to fumble without being hit.   He already is.   Both.   Yes.   He plays offense.   Michigan playing catch up ball on the timeouts.   Get used to it.   That first scene, though.   I also feel like they're more likely to be blond.   People who don't understand the genius of Wayne, 2Chainz, and Juicy J.   The Right Reasons podcast brought up a great idea for future seasons. After 3 or 4 weeks or so of the same couple giving each other roses, they  "graduate" and aren't on the show anymore so we don't just have Marcus and Lacy in the background all the time.   Who doesn't want a coach that can go to bowl games as an assistant?   Navy has to be the most consistently underrated team in college football.   Or the military.   Car crash cancer is a serious issue.   Hey Tommy outran SBPD. He got tackled by a cab driver. It's really just a shame Jesus Cab moved because if it was him that would make the story even better.   That's not people misunderstanding the movie though.   That song gives me ptsd.   Do you even internal rhyme?   I mean there's easier majors but you're going to have to do a decent amount of work no matter what your major is.     Nothing compared to the Katies though.   Knott was definitely one of the more lax dorms though. Was with Brojo anyway, not sure what it would be like this year.   They don't like Kevin Hart but they like Carlos Mencia?   Someone's never listened to Jessie J. She pretty explicitly says it's not about the money.   Pants on the Ground is a pretty solid song though.   The fact that we were playing in the worst national TV matchup ever that wasn't Army-Navy was pretty bad that year, too. At least we beat Duke in that game.   Does he not know how old he is?   How do you not like the line "When it Waynes it pours"?   If you go opening weekend most people will stay. I saw Cap 2 the 2nd weekend and almost everyone left when the credits started.   You can do it in closer to 3 or 3 and a half now that you don't have to go through Kokomo anymore.   The O.C. had an awesome theme song.   The Topanga would be a decent name for a ship.   He landed on both feet!   He was upper middle class once he got on Degrassi. He lived in a pretty poor neighborhood for most of his childhood and was in a nicer one later because his mom was renting part of a house there and going in to debt doing it.   So we're talking about Miley when we say making a teen a pop star? Because they've been doing that for a while.   At what age did you still have to be at the bottom? Drake wasn't exactly rich growing up. He was 15 when he got on Degrassi. Is it only starting from the bottom if you were still poor when you were 18?   Nah, all Devin Hester all day.   The one and only Yeezus.   Probably Beer 30.   Love Actually's gotta be up there.   You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't!   Which is funny because the big knock on Oden coming out wasn't his injury history at all, it was people questioning whether he liked basketball enough.   I particularly enjoyed some of his other work, like "White People Who Attack Other Whites For Racism Are Hypocrites."   So any genre that has rock in the title is ok? So I can keep listening to my Limp Bizkit because it's rock-rap?   Probably George Gipp. The Four Horsemen weren't too much later though.   What's the point in calling yourself a 90s baby? If you want a title, call yourself a millennial and get over yourself.   How dare they try to be creative instead of just learning how to spout something back.   I do miss when swimming babies made music.   People make these jokes because no one seems to understand the concept of internal rhymes.   As great as the South Park episode was, it's nowhere near as funny as the real Trapped in the Closet.   White and Nerdy got a ton of play.   It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne.   The best part of this is that it's a cover song.   Including all of NWA but DJ Yella? What'd he do?   Charlie Sheen, fashion icon. The man who wore nothing but bowling shirts and cargo shorts for 10 years on tv.   I think a lot of that could be attributed to Mourdock. After all his debates Republican polling numbers started tanking in every race in the state.   They're Backup College for a reason.   We also didn't have a 1st or 2nd that year.   Couple of comments there. Fighting Irish being chosen was by the Irish at ND as a way of owning negative stereotypes the media had given them. Also, that's a leprechaun, which is a fictional creature, not an actual Irish person.   Snoop and PSY skipping with old Korean ladies is probably one of the greatest things I'll ever see on youtube.   How can you be born in le wrong generation for a band still coming out with music?   And 40s comics were fucking awful. As corny as they could be in the 60s and 70s, 40s comics were straight up propaganda.   I don't know what you're talking about, no one won the Heisman that year.   And even, for example, The Other Guys was a pretty smart movie. I mean, yes, it was a comedy, but it was also a pretty well done take on Madoff and other Ponzis.   Back when the NBA went 10 rounds, the Clippers took Tony Gwynn. Hell, until 1974, they just drafted until there was no one left to draft.   People saying he's nothing like Bieber for this clearly have never heard Foolish Pride.   Plus everyone grows up to be lifelong Indianapolis Indians fans if I'm to believe the radio commercials.   So he knows how to look up his ip in the CMD prompt?   A friend of mine's song with his girlfriend was Sexy Bitch. Always laughed at that one.   It's the same as how we had "Emma" in Origins who was Emma Frost until they decided to use her in First Class.   Rocky IV isn't even montages. It's the only movie I've ever seen be a clip show.   Are you happy now did pretty well at least.   Hey now, Michelle Branch had at least 2 hits.   On the bright side he's on pace to break the single season no decision record.   How often do straight couples smash cake on each other during the NFL draft? That was the only part he complained about. He was fine with the kiss.   In fairness at least that was back when ND was good.   It was right at the beginning, but Bogut?   All part of their plan to put players around Lebron.   You know, all those people starting psychology projects a week before graduation.   You mean they didn't want to draft someone who's having a reality show about his wedding already?   In fairness, he ends up accidentally looking at the men in her family more than her.   My guess is part of it is he's pretty active on social media.    Plus posting a question with a link for that karma grabbing.   Time for New England to trade up and draft Manziel to replace Brady.   As great as the movie was, I thought the Broadway show was even better. Definitely a much lighter show, too.   What's amazing to me is how long they were able to do their accounting that way before anything was illegal. It only really became illegal once they started creating companies for their debt.   Still nothing on Gunner Kiel ending a tweet with \#GunnerKielQuotes.   Most of Whedon's shows have taken a little while to get going.   Well Cornell College is already a thing.   Obligatory fuck the excise police.   That's because people working for the CIA don't work for the CIA. They work for some fake Washington company.   Nothing like a great Cleveland GM and incompetent Seattle GM to remind everyone it's fictional.   Someone watched Draft Day this weekend and figured he was close enough to Vontae Mack.  	100

[XM8 of course.] (http://i.imgur.com/GHrxog0.png)   Peasants.    ghey   G3 MASER RACE   Le meta reddit may mays   I wish that they'd keep Okabe's hair down in Zero, like the Epigraph series. I feel like it'd solidify the whole "dropping the Hououin Kyouma" thing   \Still just an SA58 and not an FN FAL   Oh yeah I forgot about how he kills her the first time and then he goes back and gets the message. Alright, thanks. This is exactly what I needed.   Awesome.  Thanks.   It was an interesting dynamic to see him suppressing the urge to put on the Kyouma act during the Epigraph series.  I hope they incorporate it in the new series.   Ha. When I had six guns I felt like that.   Now my walls are covered.   Sounds cool. And so I'm right on the part about how all of the events of Steins;Gate Zero and Epigraph stuff happens when he denies Amane?   So it's mostly him coming to terms with what he has to do and braving psychological torment?   I **love** Cowboy Bebop. It's definitely in my top five.   So I just finished my ninth rewatch of Steins;Gate.   Or, I should say I watched it to episode 22, before he saves Kurisu and it sort of "ends" so to speak.  So this is where the question comes in.   I started reading/read all of the available Steins;Gate Epigraph stuff of whatever when he's got major PTSD and stops pretending to be Hououin Kyouma.  From my understanding, does the events of the Epigraph stuff/Steins;Gate Zero happen when he declines Amane's offer to save Kurisu in episode 23 of the first season?  Then I'm assuming does this follow a world line where he decides to kick his ass back into being Hououin Kyouma?   Or does it revolve around his darker side and his traumatic experiences from the first season?   I hope the latter is the case because delving deeper into his psyche and how he was affected (like in the Epigraph stuff) sounds really really interesting.  Any insight would be awesome. Thanks.     Sure   Weab shit with a twist   Nice. Good luck   Question though, what about how the M249 feed tray is for 5.56 and HK21 is 7.62?   Cool. You have to post pictures when you're done, I'm excited to see this   Because it shoots straight like a ray lol   Nah I forgot the original reason, it was something like that   *Nice.*   How would you mount it?

There is no scientific basis for luck or karma if that's what you're implying. They probably won't suffer any repercussions, and will lead their careers with this guy pushed far back into their minds.  It's nice to think that people who do horrible things will always be punished, but that's not the case at all.    Alright, any term for the little thingy?   Also nice gun, I almost considered an HK51 or short G3 variant, but then I decided long G3 is just too damn sexy lol   Alright, will do lol   Thanks for the info   Yeah I was thinking 200-250    Nice   I love bandit cichlids lol   I had one in my old tank   I just need a bayonet...

One tank, eight guns, ordering parts and new gun in two weeks, and saving on the side for new tank. Too much lol   Ha   Oh yeah man lol.   Before airsoft I had aquariums and then aquariums petered out with getting into airsoft.   I heard that the way clown knife's tails work they don't need as much room to turn as say, a gar or other large fish.   I cycled it and looked everything up after someone linked it.   I also know everything about the clown knife now after watching a crap ton of videos and reading a crap ton of stuff. I compiled a word document with all of my plans.  I'm planning to get a 200 gallon tank, a canister filter, and an internal filter   So I could buy some sort of GP drop in gear box, put on the G3 selector, put in G3 trigger, and it'd be good?   Alright, so I've been getting ready to build a shiny new G3. I have a list of questions and other things to help me clear stuff up. The base build will be a JG G3 and I already have a cart of metal body parts ready.   Now, the internals are a different story.  On BingoAirsoftWorks, he mentioned that the G3 used a standard M4 nozzle, and I noticed how the G3 uses a V2 gearbox. The only exception of course is the selector plate, I think.   Is this true/will this work if I can just drop in a new V2 gearbox and a new selector plate ([like this](http://www.evike.com/products/25893/))?  Next, would be the hop up unit. I haven't the slightest clue what it uses. I have a JG G3 already, but I can't tell what it is. Google isn't too helpful when it comes to G3's.  I think that's the brunt of my questions, and any help would be awesome.  Quickish edit: I think I have everything I need with the exception of a motor.   Here's a quick list,   [Nozzle] (http://www.evike.com/products/25970)   [Selector plate] (http://www.evike.com/products/25893)   [Gearbox] (http://www.evike.com/products/24818)   [Trigger] (http://www.evike.com/products/35885)  Only thing left I need is a motor, which I am clueless on   Nice. HK master race unite.  My picture quality was kind of shit because I used the picture setting on my video camera. I also have an MP5k, but he's in the SMG corner.    It could be a gas block?   On [my G36] (http://i.imgur.com/GvKEof6.jpg) there's a gas block a little ways from the flashhider.    Aw shit son I got me an [HK wall too!] (http://i.imgur.com/aQXgQG2.jpg)   Thank you for this comment.   Actually if you want a little update, I returned the Oscar and the Pictus and got an oranda red cap gold fish for now.  As for my future plans I'm building an aquarium for a clown knife fish, and then the ten gallon I have now will become a feeder fish tank.   It's just observation though. It's a cool loadout and a nice kit, but not unique.   I'm not giving him shit. I was saying that it's not unique lol   I know that it's not a 551 or a 552. I know that it's Sig's take on an AR pattern rifle. I'm just saying that it's pretty much a 551 or 552 that takes M4 mags. It even resembles it.   That's all I was saying lol   I was just saying it's essentially just a sig 551 or 552 with an M4 mag.   My username is mwdh27 if you want in   Probably.   There's **a lot** of people who have cliche skull half masks and OD chest rigs.

Sig 516 is pretty much just a modified Sig 551 or 552 that takes STANAG magazines. It isn't even related to HK.   You could say good beginner kit.   This looks like average beginner gear.   This isn't unique though   We thought it'd be funny, and nobody cared   Taco pizza baby.  Also everybody ignores that sign and I drink coffee lol   AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   I rarely skip the OP and ED of shows too.   This show I just skipped it. Too boring.   I enjoyed it, but it was hard to look past the shitty development and harem stuff/fan service.   If a second season comes out I'll watch it, but I don't really care if they don't make another season.  Also the OP and ED were shit.   *GoPros plural. Oopsy poopsy.

 A ruthless maglomaniac who is in love with death.    now that was an episode!!!!!!!!!!    I was SOOO happy!!!!!!!    oh yeah    Oh yeah    Ledgers The Joker    Youve most likely seen it but Heath ledger as the Joker.    I wouldnt mind a sequel to see what else happens in that.    John c Reilly    Adam sandler in Reign Over Me   Yeah he was pretty good in that one.    it would be really cool.    HAHAHAHHAA this is so perfect!!!!!!!!!!!    Too late LOL    yeah I liked it, good performance by ryan reynolds and I laughed so much at some of the dark stuff.    So Friday after work I got on the bus it was an earlier one because I got out of work early, anyways I get on and see this nice brown haired girl talking to some old guy they chat for a few stops then santa claus leaves and I think "I should ask her for her number" literally as I am about to get up and talk to her some other older guy starts chatting with her!!!!! I am so pissed why is he talking to her he is like 60 and she is like 22. I hear her give him her number and he gets off the bus I am about to finally make my move but then the bus stops and she gets off too!!!! I was tempted to follow her but it didnt happen I was so cheesed off LOL. I will ride that same bus again soon and see if she is on there I think I overheard her say she was going to work. Just wanted to say that and stuff.    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH    I really want to see it cant wait!!!!!!    IDK a better villain maybe and Oliver finally back as the arrow.    Oh now I get it thank you.    it looks interesting I liked the movie and glad its becoming a show plus Cooper appearing is even better.    I didnt like it that much, it has some good scenes but Im not sure if it was trying to be scary or a very bad thriller.    It was really good im glad a few of my least favorite characters were finally killed.    When the guy from Armageddon tortures that kid in the 2004 Punisher movie I just cannot watch that part at all.    Yeah most likely.    That one too    Artificial Intelligence, I have only seen it like 4 times because every time I have cried at the very end.    He is still a good actor wish he was A list again.    I still wish Gibson had returned    BOOO Thats too long!!!!!   Yeah I'm reading the stand right now I have been for awhile once I'm done with that one I will read it.    Hes alright I liked him as Scott Pilgrim Im glad he is getting better bigger roles now too.    Yeah I figured god was she something though!!!! Wish I could have snapped a picture or something but they said no cell phones.    yeah I saw that I watched the miniseries when I was younger and it scared me ive been meaning to finally read the book too I just have a lot on my plate.    So last night I went to a strip club for the first time ever!!!!! I was bored and theres one I always see close to my house I go there and I am completely overwhelemned!!!! So many HOTTIES half naked!!!! Anyways after a few drinks and at least 25 dollar bills tipped I asked this really HOT dancer named Jordan for a private dance in the VIP room, it was 20 dollars to get in and then 20 per song. We go in the back and she immedietely grabbed me in the crotch (keep in mind too that I was very drunk by this time LOL). She danced all over me and I felt her EVERYWHERE!!!!! I am still trying to remember all of the positions she was in LOL, we talked about random stuff too like her job and my job a few other things. She had this awesome tattoo on her back too like angel wings a few others too. She danced for 3 songs so it was 60 dollars (I got a raise at work recently thats why I treated myself I was gonna buy a PS4 but did this instead LOL) I was so tempted to go back there today and get another one from that sexy goddess but I couldnt really afford it. I will return there again though and get 3 more songs from that beauty!!!!! I remember carrying her briefly with her legs wrapped around me that was nice. I just had to tell someone this since I dont want to tell my family and all of my friends seem to never answer my texts anymore LOL, oh man I can still feel her grip on my crotch.    How scary is he??? Honestly if he didnt scare the shit out of you when you were younger I dont know what did.    Yeah I watched it all in a month on netflix I LOVED IT, i dont understand why it never lasted, I wish they made a movie about it since the cast are all well known now.    Ender    The Dark Knight, it is still my fasvorite movie trailer ever!!!!    Yeah it sounds about right.    I read somewhere that since Ultron had Tony Starks personality traits then that means if left unchecked Tony can be as ruthless and eveil as Ultron was, and that will come into play in CA Civil war.    I think they will just focus on other heroes down the road and stuff I dont see a complete reboot of the MCu happening any time soon.    Sad news.    They should have just called it Marvels Civil War.    HAHAHA so funny!!!!!!!    Raimis 4, by Far. I would even sell my soul to the devil himself to have seen that get made.    WOW this guy is really not gonna stop talking about marvel LOL.    Probably the weirdest choice ever, I would see him as that bully maybe but not the deranged clown, its so weird too because I was watching were the millers the other day and I thought "I wonder if this kid will go anywhere???" .    AHHHH Man Ben Mendelson would have been great!!!!!    Just give her a role like she had in the avengers just be seen for one or two scenes.    That would be mine too.    I think it was all real, how else would she get out of that locked room and how did her mother suddenly get better.    Season 9 is one of the best seasons IMO. I like the new look for the show and yes Oneill is gone and I missed him but the new characters are good too, youll like season 10 even better.    I really wouldnt have minded to have seen 2 quicksilvers over the years, instead it was a one time thing.    Yeah I kinda wish it was him instead of Kickass I mean we just met him and he dies in the same film Hawkeye we have known for a few films.    The great gatsby.    I liked it a nice underrared comedy/horror film.    The Avengers when Iron Man arrives and knocks Loki to the ground I ALWAYS get goosebumps at that part, also the end battle when they are all stand together.    It most likely is, I am also watching it in IMAX and I cant wait to see that trailer in IMAX!!!!!    WOW I didnt know there was already a movie of this.    Girl    Jumanji style adventure sounds interesting.    I missed the Marvel Marathon I wont miss this one.    UGH I knew i should have went.    exactly.    I wish they would make one with a proper Mandarin but it will likely never happen.    That used to creep me out when ZI was younger, now it is just a good dose of nostalgia.    Cuz he has a new job as the doctor of a top secret prison that is in the middle of the ocean.    Yeah......................Yeah    Jackie Chan possibly in an Expendables movie.    I hate agreeing with you.    It was also stupid    Yeah I really liked it too a nice dark comedy like you said, I just wish it had a better ending.    UGH dont get me started on her.    Okay    Forgive me, forgive me for being human.    So a few years ago I was at a party at my friends house and one of his friends Rachel invited a whole bunch of her friends and we all got wasted or at least buzzed I remember this girl I met Justine she showed an interest in me and all of my buds were telling me I should make a move on her I did and we started making out on the couch I actually thought I was going to get laid but then her friend said she was leaving and she left but she gave me one last kiss on the cheek and said "I have a boyfriend". I was a little upset cause she just used me but I also wish I could see her again I never saw her again except one time on the train when I was going to work I waved at her but she pretended not to notice me. Anyways sometimes I look up her FB profile to see what she is up to, she never accepted my request either. I just wanted to make this known.    Yeah hes still a good actor and I have always liked him, I honestly dont think he can become an a lister again though he is too far gone.    Yeah palpatine always thought of him as a waste due to his injuries he wanted to replace him with luke as fast as he could. just like how he replaced Dooku with Anakin.    How awesome would it be if it was that.    So Mrs Fug is good in it huh??? I might see it then.    Okay thanks    Good for them they shouldnt have to subject themselves to this kind of crap.    Its not just Very close in front of my face it is usually everything within three feet.    Amen.    I want nat wolf he seems like a good fit for peter and spiderman but Asa is a good actor and I would love to see him too, oh god just annouce it already so we can stop this!!!!    I always get a large Soda and Large Popcorn along with Red Vines although it is not always Red Vines sometimes I will try something else but yeah I am like you if I am in a cinema and I dont have something to munch on throughout the movie then I feel weird, I have actually gone to great lengths to get a snack for a movie. Also at certain theaters that I go to I usually order some cheese sticks man those are freakin delicious!!!!    So as far as I can remember I see double whenever something is up close like my finger or a pencil I know a normal person would see something in front of their face that is just single but I see it as double all the time no matter how far away it is. For example is someone puts their hand in front of my face I would see two hands and a normal person would see only one. What is wrong with my eyes?? I am 22 years old and 6 foot and 2 inches.    I would give Hulk a sequel in phase two and have Ed Norton be Banner in all films. I would also switch Antman so it is released before Avengers Ultron so Antman can appear in the sequel also make Pym the creator of Ultron of course.    Is this guy best friends with whoever runs FX or something???    He was on like 2 episodes and they made it seem like he was the baddest motherfucker ever LOL.    Oh yeah LOL its on my birthday too I cant think of a better birthday present then that.    The best theater experience I have ever had was probably The Avengers. I remember rushing to the theater after work that day and waiting in line for an hour I get in the theater and choose probably the best seat in that stadium like theater. It was so packed and as the movie went on I loved it, I remember when Coulson died I jumped and some lady behind me shouted "Damit Joss". Also the Puny God moment I dont think I have heard a laugh like that in a theater in so long LOL!!!! I wish I could relive that day again.    UGH I wish I had seen it in IMAX I was jobless at the time though and by the time I got a job and money The Hobbit had already started playing, to make up for it I saw it in a regular theater in one of the first few rows.    M O N E Y    Remember reading those in grade school and the images would always scare me of course LOL, I dont remember most of the stories though just the pictures, I remember one that really got to me was called Harold about a scarecrow that came to life or something.    I assume because it is not too long for production and it only takes a few months, that way they can reach their mark of yearly and stuff. I kinda wonder what it would be like if they released them 20 episodes at a time.    Yeah true.    Leo Dicaprio in Django the scene where he slams his hand on the table is so awesome!!!!    Indeed he was I was so hoping he would pull an upset on Oscar night but it was Daniels year.    It makes sense it wouldnt have done that good in the summer.    Yes indeed.   I liked it a good adaptation of the novel I havent seen the swedish ones yet but I will soon. I wish they would make a sequel.    If Mel Brooks can get one going he would be awesome to see in a movie again!!!!!    Jessica Chastain    Look up how to make your own on Youtube I was gonna do that!!!!    MMMMM I loved those!!!!!    I would have said that instead of Killing Jury he just cuts ties with the indian hills charter due to his anger, and lets say Unser calls the cops before jax gets to the house so she is locked up and jax is deprived of his revenge but he does get to kill Marks and Barofsky just not publicly and so Gemma spends the rest of her life in prison on death row never sees jax or the boys again and Jax finally leads the club into a legit direction.      I know but still I just didnt want him to die LOL especially like that.    Just saw it and I LOVED IT!!!!! Granted I had my doubts but I am glad that I went.    all of them theres no question.   	111

    liam why ;_;   I heard it in a mix angerfist did recently all I can remember was a guy laughing and saying "were going to kill so many people" sorry for the vagueness    /u/audiofrq estimated release date plz you are reverse bass king (do a reverse bass master class some time)    It's cool, the thing I like about Speedcore is how caotic it is. I'm talking Quarter, 8th and 16th note drum rolls at random, not knowing what to expect next, things like that. My advice is warm your self up to it. Start at a lower tempo like 155-200 then move up to 210-220 I did that for an entire day and it felt really weird but the next day I found a new appreciation for Speedcore and I could listen to anything, even Extratone. If and when you start to like Speedcore check out psycho filth records they are a lable based in Japan and they are my favorite Speedcore lable (they released this song). If you need help finding songs that fall under certan BPM ranges just let me know and I'll help you find some :)               It's a pretty nice little app, kind of limited but I'm expecting that to change soon   That was fantastic! so many gay men I love it love it love it!

I just realized, another ME means more gamer poop vids!!   ATM no :( I can kind of help you though :) ok first set your DAW too 300 BPM (Speedcore starting tempo) double the beat grid if you want to go to 600! Ok now you need a kick, sample, make or find one in a sample pack (I'll post a sample pack if you want 3) play around with EQing and distortion to really give the kick that personal touch! I don't know a lot about song structure but I will say this. BE SURE TO BREAK IT UP listening to a 4x4 kick pattern for a long time at high tempos will give even the most resilient listener a massive head ache so be sure to break it up with 8th and 16th stutters. As for the rest of the things ask around and message some of your favorite artists you'll be surprised who wrights back :)               It takes a lot to fix a heart.....

 Can anyone confirm this? edit: just tried it, and no saves were wiped. I first changed the date to April 18th, saved, quit game, changed to April 19th, game ran fine. I turn off my internet connection before playing, maybe it has something to do with it, idk.   Now that was an interesting read. I was part of the ones who thought RLD was the afterlife of DEViANCE. Guess not. Also, interesting how scene drama has barely changed, even compared to the old days. It always consists in bitching about other group's cracking methods, and how they're stealing something from someone. Also, Hoodlum.VS.Reloaded-Bitch-Session-**JEW**   lol.   I usually just use scenenotice.org to find PCISO scenedrama, but damn, browsing the archive and there are so many "unsecure"/"pay2leech" scenenotices.   Oh and also found this on pre.corrupt.net: **ColdIce.and.ZiruX.are.idiots.on.3fn3t-UNPACKME** . It's funny that in #razor on Efnet (Razor demo division) I think  he was actually there, under Zer0x or something, can't remember for sure. That was pre'd in 2006, and I saw him there last year.   Topsites have users who can access stuff. Interesting btw: **ColdIce.RELOADED.and.ZiruX.RAZOR1911.are.selling.leech.slots-PURGEPLZ**    I guess you must know the right people.   Wow. Topsites are shiny. Had never seen a screenshot of one before, so thanks.    3DM already commented on it, RELOADED might be on it... browse this subreddit for more info. Enough of these threads.   Indeed. RELOADED's on it. Interestingly, there's another folder called "carmageddon reincarnation", which is a game currently on early access, being fully released on [april 23rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon:_Reincarnation). WTF, RLD? Do they intend to release that too?   2nd post the guy made.   I think it's real! Some dude in CS.RIN.RU posted it: http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10 t=65537 start=330     check JoeM's 2nd post I don't wanna steal the spotlight from you, so can you make a thread with something like "RLD working on GTA V?"?   So the first "crack" we'll see is probably gonna be a loader.    It's unlikely Razor1911 will do it, but would be amazing if so.    simple google search... **Trainz.Simulator.12.Nfo.Fix-SKIDROW**   no x64 support :(   Yeah, I saw that, credits to Nervadox.   RELOADED's.   LOL so much hype :/   Hey, I didn't feel like loading the .exe into IDA and taking a screenshot, I just googled "interactive disassembler"  and chose a random pic :)   RemindMe! 1 week   True, even games that are only steam protected can take a day or two.   Do explain.      When this is pre'd I'll start jumping and screaming of happiness. And make a megathread, probably :)   Nuuvem, I heard. And it doesn't seem to be region locked. You'll need a proxy/vpn to do it, though.   Hang in there. Reversers are probably used to hw checks. It will certainly take a bit more time to reverse this one since it should be new, and then needs testing to make sure it works, but still... let's hope for the best.    Ok so I suppose this was expected, but the good news is that, according, to kevinyang225@3DM:   We find that R* use some machine info check to protect GTA5,just like Denuvo did in Dragon Age Inquisition.  But i think Denuvo is still much harder to be cracked than RGSC.            They're actually using the Razor1911 logo in one of their stores, check the last one in http://www.razor1911.es/DondeEstamos.aspx      Seems legit.   Why are you idiots downvoting this? Several groups in that pic, like ViTALiTY, Hi2U, TiNYiSO, FLT are either inactive, hardly ever (or never) release any AAA game or only crack Steam and such. Only way we'll have so many groups trying to reverse GTA V is if the protection isn't too complex.   Haha, if only that were true. Well, maybe it is, if the protection isn't too tricky :)   It's working now! edit: lol i'm retarded I clicked the picture in the original post   Not sure about the rest, but /u/adrianokay seems legit to me. Chatted with him yesterday in a chatroom link posted a couple days ago, and his posts make it look like he's actually making an effort to find out stuff.   The two panels are stuck in "Loading, please wait...", maybe it's a temporary issue. Still, it looks awesome! Maybe add [trace.corrupt-net.org](http://trace.corrupt-net.org/) so we know when it gets uploaded to trackers? :)   The chat was actually fun yesterday. Hopefully it's gonna stay active so we can all party when the crack is released :)   rly glorious, should i x-post to /r/pcmasterrace?   dont know y ppl r downvoting, fully workz 4 me  	37
 I know I post here a lot, and I usually post here about stuff that isn't exactly psychotic but related to schizophrenia, so sorry if it annoys anyone.   Lately I've been feeling disconnected with the world, and especially with other people, I sometimes go to the store with my mum and stuff and it feels like everything is amplified (as in sounds and stuff) but everyone just feels alien to me. It kinda just feels like the world is passing me by, a good way to explain it is it's kinda like when you see people in movies and they're just standing there and everyone around them is going super fast, if you have ever seen that in a movie.  Has anyone else felt like this? It's pretty strange and I think the only other times I felt it was years ago during pre psychosis, and it may have happened during psychosis but I can't fully remember.     Woah, you must be like 14 and been on the internet for sooooo long.    Just because the Jews don't believe in the new testament doesn't mean they don't believe in the same god. Like /u/Merari01 said -  Well. Yes. That's why Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all Abrahamic religions. They all worship the god of Abraham.   What about increasing taxes on the upper class instead? I'm pretty sure that's what he wants, I mean they do have more money that they hardly use after all.   Woah, stop I'm gonna die from all this laughing I'm doing.   But if they announced half life 3 the internet would explode.   Maybe it's magic???   CARRY ON? STUPID? REDDIT? FUCK YOU!    Doesn't cortisol make you less stressed as opposed to making you more stressed? Or is that only when it's regulated normally and does the opposite when it's released too often/too much?   Oh good, fuck me right in the ass :D.   Vincent will you have my baby?   Weed is a brutal gateway drug confirmed?   I don't think anyone (other than people who go on the sub) actually like FPH.   I hate all you over at /r/fatpeoplehate, it's just a retarded sub. BANNED FOR SYMPATHY.   The funny thing is that the UK has  one the highest rates of alcohol abuse in the world.   Money - The most addictive drug on earth.   Just so people know, schizophrenia doesn't usually cause violence. Anyway, sorry for what happened, must be rough.   The war on drugs makes it much worse. Being an alcoholic isn't victimless either, people get damaged severely (mentally and physically) by alcoholics in the household.    Are you in fact a gangsta?   Actually it's their anti-market and anti-consumer practices.   Thanks. I've been having what I think is derealization but I can't say for sure since I'm not exactly a psychiatrist or anything but I'm pretty sure it is, along with insomnia and other stuff. Maybe I should check with my doc again.   Is it not illegal to not employ someone because of a mental illness, especially when recovering?   Perfect   Can you use depersonalization interchangeably with derealization?   Even though I'm banned from /r/fatpeoplehate because I said some offensive shit to them, I actually feel bad for them kinda like how MLK felt about racists.    You should check out [Sargon of Akkad](https://www.youtube.com/user/SargonofAkkad100) on youtube he usually talks about feminism and is opposed to them. He also talks like a rational human being and not like an extreme, extreme left wing political correctness douche. He's quite centre, instead of left or right.   So I've been off of my medication for months now and I just wanted to know what exactly you're warning signs are for a relapse? Or what they might be in general? I've looked at places with varying information so I thought it'd be good to ask here.    Is 1 - 100 all that rare though? I wouldn't say it's too rare.   Oh, right. Must of misinterpreted what you said.    and a more educated population  Are you saying europe is uneducated or what?   You go on fat people hate... That's all I have to say.   The word shitlord makes me cringe beyond belief.   This guy is a conspiracy theorist and friends with Alex Jones (I think).   But the only swear word you seem to say is shit.   Is your favourite word 'shit' or something?   Yep, that's true. Around 10%ish, even though it's not fully agreed upon (some say more). But that's not exactly what I was saying in my comment.   Only way he could download and play that fast is if he had google fiber.   nO you had bleach.   By this person's logic opiates must be completely harmless too.   Yeah because /r/opiates doesn't exist.   You're being more hostile. Like NO ONE on reddit has been through addiction either... /s   What do you mean by controlled? Do you mean control usage or control as in stopping?   I'm guessing you go with a different view of addiction? I go with the disease model because that has the most evidence backing it up.   EVERYONE START SNIFFING 1 DOLLAR NOTES.   I don't think you're an idiot at all. I get what you mean, though.    Nice hostility, I think your friends heroin would do you nicely.   Funnily enough I'm addicted to morphine. That's a different reason to be addicted but it's still the persons fault to continue using, but after addiction fully sets in then it's out of the person's control for the most part.   For most people, yes it is. I know first hand, second hand, third hand and fourth hand.   For starting to use a certain drug it's the person's fault yes, but once you're addicted it gets out of your control.   Addiction is much, much more than you realise. It's a long term battle, actually, it's pretty much a life long battle. So yes, you can relapse even if you've been clean for months or even years.   Can you seriously not take a mild stereotypical joke? Hypocrite.    Like when you will see these presence manifest themselves physically then you will have gone full on schizo.  You said this... This is what I'm talking about. It sounds like, to me anyway, that you're saying you need to have visuals in order to be full blown schizophrenic. Maybe I'm mistaking what you meant though.   Still, the most common hallucination during active psychosis (psychosis is usually the same, only difference would be the form of delusion) would be audio not visual. Most schizophrenics hear things rather than see things, is what I'm saying. I'm not saying this guy has schizophrenia, I'm just correcting you.   You don't need visual hallucinations to have schizophrenia/active psychosis, actually, you don't even need hallucinations to have schizophrenia but the most common are audio during psychosis. Also, schizophrenia is much more than just psychosis.   Visual hallucinations do you mean? That's not actually all that common in psychosis.   Just wondering, what do you mean by visualise your delusions? Delusions in my experience (looking back) have just been intense thoughts (and obviously using everything that's related to my delusion as confirmation) in a way accompanied by voices.   Schizophrenia isn't exactly and old term either I don't think, like mid 100 years old. It's just not my dad either, it's people that I've known before I was ill (I haven't made any new friends in person for around 2 years), I guess the stigma is still very, very much alive sadly.   Closer to 5am so they don't give a fuck even more.   I thought that he said he would want to kill himself mainly because his quality of life would suffer. Schizophrenia can reduce your quality of life quite a lot and is one of the most disabling conditions to have but he cleared everything up and he meant that he would want to die if he got a disease that makes him forget drastically.    I've been struggling with negative symptoms that I can fully recognize but not fully explain properly, life is pretty much difficult day to day. I pretty much just wake up, come on my computer and do that every day, all day unless I have an appointment. My words get mixed up quite a lot etc. you know, the normal stuff. I've been asking my parents to actually research or ask a doctor about schizophrenia to realize that it's pretty much not my fault, yet they don't, they think I'm just being lazy or stupid (they actually say that to me). I've been officially diagnosed btw, so they have no reason to doubt me yet they do. My memory sucks so when I forget things they just tut and say I'm acting stupid, key word, acting. I'm not acting shit, why would I act something for years that's done nothing but fuck with my life (mainly education). I feel like my parents are stigmatizing me in a way and it sucks, I have no one else to talk to and they're my main carers. It's really starting to get to me, it's like I have no real help with anything. At least they put me on disability, only time they recognized that I needed it.  I don't even know if this makes sense, hope it does.  Edit: When I talk about my parents I really mean my dad mainly.   Yeah, I get it. I thought you meant you'd want to die because your quality of life would suffer.   Most people with schizophrenia won't live normal lives with treatment, a lot do but majority don't. Schizophrenics also sometimes need carers as well. Active psychosis is ranked one of the most disabling conditions right after dementia.   Of course they're not the same but schizophrenia is a really, really bad illness when it comes to quality of life. Medications only fix the psychosis not the actually full illness, that's why they're called antipsychotics and not anti-schizophrenics. I've actually heard somewhere that a country(?) or a group of people want there to be some sort of assisted suicide for chronically schizophrenic people, not sure though.  Also, how long does it normally take to die from alzheimer's?   Psychosis in a way can take away what was originally you, but you most likely wouldn't chose to die if you had schizophrenia, or would you? Genuine question.   I agree, sir. Very shallow and pedannnnntic.    ephemerally  Yes, quite, yes. Indeedly.   Kurt wasn't in the rehab long enough for his tolerance to go down though. Also, I'm pretty sure his tolerance was higher than what was found in his blood stream.   God damn, sorry for your loss. It's even tough to read. Trying to put myself in your position and it's super unimaginable, I couldn't comprehend if I lost my best friend to an OD right next to me.   3 times the normal lethal dose, yeah but kurt had a hefty tolerance so of course he could survive that. Some addicts can go up to grams a day.   At least his penis looks like it's small as fuck since I can't see it.    Perfect. Thought my computer wouldn't load it.   Had is starting to sound like an alien word now.   Personality disorders are kinda in the grey area of mental illness, I believe. Also, I think I might have just got some words mixed up and that's why I came to that conclusion.   If they plea insanity and they do have a severe mental illness like schizophrenia then they usually do serve time in a mental hospital (and they usually serve a lot longer in a hospital than they would in a prison).   Isn't ASPD just psychopathy/sociopathy? ASPD is completely different from schizophrenia, ASPD isn't really considered a mental illness if I remember correctly.    That's SSRI's for depression. Antipsychotics are for schizophrenia and they block serotonin and dopamine. Depression and schizophrenia are different, when I think of insanity I usually think psychosis because psychosis is basically just the modern term for insanity.   I wouldn't say alcohol is better than heroin. Alcohol is pretty hard shit when it comes to long term effects.   If it's insanity in the sense of schizophrenia or whatever then the drugs block dopamine and serotonin.   I agree that hallucinations are usually false sensory experiences, but I've also heard that voices can be inside the head but they sound like completely different from the persons inner monologue.    Teeth grinding isn't a telltale sign of opiate use. It's a tell for stimulant use though (amphetamine, cocaine etc).   How would you like it if your mummy got rid of you because she had a new baby?    cheesburger*   It's kinda the same with me and my parents except once I started to not be as good as they thought they told me how shit I was. Parents who do this probably think they're doing something right, when in reality, they're not. They're in fact building either a narcissist or building them up just to fall, it's sad.   Fat shaming campaigns wont do anything. Real information and education is better (without shaming of course telling someone about the health problems would be enough), shaming people that might have problems with overeating is totally counterproductive.    So every overweight/obese person spreads lies to justify it? FPH is just a hate sub, nothing more, nothing less.   I won't live a miserable life because I don't spend most of it hating on others, you on the other hand...   [You seem like a nice human being by the way.](http://i.gyazo.com/fc068507a099f6d0ae61a58e1f999e30.png)  obvious /s.   Vincent you aren't neo.   Ice Road Truckers is full of ancient history.   Codeine is a real drug. It's potency is just weird because some people can't fully metabolize it into morphine (its morphine that gets you high on codeine as well btw, a lot of people don't have the enzymes to produce it in their bodies though).   And what's not real about hydro?   I had a seizure reading this.   It's more toxic to your stomach, cardiovascular system and kidneys than your liver I believe... If I was taking ibuprofen every day I would worry more about my stomach than anything else.   I'm pretty sure the liver can feel like it hurts if it gets enlarged and presses on other organs because the outer shell has pain receptors (not 1000% sure though).   Do you drink alcohol (or ever drank alcohol)? Simple question.   Yeah because liking a comment means you like them romantically.    Seroquel got rid of all my symptoms mainly because it's super, super sedating.    Indonesia seems like a joke when it comes to legal matters. They'll happily execute someone even if they know she didn't do it.   I've fapped on 200mg (snorted ritalin). Albeit it is a mission to get it up.   Negative and cognitive symptoms are the worst. Positive symptoms aren't nearly as chronic and debilitating IME.   When I'm in the midst of deep, deep apathy, exercise will do nothing for me.   Magnification.   Troll detected.  	103
 That's it. I am deleting my Reddit app. I don't need to come back anymore. It can't get any better than this...      Who am I kidding... Reddit owns me. I'll be back tomorrow. Or in an hour. Or maybe I will just keep browsing for a little bit longer(4-5 hours longer will suffice for tonight).   Uh-oh... Careful now. The wrath of Reddit may come down on you for posting a pic of your kid on Reddit. They no likely. I have learned from mistakes.    Woman here... This is an insane amount of shit to bring on a trip. Also, do I really see nail polish remover? Who... Who honestly thinks they are going to need nail polish remover while on vacation?   http://media1.giphy.com/media/rfOQHBPq0kjm0/giphy.gif   Hahaha! That kid's face..."Uuugh .. Fuck!"   Oh man... I know that feeling all too well!      The first time I saw this on Reddit, about 4 different times ago, it took me WAAAY too long to find what was wrong with the picture. That day I hadz the dumbz.  	8
                Welcome to the new making money subreddit. I cleared out all the old spam.  The goal of this subreddit is for subscribers to talk about and share legitimate ways to make extra money as side-incomes and side-hustles. I'm hoping the subreddit will inspire those to find ways to make needed income and creatively think about how they can earn more money for themselves and their family while avoiding the many scams which tend to crop up when "making money" is mentioned.  If you have any questions or ideas, feel free to message me.   This is something I've done for years. I probably clear a few hundred dollars a year doing this (more when silver prices are high). I helps that the bank and credit union employees know me now so the save the half dollar rolls that come in.  Most people know that quarters and dimes before 1965 are made of silver and those made in 1965 and after have no silver content. Many people assume it's true for half dollars as well, but it's not. While half dollars made from 1965 - 1970 have less silver (40%) than those made 1964 and earlier (90%), their silver content still makes them worth much more than 50 cents. Check with your bank if anyone has recently cashed in half dollars in rolls, and if they have, buy them. There will often be half dollars from 1965 - 1970 in them.            If you've never been to this national park, you should place it on your list. It's otherworldly, especially at dusk, and then you get amazing star filled skies.                                        This new national monument is unique in its size and proximity to major urban centers of northern California. Situated only 100 miles from the Bay Area and Sacramento, Berryessa Snow Mountain spans 100 miles north to south. The area offers significant opportunities for exceedingly rare long-distance mountain biking trails and critical connectivity to both the Mendocino National Forest and the Bay Area Ridge Trail.  For those who enjoy spaces in the national park system, please consider subscribing to r/NationalPark      I love national parks but don't have the patience to be a "real photographer" so I explore with my Nikon Coolpix point and shoot camera. Every once in awhile something comes out decent like this photo of Phantom Ship at Crater Lake national Park.             More than 20 mountain biking trails would be closed under this bill, but IMBA will not compromise on two, Castle Divide and Ants Basin, said Clark in an interview. These trails are not causing any environmental or social concerns right now. There is no viable reason for shutting them out. We think wilderness can be achieved while leaving these two trails open through special bike corridor provisions.            State parks in New York are giving free swim lessons to kids at state parks. Those signed up for the lessons will get free admission to the state parks. For kids ages 6 - 12               Gas and oil interests never give up...   Since the 1920s, pipeline companies have needed to get Congressional approval for a right-of-way across National Park Service lands to construct a pipeline...But three proposed billsH.R. 2295 in the House of Representatives and S. 411 and S. 1196 in the Senatewould eliminate that long-standing provision. It would remove the requirement for Congressional approval  and with that the vote of the public -- before giving away park land for a gas pipeline, subjecting that power instead to the whims of whatever political party sits in the White House at that moment.                  Yes, that's the hope. I'm really looking forward to it -- I'll get to cross off another point off my bucket list.          Yes! I encourage all to take the time to participate and get involved in whatever ways you can with your favorite parks.   Perfect timing -- I'm planning my first trip there in September :)   They didn't specify in the information I received. My guess is that you might need to gather a stamp at each of the parks. The best course of action would be to ask when you get to the first park on what you need at each park to claim the patch.  Bryce Canyon did something similar to this a few years back where you could get a pin for hiking to certain places in the park and they had you take a photo on your phone to show you had actually gone to all the spots.   I wish I could help, but that's one area I haven't been to yet (it's on my list). We're still a small group here, but I hope someone else will be able to answer your question.   Hmmm, I am seeing all of the comments and none are stuck in the moderation queue. I'm fairly new at this so I'm not sure why you aren't seeing them.  edit: Oh, no, the one you can't see is a bot comment I removed   It's a new subreddit -- only about a month old so it will take some time to build, but the national park system is one of my passions, so I'm willing to put in the time. I'm happy if others enjoy it and can find some inspiration to go out and visit them.   As far as I'm aware, this is the only one that has been announced. I think it would be a great idea for other states to adopt a similar program, but I don't know of any others at this point.      [Photo of the patch](http://i.imgur.com/nqw1Cqk.jpg)  All 5 parks have no entrance fee. Mammoth Caves has fees for cave tours, but any activity counts for the patch, so you don't have to pay anything to qualify for it.      As part of the National Park Service 2016 centennial, those who visit all 5 national parks in Kentucky can earn a special free commemorative patch. It's being called Kentucky's National Parks Centennial Pentathlon ([Photo of the patch](http://i.imgur.com/nqw1Cqk.jpg) -- [bigger photo of patch image](http://i.imgur.com/DPmvmhG.jpg)). All five parks must be visited by April 2017 and participants must do at least one activity at each park. The specific activities are not specified, but any activity such as hiking, biking or visiting the ranger's station will count. You can do different activities at each park -- it's not necessary to do the exact same activity at each park. Basically, they want you to go to each and explore and learn while there. The five participating parks are:  * [The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park](http://www.nps.gov/abli) * [Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area](http://www.nps.gov/biso) * [Cumberland Gap National Historical Park](http://www.nps.gov/cuga) * [Fort Heiman unit of Fort Donelson National Battlefield](http://www.nps.gov/fodo) * [Mammoth Cave National Park](http://www.nps.gov/maca)  None of the five parks has an entrance fee, although there are fees to go on cave tours at Mammoth Cave.  If you enjoy national parks, please consider subscribing to r/NationalPark   I think the major issue on the island is inbreeding that has caused the pack to deteriorate. They went over when the lake froze and just didn't have the opportunitie to get new bloodlines into the pack.                                                                                                   It's been years since I've been there -- definitely want to get back one of these days.            My orginal submission of this was removed by the mods (rightfully so due to an error on my part -- mods, thanks for the great work you do) so I've reposted a direct link to the video.  Privatizing national parks is one of the worst ideas ever. The thing is, it can sound like a good argument to those who don't understand the deceptive reasons for wanting it done. This is not a fight that should be taken lightly. The [New York Times op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/opinion/lets-fix-our-national-parks-not-add-more.html) shows they are willing to try and make this happen.         Greatest apologies on that -- wasn't intentional. Thank you for the job you do.   Thanks for sharing your Death Valley photos -- loved them  	100

April 14, 2015        Statement by the Press Secretary on the Proposed Rescission of Cubas Designation as a State Sponsor of     Terrorism         Today, the President submitted to Congress the statutorily required report and certifications indicating      the Administrations intent to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation.       Cuba was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1982 due to its efforts to promote armed      revolution by organizations that used terrorism. Once designated, a country remains a State Sponsor of      Terrorism until its designation is rescinded in accordance with statutory criteria. In Cubas case, the     applicable criteria require the President to submit a report to the Congress at least 45 days before the     proposed rescission would take effect, justifying the rescission and certifying that (1) the Government     of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period;      and (2) the Government of Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international     terrorism in the future.       As part of his December 17, 2014, announcement of policy changes related to Cuba, President Obama     instructed the Department of State to undertake a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of      Terrorism based on an assessment of the available facts. After a careful review of Cubas record,     which was informed by the Intelligence Community, as well as assurances provided by the Cuban     government, the Secretary of State concluded that Cuba met the conditions for rescinding its      designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The Secretary of State therefore recommended that the     President make and submit to Congress the statutorily-required report and certification.       As the President has said, we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government, but our      concerns over a wide range of Cubas policies and actions fall outside the criteria that is relevant to     whether to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. That determination is based on     the statutory standard   and the facts  and those facts have led the President to declare his intention     to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation. More broadly, the United States will continue     to support our interests and values through engagement with the Cuban government and people.

April 14, 2015      STATEMENT BY SECRETARY KERRY                Recommendation to Rescind Cubas Designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism       In December 2014, as a critical component of establishing a new direction for U.S.Cuba relations, the      President directed the State Department to launch a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of      Terrorism and provide a report to him within six months. Last week, the State Department submitted a      report to the White House recommending, based on the facts and the statutory standard, that     President Obama rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.       This recommendation reflects the Departments assessment that Cuba meets the criteria established by      Congress for rescission. While the United States has had, and continues to have, significant concerns     and disagreements with a wide range of Cubas policies and actions, these concerns and disagreements      fall outside of the criteria for designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. This review focused on the     narrow questions of whether Cuba provided any support for international terrorism during the previous      six months, and whether Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international     terrorism in the future, consistent with the statutory standard for rescission.       Circumstances have changed since 1982, when Cuba was originally designated as a State Sponsor of      Terrorism because of its efforts to promote armed revolution by forces in Latin America. Our      Hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago. Our determination,     pursuant to the facts, including corroborative assurances received from the Government of Cuba and      the statutory standard, is that the time has come to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of     Terrorism.  ________ http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/04/240687.htm        Edit: More links  **Background Briefing on the Report Required To Rescind Cuba's State Sponsor of Terrorism Status**  http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/04/240697.htm        And?

And no matter how many more centrifuges Iran installs, it can never become self-sufficient because it does not possess adequate uranium ore reserves for a large-scale nuclear energy program."     All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.  -  Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges. There's no clear details how they will be not allowed to access to excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure (The French version is more clear). Also monitoring hasn't stopped North Korea from a bomb.  -   Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.  -  They settled for the one year nuclear breakout. Such short periods of time are very hard to monitor.     2013 Joint Plan of Action http://eeas.europa.eu/statements/docs/2013/131124_03_en.pdf disallowed construction and enrichment at the Arak reactor   Iran announces that it will not make any further advances of its activities at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant[1], Fordow[2], or the Arak reactor[3], designated by the IAEA as IR-40.   -  [3] Iran announces on concerns related to the construction of the reactor at Arak that for 6 months it will not commission the reactor or transfer fuel or heavy water to the reactor site and will not test additional fuel or produce more fuel for the reactor or install remaining components  -  2015 Joint Plan of Action allows construction and enrichment   Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild a heavy water research reactor in Arak, based on a design that is agreed to by the P5+1, which will not produce weapons grade plutonium, and which will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production.      Kerry said on ABC's "This Week." (November 2013) disallowed Iran entirely from enrichment.    "There is no inherent right to enrich,"   -  2015 Joint Plan of Action allows   Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models) centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.  What happens after 10 years?

U.S. Nuclear deal      Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years.   -  Iran will have 6,104 centrifuges installed, not 500 to 1,500 as Washington originally wanted as a ceiling or 4,000 as floated by U.S. officials as a possible compromise. 5,000-6,000 centrifuges is enough for a bomb but not sufficient to power a reactor.      All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.  -  Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges   -    Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.  -  Obama's original bare minimum would have extended nuclear breakout to at least 10 years, they settled for the one year nuclear breakout.

Farsnews released a 4-page text Joint Plan of Action that was supposedly the result of the agreement reached during Geneva talks**   Iranian Version ___ #Geneva, 24 November 2013  #Joint Plan of Action ___  ##Preamble  ####The goal for these negotiations is to reach a mutually-agreed long-term comprehensive solution that would ensure Iran's nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful. Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek or develop any nuclear weapons. This comprehensive solution would build on these initial measures and result in a final step for a period to be agreed upon and the resolution of concerns. This comprehensive solution would enable Iran to fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the NPT in conformity with its obligations therein. This comprehensive solution would involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with practical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the programme. This comprehensive solution would constitute an integrated whole where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This comprehensive solution would involve a reciprocal, step-bystep process, and would produce the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions, as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme ---- ####There would be additional steps in between the initial measures and the final step, including, among other things, addressing the UN Security Council resolutions, with a view toward bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the UN Security Council's consideration of this matter. The E3+3 and Iran will be responsible for conclusion and implementation of mutual near-term measures and the comprehensive solution in good faith. A Joint Commission of E3/EU+3 and Iran will be established to monitor the implementation of the near-term measures and address issues that may arise, with the IAEA responsible for verification of nuclear-related measures. The Joint Commission will work with the IAEA to facilitate resolution of past and present issues of concern. ---- ####Elements of a first step The first step would be time-bound, with a duration of 6 months, and renewable by mutual consent, during which all parties will work to maintain a constructive atmosphere for negotiations in good faith. Iran would undertake the following voluntary measures:   From the existing uranium enriched to 20%, retain half as working stock of 20% oxide for fabrication of fuel for the TRR. Dilute the remaining 20% UF6 to no more than 5%. No reconversion line.   Iran announces that it will not enrich uranium over 5% for the duration of the 6 months.   Iran announces that it will not make any further advances of its activities at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant1, Fordow2, or the Arak reactor3, designated by the IAEA as IR-40.   Beginning when the line for conversion of UF6 enriched up to 5% to UO2 is ready, Iran has decided to convert to oxide UF6 newly enriched up to 5% during the 6 month period, as provided in the operational schedule of the conversion plant declared to the IAEA.   No new locations for the enrichment.   Iran will continue its safeguarded R D practices, including its current enrichment R D practices, which are not designed for accumulation of the enriched uranium.   No reprocessing or construction of a facility capable of reprocessing.   Enhanced monitoring:  o Provision of specified information to the IAEA, including information on Iran's plans for nuclear facilities, a description of each building on each nuclear site, a description of the scale of operations for each location engaged in specified nuclear activities, information on uranium mines and mills, and information on source material. This information would be provided within three months of the adoption of these measures.  o Submission of an updated DIQ for the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40, to the IAEA.  o Steps to agree with the IAEA on conclusion of the Safeguards Approach for the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40.  o Daily IAEA inspector access when inspectors are not present for the purpose of Design Information Verification, Interim Inventory Verification, Physical Inventory Verification, and unannounced inspections, for the purpose of access to offline surveillance records, at Fordow and Natanz.  o IAEA inspector managed access to:    centrifuge assembly workshops4;    centrifuge rotor production workshops and storage facilities; and,   uranium mines and mills.     ___  Footnotes:  1 Namely, during the 6 months, Iran will not feed UF6 into the centrifuges installed but not enriching uranium. Not install additional centrifuges. Iran announces that during the first 6 months, it will replace existing centrifuges with centrifuges of the same type.  2 At Fordow, no further enrichment over 5% at 4 cascades now enriching uranium, and not increase enrichment capacity. Not  feed UF6 into the other 12 cascades, which would remain in a non-operative state. No interconnections between cascades.  Iran announces that during the first 6 months, it will replace existing centrifuges with centrifuges of the same type.  3 Iran announces on concerns related to the construction of the reactor at Arak that for 6 months it will not commission the reactor or transfer fuel or heavy water to the reactor site and will not test additional fuel or produce more fuel for the reactor or install remaining components.  4 Consistent with its plans, Iran's centrifuge production during the 6 months will be dedicated to replace damaged machines.  In return, the E3/EU+3 would undertake the following voluntary measures:   Pause efforts to further reduce Iran's crude oil sales, enabling Iran's current customers to purchase their current average amounts of crude oil. Enable the repatriation of an agreed amount of revenue held abroad. For such oil sales, suspend the EU and U.S. sanctions on associated insurance and transportation services.   Suspend U.S. and EU sanctions on:  o Iran's petrochemical exports, as well as sanctions on associated services.5 o Gold and precious metals, as well as sanctions on associated services.   Suspend U.S. sanctions on Iran's auto industry, as well as sanctions on associated services.   License the supply and installation in Iran of spare parts for safety of flight for Iranian civil aviation and associated services. License safety related inspections and repairs in Iran as well as associated services.6   No new nuclear-related UN Security Council sanctions.   No new EU nuclear-related sanctions.   The U.S. Administration, acting consistent with the respective roles of the President and the  Congress, will refrain from imposing new nuclear-related sanctions.   Establish a financial channel to facilitate humanitarian trade for Iran's domestic needs using Iranian oil revenues held abroad. Humanitarian trade would be defined as transactions involving food and agricultural products, medicine, medical devices, and medical expenses incurred abroad. This channel would involve specified foreign banks and non-designated Iranian banks to be defined when establishing the channel.  o This channel could also enable:    transactions required to pay Iran's UN obligations; and,   direct tuition payments to universities and colleges for Iranian students studying abroad, up to an agreed amount for the six month period.   Increase the EU authorisation thresholds for transactions for non-sanctioned trade to an agreed amount.  ___  Footnotes  5 "Sanctions on associated services" means any service, such as insurance, transportation, or financial, subject to the underlying U.S. or EU sanctions applicable, insofar as each service is related to the underlying sanction and required to facilitate the desired transactions. These services could involve any non-designated Iranian entities.  6 Sanctions relief could involve any non-designated Iranian airlines as well as Iran Air.  Elements of the final step of a comprehensive solution*  The final step of a comprehensive solution, which the parties aim to conclude negotiating and commence implementing no more than one year after the adoption of this document, would:   Have a specified long-term duration to be agreed upon.   Reflect the rights and obligations of parties to the NPT and IAEA Safeguards Agreements.   Comprehensively lift UN Security Council, multilateral and national nuclear-related sanctions, including steps on access in areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy, on a schedule to be agreed upon.   Involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with mutually agreed parameters consistent with practical needs, with agreed limits on scope and level of enrichment activities, capacity, where it is carried out, and stocks of enriched uranium, for a period to be agreed upon.   Fully resolve concerns related to the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40.   No reprocessing or construction of a facility capable of reprocessing.   Fully implement the agreed transparency measures and enhanced monitoring. Ratify and implement the Additional Protocol, consistent with the respective roles of the President and the Majlis (Iranian parliament).   Include international civil nuclear cooperation, including among others, on acquiring modern light water power and research reactors and associated equipment, and the supply of modern nuclear fuel as well as agreed R D practices.   Following successful implementation of the final step of the comprehensive solution for its full duration, the Iranian nuclear programme will be treated in the same manner as that of any non-nuclear weapon state party to the NPT.   With respect to the final step and any steps in between, the standard principle that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" applies.   Thanks.

 I bought a Canon T1i years ago when I was low on funds and was looking for something with better options than a basic point and shoot.  Now I'm looking to get some quality lenses, specifically the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM http://goo.gl/9IWHkE, but I'm not sure if my entry level DSLR is going to make the most of it.  Has anyone experienced something similar?  If I need to upgrade my camera, how should I go about it?

Not everyone should have a bee hive, and in some regions you can go to a website to determine where the closest hive is to you.  It may not make sense to have one yourself. But for those people that have space for a hive, this looks interesting.    It's because if you thought the topic was interesting enough to comment, then it only makes sense that you would want others to see it as well.   How are there 13 comments and only 4 upvotes? Cmon people, if you comment make sure to upvote the thread.    I had the exact opposite thought. A hard cookie would crack rather than be cut in a nice clean line.    Thank you!

 ESA has expressed a desire to undertake something similar    If you have the work permit already ( I presume you have a "foreign expert work permit/ certificate ") then you should be okay. The work permit is the hardest part and once they've granted that, the visa usually follows suit. Of course, being China, anything is possible :)      Uber has no chance in China. It has no compelling advantage over Didi Kuaidi and the deck is stacked in favor of the local player.       "iPhone/Pad killer" is a very tired line      That's  counter-productive. Better to handle irate clients privately than publicly.    It doesn't work in cases where the customer has no/few alternatives   Actually it does matter, because they had a registered trademark and you didn't. In the case above he had a legal right to it because it was his name. This issue comes up with domain names and the law will side with the trademark owner  or real name owner. But in any case FB, Instagram can't just take something away from you like that without a clear process, perhaps compensation etc.    And the U.S. military exempted them from the Tokyo trials in exchange for their data -- which they wanted for their own biological  weapons. Shame.    The delayed rescue sounds so un-Japanese; hard to believe   Also bad form by Facebook but not in the same league as the name was not yours - meaning not your real name nor trademarked by you, but it was their trademark. Still FB should have notified you to work something out.    I was thinking buying to bury it, not to use it.

A Church in Lynn, by Lera Ruins   /r/gone144hzcurvy   r/gonewildcurvy   I said psychotic, not psychic   Apparently [he is a real reverend who's wife died](http://www.kwwl.com/story/29413353/2015/06/25/man-says-letter-telling-him-to-kill-himself-was-put-in-his-car), I find it hard he would write that, but who knows, it's entirely possible.

There's nothing wrong about laughing of ourselves or joke about the subreddit once in a while.   It's just a joke, I don't see what's wrong with it.

I think it's coming off great! Try to do the full photo. Most of the times it won't feel 'right' until you colorize it fully.    Maybe it's a busy photo as you say, but I think it's looking good so far. Try something simpler if you want though, like a portrait with no background. Do the face, eyes, lips, etc.   As a photographer, this is amazing. My contract also says very clearly that, if the work were to be cancelled by the client, the retainer is non-refundable. When you put a retainer you are compromising with that person to save that date specifically for you, and if other jobs come along you obviously reject them. If I were to cancel because I had a problem on my side, of course I'm returning 100% of those profits as well as giving you my best recomendations with other photographers. But you cancel me, fuck you.    I applaud this person, giving the money to GLAD, that's just epic.   I work primarily with events photography, such as weddings, parties, etc, and this restoration service is something super new (less than 3 weeks) I'm doing and I started offering it yesterday, after uploading that video. I love taking photos but not so much in weddings and such, more like in personal artistic photos, so if this takes off I'm looking at working of something I love with all my heart, which is editing. Thanks for commenting!   Well, the client asked for colorization, so if I'd left it black and white that would've made a bad professional I think :p    I gave her two digital copies though, one in color an another in black and white.   I answered this on another comment, the eyes and hair were my client's indication, and I used a blueish color for the dress to bring up her eyes :)   Yes, I had people say me this. Maybe I should've darkened them a little more, and I will keep an eye to that in next videos. Thanks for your input and comment!   Thanks a lot!   Thanks a lot. Indeed, the photo is from around the 50s. It was such an honor getting to restore this person's picture, I'm sure it brought them joy. She's 70 now.     Wow, that's incredible! Thanks so much for sharing your emotions, I'm super glad the video got to you.   Thanks a  lot! I'm in Argentina. Yes, I believe I should up the prices a bit, maybe for the next jobs I'll be charging a bit more :)   I WANT TO BELIEVE   A new novelty account! I love it already.    PS: do /r/tifu, a lot of /r/tifu.   Seems like you were right! That's incredible. Here in Argentina we had a case about a very famous ex-model woman that was photoshoped so badly on a magazine cover that they literally erased her belly button. The woman itself (Susana Gimenez) is a national diva here and when that happened not a single soul didn't know. It was an amazing fuckup.   I noticed what you're pointing me, but trust me, no-one else but people who use Photoshop does, that why I didn't say anything. It's barely noticeable and there's like 0 chances someone who doesn't photoshops sees that.    I didn't know that image from Reuters, that's... I have no words. I don't think that's the photographer's fault though, most of the time this guys or even the magazines have other editors that "improve" (obvious quotation marks here) their photos for them.   Sure thing! PM me or ask here if you want help with anything, I'll reply you as soon as I can.   Yeah, that's perfect. In the video I used the laso tool for cropping out the right eye, so I get your point. It's really handy for some situations!   Thanks so much! I'm definitely going to make more videos and share here.   Thanks for sharing your process. I reccomend you read a bit about the Pen tool for selecting, it's far more precise than the laso tool. I think you did a great job, 10/10.    The reshaping tool I used for the squares from the dress is selecting a part of the image and warping it, I believe it's present in CS2! It's under Edit - Transform - **Warp**. Check it, I believe it's there. I just use a personal shortcut (CTRL+W, which in default mode closes Photoshop I believe) so that's why you you don't see me picking it.   You're very welcome! If you have any questions you'd like to ask me, feel free to PM me and I'll get to you as soon as I can. I'll be wanting to see your Photoshop progress!   Thanks! Allow me to quote myself on other comment where I responded this:  For this photo I charged the equivalent to $30 USD (maybe a little less, $26 USD). I believe I could've charged a little more, but I'm just starting with this service (repairing old photos) and I want to grab a few customers first. Without the colorization it would've been around $20 USD.   Thanks a lot! That's my intention with that new channel. This is definitely my best video so far, I'll try and make the next ones better so you guys enjoy them even more. Thanks for subscribing :D   Thanks a lot, I'm super glad you guys enjoyed it so much.   Definitely a good sign! I will, thanks for taking the time to comment :)   Thanks so much! Glad you enjoyed it!   Hi! It took me about two hours, maybe a little less. I really, really like the photo you posted, I think the end result is excellent! How old is that photo?    Thanks!    Definitely the best way is to practice, a lot. There are some great free tutorials and videos out there for you to check. There's also tons of pages that offers great high quality JPGs and RAWs to practice different techniques. When you know your way around the tools, then you can watch speedup videos and learn about different tips and editing techniques, every editor has their own tips and bits that help around the editing process. I've learned so much watching timelapses, it's incredible.    But anyways, that's my tip. Read tutorials, watch videos (do both, reading tutorials first so you get the grasp more easily and with time), and practice a lot. I'd say the learning curve is fairly fast at the begining. One thing about Photoshop is that you can always learn something new. Use as many layers as you need. Never use the eraser tool, always mask. **Don't be afraid of making mistakes.** We have CTRL ALT Z for that one. And post in forums to recieve critique, be open to the advice and... practice. Practice, practice, practice. :)     I use frequency separation for very special skin retouches only, like some fashion productions or a photobook, and mostly with super close up portraits where the skin has lots of details and I can't afford to miss them. It's an incredible technique, super useful, but I find that the Healing Brush tool can acomplish similar results in faster ways, in photos that don't require much retouching as the ones I mentioned. For those I stick with freq separation, you mantain the level of detail and lose none of the color and luminosity, it's amazing.   I will, it sounds promising. Thanks for your suggestion :)   It actually is. One of the first I did was the great grandfather of my client, and when her father saw the final photo, she told me he cried and couldn't believe the result. He put the photo next to his mother's by the bed and told her he finally got to see him every day. That was incredibly moving and I felt amazing.    Thanks a lot! Practice, read tutorials and watch videos. You'll get way more badass than this in no time!   THIS particular photo was sent to me via email and unfortunately had a low resolution. That was a downer. But, in terms of me scanning, depending on the size of the photo I use 800-1400dpi. My scan goes up to 4800 I think but that's just unnecessarily big, unless the photo is too small.   Thanks so much! As I said in other comment, just practice, read tutorials, watch videos, and you are going to be able to do much more complex things than this :)    I haven't tried that, no, but I will! One of the things that I absolutely love about Photoshop is that there are SO many ways to reach your goals, don't you agree?   I did both, but honestly the videos and tutorials out there help an awful lot. What I did in this video isn't even that hard technically, it's juts lots of cloning, meticulous selection and layers, layers, and layers. And patience, lots of that!     Get started today on some basic tutorials, and you'll improve greatly in a few weeks! I promise.   I've been using Photoshop for about 12 or 14 years now, I can't recall exactly but pretty much since I owned my first computer. I got more seriously into it a few years back though, in my career (I did 3 years of Photography, in which I had a lot of digital edition learning).    Edit: grammar, my English sucks   Thanks so much!    Thanks a lot! I will :)   Hi! No, just a Logitech G100s mouse.    It is! My idea is to incentivate people to send me bulks of photos, which they tend to have more than just 1 or 2 pictures siting around. I have discount prices for more than 10 pictures to accomplish this goal as well. I can clear 10 pics in a few hours from my computer and earn $150 USD without doing much, and people (especially old people) get **extremely** happy when they see the result, it's great.    I don't mind at all. For this photo I charged the equivalent to $30 USD (maybe a little less, $26 USD). I believe I could've charged a little more, but I'm just starting with this service (repairing old photos) and I want to grab a few customers first. Without the colorization it would've been around $20 USD.   Don't forget macro! You can reverse it and at 18mm it shoots incredible detailed closeups.   Thanks! The colors of the eyes and hair, I asked the client (who was the girl's daughter), and for the dress I selected a nice blueish color that would wring up her eyes :)    Is it me or you can actually see the Moon moving because of the large zoom? That's insane   Try it! Use layers, remember that, even for cloning, because if you make a mistake and miss it, you can fix it later in no-time instead of going back and dismissing a lot of changes you've made.   If you got the time and patience you'll find it's much easier than you think :)   Ha, far from that! But thanks, it's great that you enjoyed it.   Thanks! About 2 hours, there's some minor retouch that I didn't record, some details that I missed and then included in the final photo comparison.   Thanks! I used Open Broadcaster Software for recording (it's totally free, which is great), and then I added the titles, music, and speedup in Adobe Premiere. I'm glad you enjoyed it.   Thanks so much! Super glad you liked it   Thanks! It's some hard work indeed. It doesn't require much Photoshop knowledge though, it's mostly patience!   Thanks so much! I'm glad you liked it.      Can someone confirm how they ended up?    That was really fucked up, I want to gift you a baby goat now :(   ECH EL DELCHE DE LECHEU!

Es una cagada? Por supuesto, pero valoro ms mi vida que **cualquier** cosa material que puedan sacarme. Igualmente, no garantiza nada.    Hace unas semanas en Moreno (Paso del Rey para ser exactos) a un paciente de mi vieja (psicloga) lo agarraron unos pendejos de 17/20 a la 1am. Iba caminado con la mochila atrs y de repente lo tiran al piso, agarrndolo de la mochila. El tipo les dijo "tranquilos chicos, llevense todo". Lo cagaron a trompadas, lo tajearon, y no le cortaron el cuello por casualidad (lleg a ponerse la mano y le regalaron 15 puntos en una palma). Brutal. Le sacaron celular y billetera y se fueron. No se resisti, no se puso nervioso, se fue con un tabique roto, la cara moretoneada y vivo de pedo.    Evidentemente no resistirse no garantiza nada, pero s, reduce muchos las chances de que cobres.    It's like something I knew but I didn't know I knew   You know what they say about strangers and candy... Always accept them.   /v/bodybuilding has been banned.   Eso s, que no  abra la boca para hablar porque la pija me hace huelga, ah coincidimos   La mets en la fila sin que se den cuenta     Si te gust esta publi checke las de Agencia Madre, son todas del mismo tono pero ms bizarras. Tienen algunas muy muy conocidas.   Yo los voto   Grasa seguro, fea no se. Yo no me pongo a salir con la mina, pero cojermela no lo dudo   Dude, look at the sub's name. Of course it happened.   Since I saw that video where the airplane crashes in an air show and sends pieces of people flying everywhere I keep my airshows quota pretty boring as well. Specially since the guy filming zooms in an arm just sitting there on the grass. Brutal.   Man... That sucks. I have a bit of experience with psychedelics and let me tell you, they can fuck-you-up. The last time I consumed a powerful psych was Salvia about 5 or 6 months ago, which is one of my favorites. It wasn't a bad trip or anything like that, but the intensity and duration of it made me want to stop for a little while. I got an existential crisis with it that brought me a great deal of anxiety over the next months and that I'm still battling to get over. I started doubting reality a lot. Like, really doubting. I got severe HPPD that now has luckily toned down a lot and there were moments were I was almost sure I was hallucinating the whole reality. Really fucking irresponsible from my part to have reached this point, but well. Had to cut clean the weed also because it wasn't healping with my anxiety either.      I'm glad I stopped because my biggest fear was to end up like your friend. I know a people or two who have done psychedelics an awful, awful lot and they giggle over the silliest things, have lapsus like you describe and just aren't the same. It's cool to experience what psychedelics have to offer but it should be done under extreme responsibility and control of yourself. I hope your friend gets better :)    Not mine, a friend's. Pretty normal for the deepweb actually, he bought DMT from India and it arrived here to Argentina a few months later, inside of an air pocket on a fake bank letter. The very wtf part was that the dude sent a tab of LSD free of charge as well, which is very fucking weird. Well, I never bought drugs on the dw so maybe that's some kind of a normal deal, but it doesn't sound normal to me. Everything was legit, the tabs were good LSD and the DMT was good purity also.

 I'm trying to complete the quest, "An Indispensable Ally" but all of the dialog boxes and the choice box is blank and as such I can't get past it. How can I try and fix this?  EDIT: Deleted and completely redownloaded the game and it worked. It took a few hours, but now I can progress through the story.   I think the issue with "Blank" is that people try to use it in a rotation rather than as a situational skill.  There is a time and place for it such as in Copperbell where you have to keep the squiggans away from the bomb so that you can break apart the slime. Another place would be in ST during the Amon fight to keep the slimes away while being killed.   Archer knocks themselves back rather than the enemy.   He is playing as a "dark" knight.   For MMOs, Guild Wars 2 might interest you as it is a buy to play MMO rather than a monthly subscription.   This is one where you either love it or hate it and you can tell depending on your reaction to it. There is also a trial/demo version available if you are on the fence.     It doesn't but there is a lot of content to be experienced at level 50 and it seems as though you skipped it to go level another class.   Yes you can, just swap your main arm or create a gear outfit to make swapping instantaneous outside of combat and in a sanctuary.  Well, if you get burnt out trying to level a low class, you aren't forced to do it.   Since you were talking about leveling WAR/PLD dungeons would be the best place to go as you get a lot of exp from the mobs. I was able to get my WAR from 15-21 by doing three dungeons.    Levequests aren't good for combat classes, you might want to try some of the fates or even the level 50 content as there is a LOT of story after reaching 50 to get through that was added for free.   Yeah, I had to entirely ignore the bass and listen to the new voice a number of times to come up with a guess as to what they were singing.   Sure, but I didn't feel like constantly calling upon those in my FC to run dungeons that they are well past and don't need to complete as they tend to take 25-45 minutes to do. I used the time by doing fates and stuff to level up.    [Can't make out this part]  It sounds like, "So we bode with rage". (Bode is not bodes as the upcoming w might have caused those who are singing to pollute the vowel creating an "s" sound.)   It could also be from the introductory scene.   Sadly dungeons are only awesome for tanks and healers as they have much faster queues. (2-5 minutes vs 20-35 minutes as DPS)   Thats the thing, I took my time and watched the cutscenes and I also completely leveled a crafting job/class. I also thought the start of Astral was the last story part until last week.   FFXIV was my first real MMO so I had to learn the ropes and such.   Here is a better description, taken from the manga's page on MAL:  Struggling manga author Satoru Fujinuma is beset by his fear to express himself. However, he has a supernatural ability of being forced to prevent deaths and catastrophes by being sent back in time before the incident occurred, repeating time until the accident is prevented. One day, he gets involved in an accident that has him framed as a murderer. Desperate to save the victim, he sends himself back in time only to find himself as a grade-schooler one month before fellow classmate Kayo Hinadzuki went missing. Satoru now embarks on a new quest: to save Kayo and solve the mystery behind her disappearance.   Pretty long as there are 346 main story quests that have their own cutscenes, not to mention all of the sidequests.  I've been playing for ~90 total days, of being subbed, and I am just about to catch up with where Heavensward starts.   Thank you! All of them, except for the Abhorsen series, seemed interesting and I am looking forward to reading them.   I used to read a lot as a kid, but now that I am in college I've found it hard to find the time to read. With it being summer, I finally have the time to sit down a read.  Outside of the required classes for my literature class two years ago, I've read:  * Hunger Games Trilogy  * Ready Player One (Armada looks interesting)  * Homeland by Cory Doctrow (I didn't like the ending)  * Ender's Game  * Speaker for the Dead  I tried to get into Xenocide, but the shift from Portugese to Chinese is jarring.  I've looked into, finally, reading The Hobbit and then the Lord of the Rings series. Similarly with the Wheel of Time series due to its purported depth and the sheer magnitude of the work. (4.4 million+ words)   So, I guess I am looking for something interesting to read. I've grown up surrounded by books as my mother is an elementary school media specialist. (ie. Librarian)   Well, there is now an official remake. It is using, what appears to be, the same engine as FFXV.   What about the announcement of Fallout 4 or the FFVII remake?   It doesn't support .ass files. (Yes, that is an [actual filetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubStation_Alpha#Advanced_SubStation_Alpha) and it is used for subtitles with typesetting and it supports additional features like animation.)   I think the cutesy Final Fantasy will do well. The POP! figures are really popular int he US right now and Japan has the nendoroid figures that are selling well, so to have a Final Fantasy in that style would be an interesting but safe choice.   Putting on different files will not help. You'd have to format the drive and make sure the file system is exFat or FAT.   A certain character's backstory in Sket Dance. For a gag manga it was pretty hard hitting.   The city of the "old ones" looked like that of the city from Killzone: Shadow Fall, I think it is set in the same universe/planet.   It, probably, is that you are using NFTS rather than a version of Fat. (exFat or Fat32)   [Kickstarter link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ysnet/shenmue-3)   They said it would never happen, yet here we are.   In the [youtube description of the European trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3piye62BYf4), which is in English, it says that it is coming to PS4, Xbox One and PC.  I am really looking forward to it.    While it isn't on the front page, [Re;Birth2 is also on sale for 70% off](http://store.steampowered.com/app/351710/) and it just came out about two weeks ago.  EDIT: The above comment had asked about Hyperdimension Neptunia, hence my reply. Odds are they edited it within the thre minute timeframe where Reddit does not show edits.   Poor /u/banjothebear.   Simple, they are pandering to the fans.   What I need is a boxen of doughnuts.   I'm not surprised that "If My Heart Had Wings" is missing from the Japanese marketplace. The title was originally released in Japan as "Kono Oozora ni, Tsubasa wo Hirogete" back in 2012, according to [VNDB](https://vndb.org/v9093).   Wrong, the base price was always $12.99. They had it on sale for $10 before the sale as a introductory promotion. They kept it the same price for the Summer Sale as well.   I never mentioned Super Meat Boy at all... All I did was suggest that Duck Game needed a controller.   It just came out last week, I doubt it will go on a further sale. I got it on the 11^th and I've already put in ~7 hours while playing online.   You **will** need a controller as the KB controls are a bit weird. (You can rebind them, but I couldn't figure out a good layout.)   Quack pitch doesn't work with a PS4 controller as the trigger also acts as a button.    Just to let you know, 2048 BTC doesn't payout what they say they do.   [Here is a demonstration of Kirby doing the Shakunetsu Hadouken](https://youtu.be/Dj5m7POKl_8?t=2)  While everyone is poring over how Roy and Ryu stand up to the competition, I was curious as to how Kirby reacted to Ryu's advanced techniques or he even had them.  Well, Kirby not only gets the Street Fighter inputs but can also pull off the Shakunestu Hadouken. This is the first time that Kirby had gotten more than one move from a character it sucked in! Like with Ryu, you have to do a bottom half circle from L-R to attack to the right and R-L to attack to the left.   Kirby is also subject to the Hadouken cooldown, but it is quite short compared to Ryu.  I have *not* tested the difference in damage between the Kirby "B" Hadouken and the "D, DR, R + A" Hadouken.  **EDIT**: Made the YouTube link go right before the actual move. (I whiffed it the first time I tried)   Huh, I found that Kirby does the light jab and not the usual 3 direction punch if you just hold "a". As soon as it makes contact or if you move it goes to the regular 3 direction punch.   I've noticed that if you hold "A" without any other inputs, Kirby does Ryu's light punch/jab. Kirby can also do the regular Hadouken with the SF input. I haven't checked enough about light kicks but I would think that Kirby gets them as well.   While everyone is talking about Roy and Ryu, I decided to see how Kirby deals with Ryu's moves. Kirby not only gets the "B" hadouken but also some of the A attacks and he can use the Street Fighter inputs to get the Shakunetsu Hadouken.  Please excuse the poor quality, I had to balance my phone and put in the inputs which requires the use of both hands.   Gaijin is the company behind War Thunder. They jacked up the prices of their packs that people can buy on steam to make it seem like there is a higher discount than there really is.   Well, the script was written by Jun Madea.

If they are, return it immediately.  You might want to look on the [mturk forum](http://mturkforum.com/) (Not affiliated with Amazon, but a good community nonetheless) for good hits to do.     From what I have heard about it, the story is really good.   Probably the most memorable would be the [KS Lily Spoilers](#s "Wheat field scene where it is just them and no one around and the emotions that said scene portrayed.").   I realize this is an old thread, but you could always deposit it into your bank account and then use paypal to buy it. (I came across this through a google search.)         I don't think anyone knows at this point. So far the refunds have only been available for weekdays so this is a learning/growing period.   Try clicking on your name and inventory again. I've found that doing this will fix the issue.   I've seen people saying 2-3 days from the time of approval for the funds to be returned.   Rather than reinstalling your OS, look into creating a bootable USB/DVD of a rescue disk such as the [Kaspersky Rescue Disc](http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/rescuedisk). It will boot your PC from the USB/DVD and scan without any Windows programs running. Unless your virus/malware is really advanced, it should be dormant when running from the USB/DVD device.    This is truly a sequel to Fate/Zero  Thing is, she isn't walking [widdershins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widdershins) but going clockwise around him. (Which is the opposite direction)   JoJo's Bizarre Adventure    Early access for Heavensward, which is the new expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, starts on June 19th. Most of the thread is of people, like myself, lamenting how Splatoon is addictive and it is taking away time from various games, namely FFXIV which has a monthly subscription fee.   Thing is, there are about 100 or so quests to do AFTER the main story. The amount of endgame content is crazy.   Thankfully WAR and other tank classes are easy to do once you can run dungeons as you, pretty much, have instant DF and it always gives a good chunk of experience. (If it is your first class, make sure you do the story as well!)   I got my refund approved around 8PM EST today. It took about three days. I have to wait for my funds now.    Yeah, I've seen a number of posts from people who are still waiting on an approval for a refund that was requested the first day it was available. I, myself, included. At this point, it is out of our hands and it is a matter of Valve getting around to approving/declining them.  EDIT - Some examples:  * [#1](http://redd.it/38obh1)  * [#2](http://redd.it/38kfow)  * [#3](http://redd.it/38h590)  * [#4](http://redd.it/38gfc1)   Considering it just started a few days ago, people do not have a time frame as to when the refunds would be processed. At this point, just wait.   Within Tokyo there is Ikebukuro with Otome Doori (Mainly BL stuff) and Nakano with Nakano Broadway. (An odd mix as the entrance way is all normal shops but as you enter the actual Nakano Broadway it turns into a mini Akihabara. Even then, the main floor is normal stuff and slightly otaku things, the upper is pretty much all otaku stuff and the lower level has a grocery store.)   That is out of what I know, and can remember, odds are there are more within Tokyo itself that I didn't list.   It used to be like this in the US as well. On the back of my copy of The Fellowship of the Ring it has a box saying for people to search "lord of the Rings" on AOL.   The only real referral possibility that OP had was the Amazon Prime sign up and they used the normal link. OP gets nothing out of this.   Mainly the soundtracks for Clannad, Little Busters, Angel Beats and Girls und Panzer OST due to the fact that I own them and they are really good soundtracks.   My guess they only have the ability to do X number of refunds an hour. Odds are so many people requested a refund on the first day that they are playing catch up. I've been waiting for a few days for a refund as well.   Look, it is fine to not want to see certain games but to dismiss them as "shameful" is a bit much. Those games, just like any other, are a culmination of people's work and there are consumers interested in such things. I'm not here to change your opinion on such matters.   --- As for the curators, I would say to go through the types of games that they recommend and select "Not interested" as "Steam recommends curators to follow based on the games those curators recommend and how well we think those fit with the games you've been playing recently."   If you don't like the games they curate, you don't have to subscribe/follow them. It isn't like your eyes are going to melt out of their sockets if you run into one of those pages while perusing a game.   Heck, those curators tend to stay towards the Japanese related games and such so there isn't an issue.   Even better is that it is coming out for the PS3 and Vita in the US later this year! [Here](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/01/29/dengeki-bunko-fighting-climax-coming-to-ps3-vita-this-year/) is a post about it on the Playstation Blog.   You have to submit a ticket to Steam telling them that your account was hijacked with proof of ownership. The good thing is that it seems as though your hacker didn't delete all of your email like they did for mine. (I was, thankfully able to restore my deleted emails)   What is this about? Why should we trust such a contest?  Based on the username you are obviously self-promoting, but who are you and why should we care? Are you even going to pay the winner?   You could try. In the news release, they said that even if you are outside of the 14 days that they might consider a refund on your purchase.   Yep, I tried Lego Worlds and got bored within twenty minutes as I realized there wasn't that much to do other than build and it is hard to build large things without a flat surface to really spread out on so I requested a refund. Hopefully we hear back soon. (I really want to pre-order Heavensward now but I'm ~$4 short...)   Based on what OP said, they haven't even gotten an approval from Valve.   Sadly they didn't give a time frame on the approval process as I am waiting as well. (I requested mine around 8:50PM EST yesterday)   [Here.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=private+internet+access)   I use PrivateInternetAccess as it is pretty cheap on the yearly renewal. ($3.33 a month rather than $5-6+)  It works well and I haven't had any issues while using it.   I've played on VAC enabled servers while on a VPN without any issues. You should be fine. A VPN only encrypts your traffic between you and the server. For all Valve knows you are playing where the server is not where you are.   If you have it, provide as much proof of ownership as possible. Back in the beginning of May, I was able to get my hijacked account back within 24 hours since I provided three different proof of purchases.    n XIV, an enemy aggro'ing me in the open world is just a mild annoyance.  Except for those dang toads near Mor Dhona.    The guy is calling after his dog who is herding a lot of deer and he can't catch up. I guess it is more so the voice and tone of the guy which makes it humorous.   If you look in the post from the IC dev team there is a process in which you can get a refund on the DLC packs that they had on Steam.   Rather than creating the data yourself, look into parsing through [aniDB](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=main) as they already have a bunch of tags that get more and more specific.  Heck, they even have a [full blown page about their API](http://wiki.anidb.net/w/API) and how to use it and such.   I figured as such. Invariably someone will take pictures and share them on here anyways so we might be able to see it.   Well, it isn't until October 31, so you have plenty of time to prepare. They even have a [page](http://kyoanido-event.com/en/) where people from other countries can register to attend the event.   Based upon the [English version of the site](http://kyoanido-event.com/en/), it seems to be a two day event in Miyakomesse, Japan from October 31-November 1st.  It doesn't seem to list anything about what would go on during the event. Considering the amount of time between now and then, odds are, they will release more information as it approaches.   The four characters are separate images from one another, so someone would have to piece it together in photoshop or something.   These are the books I had to get/use for my Japanese Media and Pop Culture class:  * Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the U.S. - ISBN-13: 978-1403984760  * A Geek in Japan: Discovering the Land of Manga, Anime, Zen, and the Tea Ceremony - ISBN-13: 978-4805311295  ---  Here is another that might be good:  * The Otaku Encyclopedia: An Insider's Guide to the Subculture of Cool Japan - ISBN-13: 978-1568365497     Every account on reddit is a bot except you.   Another way of taking care of the RMT spam is to use Guildworks, which hooks into the game when it launches, to remove messages that pertain the to patterns that the spammers use.  While GW is, technically, against the ToS, I've been using it for months without any issues.   Unless you really need to anonymize your VPN purchase, I would say to just buy it through Paypal or Amazon Payments. (I think they also take bitcoin so that would be an option)  I'm not too sure what the best deal is on exchanging gift cards. I only used the feature since I had a gift card that I would never use and figured it would be of some use.   P.s. The exchange is instantaneous and they send the account details to the email you provide them.   You can even use gift cards to pay for it as well.   Thanks for replying, sorry about the interjection in my initial comment. I'll go back and remove it.  I do have a copy of planetarian, but I haven't changed the font since it is perfectly legible as is.  I am really looking forward to the release of Clannad when it becomes available on Steam and it will be a day one purchase from me as I love the story and music from the series.   At least in the us. Over in Japan a new volume of manga is 400-500 ($4-5 USD) rather than the $10 per here. (The difference in price is due to the manga in the US being printed on higher quality paper, licensing/translations costs and what not)   I'm not sure it gets standard updates since the credit page from the translation group says to go to his pixiv page. (pixiv is sort of like deviantart)   I briefly recall that the Steam release is on an updated engine compared to the 18+ version and that it would be impossible to bring the 18+ stuff into the newer engine.    Even better is that later this year, Clannad will be released on Steam. The most recent update was that the translation was at 75% with editing not too far behind it.

I am not affiliated with Sekai Project and as such, any comment here within was simply guessing from someone eager about the game.   What ever you do, don't use Hola. They were found to be selling your bandwidth.

I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to choose the right flair in the future.   No, you are reading it wrong.   The only PC release that Frontwing has in Japan, of first Grisaia game, is 18+.  Sekai Project, the publishers and localizers of the Steam release, ported the entire game from the Vita to the PC to bring in the all-ages content.  EDIT: This is also what the original comment you replied to said.   You used the wrong flair:  You had: **Suggestion**  You needed: **Request**  You are *request*ing anime to watch, not giving a *suggest*ion.  I have changed it accordingly, but please remember to choose the right flair in the future.   Frontwing never made an all ages PC version of the game. The Vita edition, since it couldn't have the 18+ content, had additional CGs and scenes in place of it.  Outside of the all ages version, a few other things were cut or toned down such as the lewd jokes and parts of Amane's route due to the contents there of.  EDIT: Vita, not "wita".   It is the version number. Odds are they did this in the case that either the physics in the game are changed or the map is updated in some form or another.   This is so that people have a frame of reference as to what version of the game this was done on.   While it isn't "beermoney", you may want to look at getting a loan from the bank for the amount you need. You'd have to repay it of course, but it would get you on your feet until you started your job in a few months.   I mean, you can supplement it through stuff like mTurk but you won't be able to do it all through beermoney.   Well, thanks for doing them! I was wondering if you had stopped or something as I suggested it back in the [episode 14 thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/328y3o/spoilers_fatestay_night_unlimited_blade_works/cq9ekyj?context=3)   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/uTYLNET.png) is a 2x'd, inverted and black/white filtered version of the end card.  It was 2x'd using [waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/), a machine learning program that was trained on 3000 anime/manga related images for resizing.  	123
 Did you try to find out where the door lead too?   Even if this is fake, this still gave me the chills unlike a lot of content I see here on /r/creepy, so I give this props. I'm pretty disappointed in this sub for being filled with pictures that are more, for a lack of a better word, weird instead of creepy. This had a story that really does disturb you, and, despite being fake, gave me a little bit of the creeps. This is what I look for on this sub, but it's incredibly rare that I do indeed find this type of disturbing material. I think we should have a rule here that explains behind every creepy picture that there needs to be a story. No more artwork unless there is a creepy back story to it, no more "My cat is giving me a creepy stare" type pics, etc. I find that the "meat" in these posts just aren't there. In my point of view, when I see artwork uploaded to this site, or a pic in general, it's more of an "oh, that's cool" kind of vibe rather than a "damn, now that is scary." But this is just my opinion, and I just needed to get this off my chest without getting a bunch of "dude, chill man." comments. I think with an improvement to the rules here we can filter out the "oh, that's cool" type posts and get more "damn, now that is scary" posts. Once again, this is just my personal opinion and something I needed to get off my chest. Thank you for taking the time to read, cheers! :]   Thank you for this. I've always had a fear of sleep paralysis and after reading this I feel a bit better as to at least have an idea of handling it. (Hopefully I won't have to experience it in the first place.)     Thank you very much.   What do you think would push him over the edge like that? This is becoming a lot more of a curios case when more questions are asked. Hell, I think there is a whole lot more to this when you look at who exactly wants this information and why they do want it in the first place. This is really tugging at my strings here, and I think everybody, including myself, would love to be updated on as to what you find out. Keep up the good work, Meredith. I'll be looking forward to what secrets you uncover next.   Thank you.   Thank you.   May I have your autograph by chance?  	8
 Damn that was amazing   Pretty much the pepto bismol ad   Tottenham   I never said you were wrong, I just stated that this question is not a serious one. It obviously would never happen or work, but that's not the point of this.    Why would you comment if your not sure  	5
 K-On Genesis Evangelion.    That's Super *Tengen Toppa* Gurren Lagann, who is 3 Billion (?) light-years tall.   Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann is the form that came from Arc-Gurren Lagann piloting the Cathedral Terra, the space battleship that was hidden inside the Moon.   The Rebuild of Evangelion movies are sequels to the original Neon Genesis Evangelion.    \implying Mr. Satan isn't the greatest martial artist alive or dead.       Yaoi hands?   Not just any boxer, that's Rocky Balboa.   WHY IS YHERE A MINION OF ROCKY FUCKING BALBOA  AND HOW IS IT IN ANY WAY RELEVANT   minion rage comics  Time to go commit sudoku.    "Frankly, my dear, I respect your opinion as completely legitimate."   I can't find it on eBay, Amazon, or Rightstuf. The links on the Aniplex website are down. Is there anywhere it's still available?    The "fucking Power Armor gimmick" edition is sold out forever.    This post is the only Fallout-related result when I googled "Fallout Sailor Moon"  Which means no one has modded Usagi's hair into FO3 yet. I'm very disappointed by this.       Armor with a bare midriff would be impractical, but since she's in nothing but a tee shirt and the bottom half of a jumpsuit, it's fair to assume it would be for mobility/cooling purposes.   Or maybe the Senshi just like showing off.    A man and a man? What's next, a man and Mothra?!?! The Bible says we shouldn't allow [Them!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047573/) to marry!!!!!  I watch too many giant insect movies.    She can't touch type? What is this, the 1800s?   Is nothing sacred?    Evil me is a Communist Atheist Nazi. While he would probably be better in combat (because I'm an out-of-shape weeb piece of shit), his undoing would be his monologues. I know for a *fact* that while I would have the better one-liners of the two of us, he would start monologuing the moment he got the upper hand.   Isn't a doppelganger just someone who looks like you?   There are dozens of us!   Dozens!   But the T-800 would have to switch off of read-only mode in Middle-Earth. He only did so in T2 because John wanted him to stop being such a dork. Even then, he didn't really have his own emotions, he just comprehended John's.    To be fair, I thought it was Unit-13 for a second   Pigs are communists though, so it's all cool.    Stage 15 Jontron withdrawal.    Fishing for Gaghiel?   It *does* help that TTGL is a bit of a parody of NGE.    Noriko is like Shinji without a dick but with bigger balls.    Two words: Gurren Lagann.    It was. It was also Hideaki Anno's directorial debut.    Fuck. That actually makes a lot of sense.    It also helps that Ramiel's the only angel to be implied to be even close to female (Lilith notwithstanding)   Glad I'm not the only one who knows where their towel is.    So... Bayonetta confirmed?   I'm so happy I managed to snag one while they were still on Amazon.    The rebel alliance get some new recruits: Noriko Takaya and Amano Kazumi, along with their Buster Machines. Using the Gunbuster, can the rebels destroy the Death Star without needing Luke? Do they even have to use the one weak spot?      I'll trade you a NiB Mario for a Rosalina restock.    There's Sadamoto's manga, which tells the same story, but with several minor (and some major) differences (For one, Kaworu shows up way earlier and is actually a full-fludged character). There's a couple other mangas as well, like Campus Apocalypse, but none of them are really very good like the original.   Once you've gotten to every Evangelion medium, you could try some other, similar shows. Gunbuster was the first work of Evangelion's director, Hideaki Anno. It's also a great work which greatly influenced mecha, especially Evangelion. They also share similar themes and characters, to the point where Shinji seems like Gunbuster's Noriko with a dick. There's also Gurren Lagann, which is an incredibly badass sort-of-parody of Evangelion. Finally, Madoka Magica. In the most basic sense, it's Evangelion with magical girls instead of mechs.    This is specifically in reference to the mobile game.    Games are just 1s and 0s but most of us still like 'em.    Was Hikari even *in* 2.22?   That's stupid. Just who in the hell do they think they are?   I called my local GS, and they said it's not happening, so chill yo.    Why not?   On DVD, preferably.    Kinky.    That would be great. I'm fucking tired of hearing Peter Parker's origin story, give me a new Spider-Man origin.    I think she actually looks really good. I might pick her up, even though I wasn't planning on getting any of wave 5A.    Where'd you get your hands on that? It looks awesome   That makes sense, since they were all animated by a different studio and not considered canon.   One of the best in the whole series. Better than Hedorah.    Marv Newland produced by Mr and Mrs Newland   In, like, a display case?    Why?   To be fair, the "Mario is a communist" one ended with him pointing out how batshit theories can get.    Bullshit. We all know Lucina's flatter than Mr Game and Watch.    Tabris got the booty.    Gonna make a Captain Falcon with realistic booty.    I didn't know you could become a cop in this game   Not the pilots, the robots.   Unit-00, Unit-01, and Unit-02. Best anime MILFs.    January is usually a terrible month for movies. Like one or two good ones, max.   I had not taken the competition from Star Wars into consideration.    can't lose those gains, brah   It's a shame, since that's the one thing that really brings down the movie. If it weren't for that, I'd say it's one of the best in the series.    Yeah, despite being the focus of most of the advertising, he was killed off in like the first half hour of the movie.    I think /u/GamingTatertot might have been referencing the new Godzilla. I hope, because if not he just accidentally described that movie pretty accurately.    Next January  That's not a good sign.    You gotta monologue before getting into the suit. That's badass 101. Arms folded, too. [Like a fuckin' pimp.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/664/747/f5f.jpg)   Because once she gets developed as a character, she's one of the more complex and sympathetic characters to have ever been written in an anime.   I was referring to the actual quality of the dub though. Because Tiffany Grant's Asuka is fucking perfect. Everyone else's performance smooths out by that point too.    Rob Bethesda at gunpoint.    What if Godzilla was one of us?   Every time I rewatch it, I find Evangelion's first couple episodes to be pretty tough to get through. Though that could be because the dub doesn't get good until Asuka shows up...   *unzips dick*   What about G14?   Also, I think Gojira's a pretty bad place to start. The dark tone and general gloomy nature clash with the rest of the series, to the point where it's practically separate from the other movies (G85 notwithstanding)   And the Inklings   As an American, that's pretty much my understanding of Boston.    Ganondorf is high-tier in terms of porn site sponsorships.    I found out the preorders had started when I learned that they ran out of Pip-Boys.   Teen Sword Squad!   I wasn't gonna get this DLC, but now I think I might.    Reggie looking like he's playing Little Mac   when u nut but Todd Howard still suckin   Gonna keep these box boxes nib   Is Ryu going to S-tier? Because it looks like Ryu is going to S-tier.    \not keeping your box boxes in a box   "Jet fuel can't melt steel beams"  It's a phrase making fun of 9/11 conspiracy theorists.    I can do it.    I'm not entirely sure I can get with that. Oh well, worst case scenario is someone mods it out.    Someone's never played Melee.    Its only seriously redeeming feature is the Chao garden  City Escape.    But it wouldn't make sense *not* to use Bayonetta. Since she is being exclusive now.    "MATOI RYUKO!"   Shame they're limiting themselves just to Bayonetta then.    The good news is that Ryu's amiibo will be one o might be able to get, since it looks like the third-parties are relatively common (at least at my local TRUS)   Did they say they were only doing *one* smash ballot character?   Do you play Boswer Jr as "Lagann"?  That's what I'm planning on naming my Bowser Jr amiibo, anyway.    My favorite fun Super Robot show is Gunbuster (and to a lesser extent, its sequel, Diebuster). Another Gainax mecha which TTGL takes heavy inspiration from (some people even claim that the end result of TTGL was an attempt to one-up the size of the Diebuster). IT's a classic that every mecha/anime fan should watch at least once. Considering TTGL is less of a show and more of a "best-of" video of mecha influence, a lot of it is taken straight from the playbook of Gunbuster.   There's also Getter Robo and Mazinger, which I can't personally attest to, but are some of the other classic Super Robots that really shaped the genre (apparently someone cuts a planet in half in Shin Getter Robo)  If you start feeling depressed, hit up Evangelion. Alongside TTGL and Gun/Diebuster, it stands at the top of the Super Robot genre. It's the deconstruction of the genre, being much more character-focused and less action-focused (don't let that turn you off, I actually consider it the greatest anime of all time). While not enjoyable for the same reasons as TTGL, you should certainly watch it. Gurren Lagann was actually somewhat of a parody of Evangelion (when you watch the show you'll see what I mean. There's a lot of connections).    Why won't Falcon-senpai notice me?   The only model of the 3DS that's compatible with amiibo is the New 3DS XL. The only amiibo compatible games for the N3DS are Smash Bros 3DS (Which works with every amiibo except Splatoon and Toad, so far), Code Name S.T.E.A.M. (which works with the Fire Emblem amiibos, so don't even trip cause you won't get your hands on one of those), Ace Combat Assault: Horizon Legacy (which works with most amiibos), and Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (Which only works with Shulk. In other words, no amiibo compatibility)  [here's](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/compatibility) the compatibility chart   Is that Dark Link a different figure?   For publicity. The utter ridiculousness (and yet appropriateness) of a porn site sponsoring a player brings in traffic.    "pretty good argument for legalizing murder"?   Is that one of those things that they're gonna patch in? Eventually?      Maybe I can go Ganon with a sponsorship from /r/spacedicks   What, that Sheik is actually not the epitome of manliness and testosterone with a pair of testicles big enough to make a Goron jealous? What else would he be, the Princess in disguise? That would be funny.    better nerf ^^/funnyandoriginal   Because he's the only furry that's cool. He has an AT field 10/10   That Sheik dude has a nice man-ass. For someone with a Y chromosome.    When are these coming to America?    You guys know you want me.    Same reason as Fakku   Looks like I need to learn Ganondorf and go after Pornhub.    I always hated how he beat Godzilla, though.   Did the kid die in a coal mine?    I want to give my friend a vinyl record of the Watergate tapes and I don't know where to go.    This should be on *my* desk   Cthulhuphant?   It's not (just) that you can't see where your feet are. It's that you have next to no spacial awareness that third person (or in the case of real life, your other senses) can provide.    Also because, you know, raisins in ice cream.    Why ban Afro Samurai?    I'll agree with you on the art style. Mirror's Edge makes for some *damn* nice screenshots. And the first person perspective does allow the player to appreciate it. But I just don't understand how people enjoy *playing* it. Platforming in a first person perspective just doesn't work as well as in third person.    [real question] Why do people like the gameplay so much? Platforming in first person is such a terrible idea, and it's not like Mirror's Edge executes it in a manner that redeems it.    Mechagamera?   *sigh* Ganon and ZSS are gonna be unicorns, aren't they?  At least I can still have Doc and Bowser Jr  ...hopefully.    Someone's never seen /r/Slutoon  Though to be honest, I wish I hadn't either.    He doesn't tip on his shawarma.       I want to train Pac-Man. I'm good at Mewtwo and Rosalina.    Yeah, it seems like OP wouldn't have gotten Akame's number if it weren't for Sakura. So this is absolutely a positive outcome.    This is why I'm ashamed to tell people I like anime. These fuckers ruined an entire medium. I kinda wanna go burn my Evangelion DVDs now.   Mecha cosplay is the best cosplay.    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann! Robots the size of the observable universe throwing down using *fucking galaxies* as weapons.   Also, Evangelion. EoE (and to a lesser extent, the TV ending) is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, even though the show started out kinda rocky.   And Gunbuster. Episode 6 is just... fuck. EDIT: In a good way.    2077: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon   Agreed. Bayonetta 2 has to be the best single player game on the Wii U right now.   Please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta, please let it be Bayonetta..   Old blueman:   New blueman: :(  What happened, America?   I thought I was an ear of butter!   Arceus, as one should always keep the Lord in their heart   It's like End of Evangelion with more mindfuck.    seeing internet strangers give each other precious metals.

[You need this to use it](http://m4sv.com/page/wii-u-gcn-usb-driver)   his taunts would be the first to deal damage to the player    A government weaponizing Arceus, the literal God of creation, is downright terrifying.  Vatican too OP Game Freak pls nerf   Wow it's like no one wants a Charizard. I'd be glad to have it.    Earthbound is freakin' sweet. Whoever gets it is gonna have a field day.    MattyB, a white kid who thinks he can rap. his parents (and more importantly, their wallets) agree.    There are **REASONS** why it can't be a Mexican standoff!    Man finally getting my hands on Charizard would be sweet   Yours is the railgun that's gonna pierce the heavens!   Im totally stealing it.    The area is gray in a one two three way.    To be fair, that's on a window. Anyone who looks out that window is gonna see "niggaZ". The real question is why no one thought of that when they first did it.    Does Rami-chan even have boobs?   You're not a tycoon!   She's heavy because she's a god damn giant. Who has galaxies up her dress.    What happens when it goes over nine tho-   Fuck it. I'm above that joke.    Did you hack Linux, Java?   Wisconsin needs to go back to Canada where it belongs.   I want to watch the Granny Sexbang episode but I'm not sure my cold heart can handle it.    Maybe we can play some Project M with this   Kiryu's one of my favorite mecha, but I can't seem to find any model kits of him. Am I just not looking in the right places?      That's the reblogger.

    An American black female who was in my command when I was in the Navy jumped all over her white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, male shipmate when he casually mentioned he was an African-American.  She couldn't grasp the difference between country of origin/nationality vs race.  She also went so far as to prevent another shipmate from listening to a radio program that she found offensive when she happened to drop by his work station.  Seems she didn't like it hearing Louis Farrahkan referred to as "Calypso Louie" by the black radio host, Ken Hamblin and no, she was not Muslim.  So much for protecting the Constitution and the rights of free speech!        Why?    Well that not exactly Southern is it?  Mashed taters or mac and cheese is were it's at!    I know, beans right?  My bite he gave me however, convinced me otherwise!        Poke holes before adding toppings.     Concur.    Were are you from and why are you making a "Southern" dinner?   Sidewalk fries?    Healthy fresh but then you add the ham or ham hocks and slow cook them until all the nutrients are leached out into the water.     Not funny, cute or witty.  Don't post here again.   Also people that eat haggis or Balut with or without drinking any alcohol!

Elvis was definitely on to something!  Checkout my appetizer version I did for my culinary school graduation reception.  They were hit!        Thanks.  I think you're right.  Might have to change pharmacies though since my pain meds are pretty strong and they may give me hassles.      The prescription was for an opioid pain patch.  I used it for 1 week before I realized it was 7 months past its expiration date.  I don't think I suffered any ill affects and they, happily and apologetically replace the medication.  I'm not looking for a lawsuit/money but I'm concerned because this chain pharmacy has been caught and fined for selling expired OTC medication and food items in another state.  It may have been an honest mistake but because of their previous lawsuit and the fact it was a prescription drug that could have had serious consequences I feel I'm responsible to report it.      Back in the day when car bodies were made of metal my car battery died.  I didn't have any cables and nobody else did.  We were in a remote area.  I found an extension cord, split the two wires apart and stripped both ends of one wire.  Found a willing soul and we positioned the cars so that the bumpers touched to create a ground then, with both cars off, I clamped one bare end to the positive terminal from one battery then did the same with the other.  Started car one, let it run, then started mine.  Fired right up!  Can't do that anymore!      That's so sweet of you but it must be torture!  The same with me but it's popcorn.  I tell my husband to go ahead a make it for himself but he adamantly refuses to.      Nope, pan seared.  I like to get the entire surface of the patty browned.  Gives it more flavor!

Damn, now I'm hungry!        Try dribbling some Sriracha on it!     You're welcome.  The best advise I got from a cajun and chili-head is make sure every layer you add to a dish adds either flavor or texture.  For instance, instead of adding just water, even if you're just making Kraft Mac and Cheese, add chicken stock instead of water.  Add some of your spices at the beginning but leave some to throw in at the end.  For texture add some of your veggies from the beginning for aromatics but add additional toward the end for taste and texture.     Tried to waffle some KD to go with my burger.  What do you think?  http://imgur.com/9CpJIIz    I don't like to give away all my secrets but here's my general spice packet plus aromatics to 1lbs dried beans or 60 oz canned red beans, Blue Runner of course.  Equal parts black, white and red(cayenne) pepper, 1 tsp ea. Dried thyme and oregano, 2 Tbsp ea. Bay leaves, 2 Hot sauce, 1 tsp Worcestershire, 1 tsp salt to taste  Onions, green and red bell pepper, minced fresh garlic.  Plus Andouillie sausage(diced), pickled pork(diced) and tasso(minced).   Oh my, what a big seed you have!   What's "wrong" about yours?   KD?   (Serious research) What are or were your favorite things to eat or most creative things you've made while stoned?    Look like the yolk is trying to give the bun a hug.    Potatoes are beautiful things plus you can make vodka from them.  Try to do that with a steak!   Thanks!  I like to put pickled pork in my beans but I have to drive pretty far to get it so I make a huge batch and freeze smaller portions.  Sure do miss a lot of things about New Orleans!   As an old cook in the Navy I say job well done mate!  I like just a little glaze on mine so I can admire the rings of filling and golden brown rolls but that just my preference.    I think your portioning was okay but doing it your way makes it hard to get a nice clean slice without "sealing" the cut edges.  This is one reason rolls will bolt up in the middle.                         Before you cut the rolls, refrigerate it covered in plastic for 15 minutes.  This firms up the dough and butter so it won't squish down and the filling doesn't squeeze out.  Using your handy dandy ruler mat as a guide and a very sharp long knife cut your rolls while using your other hand to gently maintain the shape of the roll.  Try not to end up with a  shaped roll but if you do just lightly lay it down and round it out. Use a bigger pan.  Your rolls are too close together!  They should almost double in size with the second rising.  Also, when you originally roll the dough up, do so as loosely as you can.  That will allow the rolls to expand.  Roll it too tight and they won't proof correctly and can also cause the middle to bolt up. Just some words of advise from an old salty cook.  Can't wait to see the next batch!    Nice job!    Hope you left some for her!   You can't "fry" using soy sauce since it contains no oil.  Simmer, boil or poach maybe but not fry.  Even butter has too much water to fry all though I heard of some that have used margarine however, since margarine is just one molecule away from being a plastic I wouldn't.    I'd like a cherry pie tree too!  I'd settle for a fruit cocktail tree though.      I think it's a work of art and so good!  I hope my friend, Rowdy Dugan is successful with his business!  I bake too but back pain keeps me out of the professional arena for now.  As far as the cherry clafoutis, it's the first thing I make when cherries are in season. http://imgur.com/vH8L1Hg           Why?          Eating the rice? Yes it does lol!      Even as a chef, when I eat out I pay to have that another chef treat me.  I can always come up with my own stuff and definitely won't pay higher prices just because they have the ingredients on hand!   True. Most homeowners/renters insurance covers loss of power usually up to $500.  Don't know if they would cover it because of a defective refrigerator though.  When I lost power for barely over 24 hours I called my insurance company.  They did not send an adjuster out, just began asking what I'd lost.  Rattled off a bunch of expensive cheeses, charcuterie, shellfish, all kinds of imported olives etc.  She asks if I'm a chef, "yes", I tell her and bingo, she awards me the full amount!  Pretty much just had the basics, less than $75.   I know, I'm bad.   This just indicates the owner/chef is to lazy or uneducated to create their own salad combinations.  Nothing but a salad bar.      Round har we call potatoes taters as in tater salad or tots.               ; )   https://youtu.be/neUaSTSKFZc       Looks as though all the chefs got a raging case of diarrhea and the dishwasher had to step in and cook/plate from memory!  Though I know some dishwashers that can plate better lol!    Ohhh YES!   Strongly concur.  Never let chicken or turkey come to room temperature!   Beautiful bowls of gravy!  Good Job!   No wonder our Admiral had his Culinary Specialist cater his Change of Command there!   That would be the name of the ship/submarine.  Her Majesty's Ship (HMS) Splendid.   Name your offending place of employment now and we will not judge you.   No   Yes, you can use it to thicken anything you want.   7th generation Texan here.  We say pies and bucks.  One thing I've never seen is someone putting Ranch on pizza!  Seriously, why? Hope they're just dipping the pizza bones in it. The closest I've seen are Mississippians who put Catalina dressing on pizza.     	111
 This was *not* my original idea.

You have been a tremendous help. Thanks for caring enough about your extension to help troubleshoot a pleb like me. Linked below are the pages of my "positions".

I'm on minute ten right now. Nothing has changed.   I have tried that my friend. Unsuccessful attempt. Thank you though.   [This](http://i.imgur.com/dxFGucJ.png) has been happening for the last couple of days.  I have replays, I just can't see them. I've disabled and then reenabled the extension to no avail. Any suggestions other than deleting and reinstalling? Would rather not lose my saves.   Thank you Ankh. Just did this after 10 times to top bombs with no Mario. And now, after reading your mini-guide...  **It's-a me, Mario!**   pls   pls   pls   What programs do you use to record and then make your montages?   I just completed the Companion App missions last night and I'll tell you that it is worth it. Seeing that I finally unlocked Altair's robes was extremely satisfying. I haven't taken them off yet.      You're my hero.    How do you locate the cockades and chests that don't show up on the map?   I was hoping this would end in "Thug Life".   I'm still building up, working on form and adding weight each day as the program suggests. Currently I am at the following:  Squat - 110 Deadlift - 145 Bench -  110 Row - 90 OH Press - 70  Pleasd don't take those as final numbers by any means. On most, I'm not even struggling yet. Still in the early phases of the program.    I am well aware that I won't accidentally get big. I've been working out off and on for a while now. I was simply stating that my goal is not to get big. It is to stay relatively small.          How would one go about moving over an operating system from a current drive to the new SSD?      Additionally, I am still having issues with co-op. I am able to play. That is not the problem. My issue is that every single one of my in-game contacts are listed as myself. There are twenty *test_subject861's* in my list!   I've always told it to people this way:  If you've read Ender's Game and enjoyed the Battle Room and action-oriented sequences, then Ender's Shadow is for you.  If you enjoyed the Lock/Demosthenes, Giant's Drink, and Ender's internal monologue sequences, then Ender's Saga is for you.   It doesn't look like hardware is the issue. I had a similar problem before the patches fixed some of the issues. I would try to start Uplay in Offline Mode. Then play the game disconnected from the internet. If that works, you can try turning the internet back on once in game. Hopefully that works.   Yes. Always. Everyone.   Any links showing the full process of shoe-making? I think that would be interesting.   I would place Unity somewhere between Black Flag and AC3. This might be my current line up: Brotherhood  AC2  Black Flag  Unity  AC3  Revelations  AC. But, that changes regularly.   It was just another day. Though, this day he was Jennifer.  He knew so thanks to the alarm on his phone that must have been going off for two minutes already. The screen read: "GET UP JENNIFER! Seriously, last chance if you want makeup today." He didn't.  After the second snooze wore off and the alarm sounded again, he forced himself out of bed and found his way to the bathroom. It was always awkward being a girl, even more so a teenage girl. As usual, he lifted his nightshirt to check himself out. *Could be worse*, he thought. And it could have been. He recalled the terrible day he woke up as middle school principal's secretary Shelia. Ugly, overweight, married to some bad-breath slob who tried for morning snuggles. That day was a living nightmare. Screw Shelia.  He found some clothes that looked what he would consider to be cute, tied his hair in a bun, skipped the makeup, and went downstairs. There was commotion in the kitchen. His mom started as soon as he walked in.  "Jennifer, are you kidding me? You're going to be late for school! I packed you a lunch, it's on the counter. Please get your stuff and get your brother to school on time." He knew it was his mom because he wasn't stupid. Also, he had done this many times before. Different people, different names, same story. He mumbled something so that his mother would know he had heard her, retrieved his purple backpack, and then grabbed his lunch off of the kitchen counter. Little brother was waiting at the door before he, Jennifer, could grab the keys to what he hoped would be his own car. He followed the boy out into the garage and into the red Prius. *Ew, that kind of Jennifer.*   He didn't know how to get to the middle school, much less his own school, which he assumed was a local high school.    "Can you tell me how to get to your school?"   "Real funny, Jen. You take me to school every single day."  "I know. It's...just a test." This wasn't his first rodeo. Little brothers love to be challenged.   They made it to Caddo Middle School as the bell rang. He smiled and waved by to his brother before rummaging through his backpack for clues as to where Jennifer attended. It was easy to locate, park, and even attend classes, talking to friends who spoke first and remaining quiet and passive in class. Everything went downhill at volleyball practice.  Coach Bates was a frumpy male-looking female--short graying hair, sagging skin, and a voice that was uncomfortably deep. Apparently, Jennifer was supposed to be one of Coach Bates' best athletes, at least when it came to hitting a white ball over a suspended net. And while Jennifer might have been swift and agile in her own body, he most definitely was not. He couldn't fake it either. Halfway through practice, Coach sent him back to the locker room to change. He was a little embarrassed, but he didn't really care. Jennifer would have to be the one to put up with the consequences of today, tomorrow.   As he pulled off his sports bra, he heard a noise. Instinctively, he covered his chest and looked around the room. He was alone. Everyone else was at practice.   Slowly, he walked through the aisle between the lockers, stopping at one that seemed to be rattling. Pulling the locker opened, three high school boys tumbled out onto the locker room floor in a panic. It was an accident. They didn't mean to. It was Cliff's idea. All sorts of excuses came spilling out of their mouths. None of them were true. It was obvious, they wanted to see some naked girls and that's that. Jennifer wasn't having it.   He dropped her bra. The boys gasped. He reached down for Cliff's hand, beckoning him to stand. He did. Jennifer leaned in, his chest against Cliff's, and whispered in his ear. "Don't let me *ever* see you in here again." He reared back and then slammed his fragile little hand into Cliff's nose. He howled in pain. The three boys ran out of the locker room, two laughing, one crying.   Later that night he lay in bed remembering the events of the strange day. It wasn't the only strange day he had had. Most, in fact, were awkward to some degree. He was sure that he had broken Jennifer's hand. He tried to hide it from mom, but she had noticed and bandaged it up until they could have the school nurse look at it in the morning. He couldn't even begin to imagine how confused Jennifer would be tomorrow. A broken hand, a few new enemies at school, an angry coach, and a fresh new key scratch down the side of her precious Prius. But, none of it was his problem anymore.  Tomorrow he could quite possibly be a Rick or a Dave or Juan. He might even wake up as Coach Bates. He never knew what to expect. Today, he had been Jennifer. It was just another day.   I'm halfway through the game, trying to enjoy and complete all of the co-op and heist missions along the way. I keep getting paired with idiots that just run in and start swinging their sword. I want some brothers to play assassins with. Any suggestions?   *Just saw this. Thought it was beautiful. Didn't have permission, but was inspired and wanted to edit it a bit. Great work /u/kappakappapie!*  The boy who lived realized that his time to die would soon come. Magic had sustained him far past the age of any normal human being. He had seen and experienced many wonderful things throughout his extended years, but very few moments were as precious as this one. Harry watched as one of his great grandchildren sat under the Sorting Hat. That hat always had a way of surprising Harry, even when it came to his own flesh and blood. He grinned as the Sorting Hat called out Hufflepuff and a section of the Great Hall erupted into a raucous applause.     Family was rarely allowed to attend the Sorting, but this was a small favor granted Harry from an old friend who had recently become a beloved headmaster. Though most of the students and even some of the professors wouldnt recognize him in his late age, save for his notorious scar, he didnt want to make a scene. Harry wrapped the generational cloak around his shoulders, covered his head, and disappeared from sight.  He walked slowly the aging halls of Hogwarts until his memories carried him out of the castle and onto the grounds. The groundkeepers cabin still shone in the darkness, bordering his intended destination. It would always be Hagrids house to Harry. Tears began to well up in his eyes as he recalled the many adventures he had shared with his best friends. Hermoine, Ron, and he would make frequent late night visits to Hagrids hut, hidden only by the invisibility cloak that he now wore. It had been many years since Harry had attended each of their funerals, but his feelings for his lifes closest friends had never diminished.   Suddenly, the Forbidden Forest was in front of him, as dark and imposing as ever. Harry slid his cloak off of his shoulders and tucked it into the satchel hanging at his side. He patted the leather carrier closed, trusting that his belongings would be returned to his next of kin.  It took him a while, but he finally found what he had returned to the forest to recover. A small smooth stone. It had been pressed deep into the dirt, covered over many times by passing students, centaur, and forest creatures alike. His bones creaked as he stood to examine the long forgotten Hallow, the only magic strong enough to bring back lost loved ones, even if only for a brief moment.  He longed to once again see his family and friends, but knew that wish would be granted only a short time from now. No. Who he sought today, with his fleeting strength, was someone different; someone else from his past that had left a lasting impression on Harrys life.  Harry closed his eyes and turned the stone over three times in his hand.  Tom Riddle stood before him. Rather, a shade of the man who had, many years ago, become Voldemort looked back at Harry in disbelief and bewilderment. There was still anger, still fear in Toms eyes.   Harry shook his head and waved a dismissive hand at Tom.   Our contest has long since passed, old friend. The years have made me what some would call wiser, but perhaps we all simply learn to forgive, given enough time. Harry limped forward until he was face-to-face with the apparition of a man he never truly met. Do not be troubled, Tom. You were never meant for this world. It was especially cruel to you. You only chose to react in kind.  Harry breathed deeply, then spoke in a whisper. We both fear death, dont we Tom? Weve escaped it in different ways, weve made different choices along the way, but here we both arein between.  A cold wind rustled the trees. A wolf howled in the distance. And Harrys heart slowed its beat.  Thats why I came here tonight. Together we can move on from this world and into the final adventure that is death. Prophecies and cruelty of the past made us enemies. Perhaps it is our destiny to move from it as friends.  As Harry sunk to his knees and the stone from his hand, he was sure that as the image faded from sight he saw a glint in Toms eye. For the final time, Death loomed over Harry Potter. Harry smiled and nodded, welcoming Death as a friend.   Must have hit some time during the week. As I said in OP, I got back from Thanksgiving travels and it was there for update.  I'm on regularly after 6:00 PM (EST).   A PC man.   ^^Preface: ^^I ^^know ^^that ^^there ^^have ^^probably ^^been ^^other ^^posts ^^such ^^as ^^this ^^one, ^^but ^^due ^^to ^^my ^^excitement, ^^I ^^just ^^had ^^to ^^make ^^one ^^of ^^my ^^own. ^^Carry ^^on.  I came home from Thanksgiving travels today and sat down at the computer, downloaded Patch 3, and started up Unity. For the first time, I was able to open the game online without a single crash. For the first time, I was able to up all graphics to max settings and saw very few graphical issues (970 for those wondering). For the first time, I was able to open a blue Companion App chest *and* a yellow Initiate's chest. For the first time, I was able to play a co-op mission in all of it's splendor. For the first time, I was able to play AC:U as it was meant to be played...and it was awesome.  I would love to connect with some of you via co-op because I can only imagine how could missions would be with skilled assassins by my side. Feel free to PM me or post your detail below.  I am excited once again. This does not excuse what Ubisoft did with the launch of an unfinished game. But I am finally content with being able to experience AC:U in the way it was meant to be played.       It's so unfortunate. The part of the game they pushed most (co-op) is the part that I am unable to play. There is so much of the game that is missing without online functionality. I'm sad.  	44

 with the most recent changes i had a feeling that ap's were going to be weaker. but after the update i feel like they have only gotten stronger early which is what needed to be done in the game as thats what a mage is supposed to be.   alright missions your best bet is this page here. http://www.naruto-boards.com/953198/ its gotten me around 10 characters. now for climbing you need to look into all the old characters there have been some major changes. EX lee no longer has 2 different builds its now 2 different characters. kin no longer infinitely stacks damage on people she now has conditional skills on skill targeting. and ten ten no longer deals over time aoe she can now stack damage and reduce damage that target deals in an aoe fashion but once a turn. another thing is that chouji no longer deals 300% on his 3rd pill its now a flat damage for his skils ranging from 20+ on his hand one (cant remember name) and 10+ on his roll invuln the invulnerability on it doesnt block healing so you can take sakura S on chouji team and heal him when hes invuln while eating a pill. thats going to be all i can really tell you i really reccomend looking into all characters with this http://nahelp.webs.com/Nahelper.swf    i mean i can get 22 kills 2 deaths and only get an s- with it being a 20-30 minute game. it varies champion to champion based on how well others do with that champion.   your sorta supposed to die with a team around. that way your first death will only put you in a better position for a team fight.  	4

    /r/retiredgif   And old, i assume. But i could not find an estimate.      No one knows. It just happened.                     It's easy if you know how!         I don't know why, but on one hand i am completetly sad cos the tree died. But on the other hand i am more that happy cos the tree lives on in such a... tremendous way.

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.  The Mexican replied, only a little while. The American then asked why didnt he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his familys immediate needs. The American then asked, but what do you do with the rest of your time?  The Mexican fisherman said, I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life. The American scoffed, I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.  The Mexican fisherman asked, But, how long will this all take?  To which the American replied, 15  20 years.  But what then? Asked the Mexican.  The American laughed and said, Thats the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!  Millions  then what?  The American said, Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.

 You live near the U of M area or Bartlett by any chance?   Live between Memphis and Jackson,Tn. All I can say is stay away from East Jackson, Orange Mound and East St.Louis. Anyone know about Paducah?   So what about McFarlane or Shadowhawk or Erik Larsen or Mark Bagley,etc.?    Uh no. Pick up Suicide Squad 1 from 1987. Nu-52 Suicide Squad is shit.   Someone has been watching UHF.   Faith No More remake?   I know it's weird as fuck to say, but when you live in the south and you hear it every single day you end up saying it yourself. I had to ween myself from saying it.   This is the first generation model that came with a hard drive in 2009.   Taco Bell?   Nope. Can confirm. Friend works at a Coca-Cola bottling plant and he got wrote up for eating Taco Bell cause they are owned by Pepsico.   If you work for Coca-Cola you can also get fired for eating at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.      You just watched this on Netflix too?   37?   Savage Dragon is still good. P.S. I enjoyed Shadowhawk.   Fuck no. I'm talking about the comments in this thread.  A potato ban is necessary with the shit attitudes and neckbeardisms.   Grandparents. Honestly, Microsoft still updates it and 8 people in the United States still use it.   Saying go get a job is easier to say than to find one.   For a cheeseburger?   Link?   Teethy blowjob makes my dick sore. I got a few and my cock was sore for days.   Potatoes offend me. Somebody ban them.   Guess my old neighborhood is the hood now (Frayser).

Must have been me. I farted.   I may have said this long ago but I really think I ate breakfast with a serial killer once.   That's the thing about DC. They only care about the now instead of the when and what.  You have tons of cosmic entities and artifacts that the DC Universe writers don't use.  I mean DC has the Human Squirrel and Fireworks Man.    It also explains where these superheroes come from. No conscious  being appears out of nowhere unless there is an explanation for it.  It's a really powerful device and not one writer has even delved into the backstory.    Nah. Phantom Stranger isn't obscure. But I have a fan theory about one obscure DC hero. I really do think this makes sense. Dial H For Hero : That dial is a cosmic multiversale construct on the same level as the Time Knife, the Book Of Crime, the Omni-Gauntlets,etc. The Dial possessor switches places with a hero on Earth H. It's a very very powerful multiversal device on par with the Ultimate Nullifier. We just haven't seen the full potential of it yet.   You're god damn right.   I hope you burn!   Say My Name.   What is your favorite obscure DC character? I have two that is obscure : Detective Karp and Kana the Shadow Warrior.   I'm old school. I prefer Karl Malone or Charles Barkley.

It's pathetic and annoying.   Bolivar,Tn? Absolutely the shittest town in Tennessee.   Really damn good.   Someone got their fedora on too tight today.   Another reason why I don't play MTG. It's more about the money instead of the gameplay.    Was the company Subway?   Holy fuck.   I thought of Devo De-Evolution when I saw that tat.

My local Library is a hellhole of religious lit, 50 Shades Of Sticking Things Up Her Ass and Vampire erotica. No Phillip K. Dick. No more Stephen King. But tons of Needlepoint books.  3) Fuck visiting friends. It's tough at 36 keeping up with your friends when half of them are dead, married, in jail, out of state, wives won't let them talk to you or their god damn kids are keeping the poor bastards busy. Fuck visiting relatives. They are all in the same description as above.  4) Fuck volunteering. Half the nursing home is dead, nearest hospital is 20 miles away and all the retarded people got nurses to wipe their potato asses.  5) Fuck taking classes.

 it is actually in human nature to try to rationalize things.  But after a certain point, it becomes self-delusion really   same   I just checked your profile /u/beastley325 (not being creepy or anything, I was just curious if this was a throwaway/ if you were new to reddit), and if you ever need someone to anonymously talk to about something when you feel like you have nowhere to turn, feel free to PM me.  I know what that feels like.  Given that background, I'm pretty sure your heart is in the right place.  You will get stronger and stronger, and you can be a great force for good in this world 3   You must take it seriously.  You must have an open mind.  You must, above all else, have control of your own mind before you try to mess with anything, so that you can tell if anything is trying to mess with you, and be able to fight back.  The first step to gaining control of your own mind, is to learn to be able to silence it.  To not think.  To think of nothing.   Go ahead; try to clear your mind.  At first, it'll be difficult, because you'll think of either your breathing or the fact that you're not thinking of anything.  Practice a little each day until you get past that.    Once you've got that down, you're ready to learn to defend yourself.    This is of utmost importance.    If you're serious, I will be happy to continue this lesson or whatever you'd call it.  Once you're able to clear your mind.   edit: and I agree with /u/CelticBull : EVP is at best not reliable, and at worst, may be bull.  Your own senses in your body and mind (the same with which you can sense when someone is behind you, or when something is wrong with a friend or family member) is a much more reliable indicator if you know what to look for   That's not a glitch, actually.  Sensing things, particularly with people close to us, is just a natural part of the human experience, the same way you can tell when something is wrong or when someone is upset, or sense that someone is behind you.  Some people are just more sensitive/receptive to these signals than others.  Something new I've noticed lately is that I've been sensing when people go offline on facebook.  I'll randomly click to the tab just in time to see them go offline.  All of the time.        I just saw this:  it was like this but not repeatedly : https://33.media.tumblr.com/a9b38183a1fd5d6aa82f0d88daac49c4/tumblr_mfocgyxEPY1rczhxyo1_500.gif   thanks; I will definitely bring it up next chance I get   no problem!  I just need the courage to say things like that to people in person whom I know need to hear it, without them breaking down in front of me first.  I have no problem saying those things when its clearly wanted, but I'm afraid to say them without the other person bringing it up first, which they don't always do...   how were you guys still friends?  that is evil!   that was beautiful 3   no please share details   the only fault you may have is a bad taste in girls, man.  easy come easy go.  easy fix: dont date anyone without being friends with them first.   "friend'd dad who" in that last sentence implies that you're the dad.  it should be "friend whose dad"   soy sauce   they call it "picking up the pieces" for a reason.  You gave them pieces of your heart and they threw you away.  The piece of your heart is not permanently gone.  You are not left heartless.  you have to pick the pieces back up from where they've been abandoned by these people who didn't see their value as a gift.  Those pieces you've left behind are emotional investments.  If you dont collect them back, you'll have nothing left to invest in a new relationship.   you've got to pick those pieces up from where they dropped them and put yourself back together.  Don't leave pieces of your heart dwelling on the past where they aren't appreciated or wanted.  Bring them back with you to the present so that you can heal and be whole.     In gym class one time in elementary school I was bouncing a basketball and I bounced it too hard so it came back up and hit me in the face; gave myself a bloody nose   my favorite part of this is "box of ducklings"   One time, while making the drive up to New York to visit relatives with my family, there was a traffic jam on the highway (as usual), so we were moving pretty slowly.  For whatever reason, there was a line of safety cones in between the lanes.     The road curved a bit, so we could see ahead, and I saw, in the lane to our right, a rogue traffic cone bouncing around.  Someone must have knocked it down, and it was rolling, lengthwise, down the line, under each car (the rolling under the slowly moving cars must have maintained its motion).  So as we moved forward, it was coming closer to our position (but again, in the lane to our right).     So directly to our right was a woman driving a minivan.  Due to the curve of the road, we could see the cone coming, but she could not.  So just as we were all inching forward again, the cone sprang up from beneath the car in front of her.  Having been oblivious to its approach, her reaction was priceless.  I wish I had been filming the whole thing but it happened so fast.   I will never forget the look of absolute shock on her face as, to her, the orange traffic one suddenly jumped up in front of her car.  (Thankfully, since we were barely moving, this was a funny incident rather than a tragic one. )   I would have said  "well I don't think I want that"   yelling for your mom and her answering clearly broke, or fixed rather, the glitch.  Very interesting though .  It's weird that you did it twice, but was it dark?  I have walked into bedroom doors on a few occasions at night in my parents' house because I really thought I was seeing into the hallway but the door was actually closed and it was just so dark I couldn't tell until my nose hit it.   Granted, you're talking about the morning, but if its early enough, it can be dark too.   that is my best attempt at a logical explanation, but the fact that it happened twice in a row and your hand was behind you is intriguing.    do you generally turn the light in a room off before or after you step through the doorway?  (In the above example, the light was off to begin with, but) I've been hitting the switch prior to leaving the doorway since many years ago, as I figured the few seconds each time I exit a room, over the course of my lifetime would add up to a substantial energy savings.   The point of that though, is, if you also flip the switch prior to or while passing through a doorway, was the light still on when you were "back" in the room, as if you'd never left, or was the light suddenly off, showing you indeed passed through the doorway?   true; I studied psychology in undergrad and I am aware of how that happens.  It could explain the letter changing from rejecting the time off to accepting it (particularly in the context of getting drunk), but it fails imo as an explanation for the medical history, as that is an aspect of her entire life up to that point.  It is easy to misremember details of how exactly something happened, but that generally occurs as more time passes between the event.  to misremember an entire aspect of your life (like, for example, being allergic to peanuts) would be absurd.    this is a good idea.  Getting drunk would make it easier to confuse such a thought with reality.    however, no one remembers the party.    Op, you may have just got drunk at home, dreamed/imagined all that party stuff, and then decided you don't want to live like like.  But, the letter and medical history changing seriously challenges that logical explanation.   Holy shit; I was just thinking you got a second chance up until this point.  I'm not really a believer in jumping dimensions, but damn if you didn't just make me reconsider.  To have all *history* of the problems erased is something else enitrely   Wait; I didn't realize there were more besides Berenstain/stein. It's supposed to be Interview with **A** Vampire, right?!   yes, NC; I was about to ask how did you know, thinking maybe it was related to a southern stereotype I was unaware of, but then I realized you must be combining the image of polite antebellum society (ha ha) with the lifestyles of rural communities or something like that?   well, I really hope I can help you, because the parent of half of the big problems which lead to me leaving/moving out from my ex fiance, can be traced back to what you just described.  I was going to say it was one of the big problems, but actually, half of them can be connected to it.  You are absolutely right.  She won't be happy.   you say it takes a long time for you to feel like dealing with it?  well that long time is likely longer than she can stand waiting for you to deal with it.  The result?  she will be the one always trudging through those messes, only to have them reappear far too quickly.  This contributes to (in conjunction with other things of course), feelings of hopelessness; that things are pointless.  you say she is "mess-phobic"; I assume this means her home is organized?    Do you have a proper place for your clothes?  like a dresser or a closet?  If not, get one.  As far as your habits are concerned, just remember that it won't pile up into an unmanageable mess if you pick up each individual thing when you use it.  Putting a shirt in the hamper when you take it off literally takes two seconds.  Two seconds each day is so easy compared to dealing with the massive mess which ensues otherwise.  Washing one dish after dinner each night is so much quicker, easier, and cleaner than washing a sink full of dirty mess every two weeks.  The latter will get you bugs.  You create these problems for yourself.  You will also feel so much better about yourself, and your house will stay cleaner, if you just pick up after yourself as you go about your day.  your motivation is your girlfriend.  think of it however works for you: do it for her, do it for your relationship, and/or do it to take control of your life.  good luck!  edit: P.S: at least you say you know where your things are.  Pro tip: don't ever wake her up and refuse to let her go back to sleep until she helps you find this thing you need that is buried in your mess somewhere, especially if she has to go to work in the morning and you don't   because the word came up in conversation yesterday, as part of the horrifically humorous translation for a name, I was reminded of the likely uncommon circumstances in which I first heard it:  The first time I ever heard or read the C word, I was 19, and I saw it on tumblr.  I don't remember if I googled it, urban dictionaried it, or walked into the next room to ask my (then) fiance what it meant.  But yeah, just thought someone might find it interesting how and how late I first heard that word.   well, from my understanding, the million dollar challenge (which it's one of my goals to tackle) is about demonstrating abilities in a controlled environment, not about showing proof of the existence of ghosts.   something really wanted you to pay cash for lunch today   I like to say that "everyone is a little psychic".  Sensing things is a perfectly normal part of being human; some people are just more receptive to it than others.  What you described is an everyday thing for me and I think it's great.  I don't get bad vibes like that though; I get positive vibes (not necessarily positive as in YAY! GOOD, but as in YES DO THIS), like Go Now, or Go at X time, or Go to X place, or take X way to get there.   actually, I'm in graduate school, and that I know of, I've only met one other classmate who reddits.  Even among friends from high school, I haven't heard of any of them redditing.  I haven't asked everyone, mind you, I only asked one person, and someone else volunteered the information in a class discussion, so more of them probably do and I just don't know about it.  Though some definitely don't, as they assume the entire site is full of f'd up trolls...you just have to know which subs to avoid...   thank you!  yes that is it.   I googled shockmount and the third result was one specifically made to fit my mic!   hi, I have a USB studio condenser mic, and a mic stand which came with no attachment at the top to hold mics (and if it did, it would probably have been designed for a stage mic/ too thin for mine).     (I have a tiny desk stand that came with the mic, but I would like to record standing up as well without having to hold it.)   I have seen in videos a type of mic holder for the top of a mic stand which I think is exactly what I need.  Here are some images.   Images: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/BBl0aC1MPwo/hqdefault.jpg http://www.ryanseacrest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Macy-Kate-Featured-Image-1200-800-486x326.jpg http://www.samash.com/wcsstore/root/Items/IP_N/NTLM67SET_ip.jpg    I have tried googling it, but I can't seem to find what they are called.  I need to know so I can get one.   Also, would it work with a generic mic stand or does it have to be a specific kind of stand?  (The stand I got didn't even come with a boom, but it doesn't look like I need one for this.  It has a screw top).   Thanks!   sounds like a good idea, since a lot of us music makers can certainly draw, but digital art is a whole other animal   thanks! I was about to say the same.  "things out human minds can't conceive" indeed   definitely don't actually physicall hear it in my ear, but I play instruments and stuff, so I am familiar with music, so when I listen to music, I don't just listen to it as a whole; I listen to the individual parts and how they fit together.  As a result, when I have a song in my head, I hear it all in my head, complete with each instrument/element coming in when it should and what not.  The purpose of the background info was to demonstrate my explanation for this, which is about encoding.  I think I encode more details of the music by having listened for an appreciated them in the first place, and that results in my being able to play music back in my head as vividly as if I had earbuds in.  So /u/Jelith , it is possible to have the music be "quite as good as the real thing" while it's in your head.   I'm glad someone said it, because I was thinking the same thing.  I wouldn't call the difference "childish," but there is a difference.  The voice in my head, while undeniably my voice, sounds different than the voice I hear when I speak.    However, while I can't explain why we hear the voice in the first place, this difference is one I can explain:  You know how your voice sounds different on the phone and in recordings than it does to your ear when you speak?  (There have been studies about this phenomenon, and apparently, we all hear our own voices clearer and better than they actually are, and what we hear in recordings is what others really hear when we speak.)  Well, although you hear it different, it seems that the brain captures it in its true form.  The voice you hear of yourself in your head is the voice others hear when you speak.    source: I've heard enough recordings of myself to realize that the voice in my head, although sounding different to me than my speaking voice, really is my voice.  So, per your description, I hate to break it to you, but you must sound "a fair bit more childish and feminine" than you thought.   God help me.  I just posted about a glitch which involved not being able to post something to my facebook timeline, and the post itself seems to only exist on my profile but does not show up here in the sub.  I knew it wouldn't be on "hot", but it is supposed to be on recent.  It's not here at all.  But it exists, because it is on my profile and I can click on it.  Here are screencaps showing the post on my profile but not here in the sub http://imgur.com/a/Qmxiq  Here is a link to the post, since you can't find it on the sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/33ykbo/the_universe_does_not_want_me_to_share_this_on_my/  Whatever force of the universe that doesn't want me to post the video doesn't want me to tell about the glitch either.    Well I'm telling.  I hope you guys can actually see this post.   If this doesn't work, I will just make more glitchception posts until it gives up.  If there is a logical explanation for any of this please, for the love of reddit, tell me, before I lose my mind.   update: as you can see, I just checked and this post did indeed appear in the sub, immediately: http://imgur.com/YXgchV9   but the original post is still not appearing.  It's clearly not some delay because this post is only 2 minutes old and already on the list, but my post from over half an hour ago is still not there.     This just happened and is technically still happening.   It's not a matter of video sharing in general, just this one in particular.  Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZFr3lHXh0 feature=youtu.be  It's a Louis CK comedy video.  I was going to post it on my fb timeline (for friends minus acquaintances and a couple specific people, so it shouldn't be like a guardian angel stopping me from making some reputation fuck up or something like that)   I tried about a dozen times to post it to my timeline (I tried refreshing, typing different captions, closing and re-opening the tab) and each time got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa  (first image)  I tried sharing it directly from the youtube page (instead of pasting the link in my status, and I got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa (same link, second image)  Then, I tried sharing it to my like page, just by pasting the link in a status, and it worked!  So I was thinking the problem, whatever it was, was fixed.  Then, I tried to share it from my page to my timeline, and this happened: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa (same link, third image)  .  Weird letters all over the screen.  You can even see I was telling my friend about this as it happened.  So what the actual fuck?!  As I said to my friend, either God, Facebook, or the universe really didn't want me to post that video to my timeline, but my like page is apparently ok.  The fact that I was able to post it to my like page with no problem means that it's not a technical issue with the video, youtube, or facebook.    It's completely bizzare.   yeah, they're usually after at least a small sum, about three fifty  	41

I'm far from being a dietician or a scientist, so my understanding of the subject isn't that great; however, I did a cursory Google search and it provided a lot of information to quickly debunk the whole alkaline diet as a means of cancer prevention. Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for is an explanation as to how the body becomes too acidic or alkaline through diet in the first place, and how it corrects the problem. Also, what are the implications, if any, of having an overly acidic or alkaline body. Are there any cases of people having a disorder where the body is unable to correct an imbalance?

Came to this sub by accident because I hit the "random" button, saw this post, and was really saddened by your situation. I don't usually give advice, but here goes.    Be yourself, OP. Don't try to be someone else by mimicking what you think is "normal" behaviour. Do your best to fit in if that's what you feel will make you happy, but don't feel like you have to put on an act for others for them to like you; you'll never be happy as long as you're acting your way through life. I don't have Asperger's Syndrome, but I know others that do have it, and I never once expected them to "act normal." It's a disability that people should understand and respect. Your family should be giving you the support you need, not acting like there's something wrong with you.      Have you met with a counsellor? If your family have been as unsupportive as your post suggests, perhaps you should find one have have your immediate family members meet with them too.

It's scary to think that when I was a kid I trusted adults to know what was best for me. Now that I'm older, I don't trust them to know anything.   I did it, reddit!   Where are these neckbeards getting their IQ scores from? Seriously, though, there's no way so many people on reddit are scoring 150 and higher. Something like 0.1% of the population has an IQ higher than 145, so I'm disinclined to believe anyone that tells me they have a "higher than average IQ." It's usually the least intelligent or most narcissistic who believe they're smarter than everyone else.   Don't be a NIMBY.   Everyone knows self-memes are the dankest memes of all.  	121
 I agree that if he can achieve the name recognition she has that Sanders will win. I just do not agree that he will end up anywhere close to Clinton, even if he had a full year.   How is it not useful? If Bernie does not ever achieve close to what Clinton has in name recognition then he won't win.   For the life of me I could not understand why the police just told the guy they suspected him of a crime. That would have forced him to identify himself. Also they did meet the burden for arresting him. They had testimony that a woman reported him of stalking her, a crime. They just knew he didn't do it and didn't want to go through the paperwork.   I always wonder who the white kid is in that video. Is he getting picked on by the black kid? Is he just chillin? He plays it cool as a cucumber.   The link you refer to compares Obama to different Republican candidates. In your link, if you go down to the Democratic Candidates heading and click that link, and sort to a Broad Race, you will find that Obama was polling about 20-25% in June 2007.  The percentages you refer to Sanders polling in are open Democratic primary races. The above link I referenced is the closest comparison.  While I agree it is highly unlikely Sanders will win, your comparison was not referencing the same type of polling for Obama in June 2007 and Sanders in June 2015.

He fought for many different orgs and in many non-title fights so title defenses is not as impressive as it could be. But his strength of competition was still respectable. He fought many fights against fighters ranked in the top 10 at the time of the fight.   I'm in law school. I work in a law office and write enforceable contracts ever day.   Of course it is. Would you sign a contract that you may be able to use unconscionability as a defense for? What if your defense to the contract is denied?   Of course, but it's better to treat everything you sign as if it is legally enforceable.    Do not believe it if they say that! Whatever you sign is legally enforceable. Your best bet is to go over the contract with a labor attorney.   While you are correct, you never want to give the police information that could be used against you.  If it were me, I would give a short, one sentence statement on my 911 call or after police arrive, explaining that the person attacked me first, and then shut up until I had a lawyer.   If it were me, I would say on the 911 call that I shot/stabbed whomever in self defense because they were attacking me. When the police get there, say you to refer to your 911 call and shut up until you have a lawyer.   I say this as a law student who has been working with and been around many lawyers.   Burden of proof is on the state. Yea they can take you to jail, but police can take anyone to jail for any reason.  Edit: If it were me, I would say on the 911 call that I shot/stabbed whomever in self defense because they were attacking me. When the police get there, say you to refer to your 911 call and shut up until you have a lawyer.   I say this as a law student who has been working with and been around many lawyers.   This is not a legal issue. I am not familiar with Australian law, but there is almost no likelihood that they are required to rent out to someone under 18.  This leaves you with only the option of finding someone you know there to let you stay with them, or find a company that will let you rent from them at 17 (highly unlikely).  Another possibility is catching a flight there the day of the game, attending the game, and flying home immediately after.   "I'm taking my talents to the Rust Belt!"   Don't know about German but I took Danish. Teacher is super easy and chill. Only 2 semesters until your requirement is met. Super small class (mine was 12 students). I went in with no previous experience and it was easy.   The attacker would not be liable.   Oh I totally picture the people of Arkansas interpreting it as "Imagine how horrible the world would be without religion [Christianity]."   Where was Depp?   Well I'm saying that Kennedy is decidedly on the side of same-sex rights. Thus, he is not the swing vote. It's possible that even in a 5-4 decision there is no swing vote.   Then you're calling every justice in the majority the swing vote, in any 5-4 decision.   Kennedy literally wrote the Windsor opinion. He has been in several decisions that have upheld same-sex rights. It is highly doubtful he will be the swing vote in the current same-sex case.  As for the Obamacare subsidies, he was in the dissent in the last case, with CJ Roberts being the deciding vote. That one is a crap shoot on the final decision.   I live in San Diego!!   That seems... unlikely. It would be highly unethical of them. I'm not saying you're lying, but do you have a source?   Why?   This guy was trying to plant the idea in OP's head that homeless dude gave him the dog.    Older fans started whispering that this felt like 4th and 26.  As someone who watched that live, I remember felling like crap for 3 weeks afterwards and had a similar feeling after the Seahawks game. I'm 26. Am I old?   It's ok. I'm in law school making terrible financial decisions as my current self. :((   I see. I went to a state school where tuition was only $4,000 per semester. I bet that makes a big difference.   My experience was the opposite. The vast majority of people I knew paid their own way with grants, loans, scholarships, and jobs.   Again, many parents refuse to cosign. Mine did not do that either.   The trick with fines is you have to control for how many times the person is caught. So if $50 would prevent me from throwing a cigarette on the ground, but I'm only caught 1/50 times, I might find it worth $1 to litter each time. But at $2500, it's worth $50 for each offense.   No, but most parents don't pay for their kid's college. My parents didn't pay a cent of tuition or living costs.   Stop paying fees for grandma.  Stop paying brother rent unless it's cheaper than a storage facility.  Stop giving uncle money unless it's cheaper than living elsewhere.  Get a job, anything- even minimum wage to keep her busy and give her income.  Invest all, but a 3-6 month emergency fund in an index fund.   He did say in one comment that he has a felony on his record.   I don't know if this is how other schools grade, but mine does points. I got exactly 255 points, equating to a B+, both semesters. Afterwards, I just thought about the odds of that happening.  Unfortunately, that went from my worst class first semester to my second best class second semester. :(   As someone who has filed several FAFSA's, that is definitely not true. You put down whatever income you want, and if they audit you, which is very rarely, then you have to provide verification via your latest tax return. However, it would be very dumb to write a higher number on FAFSA than you actually make, so it is very likely she makes AT LEAST that amount.   You're being downvoted, but as a law student currently working at a firm where a company is doing exactly that, you are likely right that this is at least part of the reason. Zuffa has very deep pockets and can bury the fighters in motion after motion until they run out of money.  As a result, these lawyers who were likely hired locally by the fighters, now have to travel to Nevada for every hearing. That can get expensive.   Law student who just finished Civil Procedure. This is correct. You cannot appeal unless it is a final judgment, with very few exceptions that it doesn't look like fit here. However, they would be able to appeal this after the entire case finishes, but it is highly unlikely it would be overturned.   I see it from that perspective. I guess it just depends on the dynamic of their relationship. For me, I know my SO would never say she would be going to the corner store and not answer her phone for so long. We also live in a bit of a rough neighborhood so that plays into effect for me.   I'd love to hear your breakdown after any high profile fights if you want to keep posting here! Glad to have you, Scott!   It might have something to do with being a new user.   For me, the corner store is about a 2 minute walk away. I would report my SO missing if they took an hour.   It will expire, but the extension will be able to pass 3 days after its expiration. We will be right back where we are now. But hey, I guess we'll get 3 days without the govt reading our stuff.   I hate when WEC titles aren't counted. For Aldo, this is his 10th defense including WEC.   A 5 year old is not equivalent age as a 14 year old.   He means the person who lost the bracelet, the police, or anyone besides the legal clinic. Who did you admit to that you took the bracelet? Did someone see you take it?   I'm only a law student but perhaps someone could weigh in on the possibility of suing your school in small claims court. You would not need an attorney for this and the fee is rather cheap. You could bring your friend whose door was also left unlocked and any other proof you had. I believe this would be your best option.   What is the context of this? Jonah just doesn't wanna be on camera?   Went to see it with my girlfriend last night. I cheered when Clay came on screen. A bunch of girls in the theater cheered as well. My girlfriend informed me it was because they tore his shirt sleeves off to show off his muscles. I just thought there were a lot of Packer fans :(   In addition to recording the screams and giving them to the police, you should attend your next city council meeting and bring the issue to light. See if you need to sign up to be a speaker and explain the situation. The more neighbors who will come with you, the better. If it were me, I would suggest to the city council that maybe a motion-activated flood light could be installed, facing away from the houses, but I'm not sure if that is practical. Further, making sure these two are prosecuted each time they break the law and suffer a higher punishment each time could be a suggestion, but that would only help if the possible punishment includes jail time. For the break ins, you could look into having a security camera point at your driveway.   You are literally crazy.   Even in civil courts, the general rule is to require unanimity. The difference is the burden of proof, from "beyond reasonable doubt" in the criminal system to a "preponderance of evidence" which basically means 50%+1.   I don't see a legal issue here. She can proceed however she wants to.   If they have a waiting list for your type of apartment (ex. 2 bed 1 bath), you will almost certainly not be responsible for the extra month if you tell them you are moving out on such and such date. You could find this out by having a friend call and describe your type of apartment and ask if there's any openings. Note: you may still be responsible for some incidental charges      I don't know how many MMA fans I'll find in here but this guy looks EXACTLY like an old-man Nick Diaz.   Sounds like the Scott Elder commercials I heard inAustin all the time.   They actually said in one of the reports that they found documents in the car that said JONATHAN JONES. Just... Lol..   Dude probably has crazy high insurance limits to protect his massive net worth. I'm sure his insurance will settle for below his limits.   My god... I'm not sure I would have been able to leave the table. That's just insane.   Yes but not a ton. It won't get you into a school unless you were right on the edge and the others didn't have the work experience.  An admissions officer once told me that LSAT is 50% of an application, GPA is 49%, and everything else put together is 1%. I find that to be pretty accurate.   A good LSAT score is essential for you. You don't have a great GPA but you don't have a crap one. One point about the LSAT is to give yourself time to take it at least 2 times, if not 3. Since you're taking a year off that means your last one should be December 2016, 2nd to last October 2016, and first one June 2016. You have plenty of time to learn so you should begin reading some of the Bibles and maybe take an LSAT class.  Also for your gap year, try to find a job that is law related. It can only help your application and give you a perspective on if you want to be doing that for the next 40 years of your life.   As much cap space as he's eating up, I agree. I think anything up to 1/3 of our cap space would be a good value for him. I mean he's (arguably) the best player in the league at the most important position.   Rodgers is the highest paid player in the league at $22M per year? So much for TT's value contracts...   Exactly. People get picky here, sorry.   http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/339j1f/norbert_the_3_lb_therapy_dog/cqj10gg   As a 17 year old, who won't be at the same school his girlfriend until after the first year of college, I can say with 99.99% accuracy that it won't last the rest of your lives. And there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone has young relationships where they are head over heels for each other and think life is just the best ever. But people grow up and change. As much as you may not want to hear it, you will change a LOT over the next 2, 4, 10 years.  My advice would be to enjoy the time you have with her. Be happy, let her be happy and just go with life. This is one of the last times in your life where you have next to no responsibility, so just go with the flow.  Your college plans sound like one of you is a year older and have plans to join the other at college after the first year. Is that right? If so, I can almost guarantee the relationship won't last. I'm not trying to sound mean. It's just long distance is hard. And even if by some miracle you were in the same city, it would ruin the first year of college where you should be making all sorts of friends and getting into schenanigans and going to your first parties while living on your own.  Assuming you're the one leaving for college and she's a year behind, I would say you should enjoy the time you have, but when you're about to leave just let her down gently. Be nice and tell her there's a whole world out there and if she still wants to pursue a relationship in another year when you're both a little older and have more life experience, you'd be glad to try.  Best of luck, man.   Well how common is your name? Closer to Joe Smith or Fencile Whooperpuff?   Former Realtor here.  This is standard practice, at least in my area. He will get paid a finders fee by the apartment complex you rent from.   Just like OJ...   Pure conjecture, but maybe growing up with the Internet? I'm 26 and the Internet just started to get big around middle school for me. So I was all over it to learn and research during my developmental years. 35 year olds were mostly out of high school by the time the Internet started to get big.   You should start applying for other nanny jobs immediately. Look for jobs that include live-in if you need it. Otherwise they should pay enough, if they're full time, where you can afford your own place (even if with a roommate).  Your safety and mental well-being are most important. Be vigilant at all times when you are at the house, especially if the wife is out.   He certainly did. At 23, Holloway is starting to show some serious game. Punches were on point, subs were on point. I'd like to see him become a little more comfortable with wrestling and clinch but he's coming into his own.  I just worry about them throwing him to the top too fast. With Aldo/McG coming up, Holloway likely only has one more fight before a title shot. But he should take at least another year or so to continue improving.   Dillashaw-esque was his performance, Joe.   This whole thing about "family" is crap. Would you not report any child molester to the police?  If I were you, the absolute next thing I would do after reading this comment is to immediately call the police. You can call 24/7. You can call the non-emergency line.  These girls lives are likely to be severely impacted because of this. You were who they confided in so YOU have a responsibility. Your uncle doesn't want the cops called on his dad? Tough crap dude. Maybe he shouldn't have molested children. If someone in your family murdered someone, would you not call the cops?  Come on man, get your head in the game.   Fun Fact: Holloway fought four times last year and is already fighting for the second time this year and it's only mid-April. If he ends up with four fights in 2015, I believe he'd have the record for most fights in a 2 year period (8, tied with Cerrone (twice)).   He's starting to say "two of us" but gets cut off after the t so it looks like "t-" which looks the same as +- because the handwriting isn't perfect.   Gracias.   HOW DO YOU HAVE TIME TO BE HERE?   It still hurts...   Why would you wipe off with a towel???   Why wouldn't you just go up to your room???   I agree it helps, but it's still not bullet-proof.   Ok, so you get them charged with that. But if caught, they still may report it to their insurance and you could easily be found responsible for the damages.   I am just a 1L, but where did I go wrong?  More of a Civil Procedure issue than Evidence? Same end result and since he wasn't asking for nuances of law, I figured I answered it enough.   Yea, rules of evidence. But you could wait until they formally file the lawsuit and then give their lawyer the dashcam footage in discovery.   On the flip side, if anyone ever does this and you DON'T have a dashcam, just gesture towards your windshield and say you do. Maybe they'll freak out and leave. You'll still be stuck with your damage, but that's better than the other guy's as well, b/c 99/100 they would rule you responsible in this situation.   Even better: "You're welcome"   Jehovah Witness if I remember correctly.   Where do you see that? In the article they only mentioned getting rid of the personal exemption.   I'm not arguing that at all,only that anyone that now has a personal exemption can simply claim s religious exemption.   I left out the sub to punches. That's more of a tko.   Still allows religious exemption. Biiiiig loophole.   Under current election theory with our current electoral standards, that is exactly what you should do if you want to minimize the risk of a Republican winning.   But that's what I'm saying, it won't get better under your scenario.  Let me put it this way: you're saying "swim across the ocean, you'll hit land eventually" and I'm saying "you're not going into the ocean, you're heading for outer space so you'll never hit Earth again."   Well then 4(b) applies.  But my point is that by posting this or telling others you'll vote 3rd party, you are possibly convincing others, who are convincing others, etc. So by then, if you go "oh now it's a swing state so I'll vote Hillary" then it doesn't matter at that point.  You doubt New Jersey will EVER be a swing state? Texas was blue not that long ago. NJ was red 27 years ago.  	104
 Minemineminemine   All my fucking friends are getting fucking cars and I'm still riding the fucking city bus   I'm Haitian.   It is absolutely true that Haitians will ruin your garage sale. I have seen multiple occasions of Haitian people coming to a garage sale with a box, collecting $50+ worth of stuff in it then setting it in front of you and saying "5 dollars?" And if you say no, they just leave everything there. I think it's fucking hilarious that people do that but yeah it's annoying if you're the one having the garage sale.    Now I'm looking at a whole 25% instead of 20% thank the lawd  	4
 I agree with this claim, from personal experience. I could not go to my top school I wanted to due to cost. The school I wanted to go to was higher ranked and had tougher admission standards than the school I am attending now. Yes I was still able to go a university, but the cost was why I chose a university with lower admission standards and a lower academic rating.      also, I think they are more put off by the term socialist.  	3
 He's not that much of a failure. I mean he defied the laws of nature when he united the hair on the left and right side of his head. Who's to say he couldn't do the same for the American political system?   This isn't really fair, especially with someone who has to deal with these guys 24/7....   That's the face I made when o read the meme   These have been around for a while as a way to reduce the bottleneck caused by people waiting in line. Also, more orders in the kitchen = more cooks needed to pump them out.    GUYS IS JERRY FROM FUCK JERRY         Thanks for doing this guys!   I've been a huge fan ever since I MISSED your show at Coachella two years ago. I've already purchased my ticket for your show in La this June, do you guys have anything special planned for your show?   Are you kidding me? What makes you for a second think that you don't need an education? Going BACK to school is the first step in solving your problems.    Gimley, is that you?   Nothing like a fine piece of rock hitting your face at 100mph. It's the finer things in life...   We have a new earth, a blank slate, another chance to do things right with all of our current accumulated knowledge.   What technology would you implement. What political structures would you encourage.  What religions would you allow/disallow?    What would you change/continue doing on this new blank slate of a planet?       I can never unhear this   What if you had the same dream?????   Those are my thoughts exactly. I think the context of the setting was enough to really empower the guy to speak up.   No idiot would confront someone calling them a faggot in the middle of an empty street. That I understand.    I don't buy that. If you're inside of a restaurant you have a reasonable expectation to be safe. Granted, if someone on the street called me a faggot I'd just mind my own damn business and not start a fight.   [what is a hate crime?](http://geneq.berkeley.edu/what_is_a_hate_crime)  I think proof of the pejorative is the only thing holding the police back from calling this a hate crime. Though, the video's pretty damning if you ask me.   Fuck this guy so hard. We need to find him and put his ass in Jail.   Now you're just spreading misinformation, that I"ll argue with.  [What is a hate crime?](http://geneq.berkeley.edu/what_is_a_hate_crime)  The following activities are examples of crimes that qualify as hate crimes if motivated by the victims actual or perceived group identity:  **Physically assaulting someone while using derogatory racial, sexual, etc. words**    It's kind of easy to derive that sort of thinking when you respond to an objective and rational post with. "stop being so emotional."  But I'd rather not argue.   	21

 1- because this is a message board whee people converse 2- because it is hard to tell if your comment was a joke because that same logic has been used to justify the hack   And if the boss isn't an asshole? Do you see my point? People deserve privacy- even cheating assholes. I have a lot of swinger friends, and they keep it a secret because people are shitty and say shitty things like, "oh he/she must suck in bed, so that's why they have an open/swinging relationship". Having people find out about other peoples' private affairs, moral or immoral, is an inappropriate breach of privacy.   	2
 Yes. One of many great reasons not to hand out guns in fucking vending machines. Scan that brain. I bet a two minute convo with that POS would've let any mental health pro know that he was unfit to carry.    See, this is the type of thing that a full mental health screening could suss out before handing a little fuckstick like this a weapon.    Imagine if he'd had to do it with a knife. Never would've carried it out.             Look, they're force-feeding him money anally while he says it.       It looks like it's just the top half of the baby.

The only people questioning why it's a hate crime were on reddit last night. Probably his brothers in bleach.    How much does the FBI / NSA monitor the extremist white supremacy cancer in the US? For all the monitoring they do of muslim groups, funding of terrorists abroad, this type is statistically much more dangerous on a daily basis in the US. Would love to know that they're raiding a fuckload of klan groups today.    Interesting balcony / foliage. Where in the world is Carmen Sunbathingdiego?    Not at all. There is a massive racial tension in the US right now and a shitload of libertarian klansmen with huge arsenals.

For a minute I thought today was Juneteenth.   [Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States.  Dating back to 1865, it was on June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note that this was two and a half years after President Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Grangers regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.](http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm)   So apparently everyone is here because of the new live thread feature on Reddit's main page. Here is the link to the main reddit thread about it. http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3a8k4r/breaking_active_shooting_downtown_charleston/   Several people were killed in a shooting at an historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina.   Police said the suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and boots.         Yes.

VERY low maintenance. I have an epson 13" wide R2000 and an HP letter size scan/print combo.    Toothaches.  Menstrual Cramps.  Awful economy.    That was main***line***. Kurt always wanted to main***line***.    Would you be surprised if the other half was real? Curious how you're so certain.    But the pot thing hasn't been "fixed" by legalizing it. The states that did legalize are being sued by other states, and still dealing with MASSIVE issues because of the federal ban. It still needs to be fixed at the fed level to be legit.  And your PS makes me think you're high right now.    You know who infringes on the rights of citizens? Corporations. All the fucking time. They push the line so far and when they go over it? A fine that equals less than 1/20 of the CEO's bonus.    Exactly. We have a bunch of charter protection agencies and they are failing all students.    Colorado Berner here, sending a small amount every month for a year. It's what I can do.    No kidding. With all the slash and burn of their pensions, abysmal treatment of teachers, etc - would be a fine time to step up.    That's fucking huge. YAY   Aw, leave it. Almost feels psychedelic in reply to this video.    [her]   They never do. They downvote and ridicule just like their ammosexual cousin-brides.    An hour?? That is crazy shit.    Nebraska makes me nervous that they'll profile us, since they're suing us.    Or took an extra one. You know because he was seriously really explaining everything with a lot of words and it almost felt like it was typed really fucking fast on his computer while his fingers got warmer and warmer and his eyes began to buzz while typing out his incredibly precise if lengthy question.    I haven't been but I am way more paranoid about it post-legalization than I ever was for the 2 decades when pot was illegal. Definitely think that CO plates are profiled. I was actually told by the cashier at  Target (discussing going on a drive out of state) that I should be prepared, they pull over Colorado cars at the border. She was talking about going north out of CO. I thought it was a weird convo to have with an older woman cashier at Target, but hey.    You're downvoted but you are absolutely right. And how the fuck did these two halfwits get firearms? Oh yeah, from the NRA vending machine next to the condom machine.    Meanwhile there is no media about where the guy, previously arrested for domestic violence and threatening to go on a shooting spree and kill his whole family, got his guns.   Careful! Axl will hunt you down.             Then he'll BBQ you.    Or more salad eating.    [In 1996, Adler suffered a stroke and was briefly comatose after taking a particularly potent speedballa cocktail of heroin and cocaine used intravenouslywhich caused a temporary paralysis of the left side of his face, resulting in a speech impediment. The following year, he pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in relation to a domestic violence charge involving a woman with whom he had been living; he was sentenced to four days in jail, three years' probation, and mandatory drug counseling.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Adler#1990.E2.80.932002:_Post-Guns_N.27_Roses_troubles_and_hiatus)  	100
 Does the Recobbled Edition of The Thief and the Cobbler count?             Yeah, that's a better word. Thank you.       I need music for a short film and was curious about your opinions on this. While there are some excellent scores like the one for Psycho or Suspiria, they never really make me scared because the music is so good that it becomes thrilling instead of creepy. To me the most effective music I ever heard in a horror movie was the score for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is really ugly and uncomfortable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3odOfyPz8L8  Would you recommend going more for music that's easier to listen to or going more the discordant and creepy route?        People laughed at this?   Had. It went downhill when he fell through the floor in that Halloween store.    No. Call it "This is Not a Spockumentary."    All the actors featured on the poster will be representing Everest as a human pyramid.       I can't tell if they're angsty or just bored.       The last thing I wanted on any JRE podcast I ever listened to was for Brian Redban to talk more.    *sniff* The miracle of life. So beautiful.    Asylum is going to make a knockoff series based on The Illiad.    Expect it to come out in August, 2021 then.    You could shift them out of the scene where they hang out at Hawkeye's.    Looks like he's going to hit Ellie instead.    /r/fearme   I'm amazed they're bothering with this movie since it was a bomb and certainly doesn't have much of a cult.    I would rather he just report these things like Walter Cronkite than force in a reference to whatever's trending on Twitter again.       119 minutes you'd use whining about some other experience.    I don't think that one got much critical praise. Critics I read all basically called it "okay."    Or just shot the whole thing in first person POV-style.    To specific movie that had a wonky stunt like that or to cheapjack movies in general?     "a lot of FA men do bring a lot to society"  Speak for yourself.   Four. All awkward and two led to the person I asked resenting my presence. Oh well.    Hooray, grounds for a new "shared universe theory!"    Was King admired by officials in the U.S.S.R. or were his non-violent protests considered a threat? Was he actually actively courted by their agents or representatives? I know King was suspected of being a communist (in part because he had socialists in his social circle) so did any foreign powers reinforce these beliefs intentionally or otherwise?   Thank you for your time.    Who would think this is WTF? It's pretty clear what's going on and it's not too hard to imagine the appeal.    WE DO NOT HOLD THE BEACH! REPEAT, WE DO NOT HOLD THE BEACH!   Wouldn't it be boring if he were just one thing all the time?    Hi-de-li-ho, your majesto!   That happened at a screening I went to as well.    She looks a bit downtrodden.    Has anyone seen the Affleck one? What's it like?    I know it's purely cosmetic and that my real problems are confidence and finances, but damn if I'm not finally beginning to lose some weight and get a little definition. And of course exercise is usually good for depression.  Anyway, thanks to all the people who were pulling for me weeks ago on this. It's a bench press in the right direction at least.       Sorry, I meant buttes. Applejack wants to go back to the desert for awhile.    How did villainy manage to make her even cuter?       Cool effect, but the face seems a little goofy to me.    I meant is it literally true to life. Metaphors can communicate a point without reflecting what literally happens, such as the Grasshopper and the Ant.        Deadly Premonition's first murder victim being crucified up in a tree while kids giggled at the base had me hooked.     You know, an older Alex DeLarge deciding that he's bored with going around inflicting the old ultraviolence and that he's going to go live a normal life.   I always thought that was kind of fucked up in how nihilistic it was. That it's supposed to be alright that even though DeLarge was a murderer/rapist, it's fine now because he's stopped and all his victims should just let it go/be ignored. But anyway...  Isn't that kind of inconsistent with how human beings really act? Don't psychopaths not just bored with what they're doing in real life? Isn't it much more likely that DeLarge is just going to keep raping people than that he'll just stop committing crimes?    And then you explode.    Oh man, imagine how many people must have asked Ali to pose for a photo like that and thought they were the first to think of it.    Is this that infection where bacteria that usually exist in one part of your body get into another and kill you really quickly?       Personally, when I get some cash for a bit of freelance/spec stuff I do online, I get the impression that I feel as good as I used to back when I socialized in High school. Money makes me feel so validated, even though loving it is supposed to be the root of all evil. At least I'm not acquiring it dishonestly or using it in ways that hurt anyone.   You?    I think there's a documentary somewhere out there where Willis admits he thinks he went a little too dark on Godfather 2. The word "light" was in the title.       Too busy laughing to be creeped out.    Why restrict yourself to Youtube videos for masturbation?    Does it matter that your SO is apparently undead?    I have no idea why this is still around. It sounds so stupid.   "I can't attract anyone who grew up in an environment similar to mine, so I'm going to pay for someone from an impoverished region to come over and hopefully feel obligated to tolerate me until they can save up enough money of their own to leave me."   The power dynamic involved, the resentment I'd imagine she'd likely feel at least subconsciously, etc. Being forever alone sounds much more enjoyable than that.    Is that the notoriously racist one, or did Batman drop that at the end of WWII?       Brings to mind that 99 Problems video.    Good, half the stories in these books were so dumb that even in elementary school I rolled my eyes at them. Especially the one where the guy doesn't notice the woman who's basket he's carrying doesn't have a head or the toe/liver stories.    Looks exactly like something from that Closer NIN video.    "effort"   Heh heh heh   Please don't.    Nothing about twice a week, but here's a source that says to limit the red meat: http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/moreinformation/five-myths-about-colorectal-cancer   So, she was going recite a passage from The Vagina Monologues?    A Million Ways to Die in the West. Even most moviegoers don't like it because Seth McFarlane's character is such an arrogant putz and the script has two gorgeous women being attracted to him, but I still loved it.    Because attacking Shadman's drawing skills is supposed to sound smarter than "I don't like boobs drawn like that!"          Probably Rainbow Dash. Since she's got an ego, it's the most amusing when she gets embarrassed and has to do things like draw a watch on.    Why would they bother with a woman with an artificial eye? They very clearly cut away to a completely different face.    I never came close to laughing at any of the .mov videos.    Not like that airheaded wildman Spock we're all familiar with.    To be fair, they're using magic to fly, meaning you need to switch to mathemagics (which are base 666.)   For further reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphosis      I watched a Crow in a movie theater on TV for years, so this isn't really a big deal for me.    He's in Tree of Life, which is so dense and pretty I could watch it over and over.    Wait, why are there different addresses at the top and bottom?    For future reference, this would probably do way better on Reddit if you took the write up and put the text in the descriptions of the relevant images, otherwise you have to go back and forth to get what's being referred to.       So, what STDs have you caught?    This is more like a public service announcement warning against it.    I was watching this cartoon about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DpbVXof5Sk and I wondered why hasn't this become a real underground thing if nothing else. It's apparently becoming a thing that psychiatrists are recommending too: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychiatrists-embrace-deep-brain-stimulation/   It seems like it would be legal, probably cheaper for the rich and more reliable than cocaine, etc.          Poor woman became a furry in death.    Still looks like a Benny Hill scene.    Well, now those unicorns are out of work.    http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-female-cosplayers.php  I tried to keep it objectively about the quality of the costumes and the photos and keep any sex appeal out of it. I guess you could arge a lot of the appeal for the photos has more to do with post-production than with the model, but still I've also found there's only so much you can photoshop a dud performer.    Once they reach the temple it's all downhill except one scene with the skull.    Too weird to live: Too rare to die.    /r/motherearthporn   Holy shit, I am the 75%!    ... I'm not.    Fluttershy looks a little chubby from this angle.    Please help me locate the creepy thing in this gif.      Is that last one from Legion?    Not really, kind of plateaued at about two seconds in.    Example? I haven't read the book, so I wouldn't know.    I need a break from all the space operas, dystopias, thrillers, horror, etc. I am on the look out for something upbeat about the effect future tech will have on our relationships and the like.       Because people on Reddit are way less willing to click on links to non-Imgur posts.       Twily's too fussy to eat more than one kernel at a time.    I HAVE ALL THE CUTENESS!

Oblivion fucked it by being dull and seeming like a similar movie that preceded it.          This is adorable!   Guy could be a psycho, though. There's a story in one of the documentaries about Citizen Kane where he threw a fit where he went around a hotel kicking down a bunch of doors.

Stewart was in some ridiculous crap, such as North   South.    Pretty often because I never bought an iphone or anything so I never got in the habit of constantly checking.    No!

You mean the video is one very long shot or they got it in one take?    Richard Linklater's Slacker. It's not super happy and inspiring, but it's a pleasant movie for the most part and oddly relaxing.    Way less trippy than some images from the movie: http://i2.listal.com/image/1223189/600full.jpg   It kinda looks like the wolf is Samurai Jack's enemy.    Jason Segel? Well, there goes the Lego Movie winning streak.          That's a recycled still from when he auditioned to be part of the House of the Undying.    Our little girl's tragedy is way sadder than yours!   I have a kind of risky project in mind that will either be creepy or a laugh riot, so I was curious how y'all would feel about that if it happened to you.    Huh, you'd think a performance popular enough to get both would have been able to get Best Actor.    Yes, I want to rip off Michael Evans's idea of making a short film based on a highly-rated short Reddit story.    To save anyone curious a Google search, it was for Best Supporting Actor in 1944 for *Going My Way*.      Watching Jupiter Ascending, I was thinking about how wonderful it all looked, but that the movie's insistence on a fairly generic adventure story kept getting in the way of fully enjoying it. I wondered what movies out there would best allow for just immersing yourself in it, and it seemed to me that it would probably be character pieces and/other eye candy comedies. Are there any like that which come to mind?   I know there are options like Blade Runner and Dark City, but I was hoping for a break from the more dour stuff.    There I was, in a roll, gong to the gym every other day and starting to get in shape (kind of) and if nothing else, stave off my worries I'd get diabetes. Then I got severely sick (like "buckets of yellow phlegm coughed up" sick) which threw off my sleep cycle so I've been having trouble feeling well enough to hit the gym. It's like my health saw that I was making progress on self-improvement and decided I needed to be tripped up. Like the extremely shitty chickenskin, the terrible teeth, and greasy hair weren't enough ways for my body to keep me unattractive.    I don't know how I managed it, but when I went to see Gone Girl last year, I knew literally nothing about it except that David Fincher had directed it which I believe massively enhanced the experience for me. I still don't really know what some upcoming new movies are about, but I've heard excellent general things about them so I'm looking forward to being able to go into them blind as well.   This goes completely against my old habits where I would get excited for movies and read several reviews of them, and in hindsight the process would diminish the movies a bit when I saw them in.     Bet you he goes Hangover 2 on this one and just redoes the exact same movie.    "Go tell Alexander I'm not giving him the orb!"    Is there a word for having a phobia of reflections being off in some way? /r/creepy seems to have a really bad case of it.    I like how he looks like Hitler as a kid.    Why would the building burning down bankrupt the company? I'd imagine they have insurance.   I forgot to swap the music in a student film out for the music from the Youtube library until after it got hit by the third party content match, and now it's saying monetization isn't currently available. How long should I expect to wait for that? Should I just delete the current posting and reupload a new copy with library music?    I tried to get into one of those Vietcong tunnels and could barely get down to my knees in.    I told you to kick yourself in the dick! *Draws gun   I still like Under the Skin, although everyone's criticisms of it seem completely fair too.    Robbed at the Oscars!  	162

 There was also a passing play where the refs would call pass interference every single time if you passed to a certain reciever.  It would give you 25-30 yards every time.   Over the past 2 years I've lost just under 40 pounds with just exercising and not changing my diet.  I'd say I've been averaging about 25-30 miles per week running and 45 minutes of weights 3-4 days a week.  Of course changing up my diet would have sped up the weight loss process, but I didn't want to have to change up my eating and drinking habits in order to lose the weight.  So it is possible to lose weight without eating less, but it will take longer to get to your goals.   How does Jr advance instead of Logano?  Logano beat him 2 out of the 3 events.   Maybe you're at the wrong track.   Is he even sitting on a bench or just hovering in a squat position?   Maybe you're thinking of 2006?  He missed the Chase, but won 3 of the races out of the 10.   Dilbert, don't end your sentence with a preposition.   Whoa, the 21st century!  I wonder what other advances in technology there will be?   I don't think you need a tab open.  Most people will start one while they are there of course though.   I was at Darlington and the June Michigan race this year.  Darlington had maybe around 15 tents there and Michigan had several rows to go through.  The Saturday morning at Michigan I spent about 3 hours going through those things, and easily could have taken longer.   As I run past another person that looks similar to someone I know, I usually think of an imaginary conversation with that actual friend for the next few minutes.   Jayski posts the old non chase points each week. After last week he actually would have been up to 10th. So possibly even higher after his 6th place finish today.   Before DVR's were the normal thing I called my roomate who was upstairs to ask him to come downstairs and set the VCR to record a show on later that evening.   Other 2 should be Talladega in fall of 2000 and Pocono in June 2012.   And it looks like you have a window in your office.  Why shouldn't you.  You've been here 10 minutes.   I don't think Titanic was initially released in China.  Which is why it made so much money over there with the re release.   Especially with all the different flavors available now.   I prefer to buy all of my movies on blu ray or dvd.  Depending on how much I like/want to see the film is what I base If I want to get it right away or wait until the price drops a bit.  I just need to have a physical copy for some reason.   Carpet?   His??   Hopefully this means one of two things.  Some kick ass games are on the way.  Or their next system will actually compete with Sony and Microsoft!   I would almost think quite a few people would still be standing just from the start of the race.  If so you wouldn't even notice any differnece for people sitting/standing for these 2 laps.   Clerks 2. Hands down!   Titanic.  Except the iceberg sinks instead of the boat.   I'd be fine with the next day or two.  So that could work.   I'm going to be moving to a new place in the next week and won't have FXX any longer.  Is there any good place online to be able to watch the current episodes of Wilfred?   Looks like the N64 even comes with a game.   Jimmie got second last today and last week. Has that ever happened before?   Why does he have to put so much emphasis on the H?   Ha, wow.  I guess I should use all the digits in a number next time I try to correct someone.   Or it's actually 147,198 cubic feet   Or you could try watching the first episode of King of the Hill to get my joke.   Ford stand for Fix It Again Tony   He should get one of his daughters racing in NASCAR.  That'd give Danica a run for her money!   But then Kyle Busch will have to miss the Chase on purpose just so he can keep winning in the lower series?   I believe Hamlin is signed through 2015.   But when you look at the fact of what their ages were when they each started, the comparisons aren't that different in wins.  Jeff Gordon took 8 years to get up to those 55 wins and Jimmie did it in 10 years.  Just think if Jimmie had been around when he was also in his early 20's!   Good question.  I would also like to know about this.   I wasn't aware of what they did until I read about it.   Regular Wii remote you can press B under the controller for the power slide.  So you would keep holding that instead of RZ when you let off the gas.   Got 149 for the month.  One of my better amounts over that amount of time.   I'm probably gonna hear it about this one, but I'd say Dale Jr.   For the interval running that I do, I usually use a treadmill so I know I'm staying at the higher speeds when doing them.  But as HDRgument says too, he/she prefers to do workouts outside to be in the environment they normally run in.  So I could see that being beneficial too if you are able to keep the pace you want.   Cast Away   Thanks for the explanations of the different types.  I'll have to test some of this out over the next few weeks and see how each of them go.   I've been running for several years and around last October I initially began increasing my speed for short periods during one run a week.  This turned into a sort of interval run for me where I alternate between 1/2 mile at slow pace and 1/4 mile at the sprinting pace and then the final sprint I push myself for .4 miles.  Over time I've been increasing the speeds, and I can definitely tell it's helping.  My natural pace went from about 7.1 mph to 8.0 over the past 6 months.    Recently I started wondering if trying out a different system of interval running would be beneficial, or if it would essentially be as effective as what I'm currently doing.  I was thinking of possibly a pyramid interval in order to try to get longer distances in during my sprinting portions.  I don't really have a specific goal that I'm working to attain.  Aside from natural buildup for better speed and endurance.  Just wondering if there would be any benefit by changing things up a little bit.   Sounds like my co worker that I share an office with.  She plays music through Grooveshark on the computer and has a playlist with about 12 songs on it.  Been playing them over and over for the past 4 weeks now.  She must not realize there are other songs available on the site.   I believe you're right.  I thought the off from Bruton was only for one year.   Ahh, that would make sense.  For some reason mail in votes didn't even come to my mind.   I'm curious how the votes used to be accounted for before it was done electronically.  Or was it decided in a completely different way?  Also, how was Bill Elliott able to win so many of them?  I know most fans didn't mind him, but I wouldn't think he would be able to be considered the most popular for so long.   Redditors of Reddit:  What is the worst Askreddit question you can come up with?   I would say it's a good starting point to go from.  I started running more regularly about 1 1/2 years ago and started around 4 miles initially and increased about 10% per week.  Once you do enough weeks you'll be able to gauge if you are able to add more or if you should stick with what you are doing.   Not me, but my friends dad has been going at least a mile every day since Jan. 1, 2000.  I think that's damn impressive!   No idea.  His wikipedia page says he hasn't raced in a major competition since 2009.   Yup. Good job! I only know about it because my brother is a Hamlin fan and I use this stat to make fun of him   131   Nope   What driver made his only Sprint Cup start at Pocono and finished higher than Denny Hamlin in the race?   Last week I set out to run all 7 days and get 50 miles in and was able to accomplish it.  Usually I would run about 4 days a week and get between 25-30 miles in.  Made me feel good from accomplishing it!   Got third in a 5K just over a month ago.  Didn't think I would be anywhere near the front of the pack before the event.  Made me feel pretty good.   It's like a kick stand!   I was in Charlotte 2 years ago and it was a good time.  If you do plan on going to speed streets, I'd say do the other stuff first, then use that for your night time entertainment.  Also plenty of bars in the downtown area too.   I thought bananas were the standard unit of measure?   The reason why race wins in NASCAR aren't really comparable to wins in other sports is because in other sports you only have 2 teams competing heads up.  So you have 1 team getting a win and 1 team getting a loss.  In NASCAR you have all 43 teams competing in the same event at the same time.  So to use a win loss record in NASCAR you would actually have 42 teams getting a loss on their record each week regardless if they finished 2nd or 42nd.  To sort of relate it to your comment here about playing it safe, you could technically say if a driver finishes 7th they lost to 6 teams, but won against 36 others.   So doing it in Hawaii lets you get really close to the fish?   For that damn safe to be opened up!   Thanks,   I never knw that either!  	67
 "The real scary part is that nobody knows who / or what made this show. We don't know if it was a real TV show, or if it was even aired by a TV Studio."  This is some Candle Cove shit right here. I think my nightmares are bad enough thanks to reddit without this adding to it. Though it would be interesting to talk to someone that actually watched this show as a kid.  	1
 This study looked at serious infections requiring hospitalization, not something like cold virus that we get over 50 times during lifetime. Besides, another study by [Dean Keith Simonton](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty_sites/simonton/p175wmain.html) showed that sickly kids might be more likely to become geniuses "We cannot always assume that good goes with good. We dont necessarily have the smart, stable, and fit on one side and the dumb, unstable, and sick on the other.".

 What is most easy and good argument for and against http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis    I think this is called pull requests.   I see there only Python, PHP, Node.js so no easy way to use on Android (unless this framework is only for backend solutions).   What for? This is a library, app that is "visible" and can be used is just a mock to show how it uses library. Also it won't be possible as Android M isn't still release as API (for example 23) thus also I cannot upload it to jitpack etc.   Which is a good thing because there can be still some changes before it going public (and I hope so, this library removes only some of pains to use new Permission model).   Is this some clone of a http://jimulabs.com/ (Mirror tool) even gif looks like theirs.            Go ahead and give a try to Import.io.  Created two production apps based on it. So far very good experience.   To be honest I would suggest traveling to Warsaw/Gdask/Krakw at any occasion that you would have - as Biaystok isn't that much to see. Unless you want to enjoy nature - then mazury is your best bet and it is not that far (great for kayaks/yachts).       Which App Store?  Similar question: http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/342xdv/china_android_markets_what_is_your_experience/   I would suggest subscribing to AndroidWeekly, browsing /r/androiddev also G+ Android related people etc. and use Pocket to save articles to read at work (on a phone/tablet).  You will soon find out many interestings patterns, ways of solving problems, hacks and cool features.   I would guess Leopold FC660M but keys and case (probably) has custom color.   Every account on reddit is a bot except you.   Thanks, but that sounds good until you have a paid app.   I just read this post [Android is finally beating Apple in this one key metric- revenue from apps ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/341k7h/android_is_finally_beating_apple_in_this_one_key/) and as almost half app revenue is from "China market" though it would be good to read about it and maybe try to sell there some apps.   Did you use any Asia markets (competing with Google Play) to sell your apps ? If yes, which ones and what is your opinion?      Go and look for local developers meetups (my personal recommendation - GDG events), most of them have hackathons - events during which teams compete by making apps. In most cases you can join them as a idea person, and see if anybody is up to join your idea and help to create it. Source: I'm local GDG organizer and I love hackathons.   Nice post, I would also add accelerometer data to check if user isn't looking down.   APK direct link: https://bitbucket.org/gorsamp/buttoncommathe/src/39ca13b11d96918f476b61344ec21986e0b4aa12/bin/ButtonCommaThe.apk?at=master      Best libraries are those that solves problems that you didn't know that you have.   I would like to see library effect on for example gif in readme instead of having to compile project or download APK. Much appreciated.       Oh, ok now I watched GIF few times more I got this. It is both drawer and wizard. Before that I thought it is wizard with drawer as a part of wizard process. Thanks!   I'm not sure if Drawer is correct UX pattern in "wizard", as (in most cases) we don't want user to jump from first to last item without setting middle ones.  Just a thought.   Anybody tried it, how are results?    His name is Robert Paulson   It always bothers me (like now during SpaceX Falcon 9 start) why they start to count last 10 minutes and show all those people doing a lot of important work in command center on dozens of screens. Also is there some kind of manual that they go through - can somebody explain it what are some most important moments?   22 here: Computer Study Engineer, worked last 10 months in nice and (mostly locally) well known company but got the feeling that it is the last moment that I can achieve "better" things (risk a bit as I don't have a loan or something). Thus now I just want to push some idea with crowd funding support - so in year or two I can be proud of something that I created.   Thanks since posting I used my SO laptop (Lenovo flex 14) to see how does it look as it has even more dim screen - looks like it will be fine in 95% of cases which is good enough for me.   Thanks for suggestion but T450s is no match for me - need HDMI output as I'm doing quite a bit of presentation using projectors.   Hi, I'm on the edge of going with X1C but only turn down is poor screen brightness mentioned in few reviews.  Can somebody confirm if all panels (HD/QHD/QHD with touch) have similar brightness?  I aiming in HD version but maybe it is worth to pay for better screen this 400$ more.  	34

Moze biti bolje :) Pratio sam dogadjaj oko Rezolucije   Verovatno opravdaju taj zlocin stime da misle da su ubijeni Oriceve ljude koji su pre toga ubijali srpsko stanovnistvo. Slicno kao smrtna kazna bez sudjena. Ja licno isto ne gledam to kao genocid.    1. Mislim da neces naci skoro nikog koji ce ti reci da se nije desio zlocin u Srebrenici 2. ok 3. "Srebrenica" se iscedi do zadnjeg kapa. Mozda bi i mi trebali da pravimo takav show i da se naucimo malo amerike... Jasenovac i druge logore, Oluja, Srebrenica `92, Poteranje Srba iz Sarajeva itd.  Zsto ne bi Oluja bila genocid a Srebrenica? U Oluji su sistematski sa nekoliko dana proterani pripadnici jednog naroda (preko 250.000) i hiljade njih su bili pobijeni... bez razlike da li su zene dece ili starce... Ili masakr na srpskom stanovnistvu sa vreme Bozica    Eto im korist http://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/francuski-ambasador-pri-un-u-pozivam-na-ukidanje-prava-veta/150708127   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnGYlfDw_hI       (ne samo da Rusi pevaju nase pesme :))   Jeste, jos sam na poslu.   Inzinjer sam.    Ako narod Srbi cine zlocin onda je to genocid. Ako neko drugi ubije Srbe ili ih otera i to u uspesnom merom (naprimer Oluja) onda to nije genocid, vec se to cak i moze slaviti kao drzavni praznik bez ikakve osude- definicija genocida     izvoli   Znam, ok je to.

"It is actually wrong to be precise, that of murdered German, where indeed the ratio 1: 100 would have to go to the expense of the Serbs, now 100 Jews to be shot, but we have them now in storage, after all, it also Serbian nationals, and they must disappear, too."

 Thank you for that very interesting reply. This is helpful. I know it's weird that I am defending him at all but when I hear people talk like he is evil, I have to disagree. I just want more discussion and less blind followers who just agree with everyone else. People accuse me of being racist just for asking these things.   I can see him reading about the crime from the Mexican border and getting all worked up and I think what he said and what he thinks he is saying are two different things. He just wants to emphasize the border problem. Yes he is stupid, but I want someone to really explain to him why what he said was wrong and not just say racism.   	1

  I only do it when I need to  I'm going to be frank here and say that is quite disordered. Non-disordered people don't feel a 'need to' throw up or indulge in self-destructive behaviors when they eat too much. I know, baffles me too. They just, like, live with it. It's weird.  	1
 Example? Is the stylized "N" for null (I think) a Hebrew character?   You are correct but not pedantic. A transgender person should be referred to as the gender they identify with. Refusing to do so is very insulting.  Of course, I don't fault anyone for not understanding this issue. The public is still learning.   Allowed but _not_ a good idea. Even with family, you will pay for what you get.  Ask your sister who she would hire if she wanted to file for divorce. That is her value as an attorney to you.   Guilty.   No it doesn't. You can be an [agnostic theist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_theism) (you believe in a god but don't think that god's existence is knowable).  "Theism" refers to belief; "gnosticism" refers to knowledge claims.   [Yup](http://metrospirit.com/is-columbia-county-the-true-eagleton/#.VV-8EnXD_qA)   The History of ~~Columbia County~~ Eagleton.   Finally Nearby surfaces! I was getting worried it was going the way of Wave.   But how many hours are spent actually working?   ALEC is awful. We can thank them for GA's "right to discriminate" bill.   Why does every one of your comments end with a schoolyard insult?   My dad can beat up your dad.   Yes it does. Fornicate freely for us all!   Rape me once, shame on you. Rape me... you ...  you can't get raped again.   For some reason that $2 makes me feel like Warren Buffett.   I haven't seen much about the stand-off between the Chief Judge and the federal district judge. I searched but wasn't really able to find anything.   I think the mistake here is trying to deny who you are. That rarely ends well.   Can someone with local knowledge explain _how the fuck_ he is still holding a political office? That's one helluva poor performance review...  If it's because he is _somehow_ popular, what is he advocating (albeit unsuccessfully) that appeals to his supporters. Do they think it is worth this much money?   I guess one rape is bad but multiple rapes is a-ok.   dunno why but that Superman tattoo is fucking hot.   really just enjoying the sexual experience.  I approve this euphamsim.   God damn.   Wow you're not kidding.  Does anyone know of a set of pictures of the city reconstructed? I haven't had much luck Googling.   29 to 30   Class photo or something where the members don't change.   Using the population of a city proper is such crap though.   If he's as passionate as he seems, he may not sell out (at least for some time).   I think the broad principle works with the analogy. In our bodies, a certain stability and predictability is required to live (e.g., blood pumped must arrive where it needs to be).  On Earth, the same stability and predictability is required for life (e.g., winter must yield to spring).  The body and the Earth are both systems that require certain conditions to support life. If those conditions are removed, the systems will fail.   I am too. But we're talking about a pastor, not a CEO.   Because it's not possible. All it takes is a contradiction and there will be no resolution because neither will yield.  Racists made the argument in the 60's that integration violated their religious beliefs. But if segregation is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and if both constitutional rights (i.e., the 1st Amendment rights of the racist and the 14th Amendment rights of the black students) allow for no restrictions, what is the result?  How can this be resolved without restricting one?    fire off into job land  Unfortunately for OP, Jobland has criminalized porn.   Man just fuck all of that.   I don't disagree, but a pastor should not be trying to make a $100,000 first impression.   Those words cannot be absolute. Reasonable restrictions on constitutional rights are necessary (immovable object vs. unstoppable force). I'm not making any judgment about the reasonableness of restrictions on either Amendment, though.   Both are excellent lessons in the dangers of pride.   Yes and yes.   An obviously false scientific premise (e.g., _Lucy_: we only use 10% of our brains).   But the defender wins a tie. What tilts the odds in favor of the attacker?   The companies will simply ask the legislature for immunity from lawsuits.   "She has been trying to get in touch with the man and wants to apologise in person."   I don't think children not working is a problem.   This makes me oddly feel better about his death. I'm a 33 year old male and bawled my eyes out on several occasions.  Thinking a man that brought me so much happiness growing up being so depressed was tough.  Always my genie.   You seem to be looking at this from an immature perspective. It's not about offending anyone or "staying classy".  First, if you ask someone you're casually dating if they're "fucking someone else", don't be surprised if you aren't soon dating them anymore.  Second, if you do ask in an appropriate manner, don't be surprised if the answer is something along the lines of "that's not your business".  Adults can have sex with whomever they want. If you're dating one (without exclusivity), it's really not your business. If you want to ask, go ahead - but accept the response and consequences of doing so.  Ultimately, if you want the right to be upset that someone else is "inside of" them too, then ask to be exclusive. This is not hard stuff.   It's not so much about being uninterested as it is about not being able to demand an answer to that question. Don't sleep with someone until you're exclusive if it's an issue for you.   An exclusivity talk is common. Once both of you agree to be exclusive, you are boyfriend/girlfriend.   Am I crazy or was Google Nearby supposed to be a thing? I can't find _anything_ about it other than the initial reports.  That is the feature I want the most.   From the next town over, too (but in the other direction).

This is undeniably a human rights issue.   Usually the counter-narrative makes a bit of sense but that's just ridiculous.   I'm cautiously optimistic about your candidacy. At the very least, you will force Hilary to take progressives more seriously.  Thank you for running!!!   Chick-fil-A proved that, even today, being bigoted is not necessarily bad for business.  History tells us that the market will not punish such behavior. Segregation only ended once the federal government required it to end.   We will miss it by a mile. - Cynical American.    1-3 times a week  That's... a lot of coke.    Opposition to marriage equality, though, does generally come from this religious corner.  Support of anti-miscegenation laws was based on religion as well.  Overall, however, I don't think opposition to interracial marriage and gay marriage was or is sincerely rooted in religion. It's rooted in bigotry.   5   Fuck   A few years ago in Jackson, MS.  [Let's go fuck with some niggers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Craig_Anderson)   This doesn't strike me as a "reddit" question.   I think a footnote is warranted but I don't think it's unreasonable to leave it out.  The charges against him don't seem completely baseless. And if the investigation was not baseless, the withdrawal timeframe can reasonably be excluded from his delay time. (For instance, an acquittal in a criminal trial doesn't mean the trial itself was unjustified.)   His Wikipedia page states that he resigned in the face of an investigation and, while it cleared him, it criticized him for ethical lapses.  Do you have a source for your information? I'm still looking but your comments make it sound like he was left out for obviously partisan purposes.  Edit: The resignation was a separate incident from the nomination withdrawal. There's not much I can find on the nomination withdrawal but it seems like he was fairly controversial.  Edit 2: The New York Times had a pretty damning [editorial](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/29/opinion/mr-meese-should-withdraw.html) about why he should have withdrawn, and did Reagan's own then-Attorney General appoint the special prosecutor to investigate?

Thanks for the comprehensive update!      And C) Obama   If the facts are as reported, it is undeniably rape. Unconscious people cannot give consent.   Yep - there is nothing positive about what happened, or that the events are being reported.  What bothers me the most about the reporting and gossip is how her *rape* is being ignored or diminished. Having sex with an unconscious person is undeniably rape.  Shame all around.   I've seen the gif so many times but never the source. Incredible.   That completely changes the situation. We shouldn't publicly shame those with mental health issues.      To be fair to her, _she_ was the rape victim.   Is it click-bait if it delivers?   Roll with it. Not Augusta. Not Augusta!   /u/trollabot Raxonracks   /u/trollabot test_subject937    The fact that they're both called "marriage" is what's so hard about it.  Ostensibly, yes. But it's not _actually_ hard to understand.   As I read the intro, I kept waiting for the zinger. The Service was more tame than I expected.   What is so hard about recognizing there are two concepts of marriage: civil and religious?  The equality fight has always been about civil marriage. And civil marriage cannot be hamstrung by any particular religion's tenets.   But it's still in the book. If the Old Testament was followed "to the T", gays would be stoned.      Right to left, right?   But that's more of a legal quirk than a legitimate characteristic  The Vatican doesn't have much in common with other nation states.   That's sounds like false bravado.   This is definitely Rule #1. Richmond County WILL arrest you if you are too close.   He's gotten much better of the years, IMO.   Neat.

If the Masters left town, every one of us would be negatively impacted.    he can't know that unless he was told so in which case he would have a nice suit on his hands.  Without getting into a semantic fight over "know", I don't see why not. I'm sure past experience with racism creates patterns.  And surely you don't think that every legally actionable wrong is provable in court?   he's being pretty audacious to come on here and spout it as fact.  No, he's not. The rules of evidence weed out a lot of what can make something obvious but not legally provable. And that's when the non-excluded evidence is greater than 51%. Something that is 49% likely to have happened is still very likely to have happened.   Obvious to /u/ANegroNamedBreaker doesn't mean it is provable in court.   I counted 17 on the map. Who knows what will happen after this week but at least it's here.      Personal injury attorneys.   Amazingly, he'll have to convince Gov.

Legislation can always come back, but the session is officially over for 2015.   Oh come on. Of course everyone's opinion of a city is going to be slightly different.  But you ranted and raved against the city as if your experience is a good indicator of daily life here.  I'll leave it be cause you obviously have a major chip on your shoulder. I'll just stand by my original response: don't listen to him, OP.  OP, if you want objective stats about crime, natural beauty, activities, quality of life, standard of living, job opportunities, future growth,  cost of living, etc., just use Google. Augusta is always ranked very highly.  Oh, and Savannah is much hotter than Augusta. But I do love Savannah. Great city.   Well, that's an eminently more reasonable position than "it's a shithole".   See, claiming there is no beauty here is proof that you are not evaluating the city objectively. Sure, you may have had a bad experience, but don't extrapolate and assume yours was universal.  I'd wager you haven't been here in quite a while. With the Cyber Command and the second highest growth rate in tech jobs in the country (yes, the country), you probably dislike something that you wouldn't even recognize.  But, hey, keep on hatin'. Good for the soul, right?   Ah yes, nothing impressive about the most prestigious golf tournament on the planet.  If you didn't enjoy it here, that's more than likely your fault, not Augusta's. Objectively, it's a great place to live.     	121
 This is Toby, our rescue, and he's 4-years-old. He looks like a tall border collie, but based on his personality and behavior, we think he's probably a black and white pointer mix.

 My absolute favorite is Wendy's baconator with no bun and a side salad. Taco bell soft tacos, and I just eat out of the shell with a spork.  Again, Jimmy Johns unwich is the bees knees.    Carrion! In a moment I'm   Don't even bother driving to work, and start looking at job ads.    I saw a progress pic where OP lent credit to /r/keto so I clicked the link to check it out. At first I couldn't believe a word or a single photo that I saw.   Many times ive fallen prey to weight loss gimmicks. Pay X amount of money and lose Y amount of weight in Z amount of time. I thought i learned my lesson, so I thought there was no way people were eating like this and losing so much weight so quickly. It had to be a scam. But I kept reading. I read /r/keto for half a day and i saw the emotional and physical changes everyone was enjoying. Then I realized this "program" doesn't cost anything. No books to buy, no membership fee, just a little effort. Within a matter of hours I decided I had nothing to lose, and very suddenly became  resolved to follow the diet. When I told my husband he was furious, saying it was unhealthy and it would be a greater risk to my health. After he saw my success and did his own research he started keto a week after I did.  I am so, so glad I took the chance. Keto is changing both my life and my husband's.    Oh man, my grandmother made me eat SO MUCH FOOD today! Including fried catfish, which was so so good but I felt so guilty about it. But I turned down cake, pie and candy. I was so proud of myself!! Till I got to my mother in law's house and totally caved. Ate so much candy and chocolate.  I'm so disappointed in myself because I just got fully keto adapted last week and I'm pretty sure I ruined that today.   Oh well, here's to another new day and a fresh start!   The same thing happened to me when I started Lexapro, I lost any desire I had for working out and I LOVED it before.  It's something like the medicine making your brain produce the chemicals you'd normally get when you work out, so you're less inclined to do the work because you don't need the work to get the chemical reward.  It's much more in depth than this and I'm probably not explaining it well. You may have to either push through it or talk to your doctor about switching meds..  Hope it gets better for you!   The Departed    It really comes down to exercising self-restraint and finding other methods of coping. And I mean literally exercising restraint - it takes work and time to get into it. Try planning ahead what you will eat. Don't confuse that with meal planning, but rather "I have a class at 3 pm that's close to this place, and I know I can get [healthy food] there."  There are apps that help you find fast food meals under 600 calories, my personal favorite is the KetoFinder app. From there you'll have to rely on your self control to make the right choice.  If you're having a lot of trouble, look up a recovery record app. It's really helpful both in the moment and in hindsight.  Hope this helps, best of luck    Congrats on your awesome progress and good luck on this new phase of keto!!  TIP: since you're so used to controlling your own intake very well, you'll probably forget to log MPF. In the settings there's an option for MPF to notify you on your phone when you fail to log a meal (breakfast,lunch and dinner). Also a lot of times I'll get lazy and input everything at the end of the day so I'm not always on my phone trying to find stuff all day.   I'm a female but I think I can weigh in here. I started boxing a little over a year ago and it's amazing for stress/anxiety relief. Going into a class environment made me feel very uncomfortable at first but you quickly realized everyone else has their head down and is just trying to keep going, same as you. It did amazing things for my confidence, strength and self  discipline. I just starting weight lifting a bit and it's making be feel better and better. If you can, I would recommend both! If you can't, I recommend starting off with boxing classes. Having a schedule to stick to builds a foundation for good habits, and once you have the self discipline to work out regularly  (a struggle for many here) you'll have an easier time picking up self paced bodybuilding.  Best of luck!   I started Keto 2 weeks and 1 day ago. My weight loss has stalled for about four days, but total I'm down 14lbs from my highest weight. My husband was *absolutely* against the Keto diet. He thought it was unhealthy and wrong. When he started to *see* how much better I looked and felt within a week, he did research and started the diet, too. That was a week ago and he's down 13 pounds.   Yes, everyone is different, but they all have one thing in common: progress. It might be weight loss, increased energy, blood work improving, or just a general feeling of well-being, but Keto delivers.  It's surprisingly easy, so don't get analysis paralysis. Just stick to your macos and things will improve. Also, [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah8MbmZepQxWdGo4bnB2QmxxMUlmTzZUTXYzMURRLWc#gid=0) is extremely easy to understand and has saved my life over the last few weeks, especially while eating out.   Good luck!!   I have noticed this too!! Sometimes I do miss carbs but only when I get really hangry and frustrated cause I can't eat right away. I'll think "it would be so easy to drive into that McDonald's and get a box of fries." But I have yet to seriously consider it.    I thought so, too! Very clever and resourceful!      Fantastic writing, *stunning* progress photos, and a truly inspiring story. Congratulations on your incredible success!!   I've gotten some truly amazing support on /r/keto. Everyone there is so nice and positive, I'm on it almost every day because of those awesome people.  	16
 Here's the thing. You said a "Wikipedia editor is a Unidan." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies Unidans, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Wikipedia editors Unidans. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "Unidan family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Unidae, which includes things from biologists to bloggers to nature journalists. So your reasoning for calling a Wikipedia editor a Unidan is because random people "call the stuck-up ones Unidans?" Let's get MRAs and neckbeards in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A Wikipedia editor is a Wikipedia editor and a member of the Unidan family. But that's not what you said. You said a Wikipedia editor is a Unidan, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Unidan family Unidans, which means you'd call teachers, researchers, and other reddit celebrities Unidans, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Here's the thing. You said a "emoticon is a emoji." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies emoji, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls emoticons emoji. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "icon family" you're referring to the grouping of expressive iconography, which includes things from words to morse code to kaomoji. So your reasoning for calling a emoticon an emoji is because random people "call the picture ones text?" Let's get jpegs and gifs in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how it works. They're both. A emoticon is an emoticon and a member of the icon family. But that's not what you said. You said a emoticon is a emoji, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the language family emoji, which means you'd call all other written language an emoji, too.

Can they fall under the same command? Yes. No one's arguing that, you little bitch. As someone who has over 300 confirmed kills, I am telling you, specifically, in the military, no one calls SEALs SF. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "Special Operations" you're referring to the United States Special Operations Command, which includes things from Army Rangers to my secret network of spies across the USA. So your reasoning for calling a SEAL SF is because random people "call the gorilla ones SF?" Let's get SOW and MRR in there, then, too. Also, calling someone DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six? It's not one or the other, that's not how Special Operations Command works. They're both. A SEAL is a SEAL and a member of USSOCOM. But that's not what you said. You said a SEAL is SF, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all operators of the USSOCOM family SF, which means you'd call Rangers, Pararescuemen, and other operators SF, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're fucking dead, kiddo.    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Here's the thing. You said ".999... is equivalent to 1." Is it the same value? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is an expert mathotologist who studies numbers, I am telling you, specifically, in mathematics, no one says .999... is equivalent to 1. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "1" you're referring to the multiplicative identity value of the field that defines real numbers, which includes things from rational numbers to irrational numbers to pi. So your reasoning for equalizing .999... to 1 is because random people "say they're the same value"? Let's get 1.000.... and -ei*pi in there, then, too. Also, calling two numbers equivalent or not? It's not one or the other, that's not how mathematics works. They're both. .999 is equivalent to .999 which has the same value as 1. But that's not what you said. You said .999 is equivalent to 1, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all infinite sequences for which the limit is 1 as 1, which means you'd say 1.000... is equal to 1, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Here's the thing. You said a "falcon is a falco." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies smash, I am telling you, specifically, in 20xx, no one calls falcons falcos. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "falco family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Starfoxes, which includes things from wolf to fox to slippy toad himself. So your reasoning for calling a falcon a falco is because random people "call the captain "Falcon punch man"?" Let's get ganondorf and captain rainbow in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A falcon is a captain and a member of the f-zero family. But that's not what you said. You said a falcon is a falco, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the starfox family falco, which means you'd call fox, wolf, landmaster final smashes and all other related smash bros memes "falco", too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   That's why I used the albacore/tuna analogy. What we call "tuna" are many species in the Thunnis genus or, perhaps more broadly, the Thunnini tribe. What we call a species and what it's taxonomical name is are two different things. Put another way, either all Corvus species are crows or none of them are, depending on which nomenclature you're using. It's an entirely semantic argument. The jackdaw is corvus monedula while the New Caledonian crow is corvus moneduloides. Of course, our names for those species are "jackdaw" and "crow." However, like how "tuna" refers to all species in the genus Thunnus or the tribe Thunnini, there are also species called XXX tuna and species without tuna in the name. It doesn't make them not tuna, it just means that the common name for them doesn't include the word tuna. "Cat" refers to any feline in the felis genus, specifically. You've got your domesticated variety which are called, I shit you not, felis catus, but you've also got jungle cats, sand cats, wild cats, etc. Also, "cat" appears in other genera with "cat" in the name as well as Felidae being literally referred to as the "cat family." "People in science" would definitely refer to a group containing tigers and lions as "large cats." So, in sum, in the common language, all felidae are cats, all thunnini are tuna, and all corvus are crows. The jackdaw, in particular, is much more like a crow than most ravens. It's really the only odd one out, because there's only two species, one named after the other, which was named arbitrarily (I just looked it up, in either middle or old English, jack meant "small" and daw meant "bird"). Turns out the jackdaw is a type of crow. It seems like some people want to put it into it's own genus, which might still be problematic because I've heard people refer to Corvidae, as a family as crows, also. I wouldn't call a blue jay a crow, but I'd call jackdaws crows. Fuck jackdaws.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   I will just preface this by saying I am in fact 17 years old, I am white, and I do live in America.

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies web forums, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls multi-voting cheating. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "vote manipulation family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of votidae, which includes things from posting quality original content to asking strangers for upvotes to running vote-bots through proxies. So your reasoning for calling multi-voting cheating is because random people "call the unusual votes cheating?" Let's get copypasta and image macros in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A bot-vote is a bot-vote and a type of vote manipulation. But that's not what you said. You said vote manipulation is cheating, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the vote manipulation family cheating, which means you'd call good posting, bad posting, and copypasta cheating, too.

Took it for a year, pretty sure I've been dead for months now but it's cool because I'm big at the discoteque I feel big I feel important I feel effective like I could move people around if I wanted like chess pieces, like if this girl grinds on me I could move her with my arms like I have control of my environment you know what I'm saying? Like if my dick went limp I'd just flex my tris and there'd be no.... shame. Like I'd rather die than not feel effective. I'd rather die on this fucking magic powder than feel like a grain of sand on the fucking beach like life doesn't welcome me, like the vital girls in this room don't think I could move them without making a face. They want... No they need someone to move them. They need it. They are looking around that discoteque for someone that can move them. This powder says it can give me the stature to be that guy. I'd rather die on this powder than be the guy that can't move a girl, can't move anybody. I'm just a spectator unless I take this powder and the more the better. It says take one scoop I take 8. Let's move shit. Life is a joke nobody wants to be the punchline though. I take this powder and ignore my social life for a couple of years so I can be something solid, something with mass, something that can move. Something effective and affective. Walk up in a room and be like damn that guy didn't talk to anyone for years and now he looks like he can move anyone here. What the fuck happened to that guy? He apparently lifted and shunned the world for 2 years so he could become effective. If he felt effective he could feel as if something matters on this grey ass planet of meaninglessness, he could move people. It worked though, he's big as shit now and seems to be moving people but I heard his dad used to be big as shit too but that he's got heart issues now and shriveled up. Like you build all that effectiveness up just to watch it waste away. Like life is just a study of regression. We build castles of sand to watch them wash away and being effective ain't even important. We build our own towers of Babel and they just crash down and it's almost worse to have to witness the crash than to never be high to begin with. I hear he hates himself, and his dad for exemplifing his greatest fear, that what he felt was important wasn't at all. The powder is false. Everybody is false. I hear he's effective now but he sees his father in himself and knows one day he too will shrivel up. That this makes him sad and he can't even enjoy his effectiveness anymore. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. Fuck, it's like we don't even realize our own death. We conceptualize as something that it's not, like it's so far away that I can't be bothered with it now. Like you have to be a bleeding heart to even actualize it, nobody does. Like oh here is this so edgy guy playing the part of the guy that thinks he's being deep by talking about death... he's so typical. I'm so clever because I can recognize the guy trying to be clever, and point it out, which rectifies my own delusion of being clever and immortal and above all of this. I better reply to this to reflect back into myself how above these thoughts I am, and if I get some upvotes I'll be even more validated of my own immortality and meaning. I'm not done. How can he hate is father? Well he was his father's son, grew up believing that what his father pointed out as meaningful would truly be meaningful. But as his father grew old his son realized that the direction he had been led towards was false, he couldn't figure anything out. It's all a spiral after that, the fathers realization of meaninglessness reflecting into the very eyes of his own creation. It's a tragedy and not even that matters. The old man had given his son the one thing that should never be passed down, the clarity of sickness the clarity of ill health the clarity of nothingness and voidness and ineffectiveness. That all people are impotent. That all people are sterile. Life is impotent. The nurses cleaning up the bed pans couldn't give you the answer. Hell the surgeons operating on his heart to the best of techno music surely couldn't give you the answer. Nobody's got it. Everybody's just doing the motions that solve their cost function. We've all got one you know, a cost function. A measure of importance imparted on every neuron that determines their specific weights in the influence on the grand network, our brains.

For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like its a peach of cake.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Salam, dulur.

Yours,  The Penguin of Doom.    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   I'm kinda ashamed to admit this, but I don't make a lot of money. I work thirty-two hours a week as a cashier for a local fast-food restaurant and barely have enough to pay my part of the rent and utilities. I live in a two bedroom apartment with four other people. There is a walk-in storage closet in the kitchen that was just big enough for a twin bed and a night stand. It isn't much, but it is home. On the plus side, I don't have to go far to get a midnight snack. On the downside I have to walk across the apartment to use the bathroom.   Being a member of the working-poor and living in a closet doesn't exactly translate into adoration from the opposite sex. I have below-average social skills and I'm not what anyone would describe as handsome. I'm the kind of guy who would have to pay for sex, but as I mentioned, I can barely pay rent. After two hundred bucks for a closet and my part of the utilities, which is usually just as much, I have a little over a hundred bucks a month to spend on food and personal items.   As one could imagine, I spend most of my downtime locked in my room using a cheap Android tablet to browse the internet in an attempt to find something to occupy my mind in the hours between sleep and slaving away at Burger Hell. Like most men with no social life and zero chance of finding a consenting adult to touch their genitals, this includes a fair amount of porn consumption.   For the past few years I have wanted a Fleshlight. For those who aren't inundated with ads every time they load up a page showing a redheaded schoolgirl taking oral instruction from a well hung instructor; a Fleshlight is a soft penile masturbation sleeve held within a rigid case that resembles a flashlight. The mouth of the device slides over the, well you know. For lonely guys it is the closest we come to experiencing sex. I've always wanted one, but I cannot afford to spend $58.95 for the base model.   I was browsing through used sex toys on Ebay when something caught my eye. The headline read:  Slightly used homemade Fleshlight. Has been cleaned. Must go.  The buy it now price was listed at five dollars and it had free shipping. Excited, I put in my paypal information and waited for the masturbatory device to arrive in the mail from Bob's Taxidermy. Three days later I was excited to receive a small package in the mail. I spirited it away to my closet and opened it to some disappointment. The vacuum sealed package was that of a normal plastic Rayovac flashlight. I pulled off the bulb to see what appeared to be a leather facsimile of a vagina. The pamphlet that came with the device read, Use Enclosed oil on exterior and inner lining after washing with warm soapy water after each use.  Later that night I tried it out. The texture was a little off, but it actually felt halfway similar to the real thing. Content with my purchase, I put it in the drawer of my nightstand. It might sound strange, but this tiny little adjustment to my life improved my confidence. I performed better at work. I was more comfortable talking to girls. As strange as it may sound, I started to fall in love with this five dollar used sexy toy I'd found on ebay.   One night after a particularly furious self-pleasuring, I fell asleep with the Fleshlight still attached if you know what I mean. That night I was treated to violent dreams of a sweaty old man grabbing me by the throat and choking the life out of me. I woke from this dream to the sensation of the Fleshlight moving back and forth. For a brief moment I thought a saw a grandmotherly woman riding on top of me. I wiped the sleep from my eyes and pulled the Fleshlight off. After a thorough cleaning I put it back in the drawer.  It was an odd night, but I'd had weirder dreams. I chalked it up to the Chantix I'd started the day before and a significant decrease in my smoking habit. I went to work as scheduled and returned home to see my roommates standing around the television. A man in New Hampshire had been arrested by the FBI for murdering his wife and using his skills as a taxidermist to hide the body in various homemade objects which he sold online. I shuddered at the thought and returned to my closet. I pulled up the news story on my tablet and opened a new tab to enjoy my Fleshlight to the stylings of a lonely housewife being serviced by a plumber with an uncharacteristically ripped physique.   I was about halfway through my session when there was a knock on my door. I covered myself with a blanket and said, Come in.  It was my roommate Jamie. He stood in the doorway and said,   Hey, that package you got last week. The box was in the trash. What did you order?  I panicked and said, Oh nothing, just a stuffed lizard I gave a guy at work.  Jamie grimaced and said, You might wanna call him. The box was from Bob's Taxidermy, that lizard is made from that crazy guy's wife. He choked her to death and cut her into a bunch of pieces he sold online. The cops are tracking down all the people who bought his items. They'll probably be here any day now.  Jamie closed the door and I looked at the slight bulge in my blanket caused by the Fleshlight attached to my then flaccid member. I read the article and sure enough, Miriam Johansen had been murdered and shipped all over the country. I thought about the dream and the resulting straddling I felt after. Mortified, I pulled the thing off of me and cleaned it thoroughly. I was too scared to throw it away and freaked out by its presence. I'd been masturbating with a vagina cut from a murdered woman and fashioned into a forever alone fuck sleeve. My panic intensified.   Ultimately, I put the macabre toy in an old shoebox and slid it under my bed. What sleep I got that night was fitful at best. I dreamt of Bob the Taxidermist choking me to death and cutting me into pieces he sold online. I woke in a cold sweat to the same grandmotherly woman sitting on the foot of my bed. She looked sad, but at the same time there was a warm feeling about her. I sat up in my bed, and wiped the sleep from my eyes as she faded into the darkness. I heard a low scraping sound on the floor and looked down to see that the shoebox had slid out from under my bed.   I became overwhelmed by the urge to use it one last time. I pulled it out and slid it onto myself as I reached for my tablet. The tablet wouldn't turn on so I tried to think of something that would turn me on. A few strokes into the experience I felt the hand holding the Fleshlight being pulled away. Soon the other hand was lifted as well. They were pinned behind my head. Soon after I felt a tight grip on my throat. As it became harder to breathe, the grandmotherly woman became visible again. I could feel the Fleshlight moving faster and grinding further down as her expression turned to one of sheer hatred. The last thing I remember is the most intense climax of my life as I passed out from lack of oxygen.   The next morning I was greeted by two FBI agents who found me laying naked in bed with the Fleshlight still attached to my member and deep read hand prints across my throat. As I slowly woke up and realized my precarious situation I reached for a blanket to cover myself. The taller of the two agents asked me to place the toy in a large plastic bag he was holding out. I was asked to dress myself and join him at the station. After it was all worked out I wasn't facing any charges. It didn't change the fact that my roommates found out I'd been jacking it with the taxidermied vagina of a murder victim. They in turn told my co-workers who told pretty much everyone else. People would snicker and call me corpse fucker under their breath.   My roommates informed me that they'd prefer if I found a new place to live. I had until the end of the month to find a new place. It was much the same at work. I had been branded as a necrophile and my manager said that my presence reflected badly on the store. I was too said and too mortified from my experiences that week to even attempt to fap. So, with nothing else to do I turned on my tablet and checked my email. The first line of my inbox read.  (URGENT: PLEASE READ) Settlement information enclosed.  It was from Ebay.   Contained within was a request for my banking information. As a result of the items made from human flesh being sold through their site, every buyer was being offered a settlement of nearly a hundred thousand dollars. I replied with my checking account and routing number. A couple days later I was rolling in the cash. I paid for a semester of college in cash and got a private dorm room. Sitting at my new desk on a recently purchased laptop I opened my web browser and bought an official Fleshlight. Even with the change in finances, I figured it unlikely I'd have sex anytime soon.  Besides, the only real sex I'd ever had included being hatefucked by a pissed off ghost.

I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals[1] was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for.

He is a completely isolated unit, incapable of rapport with anyone. His responses are entirely visceral, not cerebral; his intelligence is a mere tool in the services of his drives and needs; he is incapable of mental passion, mental interaction; he can't relate to anything other than his own physical sensations. He is a half-dead, unresponsive lump, incapable of giving or receiving pleasure or happiness; consequently, he is at best an utter bore, an inoffensive blob, since only those capable of absorption in others can be charming. He is trapped in a twilight zone halfway between humans and apes, and is far worse off than the apes because, unlike the apes, he is capable of a large array of negative feelings -- hate, jealousy, contempt, disgust, guilt, shame, doubt -- and moreover, he is aware of what he is and what he isn't.   + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Just another hipocracy circle jerk on r/movies about the lowest common denominator and how the commenter isn't one of them just because they have this 'guilty pleasure' or another, defending or attacking ___________ (insert from the following arbitrarily: Michael Bay, Pacific Rim, Adam Sandler, Fast and/or Furious franchise, the MCU)...

You said "Bernie Sanders is a socialist." Is he in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a community organizer who studies socialism, I am telling you, specifically, in community organizing, no one calls Bernie Sanders socialist. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "social democrat" you're referring to the political ideology of reformist socialism, which includes commies from Bernstein to Crosland to Blair. So your reasoning for calling a Bernie Sanders a socialist is because random people "call liberals socialists?" Let's get Hillary and Warren in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a democrat or a leftist? It's not one or the other, that's not how progressivism works. They're both. A Bernie Sanders is a Bernie Sanders and a member of the social democrats. But that's not what you said. You said a Bernie Sanders is a socialist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the social democrats socialists, which means you'd call Croslands, Blairs and other politicians socialists, too. Which you said you don't.

The kid didn't like the movie, and he had some fair points. However, if you want to write a review and post it online, you have to reread it, because people will look for every error in your article that they can find. Did you notice that you told us that there are 3 best scenes? "The very first scene is the best scene." "...they fall into a building and their body weight makes it all fall down. That was the best scene. Except the part where all the superheroes try to pick up Thor's hammer but it's too heavy." On another note, to all the idiots who keep saying it's bad parenting to let a 9 year old see a PG-13 movie, shut up. The first time I saw a PG-13 movie, I was six. The line immediately under PG-13 reads "Parents Strongly Cautioned." My parents were strongly cautioned, they watched the movie first, talked about it, and then they decided that they'd let me see it. It was the first Spider-Man movie, and I watched it with my dad. I remembered about 5 of the coolest lines, I remembered some of the coolest fight scenes, and I remember that a couple people died but I didn't remember how. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE! And that was okay for me, because I saw Spider-Man! It was his parents' prerogative to let this particular kid see this particular movie. Stop trying to discredit his opinion by saying he wasn't old enough to see it. I will say that the kid appears to not have been able to grasp most of the plot, but that doesn't mean that his entire opinion is discredited. I'll watch movies from my childhood years later and get a better understanding. Nothing wrong with that. Last thing. Kid, I'm not sure if you actually went to Rotten Tomatoes or not, but don't quote a website if you don't know how it works. The RT score is a ratio of good reviews to total reviews. A single critic can't change that score by more than a point (assuming the film has over 100 reviews, which this one does).   Criticism is criticism, and everyone is entitled to an opinion.

The inclusion of deep cut Marvel characters like Ulysses Klaw, Ultron, or The Vision just confuses these people. To them these characters seem really undeveloped or shallow, but to fans the characters have already been very, very meticulously developed, so we don't really need all that much exposition to make sense of it. Almost as if the films were made specifically for us.  When the film says "Ultron is going to Wakanda to get vibranium by way of Ulysses Klaw." The normie says to himself, "What? Who? I have no idea what any of those things are or why Ultron is doing that." While the fan says, "Yeah, if Ultron wants to create world peace by wiping out all human life, and vibranium is key to his plan, he may want to hit up Klaw, since he's stolen a shitload of the substance over the years. Makes sense."  Eventually we're going to get to the point where the normies just don't care anymore because they're too confused and don't want to do the homework That's going to result in a drop off in the amount of money these films make. There's still plenty of people out there who will go see these films, and I'm sure that will always justify spending two-hundred million dollars on them, so they're always going to be around, but they're going to become a lot more like actual comics. Impenetrable for people who aren't deeply immersed in this universe.   You know what I say to that?   GOOD.   I don't care if normies are into this shit. I don't really want these characters to be massive, ubiquitous pulp culture phenomenons if that means we have to spend an entire film expositing to people who don't know what's going on.   These films should be made for the fans. People who aren't hostile to the notion of an extended, interconnected film universe that requires a familiarity with what has come before. Let the normies go back to watching sports, or the Bachelor or whatever the fuck the were into before this stuff came along.   If they're tired of playing with the toys I've been playing with since I was 6, then I'll take them back.

Recently though, I have been absolutely baffled. There is this reddit cool-kid train where hating on Circlejerk whenever possible is the hip new hip thing. Now I have seen horrible, horrible subs that reddit silently tolerates. Some literally dedicated towards "gassing" Jews... violence, racism, sexism, pedophilia, necrophilia, you name it. But for some reason... Reddit as a whole has decided the worst possible subreddit is the one criticizing first world gluttons with no self control. The obvious answer is that the average redditor is a fatty, and our message hits close to home (which is true). But I think it goes beyond that. The stereotypical racist/sexist/pervert is very easy to disregard as some obscure toothless creep living in a hovel in a random dark corner of society. But we are just regular people. We are paramedics, firefighters, cops, lawyers, nurses, doctors, teachers, soldiers. We have science, medicine and facts supporting our arguments. They can't just dismiss us as ignorant hicks in some obscure circle, and they hate that. The numbers don't lie, Circlejerk is growing at a rapid rate. The average person doesn't have to tolerate obese, lazy, entitled people. And they shouldn't. Get used to it reddit fats, because all your whining does is reinforce everything we already knew.      + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   palomitas sabe bien     + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Ayyyyyy LMAO Cmo est todo el mundo? Esto es increble! Hay algo que me olvid de decirte todo este tiempo ("privilegio ejecutivo", pero bueno estoy desclasificacin de un montn de cosas en estos das). Volver en la poca de la debacle de / r / creepshots, escrib a / u / spez consejo. Yo lo haba conocido poco despus de que haba tomado el trabajo, y lo encontrado para ser un gran tipo. De vuelta en el da en reddit era pequea, las reas que l supervis eran la ingeniera, el producto y los aspectos del negocio - Esas son las mismas cosas que tienden a centrarse en en una empresa (cada CEO tiene ciertas reas de inters natural, y contrata a otros para supervisar el resto). Como resultado, hemos sido capaces de conectar muy bien y tienen un montn de grandes conversaciones - hablar con l fue muy valiosa. Bueno, cuando las cosas se calientan alrededor de la r / cosa / creepshots y la gente estaba pidiendo su prohibicin, le escrib para pedir consejo. La cosa muy interesante que escribi fue "cuando yo estaba corriendo cosas, si haba algo racista, sexista, homfobo o que me prohibira de inmediato. No creo que hay un lugar para este tipo de cosas en reddit. Por supuesto , ahora que reddit es mucho ms grande, entiendo si tal vez las cosas son diferentes ". Siempre he recordado que el correo electrnico cuando le la publicacin ocasional aqu donde la gente dice "los fundadores de reddit pretenden que trata de un lugar para la libertad de expresin." Las mentes humanas aman originalismo, por ejemplo, "Estamos en problemas, por lo que seguramente si nos remontamos a las intenciones originales, podemos hacer las cosas de nuevo bien." Lamento decirte chicos, pero no, eso no era su intencin en absoluto nunca. Chupa para ser usted, / r / coontown - Espero que disfruten voat! La poltica de la libertad de expresin era algo Formalic porque pareca que el curso ms sabio en el momento. Vale la pena que indica que en esa poca, estbamos hablando acerca de si estaba bien para la gente a publicar imgenes espeluznantes de las mujeres tomadas legalmente en pblico. Eso es una mierda, pero es muy lejos de los extremos de odio que algunas partes del anfitrin sitio hoy. Pareca que permiten enredaderas publicar (annima) fotos de mujeres tomadas en pblico, en un tiempo relativamente pequea subreddit que nunca apareci en la primera plana, era un pequeo precio a pagar por lo que es claro que estbamos en un lugar acogedor de todas las opiniones y el discurso. Despus de haber tomado esa decisin - la mayor parte de la condicin actual de reddit est en m. Yo no preveo lo que (algunos) redditors decidiran que ver con la libertad. reddit se ha convertido en mucho ms grande - s, mucho mejor - Y mucho peor. Tengo que asumir la responsabilidad. Pero ... la ms deliciosa parte de esto es que al menos en dos ocasiones distintas, la junta presionado / u / ekjp prohibir de plano TODAS las subreddits de odio en una purga de barrido. Ella se resisti, a sabiendas de la comunidad, alegando que sera una shitshow. Ellen no es un "mal, manipuladora, fuera de contacto incompetente diablesa" como se representa a menudo. Ella fue aprobado por la junta directiva y recomendado por m, porque cuando me fui, ella era la nica ejecutivo de tecnologa en cualquier lugar al que tena las chuletas y la experiencia para gestionar una nueva empresa de este tamao, y que entenda lo reddit trataba. Como podemos ver en su actividad despus de la renuncia, que sabe perfectamente cmo encaja con la comunidad reddit y es una persona normal, divertido - al igual que en la vida real - ella simplemente no le cay en reddit todo el da porque era ocupada con su trabajo del da. Ellen era ms o menos inclinados a continuar la defensa de mis polticas de libertad de expresin. / R / fatpeoplehate fue prohibido por incitar fuera de las instalaciones de acoso, no discutir grasa vergenza. Lo que todos los blancos potencia neckbeards racista sexistas no entienden es que con ella al frente de la compaa, la empresa sera inmune a las acusaciones de promover el sexismo y el racismo: es, literalmente, # 1 feminista hroe de Silicon Valley, por lo que cualquier "SJWs" tendra dificultades para atacar a la empresa para crear intencionalmente un bastin (je) de contenido sexista / racista. Probablemente habra tolerado su existencia, siempre y cuando usted no caus ningn problema - S que sus estrategias a largo plazo deban encontrar la manera de surgir y dar a conocer las buenas partes de reddit - que permite que existan las partes malas, pero mantenindolos fuera de la centro de atencin. Hubiera sido muy de principios - el director general de reddit, que una vez demand a su empleador anterior para la discriminacin sexual, defiende la libertad de expresin y tolera el lado feo de la humanidad, porque es muy importante para mantener una plataforma para el discurso libre. Hubiera sido inexpugnable. Bueno, ahora se ha ido (lo hiciste Reddit!), Y / u / spez tiene la autoridad moral como un co-fundador de seguir adelante con la purga. Tratamos de dejar gobiernas a s mismos y que fallamos, por lo que ahora el hombre va a establecer algunas reglas. Es cierto, no puedo decir que estoy terriblemente molesto.    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Hola, el tiempo Sombrero serio. 1 / S, soy un troll. Yo era un troll en la escuela secundaria en BBSes, en la universidad en los tablones de anuncios de CMU, me encontr con un foro que fue ms o menos mis amigos curricn entre s, etc. Hago bastante buena imitacin de un ejecutivo de tecnologa profesional cuando lo necesito, sin duda lo suficientemente bien como para entender por qu algo como por ejemplo, el evento dehrmann vera muy poco profesional, pero esa situacin slo tena algunos factores realmente extraos en ella. Y en realidad, no se puede posiblemente ejecutar un sitio como este, sin ser fundamentalmente un troll y entender el trolling. Cuando se anunci que yo era el director general, la reaccin de cada amigo que saba que me estaba uniformemente carcajadas. Antes de venir a trabajar para reddit, ya sabes lo que he usado mi cuenta? Hacer comentarios trolls / inteligentes para el karma. Usted probablemente puede encontrarlos si se desplaza camino de regreso a antes de 2012. Es agradable ser capaz de volver a ser un usuario normal reddit (yo no poda publicar bajo mi nombre mucho mientras Ellen era CEO porque pareca que lo hara causar demasiada interferencia), aunque tal vez voy a utilizar un alt para atraer menos atencin. 2 / No te preocupes por mi carrera. No tengo planes para trabajar en la industria de la tecnologa de nuevo; Creo que es hora de hacer algo ms, probablemente algo que no implica tener un trabajo asalariado. Tengo un buen dinero ahorrado de mi tiempo en Facebook para poder hacer esto, as que soy muy afortunado. Es cierto que no hice mucho de correr reddit, pero deliberadamente tom un salario inferior para reducir el consumo efectivo y por lo que podra dar algunos empleados mal pagados un aumento. Curiosamente, he recibido dos ofertas de trabajo en el ltimo da o dos, a pesar de mi supuesta unhireability. Imagnate. Tambin, por favor no acechar a mi esposa - ella es una persona muy reservada, introvertida que no le gusta la atencin y es molesto / divertido por la atencin que he recibido / instigado en la prensa ltimamente. 3 / Me gusta spez mucho, y espero que lo consigue. El resto del equipo tambin es muy bueno; Espero que nadie se va. El trabajo es muy, muy duro y est abriendo un nuevo camino - no ha habido una comunidad (al estilo de foro) de este tamao en el Internet nunca, y los desafos de la gestin de los an mucho ms pequeos han sido bien documentada . Ahora entiendo por qu los presidentes y ex presidentes pasar el rato juntos y esas cosas, a pesar de sus diferencias polticas supuestos (y spez y me parece que tienen un poco justo en comn, incluso).

They called me at work to tell me that my co2 detector was out of battery and that it's very important to make sure that the batteries are changed regularly etc etc. I understood the severity of the situation, but I said, "Oh, that little thing plugged into the wall, behind the treadmill?" to which they replied, "umm...yes...?" and I said, "Oh yeah, I try not to look over there because first thing I see is the treadmill, and then I see the dust on the treadmill, which just conjures up the shame of being fat and out of shape...so I pretty much avoid thinking about anything that is over there." Now, at this point, the landlord could have done one of two things. They could have taken me completely seriously, and chastised me on the importance of this. as I could be dead... because, yes, it is technically a serious life or death issue. However, the landlord laughed and said, "If you don't have life insurance, I can certainly sign you up! Hell, I'll even fill out the beneficiary part for you!" Being offended and chastising someone for finding a way to digest and internalize the morbidity of life accomplishes nothing. Making light of morbid situations appears in countless media through the ages, and it crosses international, racial and ethnic boundaries. We see it throughout thousands of years of literature, in writings from the most exalted authors and works, many of which are still taught in our schools. To say that Shakespeare should be banned because he occasionally made light of death and murder, for example, tacitly denies the way that we, as a whole, have always processed these sorts of issues. People inherently need to hear this and feel a need to share and relate these feelings with others in order to feel okay about it. Other people see this as disgusting because the way they learned to process it was merely different. Many of the offended indignant have grown up in settings where these issues were internalized and processed within their families by sharing and expressing a hyperbolic sense of seriousness with others, relating to each other by talking about how serious it is, and making themselves feel safe and secure about it by citing and mutually exalting their moral platitudes, because the only way that they have been able to feel okay about these things is by filling themselves with a rigid seriousness about it. They often adopt this hyperbolic seriousness from their upbringing as that is how they were modeled and taught to share it with others in order to process it. So the thing they wish to share is this seriousness. The problem they don't realize is that there are multiple ways to process these things even if they don't have any personal experience with facilitating the feelings in a humorous way. Making sure that everyone else is taking it with the same perspective is the only way to push and promote the personal sense of security, because if everyone else isn't being serious, then we're not internalizing it properly, are we? enter chaos, anarchy, lawlessness, slippery slope blah blah blah This is their perspective: (expressed by someone who has spent a good amount of time around these types) The idea of processing these things with humor seems foolish, useless and counterproductive. It makes light of a serious issue while accomplishing nothing except embracing a hedonistic ignorance of the real issue. (seriousness being the real issue, not the issue itself) They don't know how to feel secure by making fun, only by making and promoting standards that are going to 'protect everyone the way they've protected me'.     + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   It's interesting that you mention that because I met Martin Lawrence during the premier of his new film at Cannes, Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins, and I was shocked to discover that he in fact did not look like Martin Lawrence. It's a perk of my job that I get to travel to see movies so when I discovered that only one year later after I had already steeped myself in the semiotics of Walt Becker's instant classic Wild Hogs, that he was very different from what he looked like in Wild Hogs. Different skin tones, his goatee was now a full grown beard, when he sweat in the presence of the everyone under the hot French Rivera sun, Mr. Lawrence would run double time up the steps of the theater and make a bee line for the restroom. It was when I cornered him to get him to autograph my copy of Harvey Weinstein's seminal book "101 Things You Didn't Know About the Filming of Wild Hogs" he went completely white, quite literally. Security had ushered me out before I could inquire further, but it looked as if Lawrence since those tragically reported events is now being assumed by the man who started it all, Mr. Walt Becker. I shan't not tell more because I fear for my lively hood here in Hollywood.    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   In that same piece I noticed that everyone being interviewed declined to mention Martin Lawrence's name. I did some digging, and found an old newspaper clipping at my local library about three hooded individuals dumping the body of a man into the river downtown. By cross referencing the height of the men in the photo to iMDB records, I determined the men to be John Travolta, Ray Liotta, and Walt Becker himself. It seems they got in a heated disagreement with Lawrence over the proper way to cook the Hogs after the production of Wild Hogs was finished. Lawrence wanted medium rare but the rest were all hankering for well done. They killed him, and ate the hogs after vowing never to speak of what happened. I obtained this information at great risk to a bus boy from Belize, so be careful who you tell.    + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Here's the thing. You said a "melt is a grilled." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies grilled cheese, I am telling you, specifically, in grilling, no one calls melts grilled cheese. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "grilled cheese family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Meltidae, which includes things from cheesesteaks to hoagies to pizzas. So your reasoning for calling a melt a grilled cheese is because random people "call the melty ones grilled cheese?" Let's get chicken parmesan and hamburgers in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a grain or a bread? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A melt is a melt and a member of the grilled cheese family. But that's not what you said. You said a melt is a grilled cheese, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the grilled cheese family grilled cheese, which means you'd call hoagies, pizzas, and other melty things grilled cheese, too.

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies pedophiles, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls ephebophiles pedophiles. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "pedophile family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of *chronophilia*, which includes things from nepophiles to hebephiles to gerontophiles.  So your reasoning for calling a ephebophile a pedophile is because random people "call the perverts pedophiles?" Let's get foot fetishists and masochists in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. An ephebophile is an ephebophile and part of the pedophile family. But that's not what you said. You said an ephebophile is a pedophile, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the chronophilia family pedophiles, which means you'd call people who chase cougars and grannies pedophiles too.

I like to think I'm a pretty good dad to my 2 little girls, but as other parents probably know, it's easy to lose perspective during the day-to-day of bedtimes, baths, tantrums and picky eating. But after seeing the film, all I wanted to do was go home, wake them up and give them a hug (I let them finish their long nap). Three days later, I'm still carrying the film around in my head. And it's impacting my interactions with my kids. No more distractions. No more "hurry up and get them to bed so I can watch football." I'm treasuring every moment with them.

Don't believe it for a second. They use the successes of Asian-Americans only as a club to bash other races with, and to get them to resent us instead of them. White supremacists will often rate Asian people as smarter than Whites, but that is just because it looks completely self-serving in whatever racial "ranking" system they decide to conjure to always put themselves at the top of it.  In reality, white racists have hated us from the jump. They allowed a certain number of us to immigrate because we were cheaper labor than blacks, and when it looked like too many of us were coming over, they restricted our immigration so only a token number of us could ever take hold.   Asians were always at a numerical disadvantage, which is why we had to keep our heads down and take their shit instead of fighting back. We were the original racialized druggie stereotype. Your black kid in a hoodie slanging crack in the 19th century was a Chinaman with his opium pipe. They put Japanese in concentration camps in WWII to steal their farm land. And because we managed to survive their game, they want to grant us honorary cracker status?  I've no problem with white people, but white racists can all go to hell. Chinese, Japanese, look at these dirty knees? Everytime you racists said that to me, I wanted to take my knee to your face until it was bone-splintered pulp and I'll slit your throats the moment I catch you slipping.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.  Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running.  Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.  Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport? She shifts her weight to the side, as on a motorcycle, but the flofloflo won't let her budge. She cocks a leg, as a dog to pee on a hydrant, and: success! she turns, motating amazingly to her will.

This movie is an underrated masterpiece that flew over people's heads because it wasn't as straightforward as, say, Avatar. This is a true modern art film, only comparable to maybe Interstellar and Mad Max (another 2 movies that are very unappreciated by the Kevin James/Melissa McCarthey masses). It was so refreshing to watch an actual mature film for mature audiences,  but I guess good R-rated movies are not for everyone.   I think Karl Urban's performance comfortably fits among the best ever, alongside Ledger's The Joker and Jake Gyllenhal in Nightcrawler. It's just a very raw and dark performance that really resonates with the current state of cinema where snappy happy-go-lucky acting is so celebrated.   You wouldn't be criticizing Dredd if you were a true cinephile, so I advise everyone to dive into the vast sea of artistic and obscure films, and not just what the mainstream media spoonfeeds to you. For every film like Spy, Grown Ups, and Prometheus, there's a masterpiece waiting to be discovered, true film like John Wick, The Raid 2, and of course, Dredd. Open yourself to true cinema, you might be surprised what you find in the vast cinematic vault.  + /u/User_Simulator  /u/test_subject9527   Seems like if you hate feminists talking about the internet so much you should just stop going on the Internet. Frankly, if you go on the internet it's *kind of* entirely your fault and no one else's if you get outraged by SJWs. Like, honestly, how obvious is that? Once you go on the Internet, you got no one to blame but yourself if you overhear someone saying that objectifying women should be discouraged or that black people don't think jokes about them stealing bikes are funny. Turn off the computer. Ignore it. Don't go on twitter or Reddit or Tumblr or anywhere, really.   Look, Feminists are going to use the Internet. And they are going to talk about it. If you overhear one talking about how saying you're going to "rape" someone is terrible, and that makes you feel raincloud that's *your* fault. You went on twitter. You had to know some woman was going to ask for more minorities to be protagonists in video games. You can't blame Anita, buddy, and you've got no right to complain.  Wearing that fedora and those cargo shorts, Cheetos on your breath. You wanted to get upset and faux offended about nothing. You were asking for it, *begging* to be called a neckbearded brogressive, a short sighted, white male teenager. You go on the internet, you get feministed. 100% your fault.    + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527    Yeah, and I smell a comeback to past sensibilities in cinema that feels like a breath of fresh air. No more post-modern deconstruction and self-aware reinvention, no more ironic referencing of the past, just straight up followings of the rules of art.  There's a grandeur that comes from simply playing it straight (shown here in the camera work, the choice of the shots, the editing, the music) that faded over the decades by excess and desire of reinvention. A technique that is mastered but self-erases leaves place to the spectacle, it doesn't exist simply trying to show off how original and ground breaking the director is and let the stuff speak for itself, it is more immersive than gimmicks. Here, there's no excessive underlining and trying to make it more and more impactful to a more and more desensitized audience by forcing fancy camera tricks that more often removes you out of the experience than anything else.  We need to go back there, re-sensitize ourselves to older, more subtle and ''sage'' esthetics, because the path we've taken is a debilitating dead-end. Movies shouldn't over-stimulate you to the point of killing your sensitivity, it should exercise that sensitivity, and a Big scale underrated gem movie is no reason to go against that. It's no easy feat to balance such movies. I didn't see much footage of Avatar, I don't know if it succeeded, but from this and another trailer I've seen, there might be a chance.  I'm saying this here, but I trullly feel like we're slowly going back to some great cinema. I won't get hyped for the movie, but it caught my attention for sure.    + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527    If we ban pics of girls we should just do a sitewide ban of guy pics as well. We can't have feminists fingerbanging to underage boys.  In fact, let's just ban ANY pic just to be on the safe side.  This is really just a censorship issue. There's porn of all kinds on every single site out there. There's BARELY LEGAL TEEN porn which is extremely popular. Hell, even Brooke Shields and Traci Lords put underage porn into MAINSTREAM MOVIES. Sure we shouldn't be sexualizing naked children, but if you're going to start banning legal content just for the sake of hoping to catch illegal content, how is that any different than an officer firing into the crowd of a fleeing robber with a shotgun just to make sure he gets the bad guy?  Do just like any other site: do your DUE DILIGENCE to remove any illegal content just as any site would. But it's definitely not your responsibility to police ALL content. That's just impossible. Even 4chan is notorious for DAILY KIDDIE PORN PICS. but the mods remove them as soon as they can because they CAN'T be held accountable for other people's posts otherwise reddit would likewise be held liable for ANY instance of an illegal pic.  Even Iggy Azalea made a child porn video where she tried to seduce an underage little boy with her pussy. That was allowed on YOUTUBE. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. It's really not about the images themselves as much as the gatekeepers in charge of SEXUALIZING THE CONTEXT according to their feminist agenda.  I've seen pics on reddit of parents and strangers posting pics of naked kids playing in a bathtub or near the shower. If ALL naked children are to be removed, those would fall under 'illegal'.  If something is sexualizing a child in an obvious manner, we can remove it, no problem. But if someone is using their feminist liberal agenda to say "THAT is sexual TO ME" then we should tell them to fuck off. I mean social justice warriors support and still buy Lena Dunham's book where she admits to MOLESTING HER LITTLE SISTER. Except it's not considered molestation because the Social Justice Warriors are in charge of setting the context. Instead of Lena Dunham the CHILD MOLESTER touching her sister's vagina, it's warped into a fun childhood game of innocent curiosity. Again, it all depends on the gatekeepers interpretation of events.  Our goal should be to stand against censorship, not give it an excuse to GROW.   + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527    Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.   However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.  But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone.   Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, very worth your time.   + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527    Holy lack of imagination, Batman!  * Expanded voting rights gave more of a say to individual families with more daughters than sons. * Expanded rights to enter into legal agreements and hold property made sure that a father's legacy stayed with his blood and wasn't passed down to sons-in-law or brothers he hates. * Birth control and abortion helped stem the spread of STDs and prevented many unwilling adults from becoming fathers. * Equal pay and protected class status doubles the pool of potential graduates and employees, making sure that the highest level of achievement, scholarship, and innovation is pushed higher, faster than before. * Sexual revolutions and relaxed prudishness made women more willing to experiment in bed and more knowledgeable about how to instruct men to please them and how to please men because being sexual and a woman isn't as stigmatized anymore. * Alimony and child support for both genders has guaranteed single parents income and support for their children, even in hard economic times or when divorce upends personal finances * Dismantling the homemaker / docile wife institution has increased the GDP of the country * It struck down a law that lowered the drinking age for women, but not men, because they were "less responsible" (Craig v.

You haven't read *Why Lift* and therefore haven't the first fucking clue with which ethical/aesthetic criteria Snyder was dismissive of traditional workout conventions. You haven't read *Paleo Me Plenty*. You don't, for example, know another great regimen Snyder dismissed, or why. You aren't making an effort to truly digest or engage in an ongoing dialogue so much as corroding it. But perhaps you're over-rating Snyder as the greatest lifting director of all time. He's just ripped, therefore people think he lifts. Peter Jackson's bulking is just the same as Snyder's lazy 3x5 rep routine.  I could drop so much advanced fitness jargon on you, it would make your head spin, but I won't. Instead, I'll simply point out that you don't know what any of the different modes of dead lifts are, or how they seize upon muscle tissue regeneration. You've never read and don't know who people like Milo of Croton, Galen, or Frederic Delavier are- and those are just the biggies. You've read/seen next to no classic weight training, if any. Certainly not scholastically. You googled some shit about admiring physiques and copy/pasted something written in /r/fitness that you have no basis for understanding. You- yes the dumb, blind, sheltered little product of the exercise industry that you are, contribute to our world's and muscle tissue degradation. (You don't even know what that means because you don't know what good form is). You insult what you're ignorant about. And that's a really shitty thing to do. I suggest you take an honest personal inventory, and then try to make something better of yourself. Because right now, you're pretty fucking disgusting to read. Honestly, I think you should be ashamed of yourself, and should consider apologizing to this thread.   + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527     Querido Hijo Varn Cojida,  Siento que ya no soy 16. de hecho he crecido, mis testculos han descendido, y mientras lo hago pasar una gran cantidad de tiempo en Internet - de hecho, mi trabajo es la construccin y reparacin de aplicaciones web - probablemente los es posible que haya utilizado, yo crezco cansado de mierda de internet.  Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.  As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.  Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.  Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.  T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.  El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.  Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.  Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."  Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.  As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.  Atentamente,  de pollo sin grasa, Adulto.  + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527    So, here's the thing:  When you go to any sort of "I have a problem" support group, inevitably up comes the question: "How did you know you had a problem?"  Lots of people I've worked with never knew they had a problem until something weird brought it up. They almost never listen to their friends or loved ones or professionals or anything. they listen to little kids pointing out their drinking, or a random dog growling at them because they're getting so angry, or, famously, Robert Downy Jr eating a shitty burger king burger and realizing how low his life had gotten.  Point is, when it comes to people getting help, most of them end up getting that final kick from left field. They're so used to filtering out the normal nagging voices that it takes an outside force often to make them aware. The whole thing about a frog in its own slowly boiling water.  I don't think 99% of the folk I've talked to on the Internet have listened to my advice, but maybe one of them did. Or just thought about it.  But I've met enough people in treatment centers that have stories of random "truths" from strangers that I don't shy away from it anymore.    + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527    Djame incondicional esto diciendo que yo he sido un Memer ya que primero aparecieron en 4chan (circa hace siglos en el tiempo a Internet) 2006.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.  Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running.  Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.  Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport? She shifts her weight to the side, as on a motorcycle, but the flofloflo won't let her budge. She cocks a leg, as a dog to pee on a hydrant, and: success! she turns, motating amazingly to her will. She does a 180 to look back at her rapist-hopefull. He is a speck, a wart on the sidewalk. She is gone. To fly toward Voyager 1 to recover that golden record and to hawk it at a pawn shop for the sweet sweet green.   I'd rather see Hellboy deal with something small for the third film considering they're not going to get the money for that and hold it over for number 4. Do something like the Baba Yaga storyline.    Because Del Toro doesn't want to do it. He has 40 other projects that he's definitely sure he can get done by next year.

My favorite articles are on ArticleCity, it's where these content mill chumps usually used to sell tons of articles to. Here's my favorite called "How to be famous like Justin Bieber."  Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do?   Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do.   First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter.   If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might "accidentally" discover your talent for delight the young fans. This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber.   Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called "Never Say Never" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now.   And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called "someday" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber.   The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood.   It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls.   One of his secrets: Its well-defined market.   Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history.   young people are flocking to terrorist groups like ISIS, i know you are joking but i believe you could actually create your very own "red pill army" if you really wanted to.   Recently I've become quite heartened about the long-term future of our society, because I've noticed how astronomically, incredibly well I've done in my career since I swallowed the pill. I seriously doubt I'm unusual in this respect; in 20 years time more than a few of us are going to be in positions of serious power and we may see some positive change from that alone. No need to invade anyone, climb the ladder and shit on the degenerates from above.

Einstein left his wife to raise their two children alone, including a schizophrenic child -- for his cousin. Gandhi urged his wife not to accept Western medicine based on religious beliefs, and she died of a highly curable disease in prison. When Gandhi got the same disease next month, he took the Western medicine and cured himself. Bob Marley had more kids with more women than Thomas Jefferson did with his slaves. How about George Washington? Another person who owned people as if they were objects, forcing them to live their whole lives, generation after generation in poverty. Che? There is one man who led a rather prestige private life. Christian, vegetarian, not an alcoholic, probably never tried any drugs. He even started the fight against smoking. His name is Adolf Hitler. Chose wisely why you dismiss someone and why you follow them. Bill Clinton was by far a better president than Bush (he caused much less pain worldwide than Bush did) but I think anyone would agree that Clinton is morally bankrupt when compared to Bush in their private lives.

Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.  However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.  But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone.   Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time.   Why should I care who moderates SRD? They're not journalists and they're not really beholden to some sort of major ethical agreement to run their subs according to an original intent from Reddit corporate. All they have a responsibility is to enforce the rules that they set for the sub and make sure it isn't "breaking Reddit," per se.   Other than that, it's up to you how you want to browse. I don't see the point of going to war over this when the clear solution is anti-brigading tools and more access to Reddit's statistical data on brigading. Reddit ad infinitum. You keep using Reddit and Reddit keeps making money and chugging along. So far only brigading statistical data comes from people who do it themselves.  Considering this is a free market place of ideas, then the market place is working. People are curating the ideas they want and if they don't like ideas somewhere else they create a new branch.   Why call them cancer? That just seems like crazy talk as well. You have the ability to create any sub you want and curate the content that you want. This seems like such a childish reactionary response. The only reason I can see people calling other moderators cancer is that they want the same audience that those moderators have.

I'm uncomfortable going into this area because, again, without these anti-brigade tools we're going to be bashing each other over the head with benign Reddit history about "SRS taking over a sub," which is a weird claim anyway. SRD has double the subscribers of SRS and is ten times more active so where does SRS eventually come in? So *all* the people that post there are going to get whipped with the same cream because of general claims of brigading?   I know that most stuff that gets linked is usually around hot button issues, and the reasons these are linked are because these are usually the issues that attract the most hot headed people, hence the sub is functioning as it's supposed to. However, I don't understand what the function of the sub is supposed to be. The moderators of SRD are already cracking down on shitposting and they also work closely with the admins to ensure that brigading is kept to a minimum. Other than that I'm sensing you have a specific position about this.   Ultimately, it's up to the moderators to choose how that sub is run and I don't really see the point in arguing about who's community is more conservative and who's more progressive because these are arbitrary to the ultimate use of Reddit which is to curate communities of people who want to talk to each other the way they want, how they want, with the people they want. And Reddit seems to not care about these wars because the goal is to keep you using Reddit. Anything else is arbitrary.    yeah well. you don't know moon so there.  + /u/User_Simulator /u/test_subject9527    La pldora roja es de 120 mil hombres con estudios universitarios de clase media de ajuste.

Atentamente,  de pollo sin grasa, Adulto.   /r/bestof is the money brigade. No one's getting rid of them because they pay for their show which is the sad truth.  I don't think there's a whole lot of proof behind the SRD claims, not saying they don't, but it usually gets thrown in with SRS because some aggravated poster went in there looking for a fight and got trounced. But this usually ignores the quality control the SRD moderators enforce. SRS usually links popular posts in the thousands. SRD is a relatively new addition to the people who complain vocally about SRS.   But we do have a bunch of instances of guys who claim not to brigade actually do, like /r/kotakuinaction, who went into Planetside's sub and rolled over their community with calls to action no one wanted to hear. Either way, these mythical anti-brigading tools would probably solve a whole bunch or problems. There's a debate to be had about whether these subs help people find new communities as well, but it would also get leveled by ideologues looking to score points.   The natural flow of Subreddit's can be disrupted by ideologues as well, for instance the Xavier Mendel affair, however this is fundamentally a debate about how one uses Reddit. If I stumble on a niche sub that SRD links to that I would like to contribute later to because I find it intriguing, and there was no other way to find it, then is that finding it naturally or disrupting the flow of Reddit. What is the flow of Reddit? It's eventually going to flow back to subjective terms, but we usually it's common sense to people.  Either way, anti-brigading tools would probably end these debates because the admins don't seem too concerned about addressing the question anymore than the one time they did, which confirmed what everyone knew and wanted to move on from and that's that "that" sub cleaned up their act to the best of their ability.  The best function of SRD is that it serves a bit as a documented history. A lot of those posters are talented recapers who do a great job of keeping the first draft of Reddit's history. There is a function there for that sub beyond "Hey, look at these clowns slap fighting over steak."

Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.  As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.  Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.  Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.  T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.  El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.  Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.  Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."  Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.  As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.  Atentamente,  de pollo sin grasa, Adulto.

If we really wanted to we could invade New Zealand and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here.

Realistically the Red Pill Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.  I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy.   Je, mirar estas cucks.

MEMES   I'm here to trounce on you infant babies who cannot compete with my muscles and combat training. you internet babies.   boopy   One of my favorite Terrence Blanchard scores. He really has produced a lot of great scores for Spike Lee films as well as a lot of duds. The the theme for the 25th hour exists in a kind of age where you don't hear that kind of lyricism which reminds of George Delarue and Michel Legrand.    Undelete usually runs with the SubReddit Cancer crowd. It's basically a sub for people who don't read the side bar.   There are a ton of meta sub reddit's but largely the ones that get complained about are ones that usually peak participation around huge drama, corporate changes that affect the whole site, but it largely stays within the house. One of those sub reddits only links to popular posts. I suppose that this would all be solved it the admins would finally release those mythical anti brigading tools because this seems to be the shibboleth that has divided people without much proof other than claims made by people.   The only people who seem to have real proof of brigading from other subs into their own are the moderators of /r/blackladies who decided to start cataloging it in a seperate sub as a reaction to the policy changes. Otherwise, Subreddit Drama is the most active. And those moderators rigorously enforce their rules. They give no warning, they just ban "popcorn pissers" and that's that. They are constantly reminding folks not to vote or participate in threads. Considering the current drama has raised their subscription base by 20,000 people, they need to remind constantly. Otherwise, I find the claims of brigading usually get upvoted by ideologues on Reddit with no proof and that's very annoying because it should be easy. The claims of Subreddit drama voting are equally fuzzy because , and this seems to be a new claim, that's come up with less proof that there's no enforcement to check possible vote skewing.    Otherwise, yeah, that poster always seems to have an agenda against subs that are generally progressive. The beauty of Reddit is that it gives power to people to curate whatever kind of sub they want. They can ban whoever they want and delegate whatever they want because the power ultimately lies in the hands of what the moderators want to curate as a community. They're not really beholden to corporate standards.  Complaining about it seems futile unless you can formulate a legit grievance other than "they brigade. I don't have proof, but I know they do."

Adam ant man is literally fun plus life.   Is buttfull stury. He is true vid gamer. Tru. No pathetic    Does Reddit have a standing army that he was fighting for? Otherwise this is a private company. And the techno-libertarians don't understand that if Reddit wants to shut down subs then the free market is working.    DavidRiess comes in and destroys and the best he can get is a re-statement of the original post.       Gran Torino.   Fucking bullshit. I would do anything for a eggs, sausage and cheese on a biscuit from McDonald's but they always turn over when I wake up at 1.      Because alcohol and guns have never been a recipe for dumb things to happen.       Everyone looks so sad. It's like they're looking over yonder, to the next sound stage, where Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd are making pew pew sounds with their laser guns on a Primo Marvel Movie.   And Steve Huffman wonders why /r/askhistorian moderators want to curate their sub and delete shit posting.   Damn.....the rektoning   	197
 If you don't have a PlayStation system, I'm on xbone if you still haven't done it! GT: Moreos   Can someone explain what the Voice Identification Notification is?

Currently buying it!   Thanks for the help!   Thanks I'm lazy lol    Yes I would like to type things with it.   I'm sorry for being retarted, but what is a USB dongle and how much are they?   I have turtle beaches xo one, and they are fantastic! Very comfortable on the ears and great audio quality. I'm on mobile right now but I will post a link to a pair as soon as I get home!   Mine took about a week, some people's probably took longer. Just be patient, it will come :)   Are you on XB1? That kid may have been me :)   When I turned my Xbox on right now I was already signed out.   Lana. Laaana. Laaaana. LAAAAAAAAANNNNNAAAAAAAA!!!!   Dude. Use soap. Wash your body. Eww.      Its there!    Yes   Typically 12-13   wut   I just ignore ratings, really. I've played so many games with 18+ ratings (CoD, GTA, literally every game except Destiny ever). Oh no, it showed a boob! Oh no, he said "fuck"! Who the hell cares, honestly?   Xbox 360, Xbox 1, Ps3  Not really   Really obsessed with Destiny right now, also been playing a bit of Borderlands 2 and Witcher 3       Still looking for a swordbearer?    I do, actually. My dad is a cop since I was pretty little he would take me to the range every weekend. I now have a couple rifles to take with me.  My username was an old Xbox Gamertag. About a year ago when I made this account I couldn't think of anything else so I just stuck with it.  I'm having a "falling out" (I can't think of another word, sorry) with my parents, but I guess that's it.  Lol, that's all I have to say for that one. Yeah, it's *SUPER DUPER* being 13!!!!!!!!1!1!1111  Being able to shave(no, really) everyone else does it, and I grow hella hair.    People, places, just anything really. I carry my camera with me almost every time I go anywhere.   I'm getting Witcher 3 soon, it looks really good from what I've seen    I really want to be either a video game designer or a photographer.   Sorry, it was late and I didn't get any replies until about an hour later, so I gave up and went to sleep.      It's a tie, neither teams get a point.   Strikes.   "For what lays ahead". At least you tried...   Adding you tomorrow as well, GT is Moreos so you know who I am.   Hey there!

Does Wednesday, around 3:30 to 7:00 PST work for you?   I'm on XB1, I can teach you how to anytime. I can one sword Crota and solo him, more than qualified to teach. You do not need to be a 32 to down him. I can also show you in any of your other characters. Message Moreos next time your on :)   You're Divergent.   Yeah It did that for a sec now it says 0 friends online again    Cool , I'm on almost every day.   Send me a message whenever you need help!

Lol no   That's great, I'm Pacific time, so that works out with my home schedule.   I understand, it would be great to give someone that first experience, I still remember my first VoG sherpa!   * Xbox one  * PST/ California * 32 Hunter (main), 32 warlock, 30 Titan  * I basically just help people in this game, now.

 I'm in the same boat as you. My gynecologist stopped delivering babies a long, long time ago, so I'm searching for an OB. I've decided on the hospital where I want to deliver, and I've been searching for OBs that deliver there and accept my insurance. I've Googled some of the OBs and found reviews on other pregnancy message boards, which has been extremely useful. It seems highly recommended to not wait until you're pregnant to meet your new OB or midwife, so it's good you're starting your search early. Babycenter.com has a nice [list of questions to ask when searching for a midwife](http://assets.babycenter.com/ims/Content/Midwife_interview_sheet.pdf).   Anyway... I believe you choose one or the other; you don't need both. There are practices out there that have both OBs and midwives though. You could also have a hospital birth with a midwife (there are so many damn options, aren't there?!). I found this information which is good to know:  Be aware that if you start out with a midwife and develop a problem down the road  such as premature labor or preeclampsia  or find out that you're having twins, your care will be transferred to an obstetrician or perinatologist. (Depending on your condition and the practitioners' arrangements, you may be able to have a midwife and a physician handle your care together, if you like.)   Best of luck. I found this little pre-interview pep talk that you might enjoy reading: [Link](http://i1123.photobucket.com/albums/l543/hercampusphoto/Lauren%20articles/career/peptalk.jpg). Confidence is key to a successful interview. I'm sure you'll rock it!     Yep. The thought of him being an amazing dad is what originally gave me baby rabies. When I was first dating my husband, I was stalking his Facebook page and came across a post where he said his biggest dream is to be a dad. I think my ovaries exploded that day.    Except Monopoly almost always ends in rage quit...    So every B amp;N is participating?! Sounds so cool. I need to talk to people. My husband is getting pissed that I keep spoiling the books (currently on Voyager).    Are you and I the same person? I started a wish list about a week ago, spent 2 hours one night making it because I was so bored. I only ever talk about baby related stuff; I'm starting to worry if my husband things I'm insane. I'm always reading about how to raise kids and constant worry about being a good mom, which my husband claims is adorable and sweet. I have baby names picked out and often use these names when referring to our future kids (all names are husband approved). So far, I've crocheted 3 baby blankets and one dress in the last month or so and I'm itching to make more baby stuff. I have researched OBGYNs and already know where I want to deliver. I think I need an intervention. Please send help.    Fun fact: his costar on Masters of Sex played Janis Ian on Mean Girls.    Congrats on the marriage :) good luck!   I've had a pharmacist catch a potentially fatal drug interaction that my primary care physician completely missed when prescribing me medicine. Needless to say, I am thankful that pharmacists are so knowledgeable about drugs.    How are kids supposed to summon Satan if they don't know how to play Hot Cross Buns?!   I've spent the last two hours looking at stuff on Amazon and adding things to a wish list. This is all your fault haha.    Aw, I'm glad I could help! Best of luck to the two of you.    I'm not early in a relationship, but I'm 23 and I was once in your shoes. I started dating my husband when I was 19 and he was 20. At first, I didn't have any urge to have a baby. However, after a month of dating we were already talking about our future; marriage and family and whatnot. I don't know what the hell happened, but one day I started thinking about babies and couldn't stop. I was so madly in love with him (still am, of course) and just could not wait to start a family with him. It hurt so bad knowing we weren't ready to have children, but it was true: we absolutely were not ready. For us, the timing was not right. We were only sophomores in college at the time, unwed, and barely had any money. Plus, my family could barely swallow the fact that we had gotten engaged after only dating for 3 months, they probably would've been disappointed if I had gotten pregnant. The thought of trying to juggle school and a kid on so little income without my family's full support terrified me. So, although we hated doing so, we were very careful to prevent pregnancy.  It's been almost 4 years since I first started dating my husband. I've obviously never stopped desiring to have a baby with him. Am I sad that we don't have a baby? Yes. Am I happy we didn't end up having one? Also yes. In the last 4 years, we got married, took advantages of opportunities while in college, graduated college with highest honors, and DH has gotten an amazing job and a promotion. We've been able to get out of credit card debt and now we are able to save money for a house. I know that everything we've done would've been so much more difficult and stressful with a baby, so even though I would love to have had a baby by now, I feel waiting was the best choice for us. Honestly, we kept ourselves busy, and these last 4 years have flown by. I can't believe we are so close to TTC.   I've tried to not think about it so much by taking advantage of the time I have with my husband. One day it won't be just you and your SO anymore, so enjoy that time while you still got it. Also keep in mind that there probably won't be a time when you and SO will feel 100% ready for a baby; there isn't ever a perfect time to have one. When you accept that fact, you're "ready" for baby.   Maybe you'll feel better if you and your SO have a nice talk about the future and set a time frame. If I didn't have a time frame for buying a house and TTC, I'd lose my mind.   TL;DR: You're not alone. The waiting sucks, but at the same time, sometimes it's for the best, at least until you're more certain it's what you and SO want. Maybe set a time frame to give yourself something to look forward to, and keep your mind occupied so the baby rabies won't consume you.   "Take her to the moon for me, okay?"  God damn you, Bing Bong.    That's what I thought. Thank you!      My mother and sister both deal with endometriosis (not sure about fibroids, but it sounds familiar. I know Mom would always get cysts that had to be surgically removed though). Anyway, neither one had issues with getting pregnant. I hope this doesn't add any barriers for you.    And yet here we are, indefinitely, waiting on my husband's general feelings of not being ready.  If everyone waited until they feel 100% ready to have a baby, hardly anyone would have babies...  	18

 He sure is [purty.](http://imgur.com/a/GY8z5)   Charlie Mans..no he cool. Ted Bund.. he's cool too. Bill Cos.. nah he's cool. Justin Beiber is my answer.   Edison electrocuting the elephant to prove he could do more than Tesla.  Trent Reznor even used it in his Downward Spiral videos.   So did you just shave it, or try to grasp at some dignity?   I just watched a clip on youtube, and it looks good.   Why have I not seen this?    I saw that on HBO, and I hated the earwig scene as a kid. It scared the shit outta me.   Yep, saw that one.   I was six or seven for Empire. Rode in the back of a station wagon with three-four of my cousins.   Oh, my bad.   Great movie.   I saw Empire at a drive in, but I was only 1 when Star Wars came out.   Was that Jim Carrey's first?   Mine was E.T.      Put down the liquor Lahey!   I didn't even know why I liked her at six years old. She just made me feel funny in my wiener.   Mama always said she used to be hot or something. I never understood why she didn't use a fan or go swimming.   Two people can't fall in love over the course of a year? I don't find it rushed at all, I just think it happened at the most inopportune time.   "If you build it, they will come."?  Field of Dreams   Yea, it got leaked from comic con. Google it.   Once they come they would be there for the kick, that's all. Maybe they would stay, and help out with a proper commune. You never know man, if you build it, they will come.   Me too, but my daughters are singing it again now that I played it.    What if when the kids are grown and out of the house, we buy a large area with hills, rocks, fishing, hiking, and camping. Then we'll turn it into a rehab. No drugs there except cannabis. Too many of our friends are fucked up on that junk.   Fuck boys, I think we have our twelve year plan. Large house with pole barns and what not. We would farm, of course. You could stay, and we would help you with your sickness. Counseling, games, community, structure, something to do other than shoot up.   He went to Tonk's parents house first before taking the brush/portkey to the burrow. The ministry did not know about the protections set up at the other six houses IIRC.   I just have original Colossus at a 13, I need to buy that uni.   My setup is very strong, but everything I did would only take off a couple hundred at a time. Even Deadpool's giant weapon.   Awesome!   We need to find him!   I will agree with all but your tl;dr.  Harry and Ron showed incredible bravery that night in the chamber, but I think Neville was the *TRUE* Gryffindor in Harry's year.   RAWR! Is /u/chaosattractor all hopped up on Mountain Dew?   I killed you and the other pretty quick, but even with 3 on 1, it took like 20 minutes to beat Colossus. Did you see him in the Deadpool tralier?   1: Is incorrect. Dobby defied the Malfoys and had to punish himself accordingly. I think he was just a very odd elf.  2: James was a bit of a toerag, but as he got older, he learned the error of his ways.   I would assume he stayed at Hogwarts because Harry was never the type to assume ownership of anyone. Kreacher was a very old elf after all.   It's sometimes called hogwort or hogweed. A Goolgle search should help you.   It's my headcanon that Albus sent protectors to all of Harry's known relatives in case of an attack by the remaining DEs, but there is no proof for that.   I know! It was completely fucked!   Are you serious? John and Yoko?   Was Wendy a metamorphmagus?   Watch the other ninety minutes. I'm at the end now.      Yea, I have read everything John wrote. He/she is awesome.   His skull.    True, in HBP. OotP Harry doesn't want to use it because he thinks it will get Sirius in trouble by way of sabotage or him doing something irrational.   That is awesome. Thanks for cluing me in on that.   Sirius gave Harry that mirror as he was heading back to Hogwarts with Tonks and them on the Knight Bus after Christmas in OotP.  I just read that again a couple of days ago. But I agree, use the damn mirror before you go rushing into an ambush.   If it was just piss, shit, and water- that's cool. That shit has chemicals in it.   Wow.      That's just Sirius lashing out because Azkaban made him a bit loopy.   Mine too!   Shows what I know.   ..it is definitely 4:14, My Lucky Charm.   It was not their (JD and Turk) business to call the cops on someone who was trying to care for someone. It's their business to heal the sick.   HA!      tl;dr buddy. I'm not spending my night arguing with you, I have better things to do.   You're not telling me nothing new buddy. I know that's what he used at Hagrid's hut, Hermione used it at 12GP, Selwyn or Travers used it, and that's about all we know. Wiki is not all canon, some is fanon.   What the...  ...not *all* of them.   **Home**num Revelio, therefore it only works in a **home.**   Hogwarts is a home to some, but it's main purpose is a school. Just my headcanon, but I don't think it works like that.   No, the school was not empty. There were students and staff there, therefore *homenum revelio* would not have worked because the spell shows people in a dwelling, not necessarily a school where there is always someone there.   I do not appreciate your tone.   You're correct, it's a bearded dragon.    Aha! I was waiting for that. HR wouldn't be possible at Hogwarts because there are simply too many people there.   Brassballs because my mother used to call me that and it stuck.   I tripped Eddie Vedder once.   Yes! but I have to go with Pisces Iscariot.   That was my bible in high school.    Tupac could.   King *of* Pop   August and Everything After   What in the text supports yours? I think that if it had been planned that way all year, it would have been where it was at the end of the year.   That's interesting, never heard that before.    I still don't think so. I don't think he used that as the final task until he realized that he and Harry were spending way too much time in front of it.   It wasn't placed under the trapdoor until it was needed, when the other professors set up the other tasks to get to it. That was one of Dumbledore's more genius ideas if he did say so himself.  It's my idea that he knew it was bad for both himself and Harry.   No. It didn't have that purpose at the time. It was just the mirror of Erised.      Not at the time though. It was moved under the trapdoor after that, remember?   That's what I mean, do you think he was using it first?   Don't forget the summer between 5 and 6 when he was fool enough to put the ring on to see his family again. I believe he was very weak when it came to the mirror.   When Albus found Harry staring into the mirror, and the whole 'it does not do to dwell' speech.  There is no way he (Albus) could have known Harry was there unless he was already in the room staring into the mirror of desire himself.  It's my theory that Dumbledore was looking into the mirror and heard the door open, so he backed into the shadows and disillusioned himself. When he didn't see anyone open and close the door, he assumed it was Harry because he had just given him the cloak on Christmas.  Albus probably stood there and let Harry enjoy one more bit of time looking at his family before he finally moves it.  [6.5]    I have to disagree. If Harry was under the cloak, there was no way Albus could have seen him. He had to have used some other form of detection, or perhaps... WOW.   TBC in a new thread in the great hall.    Where is the one from CoS when Harry passes the note to Ron in class, Ron reads it *"We should do it tonight."* and gulps, then agrees?    He shows us in the first book that he can even follow Harry under his invisibility cloak  I don't remember this, could you please elaborate?   An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully. From morning till night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something. The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot. One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again. Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on. All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot. At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it. So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men. The old farmer said: "Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement." "And what about the men?" the minister asked. "They wanted to know if the mule was for sale."   The Greater Good, it's when Albus, Aberforth, and Gellart duel. Very well done short film.   I would imagine Ron did get a look at it in HBP.   Correct. The ministry was conducting raids looking for dark objects, and Lucy thought he could get two birds stoned at once by planting the diary on Arthur Weasley's (who was overseeing the raids) daughter to incriminate them both.   Well, since you have to murder someone to make a horcrux, I would say that they are very, very bad.   Shit man, since no one else is saying it, *levicorpus* was not a commonly known spell to children of Potter's age. It was created by Snape, and went in and out of fashion, but not a commonly known spell that parents would teach their children... *colloportus* is a spell to lock doors, the reverse of *alohamora.*   Say person x takes the vow and promises something to person y. Person y dies, I believe that person x is free of the commitment.   Does it have to be Harry's timeline? If not I would go with Lupin.   Yea, it's probably my favorite fic.   By the time I made it to jr high, they had the stirrups that were sewn into the sock, and were just lines up your leg.    Take the file to a copy place.    I watched that fiasco from the couch, but what a great time. Now all the Minor league managers are doing it.    Nah, they don't employ Burns security anymore.   Yea man, the movie is flowing along so nicely, and then it's Saturday morning all over again. I think they would have done better with just the actors and the same dialog in the book.   That's an interesting theory. Perhaps why he was proud of his Prince side because Eileen drove him to be what he was. Or was he proud of his Prince side as an adult?   You are spot on with that timeline.   No shit. I probably saw over 400 games there, and I completely hated that stadium. I saw from Johnny Bench night in 81 through 4,192 through the 90 wire to wire. Probably saw 40 games that year, I got in free as a teen because my buddies dad was the head of security. All the way to the beginning of the remodel.    I wore stirrups when I played in the early 80s. Nothing like the classic unis.   I don't remember reading that.   How long between the relaying of the prophecy until he went to Dumbledore is the question.       I don't think so. Remember he only switched sides after he heard the prophecy which was a month or so before Riddle's first downfall.   He's shown to be an 'expert'  fourteen years later in OotP when Harry was 15. To me that's plenty of time to hone his craft.   A well thought out response. Have an upvote.  I completely forgot about Slughorn.    I was thinking that after Snape came to Dumbledore asking him to hide the Potters, and giving anything in return Albus set plans in motion knowing that Sev would be the perfect spy, and taught him himself.   How do you suppose he became such a great occlumens? Did Albus teach him knowing that there would eventually be a need for it because he knew so much of Tom Riddle, and that he was a skilled legillimens?   Maybe by themselves in a separate animated film. I personally thought that bit included in DH was bad.   Yes, Sirius said that he and James used to communicate with the mirrors.   "The map never lies!"   Voldemort   I masturbate.      The museum of meeting everyone I've ever loved, and or admired as a real person.      I agree.    I will be there the first week of August.  	118
 Worth mentioning (because I messed this up once):  Glengarry Glenross is also a '90s movie.   Wait, this is just 100% Kentucky Bluegrass?  That is vastly inferior to a hybrid of Kentucky Bluegrass, Featherbed Bench, and Northern California Sensemilla.     I've been playing Magic, off and on, for almost 20 years now - in Colorado, Florida, and a few times since moving to Madison.  PM if you're still looking for more folks to have a discussion.   Yeah, there's a sweet article on the site that Brandon Perna writes for, suggesting that we will let Moore walk and try Kayvon at the FS position in training camp to see if it fits.  Obviously, there is some risk that it won't,  but Kayvon is squarely buried at 4th CB on the depth chart, and he has some serious talent (he's just playing behind two of the best in the NFL, plus a rookie who made an impact - not easy to do at the CB position).  This way, he gets to compete for playing time elsewhere, and if it doesn't work out, he goes back to CB depth.  Seems like a great move to me.   A duck walks into a liquor store and asks the teller, "Hey, man - you got any corn?"  The clerks says, "No, sorry Duck, we don't sell corn here."  So the duck thanks the clerk and leaves.  The next day, the same duck comes into the same liquor store and once again asks for some corn.  Again, the teller politely informs him that they do not sell corn at the liquor store.  He is a little agitated, though.  The day after that, the duck returns.  And once again, he asks the clerk, "You got any corn?".  This time, the clerk loses it:  "No, you stupid duck - I already told you twice that we don't sell corn here.  This is a liquor store!  If you come in here and ask for corn again, I am going to nail your goddamn feet to the floor!"  So the duck leaves.  Then, the next day, the duck returns, walks up to the clerk, and asks, "You got any nails?".  The clerk says, "No." So the duck says, "Well, then you got any corn?"   Dude, *A Serbian Film* literally has a mind-raping ending.  He kills the dude by fucking his skull through the eye socket!   Burt:  We got that mother-humper, you hear that?  Val:  Copy that Burt, and good job.  Be advised, however, that there are two more, repeat *two more* mother humpers.    Nobody is blaming you - and if you feel that bad you can cry on my residual shoulders.    I always knew that *The Empire Strikes Back* was missing a heartfelt rendition of "Rainbow Connection" to break up all those horrible Jedi training sequences.   And tonnes more who have done active harm to society.  In the grand scheme of things, just let the damn bear hang out and raise his kid, right?   You really think that was a joke?   So incredibly ridiculous.    Those movies were okay, man.   It is a coaching musical chairs!  (Shanny lost)   They were more mediocre than "bad" - Phillips was 16-16 as our head coach (16-17 if you count the playoff loss to the LA Raiders).  Really, the best thing you can say about that period was that Phillips was a clear caretaker until Shanny was wiling to take the HC job.   Exactly!  We're probably less than 25 years away from the ability to do basically anything shown in that movie.     I mean, you can do a lot of those things right now, if you want to.  It costs some money, but is suggested for older parents already (the older the get the more likely certain genetic abnormalities get).   I promise to you, Captain_Cocksmith, that should I and my partner go through a pregnancy, we will be very low key about it.  Maybe a couple friends and family over for brunch - that kind of thing.     Ahh, *A Serbian Film*.  Didn't know I would have to think about you today.   I've done some reasonable work, and others have too.  But, I mean, things can always be mocked *more*.   You're right - most baby things nowadays are stupid.  This definitely fits the bill.  I mean, what if you had another "reveal" party where instead of checking on a very big aspect of genetics (Male vs. Female is basically Y vs. X chromosomes), you looked for smaller things?   You get your baby checked for genetic abnormalities, give the envelope to a friend, and then he/she goes about planning the party!  Everyone gathers around, you open up a box, and out flies five balloons with the following words written on them:  Trisomy 21  At Risk for Alcoholism  Astigmatic  Blue Eyes!  Huntington's Disease   Yay!     Because penises are important for a baby.  Basically, if you get one with a penis, it makes more money over its lifetime, is safer against sexual assault, has a less stressful young life (reducing odds of suicide), there's some data which suggest that its brain will work better for things like engineering and science (which will be important in the world of tomorrow).  /s.     Wow, the uphill battle for the playoffs gets . . . uphillier?  Isn't this the actual worst player on the team to lose to injury right now?     This is a very solid hire for a number of reasons, many of which are mentioned in other comments (Von and Ware being great OLB in the 3-4, Pot Roast being a prototypical NT, etc), but one that I think is going overlooked is the benefit that this will have on the running game.  The zone-blocking running game is very strong, but it can have some issues with the 3-4, due to the difficulty in communicating assignments and just the spacing of the players.  If the Broncos get to practice against the 3-4 themselves, all the time, we may see better performance against these defenses.   Copy-Pasting my response from a previous, similar question.    I'm going to give my try at this, too.  I love Nate Silver and read his piece when it came out, so I will stay with London, Toronto, Mexico City, and Los Angeles as the expansion cities.  I think that the best way to actually add new teams isn't to stir up everything as much as possible to make "geographic sense", but to make small tweaks while preserving age-old rivalries.  Hence, I will be working with two Conferences (AFC and NFC; if you want to change the "National Football Conference" to the "International Football Conference" that would be fine, too, but I'll keep them the Same.  **American Football Conference**   East |  Central |  West ------------|--------------|------------- New England | Pittsburgh | Denver Miami | Cleveland | Kansas City New York Jets | Cincinnati | Oakland Buffalo | Indianapolis | San Diego Jacksonville | Tennessee | Houston Toronto | Baltimore | Mexico City  and  **National Football Conference**  East | Central | West  ----------|-----------------|----------------- Dallas | Green Bay | San Francisco Philadelphia | Chicago | Seattle Washington | Minnesota | Arizona New York Giants | Detroit | St. Louis Carolina | Tampa Bay | New Orleans London | Atlanta | Los Angeles   For the most part, I like this re-alignment.  I am a little pissed that New Orleans has to be in the NFC West, and that Atlanta and Tampa moved to the Central, but there are just SO MANY east coast teams that some of them had to go somewhere.  I was basically able to keep every East, West, and North division together, then got to sprinkle in members of the South with new teams where they made (at least some) sense. This is *kind of* disrespectful to the AFC and NFC South, but frankly if you were to choose a division in each conference to break up, these are the most recently created, and harm historical rivalries the least.  Indy/Tennessee and Tampa Bay/Atlanta get to bring a buddy with them, but the Saints, Panthers, Texans, and Jaguars are not so lucky.  But, except for the Saints, these are all relatively recent expansion teams, so it seams like the way to do the least harm.  So, there's my two cents:  we preserve the most storied rivalries, add two new teams to each conference in geographically sound divisions, and are even fairly immune to moves by the Rams, Raiders, or Chargers (i.e., the geography still makes sense if they go to LA, San Antonio, etc).  As for the schedule - we bump it up to 20 weeks with two bye weeks and two preseason games (so, 22 game-weeks, vs. the 21 we have now).  The byes can either be strategically placed to allow teams to travel internationally / play on Thursday, *or* can be set up so that each team gets a bye in the first half and second half of the year.    The scheduling would be very similar to what we do now, but there is a tweak which I think is very cool:  10 games against your division (home   home, obv), 6 games against a complete division (on yearly rotation, as now), and 2 games against those in your conference who finish at a similar ranking as you (so, 1st plays 1st, 2nd plays 2nd, etc - just like now).  This guarantees that you will play every team on a 5-year rotation, but offers up this little tweak:  on the years where you play a division in your own conference, you play *twice* against one team (the team that finished at the same place), which would be a home-and-home type of series between non-divisional opponents, which I think is awesome.  Camps can start a little earlier to allow for joint practice sessions and/or additional talent evaluation.  Because 12/36 playoff teams is equal to the percentage of teams that currently make the playoffs in baseball (with the WC play-in game it is now 10/30, the same ratio), you could choose to keep it to 12 teams, or you could bump it up to 14, where the top seed in each conference gets a bye.  I am also a fan of moving towards a seeded bracket with no regard for conference, but that is a different discussion.    No Thursday night games unless both teams are coming off of a bye!  Late in the season (after College Football's regular season is done), you can schedule two games on Saturday to highlight additional playoff-potential games.  These could be scheduled in advance with the opportunity to flex, as the Sunday night games are now.  Thoughts?  tl;dr - Keep West/East/North largely intact, sprinkle members of the South and new teams throughout those.  Go to 20 weeks (18 games), and possibly add two more playoff teams.      Cheat sheet for other folk:  Elway is the Duke.  Manning is the Sheriff.  The Orange Crush defense was named after the orange-flavored soda.  The Three Amigos were a receiving corps in the late '80s with Ricky Nattiel, Vance Johnson, and Mark Jackson.  Tebow.  It's always Tebow with god stuff.  BIG DICK PLAYER AWARD.

It is important to remember this one fact whenever dealing with "punishment" dispensed to *any* established system of power:  It is all bullshit.   Checkmate, atheists.   And cut the sanctions halfway through.   Didn't know too much about this cat, so I did some of my own research in to his career over the past decade or so.  I have organized my analysis in to a table of Special Teams DVOA ranking for each of the past 8 years, both for DeCamillis' team (Chicago, Dallas, or Jacksonville;  I have decided not to go back to his 12-year stint with the Falcons), and the Broncos team (at the time).    Year | Joe DeC.'s Team | Joe De.C's Rank | Broncos Rank ---|---|----|---- 2014 | CHI |25th | 27th 2012 | DAL | 15th | 13th 2011 | DAL | 25th| 18th 2010 | DAL | 15th | 27th 2009 | DAL | 14th | 18th 2008 | JAX | 21st | 31st 2007 | JAX | 14th | 28th   As I said before, this is football outsiders DVOA for special teams, which attempts to measure how many points the five areas of special teams add to (or take away from), to a team's point total, on average.  The five areas are kickoffs, punts, kick returns, punt returns, and FG/ Extra points.  In general, it is about a 50/50 split of teams with positive ratings and negative ratings, due to this being based on league average (although a huge outlier can throw this off by a bit).  Anyway, what should jump out to you first is that the Broncos have been absolutely awful at special teams for the better part of a decade.  Only once were we even above the league average! (2012).  Most of the time we are squarely mired in the bottom quarter of the league, which is just embarassing.  Comparatively, I would say that DeCamillis' teams have performed *slightly* better - most years he is right aroudn average, if not slightly above average (so, 14th or 15th), but there are years where his squad performs below league average, with the 25th ranked squards in 2014 and 2011.  It is troubling that his two worst-performing jobs have occurred in the last three campaigns.  Overall, it is hard to sugar-coat this one.  This is an average Special Teams coordinator, who appears to have a few off seasons every now and then, the last of which likely led to his firing from the Bears.  However, that being said, it would be hard to argue that this is not an improvement (albeit a slight improvement) over what the Broncos have achieved in the recent past.  This is a textbook C+ type of move, and it will likely result in a middling special teams next year (and beyond, perhaps).  The thing is, with the talent across the rest of the roster, this may be all that John Elway and Kubiak want - a special teams that doesn't cost the team points.  DeCamillis may be a good coach to deliver just that, all while we allow above-average offense and defense to do the real work.  In addition, it worth noting that this was one of the guys that had the roof of Dallas' practice facility fall on him, which resulted in a severe injury to his neck (he had to have vertebrae fused, I believe).  Regardless, he was back on the field less than two weeks after the surgery in a neck brace with his usual rowdy behavior.  I mention this because he could definitely be the kind of guy that will provide that "kicking and screaming" mentality that has been missing.  tl;dr - Average guy - but maybe that's all the Broncos want.  edit: in the interest of fairness, if you go all the way back to his 10-year stint with the Atlanta Falcons (1997-2006), those teams averaged out at ranking 7th in the league (so, top quarter).  That was a while ago, though, so take that information as you see fit.       He was 100% a caretaker head coach, when Bowlen had to decide on an Elway vs. Reeves ultimatum.  He was actually fine as a head coach (.500 winning percentage over 2 seasons, plus one playoff loss), but he was always hired with the idea of holding the position until Shanahan was ready to leave San Francisco.  And yes, he was a worse HC than DC - this was also true at Buffalo and Dallas.  But, wherever he gets to focus on just the defense, he always fields a strong unit.   And if he does preside over the ascension of Bortles (Raise them!), I think that should put to bed the whole, "Only had success with Peyton Manning" style of criticism.  I wish him the best of luck, though.   Gibbs' zone-blocking scheme (ZBS) can be run with either 1 or 2 backs, with some slight adjustments for when both backs are in there (it adjusts the strongside/weakside designation, and especially alters blocking on the weakside, usually).  But, I think it is important to understand that a FB in the ZBS is not built to go put a hat on a Mike linebacker in the hole every play.  He is more in the Howard Griffith-style of back - can pass protect, can catch balls out of the backfield if needed, and can lead block (sometimes), and even can take those 1-yard plunges from an upback position.  I am not sure if that kind of player is currently on the roster, but I think the closest fit is probably Thompson, as you suggested, although I have not seen very much from him regarding pass protection and catching the ball (at least in the regular season).  edit:  If you want to learn so much about the ZBS that you'll consider quitting your job to go coach it at a local highschool or community college, check [this] (http://vimeo.com/cripes/videos/search:Alex/sort:date/format:thumbnail) out.   That was Kizsla, predictably.  Always being a douchebag.   I think you're wrong; this Belly-chick guy never recovered from sucking it up with the Browns.   You have been invited to "Terrorist Attack on July 27th"!!!  Please like the page and invite your friends!   You can't always make fun of the bottom-dwellers.  Sometimes the best jokes are at the expense of those who fail in the spotlight.  Whenever I am football-sad, [this always cheers me up.] (http://www.theonion.com/articles/patriots-season-perfect-for-rest-of-nation,2382/)     Not a doctor (well, not that kind, anyway), but I think that the nature of Manning's injury was that it really only would heal via rest, and the rest required would have been longer than just the end of the regular season (sort of like Aaron Rodger's calf).  It's possible the options were :  1.  Sit Manning the rest of the year or 2. Play Manning the rest of the year.  No real in between. If 2 or 3 weeks of rest wouldn't actually accomplish anything - then why sit him at all?  Recall, also, that until the Cincinnati Bengals loss, the Broncos were still playing for the #1 seed in the AFC.   Bonus:  If you start mimicking how these people evaluate the wine they are tasting, you're S.O. will give you dirty looks!  Source:  "This is a dark new world red, medium-plus acidity, low alcohol, high tannins . . . "   I watched Brian Griese beat out Bubby Brister when Elway left.  People were all, "Wonderlic this" and "Michigan that" and the hype was huge.  And you know what?  He was fine.  He played well sometimes, but generally didn't perform well in the big games (which were almost always against you assholes back then).  I watched Plummer being instilled as the new answer, and I loved Plummer.  "No Mistake Jake" was the mantra around here - as long as he didn't force anything, we would be *fine*!  Even though Shanahan fucked it up, Plummer had a clear ceiling.  And Cutler.  That was probably the biggest hype I have ever seen for a new Broncos quarterback - even Shanahan fell into it, replacing Jake mid-season and easily costing us a playoff spot and Shanahan a job, eventually.  Don't get me started on Orton and Tebow.  These players all looked like they had potential, and I'd argue that only Plummer really put it all together for a strong season.  One strong season.  It is easy to get swept up in the hype, but there are not very many NFL-quality starting quarterbacks in this world.  Hopefully, the Lobster turns into that for us, but you never know.  I think the organization has done everything they can to stack the deck in their favor (having him study under Manning, but still compete for the backup role with various other QBs), and I have seen improvement in preseason play, but who knows?   It's wishful thinking.  We all hope that will be the case, but it is obviously completely up in the air.  If I were being honest, I'd say there is a 50% chance that Brock is a completely mediocre, replacement-level type player, a 40% chance that his is an above-average starting quarterback, a 8% chance that is the long-term solution at quarterback, and about a 2% chance that he ascends to the mysterious level of "elite".  You think I am being too optimistic? (honest question)   This logic is faultless.  **Faultless, I say!!!**   If you want to have some fun (is that the word?), check out her videos on abortion.  Or women voting habits.  Or anything, really.   Knew it was Borowski before I even clicked it.  I don't know if there has ever been a person with whom I could be in complete agreement (sometimes; not on everything) while completely disagree with her method of expressing those views.     I would straight-up trade Peyton Manning for the #1 overall pick this year.  It is simply a question of value.  Manning adds a great deal of value to his team, but it will likely only be for another year (if that!).  By contrast, a number 1 pick will add much greater value *over the course of that player/player's career*.  Imagine the Broncos do this, and simply trade back for something reasonable (i.e., not what the Redskins did):  Swap 1sts this year with a team in the high single digits, plus next year's 1st rounder.  So, to recap:  Under this situation, I give up Peyton Manning, and I am left with:  The number 28 pick (Broncos), the 7-9th pick (traded for the #1 overall I received for Manning) this year, plus two more 1sts next year - at least one of which is probably top 15?  I love Manning, but no team would take that trade.  It just bleeds value.   Very possible.  Peyton and Gase seem to have a great relationship, and I like the idea of giving a Wunderkind-type coordinator his first shot at HC.  Thing is, that also describes Austin and Quinn (though they are on the other side of the ball, and have not built up the relationship with the Broncos organization).  Then there's Kubiak, who I think gets too much flak for his stint in Houston.  When Schaub was a respectable QB, that Houston team was very good.  It is not easy taking over a franchise which has literally zero history of success and establishing that new culture.  Personally, I think I would be quite pleased with Gase, Quinn, Austin, ot Kubiak, but would prefer Gase (if we go offensive) or Austin (if we go defensive).   That movie had such potential.  A very interesting world with a nice sci-fi concept to tie it together.  But, nope.  Bank Robberies for everyone!   Broncos have an interview set up for tomorrow with him, and I think that the Falcons have a 2nd interview today.  I hope he makes it to Denver to talk with Elway, at the very least.   By Grabthar's Hammer . . . What a savings.   You certainly do; there's a reasons that he is one of the only coaches left over from the McDaniels Era - he is very good at coaching running backs.  Studesville truly is a . . . hmm, what word am I looking for here?  I guess, "Pro".   I like Redmond because sometimes he plays alongside Barrie and I get to shout, "The Kubrick Pair is D-ing it up!!!"   Nah, $41.43 - because real cool dudes use two Twin Primes to make a price!   There's always money in the banana stand . . .   Maybe if I make a bottom 5 list . . .   Stream open; over-reactions to minor statements ready!   I got to thinking about this when everyone and their dog seemed to have an opinion on how good Fox really is, both here and in /r/nfl.  So, where, in your estimation, does John Fox rank among the other great coaches that have been at the helm of the Broncos?  Is he top 5, or somewhere below that?  I think Shanahan is heads-and-shoulders above the rest.  I know he looked iffy without Elway at QB, and that his teams would fade at the end of the season and always have trouble fielding a reasonable defense, but he coached at an elite level for a brief period, and was very good for most of the rest.  Easy #1.  I think the second spot has to go to Dan Reeves.  I know we lost three Superbowls and an AFC Championship game during his tenure.  I know he was far too conservative with Elway in his prime (a direct contrast to Shula with Marino), but the man won so many games, and had the Broncos competing for championships many times.  I don't think that can be overlooked.  Easy #2.  Now here's where it gets hard:  who is number 3:  John Fox or Red Miller?  I think they are the most comparable of the remaining coaches, and have had very similar success (Fox is .719, Miller .645; both have a single AFC Championship, both righted the ship when they arrived).  For my money, though, I am going to put Red Miller here.  He very deservedly won Coach of the Year in '77, and was really the first coach to establish the Broncos as a legitimate franchise.  It was amazing what he accomplished in that first year with Craig Morton at the helm, although the importance of the Orange Crush defense cannot be overstated.  By contrast, I think Fox benefited greatly from a miracle run by Tim Tebow , that Broncos defense, and amazing kicking from Prater (all of which was completely unsustainable), and then working with Peyton Manning.  I don't think Fox would have been successful taking over the '77 team, but I do think that Miller would have been fine taking over after McDaniels.  And, finally, to round out the top 5, I present the only other coach to have a winning record while coaching the Denver Broncos:  John Ralston (who went 34-33-3 over five years).  These Broncos teams were not good, but somehow Ralston was able to remain competitive regardless (Floyd Little helped, I'd imagine). He barely ekes out Wade Phillips due to longevity, a slightly better overall record, and the quality of talent available to him.  So, That leaves my list as:  1. Mike Shanahan 2. Dan Reeves 3. Red Miller 4. John Fox 5. Jon Ralston  Hon. Mention:  Wade Phillips (a much better DC than head coach, he still went exactly .500 in his career with Denver, and led us to a playoff appearance - which Ralston never did).     I said this in jest to my wife last night (we're both UF alums who were there for both of his Gator Championships).  It really isn't *that* crazy of an idea, but I am pretty sure that he wants to build an entire program and have full control with recruiting and what not.  The college game is just so different, and now with the playoff system it is easier for an always-solid team to have a shot at the championship game most years (without a playoff system, the Buckeyes wouldn't have had a chance this year).  I also think he likes shifting the power away from the SEC, and he's doing very well in that regard.   Good call.  Fucked up all the way through, but eye stuff gets me especially.   Good news!  Got a bunch more of those for you:  Antichrist.  Irreversible.  4 months, 3 weeks, 2 days.  The Accused. (I actually watched this twice; don't know what I was thinking).  Grave of the Fireflies.  Salo.  Enjoy!!!       They both kind of work in a metaphorical sense, right?  "Whale" is attractive because whales are large and it suggests that you just dominate someone.  And "Wail" is nice because it means "a cry of anguish", which is exactly what you are forcing out of your hapless victim.   You don't protect yourself by crosschecking to the face.  You protect yourself (if that is your argument) by raising your gloves/arm/stick to your own face.  You know, turtling.  Like he does when he is getting beat down.   I always thought it was, "Wail on him".    Regardless, totally in your camp.  Cooke is a goddamn disgrace.  It is slightly worse because they are down by 2 with ~2 to go.  Total bullshit enforcing, and he got walloped for it.  Fuck him.   [Hard Candy]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Candy_%28film%29)  Tl;Dr - Ellen Page seduces a suspected pedophile for some vigilante justice.  Not bad.   Or an Ellen Page with a box full of tied-down pedophiles.   This is exactly it; he is average.  There was a piece (I think on Grantland) at the beginning of the year ranking coaches based on a survey sent to football people.  Fox was squarely in the second group - above average, not elite.  So, what is he good at?  I think the players like playing for him.  I think he handles the media well.  I think he has reasonable game plans (or at least trusts his coordinators to make decisions) - but nothing special.  He's not great at adjustments.  Awful at motivating players.  Absolutely awful at situational decisions (4th downs, being aggressive at end of halves, using time outs. **challenges!!!**)  He is an average coach, maybe slightly above average.  His ceiling is not very far from his floor, and he is certainly a stabilizing force.  This was precisely what the 4-12 Broncos needed after the McDaniels fiasco.  Now, with a strong core of players built over the last few years through strong drafts and key free agents (not just the big names, but folk like Chris Harris Jr. and CJ Anderson - both UFA), the ceiling on this team is high, and I think Fox's style conflicts with what this team can accomplish.   It is definitely a thing on all the Broncos blogs.  And we didn't even make it up - the Panthers did.  Ask the Panthers fans.   I think this is *a little* over-stated.  In my estimation, if you don't *play for* the Superbowl each season, it is a failure (meaning, reach the AFC Championship game, so you have a chance).  I mean, come on, anything can happen in a big playoff game like that - you just want your shot at the Superbowl.  The Broncos didn't even get that 3 of his 4 years (lost in divisional round @ NE, vs. BAL, vs. IND., which I think was a big part of this.   Correct.  And you don't exactly say to the Ravens, "Oh, I am waiting to see if the Broncos fire their coach which just won the division championship for his first four year before I decide if I want to OC for you guys!"     And yet, both coaches that you are referring to have developed a style so reviled that it inspires the creation of "insert name-ball".  Coincidence?  I think not.  There's no Carrolball or Belliball or even a Tomlinball.   This is really great!  As an assist for people to see what is going on under the hood (or, in essence, why you did each calculation), they can "follow along" with [this pdf] (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-4/fips-180-4.pdf).   Thank you for the stats!  You are certainly correct - but I think the Colts were still just daring Manning to make the throws.  As your stats show, this year he has been above-average in making those throws.  I think it is fair to say that yesterday he was below average making those throws (and they *were* there, in that sequence where multiple throws went to Sanders, he had beat his man by at least a step).  Results?  Overthrow by 2 yards and overthrow by 0.5 yards.   Usually the head coach is made available to the media as well (recall last year when Fox and Elway had a presser after the Superbowl).  This tweet is suggesting that that omission means the Fox will be fired.   It was mentioned in his SI piece last week.   I do agree with you in principle, but there were opportunities to win the game.  You don't deserve the down votes!   This was an absolute choke job.  Only CJ Anderson showed up today.  Poor showings from the wide receivers, Peyton Manning, and much of the defense, especially on critical third downs.  Talib may have had his worst game as a Bronco.  Demaryius looked spooked most of the time.  The Colts decided to be physical 1-on-1 with receivers and we had zero answers.  This looked eerily similar to the Superbowl at times, and the Colts D is not the Seahawks D.  Disappointing.  This is now twice in three years that Fox and company have squandered a first round bye by losing to an underdog.  And the other year they were out-coached in the Superbowl and embarrassed.  I'd guess that people will be clamoring for Fox's job - but there aren't really reasonable alternatives in mind.  Staying pat for at least another year would be the best move; 4 division titles in 4 years is still an achievement to be proud of.  Good season, Broncos.  Always looking forward to next year, but this one leaves a nasty taste . . .   How close were we to kicking Tom Brady out of this game?  Holy shit    Interesting design - but I must say that I am a a little surprised that it is an open-air stadium.  It seems to me that all the owners who are a building new digs want to be able to host a Superbowl there in the near future, and I think the league would hesitate to have one in St. Louis in February.  Now, I know that New Jersey just had one, and I am actually supportive of the idea of having cold-weather Superbowls (Denver would be great - you could easily have a 50 degree, sunny day or -10 and a blizzard!), but I think it is folly to assume that because NJ had one, that this issue doesn't stick in the craws of some.   Amazon Prime has it.  Just in case you already have that thing.   Not only that - but did you read the article?  Very, very poor writing.  If I see another one-sentence paragraph which is completely related to the previous and next one-sentence paragraphs, then I will not be held accountable for my actions.   My day-to-day sanity has greatly improved since unsubbing from /r/politics and /r/atheism.     Very, very sad.  Apparently he can't remember the Superbowl victories anymore.   It is amazing to me to think that Chris Harris Jr. was almost not given a chance in the NFL.  You can be aggressive and call him the best cornerback in football, or at least have him in the top 5, but I think everyone who follows football would put him in the top 10.  So, think of this:  how many players who are one of the top 10 at their position *almost didn't get any college free agent offers*?  That's amazing.  And then, to suffer one of these non-contact ligament injuries and recover so quickly?  The Broncos underpaid for Mr. Harris Jr. - He is something really special.   Lotsa people arguing about looks and pretty and girl next door and what not.  But when she sings, "Two bottle of whiskey for the way.  And I sure would like some sweet company, and I'm leaving tomorrow, what'd'ya say?" I have only one question:  What.  Fucking. Train?   I'll look for it in earnest tomorrow.  Also, obviously Tebow was a rollercoaster for everyone involved.  You know we lost 7-3 against the Chiefs **at home** the week before various miracles won us that WC game?  That's just not a healthy way to live . . .   You ever see the article/gif explaining how something like 4 defensive players completely shit the bed on that play, simultaneously?  Was hilarious.  Go Tebow.  Edit:  Oh, and Bubby Brister can't field a shotgun snap in the playoffs, bit he's good enough to backup Elway.  Edit 2:  But not good enough to beat out Brian Griese for a job.   So hard.   AFC West plays AFC North next year.  So he's at least good for a 90-yard run against the Steelers.   Good luck, buddy. I would seriously consider switching fandom if my team picked him #1.   If I walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, would you call it a duck?  Similar thing going on here.  Some people are very willing to call "duck", and some think there isn't enough information available.   Here's a game:  I'll set the Over/Under on Career Playoff wins for Manziel at 0.5.  Whatcha want?   Elway is so good.   I'm sure they'll have plenty more opportunities to look the other way.   Exactly!  You have to make sure you mispronounce it in some way which vaguely suggests that you are subconsciously harboring some deep-seeded racism.  We also would accept, "Scrong", "Stronk", and "Scarong".    Good work, this is how one answers a direct question.  Now go fuck yourself you dirty Patriot fan.   Almost all bitcoin mining today is done with ASICs built specifically to have a very high hashrate.  /r/bitcoinmining has a bunch of info here, but especially check out [the first entry in FAQ] (http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1e086p/faq1_can_i_mine_bitcoins_using_this_old_thing_i/)   Here's something that I am looking at for this game:  Red Zone efficiency.  The Seattle defense is at the top of many statistical categories, but one in which they are deficient is opponent touchdown percentage in red zone.  [Here] (http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/opponent-red-zone-scoring-pct) you can see that the Seahawks are 26th in the league here (granted, the Panthers are worse, but that isn't the point).  IF the Panthers can convert red zone opportunities into touchdowns, instead of field goals, they have a very good chance.  I mean, this is kind of one of those obvious coach-speak cliches, but I bring it up because it seems to me that the greatest weakness of the Seattle Defense is in this portion of the field - so you need to take advantage of that to beat them.   I think I would put a lot of money on this game being closer than at least one game this weekend.  This is just someone looking at the point spread / records, glorifying the Seahawks (particularly their offense, which is situationally good, at best), and moving on to the other, more "interesting" games.     We're going to need some more of this come Saturday.  Here's an interesting question:  who has more rushing yards at the end of the game:  Stewart or Lynch?   I remember jumping out of my seat from that hit, scaring the shit out of the cat.     I've got the Carolina Panthers covered.  Since my wife is from Charlotte, and still has family there, we went to the game two years ago when the Broncos were in town (we planned on being there for the long Veteran's day weekend anyway, and completely lucked into the game being the same weekend).  So, it was me, in my Von Miller orange jersey, my wife in some normal Broncos shirt covered by her coat, and her father in normal, non-affiliated clothes.  We started off in a Broncos tailgate where the guys in charge were home-brewers and offered us tastes of all of their beers, which was awesome.  We got a little light razzing a couple of times outside of the stadium, but nothing too serious (this was the year before the Panthers won the division, and Cam was struggling).   Even once we sat down and the game started, everyone was really, really nice.  I was slightly obnoxious as Von sacked Cam 1-on-1 from a "spy" position, stuffed him for losses on QB-keepers, but no one really cared.  In fact, as Cam continued to struggle, there were many cries of, "Scam Newton!" and the like.  Overall, we ran away with the game, but nothing was ever heated at all.  I even high-fived a dude when De'angelo Williams scored a touchdown because we both had him in fantasy!  Very cool people.  My experience at this game, coupled with my recurring visits to Charlotte have led to my adoption of the Panthers as my NFC team.  Needless to say, I am a huge Panthers fan this weekend.  Obviously, should the Panthers meet the Broncos in the Superbowl, my allegiances will lie with our shade of blue.  But, there is no team I'd rather lose to more than the Panthers this year.     Ice Bowl will be on after that!   It  is on again next (right now is Cowboys vs Packers NFC Championship game before superbowl XXX)!     No need to buy it - just mine a bunch at the very beginning when you could mine on CPU/GPUs.  	105

    was responding from my phone while interacting with 'snooty people'... but, also, just how i interpreted your reply.  moving on, biochar isn't biocharcoal....   check out the Rice U study linked to at the bottom of the sidebar.  Biochar is, or should be at least, just 'char'... carbon.   the VOC's cooked out.    They're just two different things.  (bio)char is the structure... 'coal' is/are the VOC's intermixed within the structure of the 'char'.  you don't want these in there anyway.   higher temperatures 'cook' these out, increase the porosity of the char, activate the char to a greater extent, make the char stronger (weaker C-C bonds are broken and the carbon leaves with the rest of the gases) ... etc.  in the end, you end up with either a very porous material... that is virtually 'empty' and that needs to be 'charged' before application to the soil... ....or, some 'charcoal-like', much-less-porous, gob of lower quality char that .... is still very unlikely to catch on fire... ...but, contains enough VOCs to 'repel' nutrients, microbes, fungi, and plant roots away from it until it eventually breaks down.  Still don't think it'd catch on fire.  That thought relative to it just implies to me that you should maybe to a little more reading up on it before trying to use it.    That said, to answer your question... 'to not *burn*'? ... probably as much as you want.   but, for proper growth? ... you don't really want to exceed 33%.  Some were going as high as 50% biochar... or, mixing biochar with compost 50% per volume ... but, they'd (presumably) let it age for a while... giving the nutrients and microbes and such in the compost a change to 'load the char' before applying it to the soil or trying to grow in it.  but, from most of my reading ... and in my experience... 33% is really the most you'd really want to apply... and, positive results can be seen at below 5%.   i.m.o.   10-25% is the sweet spot.  the longer you have to let it 'age' mixed in with compost, the higher you can go.  but, I'd imagine you'd have to work pretty hard to get it to *burn* ... after the initial cool-down period during the char production anyway.   ...and I might've heard a rumor that biochar isn't charcoal... hence the lack of the word 'coal' in its name.  You may want to read the Wikipedia on it...link in the sidebar   if you're going for that size, [biochar kilns](http://bestbiocharkiln.com/) are probably your best route ... over 55 gallon drums.

I've made probably 15 different barrel things over the years and... they're just a hassle when it's said   done.  but that's just my opinion.    For starters, ash and biochar are two totally different things.   separately, you can definitely use too much ash.. it'll throw off the pH of your soil.   but, I've been able to add pretty liberal amounts to compost piles that I'm in no rush to use any time soon and... i tall work out alright.   but, honestly, there are 'better' ways to get minerals into your compost/soil than ash.     why would it catch fire??                                 ^#4's ^probably ^the ^funniest                                                   x-post: /r/drought                                                                        and, in contrast...

 Some questions you need to ask yourself:  * Is there anything your employer could do for you to convince you to stay? More money? More time off? A promotion? * Can you survive on your husband's salary for an extended period of time? * If you quit, what kind of job would you look to get?  Either way, you probably need a break. I've had jobs that made me physically sick to come to work in the morning. That's not good for anyone.      Why would you be sad? IO had the second highest opening weekend of any Pixar movie and, when all is said and done, will likely be the second highest domestic gross after Toy Story 3.   It's a fine movie. A lot of people went to see it and it made a lot of money.   It just ran into the JW buzzsaw. No way you could plan for that.   If there's anything we NY Mets fans know about, it's suffering and sadness.   97% of the K-3 teaching staff in the United States are women. If there was an important job that was gender skewed the other way, people would be out in the streets with torches and pitchforks.    I'm not a fan of the TPP, but realize that all he's done is get authority to negotiate an agreement and get an up or down vote from Congress. We don't know what's in the agreement because there is no agreement. It's still being negotiated.    All we've got so far is a bunch of leaked bits and pieces of various proposed parts of it from people who, quite frankly, have their own agendas.   For me, there's no discussion technology that can beat mid to late 90's Usenet.   I paid for a Usenet account because my company's feed was occasionally unreliable and it allowed me to comment without putting my institution in the header. Plus I could read at home and at work and mostly stay current by remembering where I left off.  I was working the overnights in those days, so I had plenty of time to waste.   Yeah, my account is only mid six digits. I read /. for some time before signing up for an account.   I still have it in my RSS feed because there are decent links posted and I can scroll through them quickly enough in Feedly, but I haven't commented there or even been interested in the comments in some time.   Just note, as an exempt employee, they still have to pay you if you run out of leave time.    Yes, something like this.   You like working where you are, but you felt it was time to move on because you wanted to advance in your career and take on new challenges, but you were blocked by your boss, so you had to seek an opportunity outside the company.  Tell them you have an offer on the table with a raise and a promotion, but now that you found your boss will be leaving, you're interested in his job.   I wouldn't pussyfoot around. Walk right into your boss's boss's office and lay it on the table. You're under time pressure and you need an answer ASAP.  Some things to consider:  1) You're going to have to replace yourself if you take your boss's job. If it's hard to find good workers where you are, this may end up being an issue going forward.  2) You may burn bridges with the company whose offer you're turning down.   3) There may be resentment from your current company. This is not unusual when people get counter-offers to stay in their current job. Since you're hoping to be promoted to be able to stay, it may be less of an issue.  Good luck.   In the US, a company can make whatever rules they like for sick/vacation time.   How big is the company. They may not be able to move fast enough to give you the job before your new job starts.  Also, this kind of ultimatum often ends badly.   Short answer, yes.  Get your resume together and start sending it out.   Tank is out of the basement now.  http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/kiel-schwierige-bergung-eines-weltkriegspanzers-a-1041834.html   Alternate title: German Government Steals Old Man's Tank   You're The Worst. It's almost an anti-romcom.   And if you like that, try Catastrophe, currently on Amazon Prime Video.   Well, maybe that's how you see it, but that's certainly not clear from the rule's origin. Here's the comic from whence the Bechdel test springs  http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Rule-cleaned-up.jpg  The woman who explains the rule in this comic says it's rule that she won't go see a movie unless it passes this test. That has nothing to do with statistical analysis. It seems like a pretty hard and fast definition of the bar a movie has to pass to be acceptable to her to watch it.           A lot of people who shouldn't be exempt will be moved to hourly positions, perhaps with a pay cut to cover some of the OT.   Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. That's $15K/year. It's ridiculous that there are people making $24K as an exempt employee.   If retailers are relying on exempt employees to do that much of their work, stocking shelves or ringing up customers, then they're already in violation of the FLSA.   Exempt employees are supposed to spend the lion's share of their work day performing managerial duties. If they're mostly doing the same work as clerks or cashiers or cleaners or other associates, with only a few managerial duties,  then they're not eligible to be exempt from from overtime rules.   By the way, here's the fact sheet with the proposed rule changes.  http://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/NPRM2015/factsheet.htm  The proposal is to set the new exempt minimum at the 40th percentile of weekly wages and index it yearly. Right now that would be $921 per week, or $47,892 annually.  I expect a lot of lower-level exempt employees will be converted to hourly. A lot of these employees are probably not really qualified to be exempt anyway, based on the duties test. They're just given sham manager titles, even though most of their work is the same work done by hourly workers.    Right.   Assuming this rule goes into effect, if you make $40,000 a year now and are exempt, next year your company will either have to convert you to hourly (OT eligible) or raise your pay.      No, that's not how it works.  Your employer has to decide whether to classify you as hourly or exempt. If they want to classify you as exempt, they they have to meet a bunch of criteria based on your job duties and also pay you at least the minimum salary for an exempt worker.   If you're an hourly worker, you must get paid for every hour you work at your hourly rate up to 40 hours per week and 1.5 times your hourly rate for all time worked over 40 hours. This is true no matter how much you work and how much you earn. I'm an hourly worker and I make much more than the current or proposed exempt minimum.  Your employer can't cap your pay by switching you to exempt if you make more than the exempt minimum by working OT. If you're hourly, you must be paid hourly. If they want to switch you to exempt status, they have to reclassify your job and treat you as exempt from that point on, no matter how much you work. They can't switch you back and forth willy nilly.  Edit: My first gilding! Thank you, kind sir.   The short answer is yes.   You can make a lot more money as an hourly worker working a lot of OT than an exempt worker who makes a higher base wage but works a lot of unpaid OT. A lot of employers classify their workers as exempt for this very reason.   Are there people who don't like this movie?  A lot of Bay's and Cage's work over the years has been...not good, but this film is pretty much a perfect exemplar of their particular strengths. Just a fun action flick with snappy dialogue, good humor and some very nice action set pieces before the availability of CGI ruined everything.    To be eligible to be exempt from overtime rules, your job must fit into one of the categories of jobs that are exempt from overtime. Moreover, most of your work time must be spent doing those duties. You can't just call someone a manager, for example, and have them spend most of their day stocking shelves, ringing up customers and doing inventory and then classify them as exempt.   As a journalist, you might fit into the creative professional exemption. There's actually some case law directly on point here. Here's a DOL paper about journalists.  http://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/fs17q_journalists.pdf  Relying upon federal case law, the final regulations clarify that employees of newspapers, magazines, television and other media are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect, organize and record information that is routine or already public, or if they do not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product.    On top of this, you must be paid a minimum salary to qualify as and exempt employee. The current minimum is $455 a week, which has not gone up since 2004. The proposal sets the new exempt minimum at $970 per week. You must still have a job that qualifies for the exemption.    They're probably doing the old fake cashier's check scam. Craigslist is a haven for that sort of thing.  They will ask you to buy something on your credit card and send you a certified check for the amount plus your salary. Then a couple weeks later, your bank will find out the check is fake and demand the money back. Your employer has the items and you're left huge debt and possible criminal charges.   No, it's still a federal holiday.  As a private company, they can choose to observe it or not, but don't pretend like they're not screwing their employees out of a day off.   You managed to squeeze seven for Jonathan Strange.   It's a really fun show. Great romantic chemistry between the two leads combined with some seriously vulgar comedy.  Some caveats:  *  Amazon Prime Video's interface is shit.  *  Six episodes seems way too short for the amount of story they want to get through. It all seems very rushed and there's no time for the story to slow down so the characters can breathe a bit. *  The tone is very inconsistent. For a lot of scenes, I'm never quite sure whether it's supposed to be funny or serious or disturbing or what.  Still, it's a great show and well worth watching. Plus, it's only six episodes. You can fit that into a boring, rainy afternoon.    If she was making less than 16,200, she'd qualify.  That's a bit more than minimum wage/full time.

My brother transferred her cell phone service to his account and it preserved her outgoing voicemail message.  For a few years afterward I'd hear my Mom's voice when I called him and he didn't pick up. It was weird and creepy, but it was also nice to still hear her voice every once in a while.  The message got cleared a while ago and I miss being able to hear it.  Fuck.   I saw this movie in the theater. I liked it a lot back then. Don't know if it would hold up for a re-watch.   You sure you know how to handle that thing? Yeah, I was on the machine gun club in High School.      Got my purple guy today. Wasn't sure about the purple, but it's really rather attractive.

I wouldn't worry too much about it. Your boss came to you and asked if you were going to apply and smiled when you said yes. Sounds like you're the one he wants to hire.   You can certainly ask him about it. He'll tell you if he's not allowed to say. Something along the lines of,"Can you tell me a little about how the interview process works? What kinds of questions do you usually ask?".   A lot of times, these temp-to-hire interviews are mostly for formality.   Good luck!   English doesn't just borrow from other languages. English follows other languages down dark alleys, knocks them over, and rummages through their pockets for loose grammar.    **AVC:** You must have some Oliver Reed stories.   **DR:** He was a man who liked his booze.   And Chevy wanted to use it as a jingle to sell cars. Did they not read the lyrics?   They often cut stuff out of the versions they show in the US, either for time/commercials or S P reasons.   Second half of the first season was much better than the first.    Most people who do hiring aren't stupid. If they see an abrupt resignation in you job history, they're going to ask why. And when they call to check on your references, they'll simply ask if you're eligible for re-hire, which you aren't.  Resigning instead of being fired doesn't do much for you in this instance, unfortunately. If you're fires, you still may be able to collect unemployment.      I'm interested in this subject, so I've read up on it, but I'm a layman. If you're really interested in pursuing this you should speak with an employment lawyer and a tax professional to see what the upside/downside might be for you.  Good luck.   Just to be clear, there's no law that says a 1099 workers should be paid more than a w2 worker for the same work. It's just a general business guideline. An employer is free to pay an independent contractor whatever rate is agreed upon.  On the other hand, if you have been improperly classified as a 1099 worker, the IRS can reach back quite a ways to sanction your employer. The only real benefits for you would be a possible rebate of self-employment tax that you paid to the IRS in those years as well as eligibility for unemployment insurance.  http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses- -Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee   First of all, are you really an independent contractor? When you get your paycheck, are income and social security taxes taken out? If so, then you are an employee. If not, then you are an independent contractor.  If it's the latter and you really are a 1099 independent contractor, then you are responsible for paying your own income and FICA/Medicare taxes. You are also responsible for paying the employer's portion of FICA/Medicare. Hopefully you are saving money to pay those taxes.  If you actually are a 1099 contractor, your boss should be paying you extra to make of for the extra tax you have to cover, not to mention not having unemployment or other worker benefits.  The IRS has rules as to who can be classified as an independent contractor. Based on your description of your job duties, you probably should be a w2 employee. You can file a complaint with the IRS and they can make your employer classify you as a w2 worker retroactively.   Either way, your boss has to pay you for all the time you work,  whether it's at home or at the office or wherever.  She has to pay you time and a half for hours over 40 in a week. The only way she can get out of this is to designate you as Exempt. The IRS has some very strict rules for who can be designated as exempt. At the very minimum you must be paid at least $455 a week to qualify.  Realistically, you're probably better off looking for a new job at this point instead of trying top whip your boss into shape.   It's interesting to think about the counterfactuals, but I doubt Al Smith could or would have much of a difference had he been elected president.  In fact, if Smith were elected in '28, we'd almost certainly have had a Republican elected to the Whitehouse in '32, which probably would have been a huge disaster.   Yes, Hoover was far from the worst president. There are easily a dozen worse you could name without too much effort.   Just create an LLC and transfer domain ownership to it. Put the LLC information in the Whois info.  If you run a website of any significant size, you should probably consider doing this anyway.   There was a biographical movie made about Von Braun called "I Aim At The Stars" that came out in 1960.  Mort Sahl suggested the subtitle should be "But sometimes I hit London."    No, this is horseshit that Southern Pride people tell themselves.  Go read the articles of secession.  http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html  Here's Georgia's  For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.   The Confederate States clearly lay out why they are seceding and, in the main, that reason is slavery. Read the actual, historical documents, not the crap southern apologists spout.      We work similar shifts here. 8AM-8PM/8PM-8AM, two on and two off. Luckily, management doesn't care how we rotate, as long as there are the proper number of asses in the seats.  I currently swap back and forth every two months with my opposite number. Some people work all days or all nights and some prefer switching on and off every eight days.  I've worked some version of this shift schedule for the last 26 years and it just seems normal to me now. I like the freedom of being off on weekdays so I can run errands and generally if I need a day for something specific I can swap with someone on the opposite shift.  I am pretty overweight, but I do sit in a chair all day/night.  When we switched to our new facility last year, there some discussion of moving to an 8 hour rotation, but none of us liked that idea very much and we would have had to hire more people.   Yeah, I was wondering if it was a mistake or if a lot of people just don't like purple.  I was ready to pull the trigger on a used one from eBay since some sellers are saying their phones are good with Ting now, but I figured I'd check the Ting shop one more time and there it was.  I'm down for one. I'll report back when it arrives.               That's why we need a space laser to shoot them down.         If this is not the first time they've done this, then it's probably time to get your resume together and start looking.  In you review, you can talk about your desire to move on from your current role and what the time table looks like for that from her perspective. See if you can get some firm commitment with respect to the time interval.  If your manager is someone you can be brutally honest with, then you might talk to her about the fact that if you're going to be blocked from an internal promotion for the foreseeable future, you might have to think about pursuing an external one.  Then the company would lose your services completely.   But a manager who blocks internal promotions is not likely to be the sort of person you can have that conversation with.  Sometimes you just have to move on if you want to move up, hard as that may be to do.      Which one is the real one? Seriously?  Reminds me of a story, which may be apocryphal. In 1985/86 DC Comics had their first, big crossover event, "Crisis On Infinite Earths". The objective of this event, besides selling a shit-ton of comics, was to get rid of all of the various "alternate universe" versions of heroes and villains and simplify some very complex continuity.   Near the end of the event, one of DC's editors got upset because a book was still being published, or planned to be published, in pre-Crisis continuity, with characters that had been eliminated in the Crisis event.   "He's writing about characters that don't exist!", said the editor.  Whereupon someone else turned to him and said, "Dude, none of these characters exist."   I finally got around to watching the show on Netflix a couple months back. I'll admit, the title put me off it for a while. Punny titles make me think "stupid sitcom".      Barristan was killed because his role, running Mereen after Dany flies off on Drogon, was taken by Tyrion/Varys.   Sansa is with the Boltons because her story in the books, hanging out in the Reach playing politics, is another pointless diversion and certainly not worth wasting screen time on. Putting her in Winterfell moves an interesting character to the heart of the action.   Jaime is in Dorne because someone had to go there and he needed a reason not to be in King's Landing. His Riverlands story was so compelling that I barely remember any of it.  Its seems to me that a lot of the complainers just don't seem to get the very specific limitations of a TV show versus a book. On TV you can't just keep adding more characters and more plot lines as Martin loves to do. There's only so much screen time and actors cost money. Similarly, you can't just sideline characters for an entire season because you have nothing interesting for them to do, Bran and Rickon not withstanding.  The problem is that books 4 and 5 are a narrative mess and punching them into shape so they could made into coherent television was a difficult task. I could see people being unhappy with the specific decisions of how to do this or that, but it's unarguable and difficult decisions had to be made.   Interesting. You know, I thought there would be more.   It seems like there aren't very many TV shows where the Star Of Morning was actually a regular character.   Any day now I'll be able to buy myself a real Tricorder.      It's in the hole! It's in the hole!            Execution, Execution, Execution, Execution, Execution... tough guy.    Yes, they do.   http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/hoursworked/screenER13.asp  After being hired, employers often require their employees to take certain tests as they begin employment or on a periodic basis during their employment, such as physical examinations, fingerprinting and drug testing. Whenever you impose special tests, requirements or conditions that your employee must meet, time he or she spends traveling to and from the tests, waiting for and undergoing these tests, or meeting the requirements is probably hours worked.   	84
 Sounds good. I will check those channels out. Thank you!   Okay. I was just hoping for a number of lbs to add at a time or a way to figure out how much is too much.

 Speech. Less.  (In a good, no, strike that, AMAZING way)   One strategy is to not waste attacks and get VP you don't need - pick and choose high loot bases to attack, and avoid NPC bases if possible (might not be possible at the start though). Another one is to attack everything all the time - you'll lose half of your loot to your bases being attacked, but this might be the more fun way to play the game.   And if you do join a Task Force, please for the love of Dog, join in and attack as frequently as possible. Nearly half of the people in my TF don't attack most ops, and get free loot (although some do contribute intel, so not entirely freeloaders)   I never seem to get Building Health statues, one bloody DBD after another   I don't think the pedestrian auto braking would have worked anyway if the driver had his foot on the accelerator (all of these auto braking systems allow the driver to override it if they choose to).

Ia!! Ia!!   The aromatics steam in pork fat for 5 hours.  It all turned out amazing!   The cheese and bell pepper were the only 'cheap' ingredients.  The ground pork and bacon is from a pasteur-raised, heirloom hog from a local farm.  The onion, garlic, and chiles are from my back yard...even my chipotle rub is made from garden chiles that I smoked and dried myself.  Thanks for looking!      I discover new stuff on bandcamp every day...I do find that on Spotify I tend to listen to the same shit over   over.   Deep Rising.   it's the Kirkland brand marinated artichoke hearts - I sautee them in a little oil from the jar.   I was stoked on it actually...the photo montage is mine.  I whip this up all the time now.  The trick is to get the pan super-hot so you get a nice sear on the chokes.  It's a 2 min recipe that's perfect for guests to snack on while you finish cooking the main dish!  \m/      I like the idea!   totally, and sounds like it was recorded deep in some dank cavern.

    It was when the car arrived on the flatbed behind the pits, the Merc's pit crew immediatly covered most of the wings before taking the car down   The Hollywood Blondes   *face. Oh god I fail at the title      http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2myqcv_20150416220252_fun  Itami Hideo's one from Wrestlemania   They earn more from USA though, so we won't be seeing RAW online anytime soon.   http://i.imgur.com/ME9usG8.png      ZZ and Bull Dempsey doing cardio together   At least 20 bucks   Paint them like TNA does with their belt?      Local distribution and info. As well as tech journalist can talk to AMD directly   Yes, as well as a dual GPU Fury X      Some pictures: http://imgur.com/a/atxbI      Read the article. It's a smaller configuration so that it fits thr formula e 3km length limit.   If you are going to an F1 weekend, visit their shops. They will be selling out of season items there as well. IIRC Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen's cap were selling at around $10 or $8 when I was at Sepang   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haxuZardUiI use this version   yep. they are not cheap, when in season. but once the season is out, you can get them as low as $10  If the team is doing clearance (Like McLaren clearing all of their Mercedes branded stuffs) it can go as low as $5   maybe a temporary one? I can't imagine they would want to add a permanent one when they already took out the old one      I forgot that the manufacturers can use their own next season. Hmm, that would be interesting. if Piquet can get a car that is really efficient in energy he will be streaking away at the front   Not that I am complaining, but at 2.8km and very little heavy braking zones, the cars would be running well below the 150kw power permitted for teh race to last the whole race.   Still an awesome hotlapping sim, but for physics wise I do still gravitate towards rFactor/rFactor2. Mak from Mak Modding Group summed it up http://www.virtualr.net/meet-simfunding-sim-racing-crowd-funding-platform#comment-1871850631      No. Thing is Vince TRIED to keep the WCW brand. WWE planned a WCW PPV a month after WM17, and they even wanted to take off Smackdown and put WCW in it's place, but nobody wanted to touch WCW with a 10 foot pole at the time. It does not matter who bought WCW at the end, it would have died   I disagree. Behind that "marketing" racing team, most likely lies a real racing team that works hard to win and have a passion for racing. For example Red Bull Racing is nothing more than Horner's own Arden Racing Team. Similar to Marussia, who is just the sponsor, the real team that runs the racing outfit is Manor. Sponsors comes and goes, but these people and team will remain, albeit in another name when the time comes.   "Forehead" view more like it. I wish they could put the camera lower but that's unlikely   IIRC didn't they let the drivers adjust the front wing once every lap in 2010?   Giving a meaningless belt to Jeff is better than WCW giving it's world title to an actor or ECW having Tazz win their belt while under contract with WWE and then having him buried by Triple H the next week   Cesaro looks like he unintentionally cosplayed as Lupin  http://i.imgur.com/t8VrvLJ.png   I am impressed at how many peoples are there. usually there are smaller crowds for house shows   Candy cotton   For Joe i think it's due to him having agreements to appear in indies and such up till August. Being in NXT means he can fulfil those dates without havimg to travel with thr maim roster      Push the Lucha Dragons and The Los Matadores. They would be awesome to watch just for pure wrestling   "HAHAHAHA!! YOKOZUNA NAMBA WAN!"   Apparently this is due to Hernandez has already left Lucha Underground  http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0625/596626/lucha-underground-news-status-of-hernandez-after-tna-appearance/   Basically as his body slows down, so does his theme?   I hope we can get back backstage brael where you can fight everywhere evrn in the kitchen    Sorry, I've been reading that as High Memory Bandwidth and just now I realised it was supposed to be the other way around    powered DP to Dual DVI adapter then?   I think it's due to the limited availability of the HMB and a rather tight schedule, meaning that AMD has a limited card to give out to reviewers this time.    Depends. The 980Ti has better overclocking potential (for now). I am waiting for AMD to let the users overclock the HMB, but I think it won't be allowed in the Fury X as of yet.   No matter what the number, any advertisement is good for GFW.    The search function is fucked up. there is no option to list according to date, instead it will list according to popularity and you're stuck at that   375w when overclocked, hence the extra 125w comes from I guess. For all intent and purposes if we are talking about a vanilla R9 Fury X then 275w is the tdp   wut   indeed. but it WILL make the episode more entertaining, which is a reason to watch   THe time they tried the gay storyline with Billy and Chuck    The rear view. OH MY GOD! NAOMI IS GOING TO GFW/TNA!   "What? What? What?"   "Balor spends a lot of years in Japan. Big deal. I spent a lot of years here, doesn't make me an American okay"  Oh god, this is gold   Are you using Wifi or LAN? sometimes Wifi can be iffy for streaming   Bullet Club/NJPW confirmed for next week   As bad as Dana Brook is, she's a whole lot better than most of the Tough Enough contestant   I wish that when Enzo and Cass goes to the main roster, someone print out the whole intro sign and make it longer than the NAO one   Even in that trainer hoodie Alexa still looks hot   Yes   If Dr Death had won, it would end at that. Butterbean was introduced specifically because Bart Gunn won that tournament.    Started with Trips Wrestlemania entrance correct? I think they are doing this in return for Arnold's appearance there   If he joins the Bullet Club it's more likely he's joining NJPW and then have a working relationship with ROH, than him joining ROH directly   Weird, still no patch on brake bias not really working during racing with cars that should be able to adjust them (Formula A, Endurance, etc)   It was. As did Shumacher's Ferrari. but when Ferrari/Red Bull focused on developing one car to maximise their potential, Mercedes split it down the middle, giving both drivers equal car throughout.   The "50p" line is NOT about old tyres, but flatspots.  Also "a dollar short and a day's late", and car handling like "a supermarket trolly"      ZZ = Bull Dempsey?   Is it just me or does Paige's ring gear hides her rather large assets?   Stay Tuned for me   Is it just me or does TNA not care that they are using the WWE HOF as part of THEIR storyline. I remember  Hogan giving his ring to Abyss in one episode as well   Yeah. his contract won't allow that   BRAD MADDOX?!   Trying not to be that guy, but mold and mould are two different things   With the interest in Lethal by WWE and Ric is under contract with WWE, the future should be fun         9874   As of right now there is nothing much that linux could offer me. My pc is stable as it is and i am comfortable. I also have an old laptop running crunchbang (ubuntu before this) and a few pi with raspbian that I use as an easy information board system.   I think the moment i just rather stay with windows was a few years back when I have am optimus based laptop and there was a problem with linux using the nvidia gpu and it always will use the Intel gpu instead no matter what I did     Maybe because I am old (nearing 32) that i am just too lazy to use Linux. Like people that uses OSX instead of Windows because it just works I use Windows instead of Linux because for me that's the easiest to use, especially after a long day of work.   Ironically i work im IT handling servers and network so i work with Unix almost daily.    There are times that it's just better to stick to Windows   Too much performance hit, and my Thrustmaster steering and Fanatec pedal won't work, and I am using triple monitor   Well, that leads us back to the first problem, all the racing games that utilised the SRW-S1 LED, or can utilise it are Windows based  Hence it's easier for me to just use Windows   Go naked and piss on top of our tallest mountain   SRW-S1. It has a DLL hook depending on the racing games I play that would light the LED up accordingly.    It works as a controller, but as I said, I modded it because I want to use the shift light indicator built into the steering and hence it still will only works for windows :/  thanks anyways.    I did say custom or special. The steering wheel will not work, especially for the thrustmaster steering base that the steering wheel can be swapped around as different steering have different buttons and functions   Fanatec's support say they have no reason to support Linux since most racing games are on Windows  and SteelSeries SRW-S1 works without any driver on Windows 8.1 but certainly not debian   I don't care about the lack of directX on linux. What bothers me (and stoppign me from using it) is the lack of drivers for custom or special controllers/peripherals  I have a steering wheel (thrustmaster), a seperate pedal system (Fanatec), and a modded shift light indicator (SteelSeries) and all of them would only work on Windows   http://i.imgur.com/l4uWZMf.png  Jean Elise    mika passing schummi using a backmarker at Spa  Kimi winning from 18th at Suzuka  hamilton's last gasp WDC in 2008   /s   2004 and 2005 was such a breath of fresh air during those years   rain makes painted line slipper and there were a lot of cases of cars spinning out on painted lines   I am planning to since most are looking like they would be falling apart. Will take time tho. There are hundreds of mags here.      I'm actually more impressed with Earl Bamber. He and Tandy was given most of the task to make sure the Porsche pulled out that lead during the night stint.   That turn 1 "extend" would definitely be frowned upon this season. But that awesome save into turn 2   There are some tracks (like Interlagos) which due to the flowing nature would mean the car would use up more energy that what it's harvesting. You could see this where in qualy they can't do two quick laps, instead a fast lap, a harvesting lap, and then another quick lap.    He was in the first ever RAW, and was in the match where 1-2-3 kid beats Razor Ramon   THe first thing that comes to mind was "Oh god, get a tripod son"   Whoa, and just last week there were people asking "Why can't F1 show more feeds?" or "Why can't F1 coverage be like MotoGP or WEC?" and today it's like "We're  cool, we know where to find this"   He's a glorified seller, not a flippy shit guy so I don't think going to LU would do anything. But he's a good midcard guy to keep and his merchandise is still a good seller so I don't see WWE releasing him anytime soon      Owens vs Brock  Owens vs Seth Rollins   Owens vs Roman Reigns   Owens vs Dean Ambrose   Owens vs Paige   Owens vs PTP    Pre Match Cena vs Bull Dempsey for the USA title that last 10 seconds   Harry Potter and The Spy That Came In From The Cold  Cold war espionage, with magic   Depends. The Chinese Market Lever for example could be done in various ways. Get the poison from the fish seller and poison the food that the guys loves to taste. Or go up to his shelter and wait patiently as he come and kill him. Or take the sniper rifle there and head shot him.  But my best kill is just to slam his car, and when he comes to investigate his alarm, blow it up.    Yep. I did that the first time   Following other cars and destroying tyres have been prevalent for years. It's only today with a lot more messages being aired that we think it's getting worse.   They should find something that negates the dirty air effect. Ground effect has been thrown around, but teams are not keen to go back on them.   One solution is to ditch wings altogether. Surely would make Raikkonen and Lauda happier   I think the worked shoot was well hidden at the time. Most if not all thought it was a legit storyline, where Punk actually did took the belt as his contract was up  Will take a long time till WWE can top that   Yep. I was surprised as well   I said the right "idea". The execution meanwhile...      With lyrics the song is actually good   They usually have quite a lot of working relationship with promotions that are not on national TV.   Russo had the right idea when he joined WCW to elevate the young talents and replace the old guards.  I just hate his crash style booking tho :/   All wrestlers have that "opening identity" that makes it easy for people to recognise who the wrestler is from just a few bars.  Most of Jim Johnston's music has this style. They range from a signature sound; Austin's glass shatter, Mick Foley's car crash, Undertaker's gong; or a signature line that is sung; The Rock, BA Billy Gunn, The Big Show; those songs were easy to identify and would always instantly make you recognise who is coming out   Owens vs Paige Wrestlemania confirmed   Also i think the reason why not just Wwe but most wrestling shows in general do not submit to be considered for an emmy because they feel like the EMMY is for a normal drama and not suited for a kayfaybe industry like theirs     Nice spot. I was busy wondering if I could disguise as the model on the catwalk when I watched the trailer   Petronas Green you mean   Luger?   I was expecting Doritos with that actually   MOD for L4D I think   Fucking mountain dew    Made me chuckle  http://i.imgur.com/mWMaAo0.png   12 hours difference (starts at 9am 17/06 here) and watching in the office. Twitch is a bit laggy tho   Depends as well. The curved screen gives quite the immersive experience I've read. And Depth of Field is not really something of a priority, since they are usually running a single car in simulation. If it was a race simulation with multiple cars, that would be something else            it's my cake day when I posted that to imgur :/  http://imgur.com/gallery/lTlbLiE      For a PPV, they hang out if there is a last minute change or something.   For RAW/Smackdown, they also have dark matches, WWE Main Event and WWE Superstars   Erick Rowan also starred in a Norwegian reality TV show IIRC. It was posted by another redditor here    In Sepang, there is a built in Petronas station at the back of the pit complex. Usually support races where they are running cars that have been minimally altered but FIA approved uses this facility.    Not feasible I should think. It would be much more logical to use the full motion rig with the real steering wheel in front of them than using VR  Also VR won't give them any advantage. It's slightly more laggier, as well as drivers don't even have much range of head movement in the cockpit in real life means there is no reason for them to use it   I think it was not even WWE that noticed it, but fans who were coming to Wrestlemania and bringing the "Streak" signs  	139
 Thanks! :)   Thanks! Keep practicing! It's frustrating at first but it really allows you to be way more forgiving of your art's natural flaws... Actually, just about all of my favorite work in the past few years was done with a right handed sketch and cleaned up with my left :)   Very cute! I'm sad there's no walrus and the carpenter, though :)   Great colors and angle!   * [This is a rat I did with my non-dominant hand](http://i.imgur.com/TQGsTCR.jpg)      * [This is an opossum I sketched and underpainted; my friend collaborated   finished the lines](http://i.imgur.com/YRoAmqm.jpg)      * [This is an armadillo I sketched a few days ago and my friend collaborated on the linework](http://i.imgur.com/da4XK6N.jpg)      I can't sleep so I've been doodling and waiting to post these, haha. This is my first sketchdaily!   I haven't really been drawing much lately, so it feels great to take it up again! Rodent like creatures are fun :3   Great pic! Your tumblr is stunning   These are amazing   This is amazing! Arya's my homework and Song of the Sea is such a beautiful movie, too.    RIP Beau Biden!   Well, I agree with you there. Honesty is important and I agree you 100% deserved the truth... Sadly, people do stupid things when they feel guilty about their stupid choices. I'm glad things are better post divorce, though! I think the best you can do is focus on your own happiness now :)   I would wait a couple more days and rather than text/call her saying you want to go on another date, text/call her and give more concrete plans and let her take the reins... For example "Hey, X, how does a road trip to the beach and having a picnic by the water sound? Friday at 8 work for you?"  or something to that tune depending on where you live and what y'all find to be fun and appropriate.   You wrote this like a beat poet.   I'm sorry for the salt in the wound, but all in all it sounds like it was all for the best. Not everyone is the same; not everyone is capable of monogamy and it seems like you and your ex were fundamentally different. Was it wrong for her to not tell you her true intent? Yes. Can you blame her, though? That's a tough pill to swallow and it sounds like you and she will live a happier life doing your own thing. I honestly just hope for the best for your daughter and that she doesn't get introduced to a rotating door of weird partners via your wife and her new man.    Also, get checked for STD's like everyone else has said.   Wow holy shit are you living my exact life? I have fought tooth and nail with my bf about his psycho ex contacting him with inappropriate stuff and he can't understand why I want her gone. He also doesn't understand how him talking to her is just encouraging her negative behavior. Hugs, OP. I hope things go well!   Oh also I now have the imagine of the police blacking up a body after shooting it.  [Reminds me of this](http://i.imgur.com/LBwooNC.jpg)   The Wind in the Willows   Ahahaha, I am a part of the room mate dynamic and when they *asked me what I preferred*, I answered them honestly. That also included me stating that I was willing to move out myself.   Also, the girl JUST got out of a relationship where they were saying they loved each other. It's just... It feels odd.   Grackles are some tough motherfuckers. I've seen some really fucked up looking grackles just going about their day unfazed.   Reason A is directly linked to reason B...So, yes. If I didn't live with both of them, I'd be fine with visits and hearing the resulting porkfest. I just don't want to live with a couple; even if they're my friends.   True. Very good point. I thought I was okay with it but hearing them occupy the one bathroom for 45 minutes to fuck is kind of annoying... And then loudly fucking twice more, once while I'm trying to work from home is a little more than I bargained for, so I kind of just made the change of heart today.   Additionally, I don't find him relatable because we have very little shared interests and holding a conversation just feels forced. He is a great man and I love him as a room mate, but I could live without him without losing any sleep over it, that's all.   I've heard my room mates have plenty of sex. Just not with each other. I just don't like living with couples. Is there something wrong with having that preference even if the couple happens to be my friends?   Never issues. I've just never really felt compelled to converse with him. I don't find him relatable.    I live in a city with lots of options, so I'm sure it would be doable in short notice. I can always stay at my current apartment if they choose to move out.   Yeah. I'm going to take a day or so to think about a tactful and understandable way to approach it. I feel like I'm going to lose my friendship over this. I guess if that's the case, it was never really meant to be, though, eh?    That's the thing. I have lived with boyfriends before and have even had the "ideal" living situation where we kept separate rooms "just in case" and it has still gone up in flames. Though, I'm a very solitary person and enjoy my alone time and independence, so I may differ from them there. It's just hard to see myself in their shoes because I've been there (but always lived alone with a partner) and it was not fun.   Already on it. I'm honestly looking at places with them and on my own simultaneously, just in case. I'm leaning more and more towards an independent move at this point, though.   We've discussed it. It's a really weird conversation to have because they don't even know what to label their relationship yet. It's overall just kind of messy in my eyes and I've expressed my anxiety. I then felt incredibly guilty because a few of my coworkers at the bar (I work at a bar in addition to a full time desk job) seemed to think I was being unreasonable for feeling nervous/hesitant and told them I would live with them and get over it.... I am not over it.   It's hard to put my finger on it. I think mostly it feels like I'm hearing my brother and sister fucking each other if that makes sense. Beyond that, I just have never really liked the idea of living with a couple. Especially new couples. No matter how well we get along and how well we know each other,  it's still a new relationship and things could change for the worse.    nbsp;   Also, to be completely honest, I've never felt as comfortable hanging out with the guy alone without her there to facilitate the conversation so, meh.     The three of us all met when we moved into this apartment and have fortunately gotten along really well. The two of them have always seemed close but aside from my friends joking to me that they seem to have chemistry, nothing has really happened.     nbsp;    Somewhere over the last few weeks, they've started hooking up. Honestly, I'm not surprised at all by this and I think they would make a great couple, but what bothers me is the fact that we had intended to look for new apartments together as our lease ends in August. When they found out I knew, we had a chat and discussed options and both of them seemed surprised that I was hesitant to move into a new place with them.     nbsp;    Ive never found myself in a situation like this and I dont know if all three of us living together is the best idea. I could honestly live with it, but its not my preferred option. I mentioned to them that I would rather one of them live elsewhere but now, honestly, I think that the girl would just end up resenting me for breaking up "the group" or think I'm a tightass or something.     nbsp;    After a long talk with them and consulting some friends, I decided that maybe I was just being sensitive and that I should just suck it up and give it a shot. We all get along so well and we all know we like living together so it's possible it could work... But this is all uncharted waters for me and I'm having second thoughts. We looked at a new apartment today and we would have signed for it if the landlord hadn't found a more long term candidate and I'm honestly relieved. I can't help it, but hearing them fucking makes me incredibly uncomfortable and almost like a "prisoner" in my own home and a thirdwheel amongst my room mates. I feel incredible guilt that I'm reacting this way. I feel unreasonable and childish that I can't just nut up about it but I keep going back and forth between acceptance, anger, sadness and anxiety about my living situation.     nbsp;    **tl;dr**: I love my room mates of two years, but ever since they started hooking up (past few weeks) I no longer feel comfortable living in my apartment with them. Am I being unreasonable?   nbsp;  **UPDATE:** Thanks for all your help and advice, all! It means a lot to hear so many different opinions. I sent a text to my room mates that said: "Hey guys, I've been thinking about this and I think I need to give up the search. It's been great living with you both and I love you both but I just dont think I am ready to take on a new apartment. I probably am going to stay at the current place until I get my finances more in order. I think you two should continue to look for a place together, though."    nbsp;  Hopefully they'll be understanding and the next few months won't be super awkward...   Good luck! I'm not good at math but I think one person has good odds :)   Much respect to you for trying to take a literal route without being too overwhelming!    How did you answer his questions?   True, but I feel like so often if parents or support systems don't broach the subject appropriately when a child inquires, it can cause some  issues, complexes  or phobias.   He's a big guy I guess? Not huge or fat or anything. He works as the door guy at saloon.   Thanks!   Haha, hey Tom. The person stole the mask from Nick. I'm sure you'll hear about it tonight :)   Really? Around what time?   Thank you. I know it isn't much, but this mask means a lot to my friend. He was really upset about it.   I've played tug of war over a kiddie pool filled with baked beans... This kind of reminds me of that. It was pretty gross, but it was entertaining!   My friend is an artist who also works at saloon as the bouncer. He puts a lot of time, care and effort into making his costumes for Halloween as he works during that season as an extra. He was closing up saloon and foundry tonight around 12:45-12:55pm when someone stole his mask from the host stand at saloon. We are trying to locate the theif or at the very least, his mask he has worked hard on. If anyone sees any goons bragging about their find or sees anything on social media, please let me know. Thank you!!!      wow, wow, wow.   Jaguars... They already are. They like to eat hallucinogenic plants and trip balls.   Haha yes! I love how he asked for BREAD but you read BEARD.

OMG I totally talked to you at saloon like, two Sunday's ago! I was your waitress. GO YOU! I remember that you are such a beam of sunshine and now I understand why!!! Keep that kickass spirit.

 shhhhhhhh  We don't mention that   "Fuck me" as in stick your dinker inside of me  2nd "fuck me" is like a compliant. "Fuck me, what have I gotten into"   You have taken me on a wondrous journey.  And I hate you for it.    Is this like a real thing that is happening?      Thanks man      Oh lol, I'm a 12, but not interested in buying any at the moment. Thanks though!   Like 8-11.5  I don't know if theh have them anymore since this was like 3 days ago   That's weird. I don't know if I just unknowingly got them and deleted the eMails or what, but that is unfortunate.   Yeah, Southwest Florida. I don't have exact numbers but I remember my Dad's allergies being terrible here, so pollen is probably abundant.    *could* have done some truly heinous shit     On the Console version there is.   It rains a lot in my area in this time of the year, and I notice that after it is done raining, everything seems to have a yellow filer over it.  Why is this?   They're actually pretty different. Yeah, the silhouette resembles it, but most runners resemble each other. Also, there are a good bit of design changes.   Wide feet?   They only send one like once a month?   Yeah, the Bab low looks really weird with those   Which model are you referring to, the Bab?   #Bruh   I wrote that at 3 AM, didn't even realize.   #2real2fast   /r/nocontext   Not at all. You're just buying product in bulk for personal use. You like to have variety.   "A new day, a new bong," as my Grandfather would say.  	24
    Let us first make a functioning device from graphene first, before calling its competition in.   * [**Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction** by *William Callister*](http://www.amazon.com/Materials-Science-Engineering-An-Introduction/dp/0470556730)  * [**Structure-Property Relations (Crystal Chemistry of Non-Metallic Materials)** by *Robert Newnham*](http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Property-Relations-Chemistry-Non-Metallic-Materials/dp/3642500196)  * [**The Physics and Chemistry of Materials** by *Joel Gersten*](http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Chemistry-Materials-Joel-Gersten/dp/0471057940)   Very interesting stuff. Thanks a lot for posting this. For those interested I am [linking the original paper.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1250366)   The creep spent only 14 days in prison. A day more than that in prison for this young girl would be a gross travesty of justice.  Also, can't we redditors band together and raise money for her legal defense?   Also, it is worth noting that since 2010 Wisconsin has followed textbook GOP policies, while Minnesota has followed textbook progressive policies. Wisconsin is 44th in job creation, and has had sluggish economic growth with a budget deficit - while Minnesota's budgets are balanced, and has a booming economy.  Same stories are for NJ, Kansas and Louisiana.   Even after all these data points - I struggle to understand why any sane American can support the GOP's economic policies.      Randians please educate me - what is the whole deal about clean chits in India?   For the last few years, someone is accused of a crime, and then a few weeks later they get a clean chit. I thought you needed a prosecution, judiciary and all that stuff to determine guilt and innocence. Or are we just dealing in clean chits now?   Also, you can use authsmtp.psu.edu as your outgoing mail server, so all mails will be routed through Penn State, and no one has to see the "via gmail" tag.   Well, a quarter of the world's population still smoke.   Please robocall me - I can pm my number if they want - several pesky loans can go away that way.      But will it take good selfies?   And considering that he is also one of the senior most leaders of the same party that rules MP.   Didn't they call him Bekar patel?  	15
 Glad I viewed that on public transport!   Not quite, but Sports Direct are interested in buying out this particular store.   I don't think we do, but there's a store called Next that is infamous for its "sales". They actually put out entirely different stock than normal and say it's on offer, for some reason people go mental for this particular sale and queue up for hours before they open. It's like a mini Black Friday.   I think I heard somewhere that the products have to have been sold at the "was" price within the last 6 months. There are so many damn loopholes though I'm sure they'll get away with it, just like that DFS one.    I know of a store that has had a "sale" on for over 6 months now. People think they're making huge savings and it pisses me off so much cos the price has never actually been reduced.   In fact, does anyone know if this legal in the UK? I'd love for Trading Standards to stumble across this one.     Urge to nap beats this every time. Regret follows every time.    Hi everyone,  My name is Josh and am the current Vice President of Membership at Reading Speakers Club. The club is part of an international speaking organisation called Toastmasters International (NOT the guys in the red coats, don't worry) and we're always on the look out for new members who want to improve their public speaking/leadership skills in a safe, supportive environment.  I personally joined the club last year and I can't believe the progress that I've made in such a short time - 9 months ago I was on the verge of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but thanks to the confidence I gained at this club I'm now happier than ever. Its a very rare thing for a person to make permanent and genuine change in themselves, but every month I witness more and more people growing in confidence and becoming truly talented speakers at this club.  I just wanted to put the word out there that this club exists, as it is not always well publicised. Our next meeting is at 7:30pm, Monday 6th July at Salisbury Conservative Club (near Cemetery Junction).  Please feel free to come along as a guest and see if this club is for you. It's a great group of people who are all really fun, supportive and willing to go the extra mile to help you.   PM me for more details or visit the website https://www.toastmasters.org/    Fellow plane viewer here! Unfortunately I watched it on the way back from Australia and it made me want to book more travelling straight away, wish I'd seen it on the way out!   Got a one line email from head office saying "Good job" though. Worth it!    Two main reasons in this case. 1. This guy steals as a business and is a regular around my town, he'll head out with a list of requests and then sell them on to his buyers. 2. I was really fucking bored on that shift and I couldn't resist the adrenaline rush!   I stopped a shoplifter the other week and haven't stopped telling everyone about it, if I'd saved hundreds of kids you'd never heard the end of it.   I tend to get that with international students a lot who couldn't afford to do one at home. Always a bit of an awkward situation as somebody was convinced they'd spotted a tumour in their scan once and we got an angry phone call from their GP asking why we gave pictures out.   It was nothing more than a spot of hypochondria though!   Mission accepted, I will report back to you! RemindMe! One year "Are you big yet?"   Can confirm that we do this at Universities. However it's unlikely you'll be given much information about your brain, also there's no way we can tell how many neurons you'd have. Still, it's cool to have a picture :)  If by some crazy coincidence you're near Reading University in the UK, pm me and I'll set you up!   173lbs? Damn I wish so wasn't so lanky, I'd look great if my weight wasn't stretched over  4 miles of gangly limbs!   Read this as "human torch". I'm glad you're not a psychopath.  	16
