 "Kill Bill Siren" was awesome. These seriously make my week. You should do them for Better Call Saul!!! That subreddit would be extremely grateful.    crazy bastard   What I hoped for this post: something other than the obvious.    I didn't find this scene funny, but the fact that you did kills me.    Bill from Kill Bill. Not saying the five point palm exploding heart technique sucks....but he's a dude we have waited through TWO movies to see die. And he falls. On the grass. Cool.   Jump to Conclusions App.    There has to be some angle in this decision. Surely he's not ACTUALLY thinking he's above Rick's group and their decisions. He still carries the guilt of the people he left to die AND he knows he would be dead if it wasn't for Grimes and Co. So I'm thinking there's another angle that we just aren't seeing yet. Thoughts?   These are my new friends; the Van Buren Boys.    No dough....no show.   I seriously cant stop singing that song. "Arizona moon is shining"   "Great! You shot the invisible swordsman!"   Goodnight Ned.   Infamous is when you're more than famous. This guy El Guapo isnt just famous....he's INfamous.    Ha! My bad. I'm in.    I think he means that if you- SHUT UP!!   Tell us we will die like dogs.    Can I have your watch when you are dead?   I saw this movie as a kid and absolutely loved it. Watched again as an adult and still am drawn to quoting it and singing along. Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short are perfect in this movie. I don't see this movie mentioned very much, but I recommend it to ANYONE who hasn't seen it.    I gave you a downvote.    I think you'd be in serious trouble if this subreddit ever found out where you live.    Hahaha!! That is exactly what I was looking for. The Lost Boys is so damn good btw.    I wasn't referring to famously misquoted lines. But personal lines that you just misheard and said wrong for a time.       After going through OPs post history, I have concluded he is 12 years old and needs to find another site to be annoying on.    I think you overestimate redditors and their love for posting absolutely anything; even if they literally just read the same post.   Hollywood's best kept secret in transforming characters: glasses    Greg Kinnear. Every time. Always. Forever. Captain Amazing.    Because Andrew here is very interested in pursuing a career in the custodial arts.   What're you referring to exactly? I feel like the obvious answer is 'no' and maybe you just got unlucky and saw a bunch of slow-song trailers in a row.   	29
 I know that wind chill is used when it is cold and heat index when it is hot, but what determines when weather forecasters switch from one to the other?  Is it temperature, humidity, etc.?      It is an African Red Knob Sea Star      https://twitter.com/GordonRamsay01  1) You are an accompished chef, restaurateur, author, television personality and philanthropist, but what is your proudest accomplishment we do not know about?  2) You are fluent in profanity, I am sure you do not speak around your children like that, but are they aware of that side of you?  3) What chefs have inspired you?  4) What is the one thing you personally must have in your refrigerator/panty?  5) Can anybody make a scallop dish to your satisfaction?         Yesterday evening I left flowers on my girlfriend's from door, so that when she came home from bartending and she see them, which would hopefully put a smile on her face since we couldn't have our Valentine's day together.  After not hearing anything from her this morinng, I finally asked her if she saw them.  She responsed with, "You mean those were mine? They are on my roommate's dresser.  She thought she had a secret admirer."  Now we don't have the heart to tell her otherwise, but don't know what to do.  Input...    	8
 Exactly! I don't know how you can get a job at a bookstore without at least knowing Faulkner   "As I stand before you today, I can tell you why we shouldn't change minimum wage. You may think I'm a rich man. This is a lie. I work minimum wage like a lot of you. Pleas don't expect people to pay more, so we may feed and take care of our families. Please don't ask my employer to pay me more... It's not like he can afford it. Please don't make me a burden to other's. I should be thankful to have a job, right? Is that what I'm expected to say? My children should suffer for the mistakes a younger me made. Because that will make them work harder? Make them get jobs as soon as they can, so they won't focus on school and resent me later for not being able to provide? So they will be stuck in this never-ending cycle of poverty due to not having the support to get a higher education? Yes, this is the life I've always dreamed of. As a child, I dreamed of never having a set schedule, never getting to go to school functions, having to miss my children growing up due to having to work more and more to support them, not getting holidays with my family, being terrified of illness because I can't afford not to work. This is the American dream, right? But please, don't make my employers pay me a living wage... As if I deserve it after staying late, coming in early, and never calling in. What more do I do? I could easily be replaced. I am nothing. Is this what I deserve? Is this what we deserve? Most of us "leech" of the "working" while working more hours than normal. They see nothing more than my food stamp card. They don't know that I work more than I sleep. They don't see me. They don't see you... Just leeches. But remember please, don't ask for more pay. Your CEO doesn't have that kind of money. Stop being so selfish why don't you? It's not like you have the right to spend time with your loved ones."  A man who's job was threatened if he didn't give a speech against minimum wage, give his boss exactly what he wants yet doesn't expect.   Anyone who likes Jersey Shore/ Snooki, people who are obsessed with celebrity gossip, the willfully ignorant, intolerance, people who like Miley Cyrus... I could go on forever...   I walked into a Books-A-Million and asked where the Faulkner books were. The worker looked at me completely serious and asked who Faulkner was... I walked out. So, who knows what schools are having people read now!   Some times you have implantation bleeding a few weeks after the sex. Some girls confuse it for a period   I would say you would be suffering from PTSD. I'm sad to say, you might have to deal with this your whole life. A good support system is a great way to handle it. From your post it seems you have good communication with your current boyfriend, so he most likely understands. Try to talk about why you feel that way and work from the core out!   I think that only time can lead to feeling comfortable in a relationship if a partner has an... interesting sexual past. It's self preservation. Sadly, I think, still, people are judged so easily by what they chose to do in private. It's still that taboo subject. Maybe if we brought it more out in the open and stopped shaming it, people would be judged less because it takes the secret out of it. I'm not in favor of flaunting, but civil, mature conversations is one of the few ways we can overcome this.   The book that has stuck with my is Loose Girl: A Memoir of Promicuity by Kerri Cohen. It really makes you think about why people act the way they do, and not to judge people by their sexual history. I have to pick it up once a year and re-read it. Anytime I see some one (boy or girl) acting in a promiscuous way, I think of that book, and it reminds me that despite their actions, he/she is a person and deserves respect (reasonably) and might just need some one to be in their life consistently.   Thank you! I really don't know where I would be without them!   It's ok to be upset. As long as, it isn't affecting your relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for about 7 months, and I still call him by my exes name sometimes. It's because he spent time with said ex and needs to get used to having someone new in his life. Just remind yourself that she's his ex, and he loves you now! :)! Hope I could help!   My mom isn't a Harry Potter fan, but I always bonded with my step dad over it. After he passed away, she helped me organize a Harry Potter Marathon in his memory with close friends and then bought me the Wizarding Collection despite the high price. Now we are going to the Harry Potter theme park (my last vacation with my step dad), and she's taking my boyfriend with us for support in case I can't handle being there.  	11
 Don't tell me you're  16 year old, because if you were then I'd  get angry. A day old infant isn't depressed. You probably fell from grace around 7 years old. So if you are 16, you had angst for about 9 years. It will go away if you change your attitude about life - irony. Good luck.    Did the guy walking cause the accident? How come the other people aren't walking in the intersection and he is? Doesn't make sense.    That's the sad part OP. We have to suffer to the point of insanity, then one of two things happens: 1. You break and will never be the same. 2. You break and realize you need to become apathetic and figure out the sodomoty of life and play the game, take no prisoners.    If OP mentioned SpongeBob and the "son" has to ask why there is semi-naked people in public.  10th grade.    Koons?   loved the kid's  apathetic reactions. "I like hockey, and I don't know why", "I'm so happy right now I don't know why". Poor kids, growing with the social outcasts with the beta dad.   Green moose? I'm not the intended audience.    Makes way more sense if you watch from the beginning. I feel like that part was left out on purpose to not make him look like a huge dick. Clearly he knew exactly where he was going.   Why?   I'm not a fan of this message. Too many people work too much and dont spend time with family or kids or doing something they enjoy that's not work. What is the point of having all that money if I don't have time to spend it or enjoy time with my loved ones?   Mischievous Kiss in Tokyo. You'll thank me later.   Hey OP. This doesn't sound legal to me.  Is there some kind of legal  council? Try ombuds.    Don't be. Everything may not be okay, but you still got love.   You're the devil. : p     Did you know only 1% of the world is college educated? People don't want to think, if they think they will think about all the things they have to think about doing.  All they want to do is watch something to feel good about themselves, and so they give them what they want. I stopped watching TV in 2012, because once I realized my IQ went up, so did my standards. The laugh tracks infuriates me with such  passion, I get mad. I can no longer be near such a vicinity.    How ironic if it was the board game: Life.   Names Jorge.  19/m/US. I like asains and traveling. sometimes I read, I love music (understatement) and I enjoy learning languages.    There was this movie. All I remember  is people in a cage and a small human girl approaches  the cage and sees a little boy, the girl runs to tell her father and he comes back with a scanner and scans the boy. He's a robot, too.    What was step one again? I'm confused.    People don't fall asleep in less than half an hour?    I totally  agree with you, no one comes from the blank slate credit competent. However, I don't  agree on the "fuck ups" one enough can fuck your life up. E.x. 50 credit that you can't pay off.  And the traveling, it's  for the "miles" Again neophyte trying to figure shit out one 1% at a time.    You left everything  vauge. I'm just going to reply with a vauge answer. What ever your problem is, isn't the end of the wrold. No problem is. Cancer? Surivable. Frostbite?  Surivable.  Not being able to make friends? **NOT SURIVABLE** as humans we're  social creatures, buy an animal or get a job and hire escorts until you get confidence start meeting people who love you not for you but for who  you are. Best of luck, OP!   Maybe it was a perky female attendant that day? Men have fallen for worse.    As long as you're still willing to fight, you haven't lost yet. Failure is when you admit it. Keep working OP, I know it won't be easy, but you got to do it for your daughter.    Depends where you are in life. For me, I'm just starting. I use my credit to get free $$$. Welcome to America where they pay you to spend money. I got $40 in 1% rewards just buy using a credit card. I always pay in full. Post-college I'm getting a traveling card, and fly more often and get "miles"   **tl;dr Credit is only for people who can handle it wisely**    Why are you here if you already know?   How about a barista?   When I was 18 I got my first credit card. No job until I was 19. My credit score is better, why? because I started 7 months ago. Time is ticking you only have about 340 months to really enjoy life. Don't wait until month 200 to get one  Just don't get into debt. Have fun!   Nice headphones! I want to get the HiFiMan HE-400, but after I upgrade my car speakers ($400-1k) Same here! I'm going to apply for subway tomorrow. Good luck on your job search.    Hello,  My name is Jorge. I am a university student in CA. I'm going to travel to Japan this summer. I enjoy the culture and want to learn everything there is about Japan. I don't expect you to teach me anything, I'm already studying the language. I want to send gifts and receive gifts ( small items, but it's the thought that counts) I just want to make more Japanese friends. I plan on working in Japan after I graduate so I want to start now. You can either email me or snail mail me. my email is drummergeorge@aol.com     Take them to to the people who are starving. Offer them 10 potatoes for every head they bring to me.    Nice, nice. I play League. I used to have a gaming adiction, but it's mostly extinct now. Which headphones do you use?  I get out next month :( I work as a tutor as of now, btw. You like your job?    Vist /r/SuicideWatch if anything goes atrwy. I can answer your question, OP. I live life for romance. Everything I do in life is for the sake of love. To me happiness is being healthy and seeing a beautiful asain girl, I approach her flirt with her, let her know I want to bang the shit out of her and hopefully  not get rejected. I will always do things for love. e.x Work - love - better production   School - love - great time, fun memories. Home - love - cook, Clean house  I'm just in love with life. Oh as an aspiring psychologost, I highly  recommend you find love- whether platonic or promiscuous, you need love as an individual  in order to feel like living. If you're really desperate try an escort services and after the first experience  you'll fathom. Best of luck! (also worst come to shove, please be an organ donor)    This is the most easiest problem to fix. All you need is to learn to how socialize and boom. Read 48 laws of power, How to make and influence friends, and 7 high habits of successful  people. By the time you finish these books, I'd  say you wouldn't  be suicidal  by July 20th. Have fun, PM if anything confuses you.    Nope. I used to but not anymore. What are your interests anyways? Bang any girls yet? Future goals? Best memory last week? How is the weather in your State? Been to anything cool  over there?    Yeah,  my closest ones from 3rd grade. Out of all of us,  I  only went to university, one went to college and the other two didn't. They have no ambition, stay at home all day. I started seeing the gap several weeks ago, but I was in denial. I realized it yesterday  when I invited them to a party at my school, I drank a little but my friends were total losers. They didn't  want to do anything.  I wanted to approach women and I did- got rejected, twice- but they didn't want to do shit besides go home. Killed my buzz. Also, it was a built up from that, always telling me about "my debt" that I'm stupid for doing  all these awesome things. I work as a tutor as of now, I go to the gym, just cardio but am going to start lifting soon. I'm an audiophile, I spend 300+ on headphones, currently saving 1k to upgrade my car speakers. Love electronic/ambient music. I don't watch TV, I abhor the laugh track, makes me furious. The TV producer tells me I'm so stupid I don't know when to laugh, what a moron. Other interests? hmmm.. I love romance a lot. I dedicated my whole life to it( platonic or promiscuous ) I love helping people, that's why I'm going into therapy.  I volunteer at a orphanage to "save the children".As far as talking to people at school, I got rejected  four times last week, so now I'm here. See, i go for the 8s and 9s, those babys are hard to crack. I got a few after me, but I know my worth. Trying to bounce back though . I do meet people at my school, but I think reddit will just falciiate  my social circle ten fold.   You want to be Reddit friends? My name is Jorge, I'm the same age as you. I'm in CA though. What's up.    I'm a heterosexual male attending a Cal State. I just realized yesterday that my friends were losers. And am looking for other friendships as of now.   My interests: Learning Japanese (Going to Japan this summer) I know  a little french and fluent in Spanish and English. I love to read, travel and buy stuff online. I'm an audiophile; plan to practice therapy in 2017.     **tl;dr** **Looking for people who are great socializers.**   You deserved  it \s   So you're suicidal because a girl won't talk to you? Damn, you won't live to 20.    I break my phones w/o a case. I can never buy this phone, I just buy a external battery case phone. 10,000mAh keeps me happy.     But I don't want to be manipulative or anything  You're associating manipulation from a negative cognition. But did you know a positive connotation is referred to as: persuasion? People use each other all the time, for good or bad. Relationships are exactly that. Men get the sex, woman get the security form it. It's a give and take. (This might not make sense, depends on your level of apprehension)   Honestly, I don't think you would be able to handle it. You need to be angry or uncomfortable. Then you have passion to change. I got a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/PrXxF5k.jpg) for you OP. I can go on and on about the subject, but I just want to plant the seed and hopefully one day you'll transpire from it. Good luck!     I came up a with an analogy for you OP. Consider woman dogs. When you're little they all look strange and interesting. You want to touch them. When you have the courage to do so, some will be pleased with your touch and one day one will bite you. Now it may be an ER visit type or just a small bandage. You've been bitten OP. And you're in psychological pain. But that's the worst one. There is plenty of material on the internet to spot dogs (woman) and how to get them to wag their tail in your presence, but it's hard to find what works for you.    This used to happen to me. You just learn not to invest that much into it at first, since it's unpredictable. Hopefully, you'll learn from the mistake of being too attached real quick. Unrequited love is horrible. Hope you feel better, OP.   I went through something similar to what you went through OP, not as drastic but just as traumatic. When I was 17 I got hit by a car. I broke my neck-C-7- If it was one bone down-C-6- I would have been a quadriplegic. My mom wanted to go to court to sue the driver. But I couldn't. I told her if she did I wanted nothing to do with it. It was a moment of time where I didn't want to relive. I had my neck broken for fucks sake. I had to wear a neck brace for 3 months. Can you imagine being in high school for that duration? My friends were awesome about it, making fun of me- I liked it, it made it less threatening- but I still got looks and empathy from people. I just wanted it all to go away. I still keep the torn helmet from the crash to remind myself that life goes on. I'm not sure how old you are, but no one can force you to do anything, in the US-long as you're not incriminated. You can tell your therapist to eat shit, you're not talking. Sure, maybe the cops will be involved but so what? Plea the 5th. You don't have to say shit, if you don't want to. But don't repress that memory or else it will manifest from within. I was at peace with the accident, and so should you. Let it go, there is nothing you can do about it now. Just accept it happened and move on with your life. You're not going in that direction why look there? Keep moving forward. Good luck.   	45
 I can't really see the Greeks wanting to be that rude about the Canadians though.....   I bought some wood by the metric foot last week. Gloriously archaic :-)   Yup, this is kinda why I've never understood the hang up that people have over the licence fee. If you assume its a mandated tax (it isn't, but hey...) then it's some of the best value you'll ever see for that money.  Personally, I see no reason to pay for satellite or cable - I'm not a big TV watcher anyway and find that nearly everything I enjoy watching comes from the BBC anyway, so I don't see the point in paying for a much wider range of stuff I don't want to see anyway.  Check out Luther or The Escape Artist, both of which are excellent drama series. We're also enjoying The Paradise, which is a more traditional costume drama on its second series now.  There's also a convincing argument that Sherlock is worth the licence fee all on its own... :-)   Yup, regions that don't pay the licence fee watch ads to help fund more telly. I have no problem with this. Same with the BBC's web content, I believe.  But on home turf, its strictly non-commercial and this is how it should be. I hate ads and 150pa is a small price to pay to be shut of them.  Interestingly, most Sky subscribers pay 2-3x as much and still get ads on every channel's. This seems a much stranger situation to me...   Operation Ouch on CBBC is worth the license fee on its own...well so the kids tell me anyway ;-)   Not in Blighty it doesn't. Check your facts please.   I enjoy quality programming from the BBC and don't like to watch adverts.   I'm sure you can make a sustainable TV network without a license fee (note: it's not a tax) but it means watching 20 mins of ads per hour of TV. Oh, and still paying more than the license fee cost to a cable provider for the privilege to watch them.  Thanks, I'll stick with the Beeb.   What a bucket of bilge.   It would be easier to change the moon's orbit than to move the wife from Waitrose, I'm afraid.  Good queuers there too, BTW ;-)   Thank you. It's a strange thing, but if you asked them, I'm sure most customers would also be proud of it.   We Brits can be a strange bunch, but you can always spot us shaking our head at "5 queues for 5 tills" when travelling abroad. It just doesn't happen here...we'd automatically and without a single word being said, create a single master queue feeding all 5 tills in a fair and equal way.  Love it :-)   Fair point, but typically the frier cooks the food and neither serves it nor takes payment. He does however accept the initial verbal order ("two large haddock and a battered sausage please, mate") so he can be getting them in to cook while you're properly ordering and paying.  Most decent chippies have an order taker, a wrapper and a frier.   My local chip shop (Leeds, UK) has a very strict queuing system:  1. Enter shop. Place order with frier who starts cooking it immediately. 2. Walk straight to till, place order and pay 3. Walk to back of queue. 4. Wait. 5. You are served strictly in order and the best part is that while you're queuing you're food is being cooked, so you're not really being held up 6. Collect food and enjoy it.  Efficient, brutally fair, and all freshly cooked. I've been to many, many chip shops and found few that work like this. I've also found none that serve better food and cope with a lot of customers so efficiently. Shops that don't work like this actually make me stressed!  Queuing is culturally embedded in Britain and I'd have it no other way.   Give me back my fortress, you bastards!   I loved ad d (note username ;-) but my heart still lies with Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (way before the battle stuff) and, even earlier, the wonderful Dragon Warriors series. I enjoy fantasy because of these two wonderful series.  Not sure how much light they saw outside of blighty though.  Love em still :-)   As a parent of two (5 and 7), I still read to them every night. For the eldest, we mix it up between me reading to her, her reading to me and her reading by herself, but neither of us is quite ready for me to stop reading to her - after all, it's fun :)  Stephen Fry reads Harry Potter to us all when travelling in the car. Does this count?   Yup, and that's also why they don't take off planes noise to tail. If they did, following aircraft would hit turbulence caused by the previous take off... which may be very serious indeed.  Check "wake vortex" for more info.   Indeed. Although when you realise that you've left your phone, the first thing you do is....reach for your phone!  In my case, I'd been dropped at a hotel so ran inside and borrowed the concierge's phone to quickly call mine. It just rang out and I started to panic then looked out of the window to see the cabbie waving at me from the drop off area.  Shock news! Most people aren't arseholes! (Well, ones in the real world anyway ;-)   I left my phone in a London taxi. After realising I'd done so, I called the number and the friendly taxi driver drove back and returned it, earning himself a nice tip.  The end :)   Wireshark. Unquestionably the most useful tool in any IT admins tool bag.  Not free, but I'd rather use a Mac than be without ALTAP Salamander. Any two pane file explorer would be better than nothing though :-) A few people mentioned windirstat, but the functionality is baked right into AS so I never miss it :-)   Fair comment on 3 hour play, but on a 30 minute sitcom...?   The ideal format for a 30min TV programme is no bloody adverts at all!   It's really sad, but kinda inevitable, that the first and most earnestly discussed point of this thread is the cost of treatment. Coming from the UK, it seems /so/ strange that this should be so.  This is a really odd question, but what would have happened if you weren't insured? Would the medical system really have refused your son treatment because of something as silly as ability to fund?  Anyway, don't want to detract from your original post. Sincere wishes for a speedy recovery.   :-)   Rubbish!  A carefully, well reasoned argument there ;-)   Dunno, 30k miles a year, means you'll probably have done 1/2 a million by then.  The point is that cars kill kids. It's a shame, but it's the truth. Just at the point kids are at their most headstorng and at their least likely to listen to adults, we give them a 2 tonne killing machine and say "there you go, knock your socks off".  Kids think they are great drivers. They are not. They are rubbish. And they need this hammering into them. Realising that you are a rubbish driver is probably the one thing that will keep you alive long enough to stop being rubbish.   He's in high school. When he's got a dozen years and a few hundred thousand miles under his belt, I might revise my estimate.   Sorry, my friend, but he did noone a favour that day.  1. You were a rubbish driver 2. You were well over the speed limit 3. He effectively told you to "carry on, sonny"  This time you were lucky. Next time your inexperience might kill someone.   Cop FAIL.   Check the in car footage from Nando's and Hamilton's cars - it was a pretty dangerous move from both drivers and a reprimand was a fair penalty.  Tough luck on Webber that 3 in a year means an automatic penalty, but them's the rules and it's hard to argue with them (even though, personally, I thought it about the best part of the race :-/ )   you're a cunt if you only tip 10 percent  Or not from the US... Tipping 30 or 50% of the meal cost? Mental!   Couple of things to note:  1. I always start out writing a select statement that returns the rows that I want to modify, and then changing it to an update. Paranoia always wins :) 2. MySQL has a not well known startup flag that disables unqualified delete or update statements (i.e. where you've forgotten the "where" clause). Amusingly, it's "--i-am-a-dummy" :)  Otherwise, this made me spit my tea on my keyboard. Certainly, an IT guy's idea of horror - give me hairy monsters and vampires any day!   A "Glasgow Salad" aka chips :-)   I Am The Resurrection - The Stone Roses  Anything else and you're not thinking straight ;-)   My wife has had ITP for the last 3 1/2 years after she started bruising for no reason. Her platelet count dropped down to  10k when she was first admitted and bounced around for a couple of years, following her various treatments.  We've managed to avoid any serious interventions (it's /always/ possible to drag your feet instead of going under the knife!) so it's really been an inconvenience rather than a serious illness. As her doctor said to her: "You're ill, not dying."  For the last 12 months she's stayed above 30k unaided and has managed to avoid any trips to hospital for IVIG and, even better, she's just started mountain biking again (with a helmet!)  Best of luck to you and, from my experience as a partner of a sufferer, please remember not to let it own your life - even if it never goes away, you can live a more or less normal llife. Oh, and don't be too quick to have bits chopped out ;-)  Hope the financial aspect is OK for you. We're UK based, so at least we don't get a bill at the end of each month!   Considering offering your seat on the underground to a "pregnant" woman?  Remember: It's always better to see a pregnant woman stand than a fat girl cry...  	33
 Pretty similar wr group in a 16 teamer, except I have Fitz instead of Cruz. I actually got Marshall and Blackmon in trade. I ended up trading Moreno Steve Smith and Broyles for those 2 plus Jerome Simpson. I feel like the trade worked out well for both sides.    I think it could be a misprint. Ian rappaport, on twitter, is saying that he's getting an mri on his foot. Either way we still have to wait for more info.    Which the week the giants come off their bye :)   If someone has the luxury to drop a lot of cash on fantasy football then he doesn't have much to bitch about.    Update on the situation: https://twitter.com/ConorTOrr/status/388765847554383872  From rotoworld: "That's not the way it was presented to me," Coughlin said. The Giants' coach gave a "vague timeline" on Wilson's return at 3-4 weeks, although none of this really matters until Wilson gets a second opinion on his neck during Monday's visit with specialist Dr. Robert Watkins. Wilson owners should still fear the worst, but keep Wilson rostered until the Watkins results are known   I wouldn't say RB2 just yet.  This was the first game that the giants oline looked competent but that could just be a result of the bears defense being incompetent.  Also Andre Brown should be back from his injury after the giants bye.    Dude get over it.  It is just fantasy football, this on the other hand is a pretty serious and career threatening diagnosis.  Show some empathy.      Has the Bears run defense been this mediocre this year?   Shocking the VP of Officiating defends the decision by the officials.   Didn't Cruz benefit from this rule 2 years ago as well? I think it was against the cardinals.   And Randle is soooo stupid.   Lets hope.   This is my internal dilemma.  As much as I love technology, I know whatever I decide to buy will just promote a business model that includes exploiting another human being.  The only way to stop this is to just not buy from companies who are complicit in this type of behavior. And that is why I've started to purchase second hand items.  It doesn't directly support firms who allow for these awful working conditions, I end up buying the product  at a cheaper price, and I'm not being completely wasteful and adding demand for a new product that really isn't that much different than the one that came before it.    Also is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of companies that force their workers to work in such awful conditions? Is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of the companies that do the exact opposite and pay their employees respectable wages or even living wages for producing all these consumer goods?  EDIT: And this is why I also don't necessarily bitch about prices on products.  There is a limit I am willing to spend on something but bitching about prices is just silly.  The price of a product is a derivative of its cost and demand.  If I want to buy something new that is cheap it most likely means that the cost of labor associated to it is cheap, which in turn means that person or people who created this product are most likely not being paid a sufficient amount to make the item.

The manga has great extensive character development on Kanae, Akari and Risa. IMO the novel has a better depiction of adult Takaki than the manga and the movie.  [In the novel adult Takaki wasn't that hung up on Akari, some memories and feelings would pop up but he didn't hold on to them like he did in the manga and the movie. He even admitted to falling in love with other women. But being heart broken at such an early age seemed to have left a lasting mark on him which led to him giving up on relationships when things get tough.](/spoiler)   It had a happy ending but what stuck out the most was the sad part. The scene where Asuna was running on the shallow river really got to me.   [] (/s "You've got to keep in mind how old they were and their situation. They were just thirteen, dealing with such strong emotions at such a young age could make one apprehensive and scared. Add the fact that they were about to move away from each other which makes expressing their feelings even more difficult. I think most adults would have trouble with the same situation.")  [] (/s "As for keeping in touch, they did try but the letters/texts were just not enough. The manga went over this really well, they both just shied away from the difficulties the distance provided. It's hard to expect two teenagers to try their best to make a long distance relationship work.")   I rewatched it a couple of days ago and I had to close that youtube link only a few seconds in.   http://i.imgur.com/m6dzIUl.gif   I recommend reading the manga also. Perhaps read it prior to rewatching the movie. The manga has added dialogue and scenes that does a great job of developing the characters better than the movie which also makes it all the more depressing.

 I've posted this before, but here it is again:  I once did a "job shadow" (learn about other jobs at our company) for this very odd girl from the mail room. The first day, she works into conversation that 1 out of 3 women has had an abortion. Then she points down my cubie aisle and says: "So 2 of the people on this row have had abortions." Not even trying to be quiet about it. I look at her, astounded, and she leans in close and whispers "2 of them were me, though..." Then pulls back and I must had had a very confounded expression on my face because she goes, "I've had 2."  So that was Day 1.  Day 2 she comes in and let's me know she wont be there the next morning because she has a doctor's appointment. I say "ok." Most people would leave it at that but of course that's not gonna happen. She says "You know, my yearly?" I am a woman so I said "Yes, I know." She then proceeds to spread her legs, squat down a few inches, point up to her crotch and say "It's for down there." She didn't come back the next day, thank God, but just knowing she's still down in the mailroom, creeping up everybody's day makes me sad.   AND?   Breakfast burrito.   "Moving Day!"   Please say yes.   Cool thanks! I hope it's neat, we want to go this year.   Jesus - that was brutal! Thanks for sharing!   Link?   I also don't know who OAG is.   Ahh says the video is private.

She didn't sue McDonalds for punitive damages, she sued for coverage of her medical bills. The judge awarded punitive damages.   Do you work for McDonalds?   A smear campaign that clearly worked.   Sorry - edited.   Actually I think that woman is dead now.   Exactly.   Keep it mind, this is what McDonalds and other corporations WANT you to think. They want people to find civil lawsuits ridiculous and to shame those who sue, because in the end it can not only discourage people from suing, but also affect tort law in America.   It caused extreme third degree burns. It was definitely too hot. It's coffee; yes, it should be hot - not scalding.    Most people don't know or don't care about the whole story. She really did have terrible, horrible burns. She asked for her medical bills to be paid and actually settled for much less than the jury originally awarded, if I remember right.  We must be very careful with Tort Reform.

It's the only one that I still think about occasionally.   I saw it moving through the shaft of light on the staircase. I wish it was a WA because if it had been, then that means a Doctor would have been there to save us.   Yeah, someone suggested making longer stories into a series but when I found out I had to post it on three separate days, I bailed on that idea. If you want to know what it was like to be there, you have to read it all at once.    I couldn't say - we drove there from Chicago. If I had to make a guess I based on the landscape I remember, I would say Western PA.   I don't know where in PA I was - I was 12 at the time.    Yeah, as below, the camera stayed in the church. I really would go back if I knew where to go. There were pictures of Jamie on there.   I have no idea where it is/was. I was a kid at the time and my mom doesn't think she's ever been there.   Yes I can. They were mostly triangular, like triangles within and overlapping other triangles, if that makes sense.   I wish I knew. My mom is convinced she was never there and I was a kid at the time so vital information like this has slipped away.    I don't even know what to say to this except that I am embarrassingly flattered.   Who fans unite   Thank you!   Yeah I didn't know about that rule. I have discontinued it as a series and posted the entire story here instead.    When I was a kid my dad traveled a lot for work. Back then, his company was growing exponentially and my father was sent to oversee the opening of new stores all across the country. In 2002, he had a particularly busy year. My dad was assigned to a store in Pennsylvania and, because it was a longer assignment and because it was summertime as well, he decided to take my mom and I with him.     Since we were going to be there for two months, they gave us a fully furnished house in the suburbs. It was two stories tall and at the end of a very lonely cul-de-sac. The town itself was very small, with a little over 3,000 residents, and the suburb where we stayed was even more rural.     Our neighborhood was relatively new, and most of the houses were still empty. The housing development, Lone Wood, had only just started cutting into the dense forest that surrounded it and all the empty houses gave it a very eerie, albeit boring, feel.    Lucky for me, there were a few other kids who lived in Lone Wood and one of them happened to be my age. Jamie and I were both 12 and really that was all we needed to have in common.    We had a lot of fun that summer. Being a city kid, I was eager to explore all the bike trails local kids had made out in the woods. The city of Middlesbrough was a very old town which was incorporated sometime in the early 1800s. The town had tons of history, but nothing really to do. One particularly boring Sunday, Jamie and I even went to the towns museum.    It was pretty boring, as expected, until we heard some kid ask an employee about the lost town. The employee replied that that was just a legend, but that was enough to pique my curiosity.   I quizzed Jamie about it but he didnt seem to know much either. It was a full five weeks into the summer before I finally got my questions answered.   Jamie and I were building a bike ramp over a narrow stream late one afternoon when we saw a group of five teenagers boisterously heading out into the woods. They were carrying flashlights and beer, several of them trying to scare the girls of  the group into turning back.   I wonder where theyre going. I mused as I glanced over at Jamie. He stood up and wiped his brow.    I know where theyre going.   Where? I stood up and dusted the dirt off my shorts. The novelty of living in a small town had weeks ago given way to boredom and I jumped on anything that sounded remotely interesting.     Theyre looking for the Lost Town. He sighed regretfully.   Okay, seriously, what is that? I knew you know more than you let on. I need to know Jamie, I need to know! I shook his shoulders in mock hysteria and he stumbled for balance.   Alright! Ill tell you, geez, Katie! Jamie picked up his bike and started walking down the bike path. I grabbed mine and followed him.  The Lost Town is just a dumb legend.  The stories say that Middlesbrough had a sister city nearby, somewhere out in these woods. Then one day, like a century and a half ago, the whole town just disappeared. The people left or died, nobody knows, nobody even remembers the name of the town. Its like a right of passage or something for kids to go looking for it.   "Jamie we should-   No! He stopped and turned to look at me. Some kid went looking for it in the 70s and never came back. They found his body like ten years later in the middle of nowhere. He got lost out there. Its easy to do, everything looks the same.   He was a total idiot! Probably on drugs, it was 70s. We are a totally different generation - we have satnav!  Satnav? He looked at me curiously. Jamie had lived in this  town his whole life and sometimes I forgot how sheltered he was.  Satellite Navigation? My dad has a GPS that he totally wouldnt notice missing for a day. Come on Jamie, itd be so much fun!  Id better get back. Jamie looked at his watch and then mounted his bike. My dad is taking me to a movie tonight.   We rode in an uncomfortable silence until an idea struck me as we rolled over the abandoned train tracks. They were old and almost buried by plant growth.   Hey I know you dont want to talk about it, but has anyone ever found anything?  No. Well, my friends older brother said he found some human bones out there once, but nobody believed him.  Oh. And where do people look?  Well, almost everybody goes to the lake. He pointed to the left of us, where wed seen the teenagers heading earlier. Its pretty deep back there but they figure that if there was another town, they would have lived by the lake, sothats where they go.    Well, you know what I would do? I would follow the train tracks. I mean, they look pretty old. And I dont know why they would lay them going back into those woods unless there was something back there, so thats where Id go.   Jamie considered this and then nodded. Yeah, I guess I could buy that. No one follows the tracks that way, though. Thats where that kid that disappeared went.    I wasnt swayed.   I didnt bring up the Lost Town again until two weeks later. It was the weekend before we were moving home and my parents had a barbeque for the employees of dads new store and some of our neighbors. Jamie and I hung out inside the house and played my N64 while we flirted pretty outrageously. There had been an unspoken sort of mutual attraction throughout the summer that no one had had the guts to act on. Since I was moving home in five days, there really was nothing left to lose.    Although his intentions were probably pure and genuine, I am embarrassed to say that mine were not. I thought that if I could make him want to impress me, he would agree to go looking for the Lost Town. The legend had thoroughly consumed me. I had been to the local library every morning for the past week looking for more information on the town and had found nothing. But legends dont just come from nowhere! I was sure of it.   I knew if we didnt leave by 2pm we wouldnt have enough daylight to carry out my plan. I already had a backpack packed with water, a flashlight, a camera and a can of red spray-paint. I figured if we left the tracks we would need a way to find our way back to them. I thought I was so clever.    Nothing in that backpack made a damn bit of difference in the end. I was a fool.      I set my controller down and turned to look at Jamie.    Sodo you want to go out to the woods one last time? I raised my eyebrow at him and smiled.    Yeah! He said excitedly and he jumped up off the couch. Then, embarrassed, he cast his eyes down at the floor. Yeah, you know..if you want to, thats cool.   Cool, lets go! I grabbed his hand and ran out the front door, grabbing my strategically placed backpack on the way. Jamie didnt even notice it; he was walking faster than I was.   When we had gotten a decent way into the trees, Jamie turned around and looked briefly at my face before casting his eyes to the ground. He rubbed the back of his neck.   Ive actually, like, wanted to kiss you all summer.   I was stunned to silence, absolutely dumbfounded that Jamie had found the guts to say anything like this. I knew I needed to fill the awkward silence left in its wake, so I did the only thing I could think of - I leaned in and kissed him.    It was the awkward first kiss of two twelve year olds, but it made me feel warm and sent a flight of butterflies swirling into my stomach. So I actually really did like Jamie. How about that?   I let him go and his face was the same shade of red that I imagined mine was. He quickly changed the subject to how long hed wanted to ask me out but that he didnt think I liked him back. We walked for awhile carrying on this conversation, him oblivious to his surroundings, me subtly leading the way.    It took him stumbling over the tracks to break off his monologue and finally notice the backpack. He looked at me like Id punched him in the face.   You cant be serious.   Jamie, I know but look, this is the last time Im going to see you in a really long time and I want to remember today! We will only be out for two hours max; well be back before they even realize were gone! Jamie stared at the tracks for a minute and seemed to be considering it all. I held my breath until he finally let out a deep sigh.   Okay.   Oh my God, Jamie, I- He held up his finger, cutting me off.   But we follow the tracks the entire time and we turn around after an hour.   Okay! I was so excited that I hugged him. It would be the first and last time I ever did.   As we walked, we talked about all sorts of mundane things, stopping only to make sure we were still on the tracks. It felt like we had only been walking for 45 minutes but when Jamie checked his watch, it had been 3 hours.   Thats weird.it hasnt been 3 hours. It says its 5 oclock. He trailed off.   I swear, we left just after 2. Its cant be 5, dude, your watch is busted. I gave him a playful shove.   Jamie raised his eyebrow at me and smiled. Even so, we should probably turn around.    He wasnt wrong, the sun was setting. The shadows were long and looking around, I wondered if it really was 5 oclock.    But I wasnt ready to give up just yet. As we had been walking, Id noticed something taking shape off of our right; a large mass, maybe a quarter mile away. It was denser than the area around it and seemed to have clean, manmade lines.    Jamie, look.    He turned. Yeah, I was hoping you hadnt noticed it. Its a long way off though; we would never find the tracks again.   Yes, we would, check it out! I triumphantly pulled the spray paint out of my backpack. Its for the trees.   He took the can and shook it, then made an experimental x on a nearby tree.    Ok, but I get to do the spraying. I didnt argue.   The closer we got to the mass, the more it took shape. First we could tell it was a building. Then we could tell it was church.  By the time we got the front door, we were looking at a very old and dilapidated chapel. Remembering my camera, I took a picture of the wooden plaque over the door; whatever had been written on it had long ago worn away. We walked around the church in awe. The building was small, maybe 500 square feet. The windows were, surprisingly, all in tact but were so caked with dirt and grime that we couldnt see anything inside.    How do we get in? I asked quietly.   I dont know, but were going to figure it out! Wait until my brother hears about this. I mean, holy shit. Look at this place! His excitement was contagious.   The front door had a pull handle but try as we might, we couldnt seem to open the door.    Do you think its locked? I asked as I watched Jamie struggle with it.   "Yeah, maybe. I mean it must be. There was a door around back, though.  The door at the back was a lot more sympathetic and let us in with relative ease. We were standing in a small room with an old wooden desk attached to a wall. There was a small fire place and old portraits hung up around the tiny office. The people in the pictures were all standing in front of the same maroon background and were looking down at us disapprovingly. Books were scattered everywhere, most in a language I had never seen before. The floor was covered in dirt and a pair of old shoes were laying haphazardly in one corner.   Whoa, I said in awe.   Yeah, whoa. I looked over at Jamie who had a huge smile on his face. He was holding up a cross and a piece of paper.   What is it? I walked over to see.   Its a list of names. Theres like 60 people on this list. Maybe a town census?   Let me see. I pulled my flashlight out of my backpack and shined it on the parchment.    Deepwood. Do you think thats the name of the town? All these names are crossed out. All except this one. I pointed to a name at the very bottom.    Maybe it was the plague.   You think its a list of the dead?   Jamie shrugged. Makes as much sense as anything else.   I walked over to the desk and leaned against it. Why do you think they left? I mean, look, theres a jacket or something on that chair, and shoes over there. The town pastor or whatever, he just took off and left everything like this?   Or died, said Jamie as he folded the paper and put in into the back pack.    Yeah, died Either way it must have been creepy as hell to be alone in here. I stared at one of portraits for several long seconds; the young woman painted there seemed to be staring down at me with a very accusatory look. It made me incredibly uncomfortable.    I was so absorbed in the paintings that I didnt notice the slow creaking from overhead until the ceiling cracked loudly as it started to cave in. I screamed and covered my head, but the next thing I knew, I was lying on my back over the threshold of a door, Jamie on top of me protecting his head.    Ah, thanks, I mumbled as I gently pushed Jamie off of me.    Dont mention it. Jamie climbed to his feet and brushed himself off. I glanced behind him at the office, which was now filled floor to ceiling with decaying debris.    Jamie, that was our way out.    Thats ok. We can unlock the front door now that were inside. Or break one of the windows.   If the back office was unsettlingly, the chapel was downright disturbing.   Even though the grimy windows allowed very little sunlight in, I could make out eight rows of pews lining a narrow aisle and a tall podium at the front of the chapel.   Jamie and I stumbled around the small nave breaking windows on either side with pieces of wood we had found. The sun was still setting and I wondered how much of a difference the muted light would make. When I broke the last window on my side I turned back around to survey the chapel, disappointed that the lighting wasnt much better. The room itself seemed to repel light.   The wooden pews were completely rotted. In fact, the wood we had used to break the windows of the church were leg stands from the front row. The narrow aisle in between the rows of pews was littered with leaves and rotting wood. But that was nothing, nothing compared to what sat upon the alter.    It wasnt a podium, as I had thought earlier. It was a statue of the crucifixion  but unlike any I had ever seen before. The paint had been worn away on every part of the statue  except the blood of the crucifixion wounds, which stood bright and realistic, and seemed to be oozing before our very eyes. The only other surface left untouched by the decay of time was the face of Jesus. The details of his face were still so incredibly minute and perfect, and he had the same accusing eyes as the portraits in the pastors office. He seemed to be staring directly at me and I could tell Jamie felt the same, though he was across the room from me.    The statues stare awarded me an edge of panic, and I suddenly realized that we needed to leave. We werent wanted here. I had the sudden feeling that we were trespassing on some sort of hallowed ground. We had found the church, we had documents proving we had been here  and now it was time to go.    I turned to Jamie to tell him so and could immediately tell that he did not share my feelings. He had been born and bred on these legends and nothing was going to tear him away from our discovery. I watched him walk over to grab the camera out of my bag. He took pictures of everything he deemed interesting, including the crucifixion statue, much to my unease.    I gave him several minutes before I said something.   Jamie, I think we need to leave. I said in a low voice.   Jamie stopped and looked up, seeming to remember I was there.   Are you kidding? This is what you came for! We have to bring home evidence, of all of it.   Its going to be dark in half an hour. Its already hard to see in here   Duh, thats why Im using a flash. Hey, can you get a picture of me next to this creepy Jesus thing?   UmI guess, I mumbled as I took the camera from him. I didnt even want to look at it, much less photograph it, but if it would help me get him out of here I was going to stomach it.    Jamie wrapped his arm around it just as I snapped the picture. Dont touch it! Oh crap, why did you touch it? Theres something off about that thing, Jamie. Can we fricking go now?!   Yeah, fine. Jamie walked over and picked up the backpack as I headed toward the front door.   I noticed there was no lock on it. I pushed against the door as hard as I could - it didnt budge. My heart sank; there wasnt even a handle or a knob. It was just a solid piece of wood with strange markings on it. Symbols I had never seen before.    Jamie, the door is stuck, I said as I turned around to see him testing a piece of the floor with his foot.   What are you doing? I asked, hearing the edge of panic in my voice. He was still at the front of the chapel, a foot from the Jesus statue hopping back and forth from one part of the floor to another. The statues eyes seemed to be only on him now.   Theres something under here. See? I heard the floorboard creak under his left foot as he put weight on it.    Jamie, dont.   No, its like, under the dirt right here, the floor is hallow, he kneeled down and starting digging through the thin layer of dirt, its like a trapdoor or something!   And it was indeed a trap door. By the time I had walked the length of the pews, Jamie already had the edges dug halfway out.   Lets just leave it and your brother and his friends can come back and see what it is, please, Jamie, I want to go. There was something wrong with this place. Terribly wrong. And the thought of spending one more minute here had me on the precipice of a panic attack, something I hadnt experienced in over a year.    I sat down against the front pew and put my head down. I heard a roaring in my ears and my breathing grew labored. I had to leave here, even without Jamie. I rocked back and forth for a few minutes as I tried to calm myself down. I would climb out a window and run  in any direction, it didnt matter.   Theres something here, under the church. Jamies voice sounded a million miles away.   By the time I pulled myself together enough to lift my head, Jamie was knelt next to me.   I didnt know you were claustrophobic. At least, thats what I think Jamie said. I better remember the horror I felt as I stared at the hole in the floor. Jamie had opened the trap door.   Two minutes, Jamie said as he stood up. We go down, we take a couple pictures of whatevers down there and we come right back up and leave. Just two minutes, Katie, thats all Im asking.   I wanted to say no. I intended to. But I felt myself slowly nodding as Jamie pulled me to my feet. To this day I dont understand why I agreed. But I suppose that its better that what happened down there didnt happen to Jamie alone.   Were going to come back with the story of a lifetime! What if there is valuable stuff down there or something? Old shit is always worth money. We could be rich! So rich that your family could stay here. You could buy the house youre living in and come to school with me in September.   I managed a small smile. Of all the things someone could think to buy with wealth, Jamies first thought was to keep me here with him. And he was right, there could be anything down there and almost all old stuff was valuable. I took a deep breath.   Okay, 2 minutes, I agreed.   As we leaned over the trapdoor and peered down, the first thing we noticed was an intense heat emanating upwards from the hole. The second was the strangely out of place spiral staircase leading into the depths below.    Jamie rolled the flashlight over to me with his foot and I picked it up as he pulled his lighter out of his pocket.   Ladies first, he smirked at me.   I stared at him slack jawed.    No way. You found this door, YOU go first. Between the black staircase and the heat, I feel like were descending directly into hell. I am not going first. I crossed my arms and glared at him to reinforce my point.    Jamie simply shrugged and stepped onto the staircase.    I took several deep breaths as I watched his head disappear into the darkness below. I almost didnt follow him. I was still deciding when he yelled at me to shine the flashlight down the stairs so he could see.    I started down the stairs after him. They went down much farther than I thought, and it became warmer and warmer the further down we went.    When we finally reached the bottom, I was holding back what threatened to be a massive anxiety attack. We were farther beneath the church than I thought wed be and it was hot, muggy and difficult to breathe.    Hoping to get this over with as fast as possible, I swung the flashlight around the chamber hoping to reveal its hidden treasure. What I saw there, I can never describe, though I have tried many times.   The room was entirely empty, save two things. One was a desk in the corner, much like the one in pastors office. The second was another statue.    This one was roughly twelve feet tall, and remains to this day the most terrifying thing Ive ever seen. To put it mildly, it was some sort of demon. It towered over us and as such I could only see the bottom of its jaw from where I was. It was looking directly ahead of it, at the staircase we had just descended. Its tail was long and swept around the entire room. There wasnt a lot of room to move. It had claws, like any modern depiction of a demon and as I moved around the chamber to view its profile, I noticed it had horns as well.    Neither Jamie nor I spoke as we shuffled around room, our backs to the wall as far away from the demon as physically possible. I stepped carefully over the tail as I made my way to its back and came around to the other side of the statue.    I couldnt take my eyes from it, I couldnt trust it. If the statue upstairs seemed to bleed, what could this one do? As I eyed the talons on the gigantic stone feet, Jamie broke the silence.   Can you even believe this shit? His voice was coming from the other side of the room. I searched the darkness for the weak glow of his lighter and was relieved to see it moving towards me. I turned my flashlight upward to shine it on the side of the demons head. The horns had to be at least a foot tall. As I brought it down to see where Jamie was, I hit my arm on something hard.   Ow, my head! Jamie squeaked as my flashlight fell to the ground and rolled under the desk.   Goddammit, Jamie, I whispered in a panic. I dropped to my knees and felt around under the desk, searching for the flashlight.    What! Its not my fault you cracked me on the head.    I stood back up and swung the light around to see Jamie trying to relight his lighter  but it wasnt him that stopped me dead.    I will forever be frozen in that moment. I dont know why I couldnt speak, couldnt scream, couldnt move. All I could feel was my own intern decent into madness.   As I had moved the beam of light up to Jamies face I had seen another face right next to his. A twisted, angry, soulless face  the demons. The statue had bent down and turned to the side; its head mere inches from Jamies. And it was staring at me. I can not describe its face, and I am not sure my mind will ever let me remember it in detail.    It shook me to my core in a literal sense. My body was having a dark, violent, visceral reaction to this impossibility. Jamie finally noticed the flashlight shaking in my hand and turned to see what I was looking at.   It wasnt until he started screaming that I was shaken from my paralysis  I dropped the flashlight, Jamie dropped everything else, and we ran.   We took the stairs 2 and 3 at a time, Jamie pushing me up ahead of him. Halfway up I slipped and we both went tumbling down halfway to the bottom. In that horrible moment we heard the grinding of stone against stone and we knew the statue was moving. Jamie screamed but I was mute, too horrified to make a sound. We got up and kept climbing, never taking our eyes off the small, dying light above us; our only salvation now.   We were almost to the top when we first heard it on the stairs. It was so large and heavy that the entire staircase shook with the impact. Terrified that the stairs would come crashing down and we would be left alone with it below, we jumped the last 3 steps.   Jamie pushed me up out of the opening. He climbed out after me and tried to slam the trapdoor shut but it was somehow stuck.   We could hear a deafening thunder on the staircase as the statue slowly climbed the steps. I helped Jamie try to push the trapdoor closed and for the first time noticed the symbols on the bottom of the wood  the same as those on the front door.   Before I could begin to comprehend this, I noticed the demon first penetrate the shaft of light on the staircase below. It was coming. Jamie saw it too and pulled me to a standing position while pointing at the front door.   We both ran at it as hard as we could  but when we hit it, it didnt budge. We tried again, but it was unsympathetic.   Katie, the windows! We ran to the closest one and tried to climb up the wall to get out, but the windows were too high.   The thunder from below was getting louder, closer. It was more than half way up the stairs   We tried to climb on the rotting pews to reach the windows but they crumbled under our weight.   Ill push you out, give me your foot! Jamie yelled over the sound bellowing from below.   I shook my head. I wanted to, God, I wanted to. But I couldnt leave him. I couldnt leave Jamie to face that thing alone. We both looked over at the door again. Our only chance was to keep trying to break it down. We stumbled back into the aisle and ran at the front door with everything we had. I thought I felt it move. We backed up even further and ran at it again. This time the impact knocked me backwards into the aisle and Jamie barely stayed on his feet. He looked at me in horror and I turned around the see stone horns rising up from the darkness of the trapdoor, 3 feet from where I sat.    We were going to die here. I stood up, refusing to turn around again. I knew that the next step it took would bring its head into the room, and the thought of seeing its face again had me running at the door with every last bit of strength I had. Jamie reached it at the same time and I felt it give way as we crashed through the threshold and landed outside the church.   Jamie had picked me up off the ground before I could think to move and we were running toward the train tracks at an Olympic sprint. We could still hear the thundering on the stairs no matter how far we got from the church; every step echoed through the woods like a gunshot  until they stopped. It was here.   I had no idea if we had run in the right direction or if we would be forever lost in those woods. It was now dark outside and the temperature was dropping fast. I was beginning to panic that we would never find the train tracks when I noticed Jamie wasnt next to me anymore. I turned around in a panic to find him sprawled on the ground a few yards behind me- he had tripped over one of the rails. He was up and running down the tracks before I could even ask if he was okay. We ran until we couldnt anymore.   Our running eventually slowed to a jog and the jog to a walk. We hadnt spoken  neither of us had any idea what to say  and it wasnt until we had both gotten our breath back that one of us finally broke the silence.   How long have we been on the tracks? Jamies voice had an edge of barely suppressed fear. I looked at his wrist, and noticed his watch was missing.   It didnt take us this long to get, to getto find that place. Or did it? Do you think maybe we went the wrong way? Jamie asked hesitantly.   I couldnt afford to think like that. If we had somehow gotten turned around and ran the wrong way down the train tracks, than we were deeper into the woods than ever.   No. We went the right way, I said to convince myself.   That thing, Jamie started, I thought it was a statue. But maybe it was some crazy undiscovered giant reptile that was, like, hibernating and we woke it up.   So we were going to delude ourselves into thinking that there was a scientific explanation for this. I understood why but I just couldnt accept it.   Yeah, I said slowly, did you, um, did you see the weird writing on the front door? It was on the trapdoor, too. Do you think it was keeping it down there? Because, Jamie, all those doors are open now.   Well, if its an animal, words mean nothing to it, anyway.   Yeah, if I trailed off hoping he would challenge my implication. He didnt.   I could tell this was something Jamies mind wouldnt accept. But he hadnt seen its face, not like I had. It was no animal. It was made of stone. It was something sinister and anciently evil and it had seen me, had seen right down into my soul. It was aware of me and I was aware of it. And now, it was free. Whatever had been keeping it beneath the church has been awkwardly destroyed by Jamie and me. That thing was free to walk the woods and go God knows where.    We walked in silence for another half hour until Jamie suddenly stopped short and started yelling.   Here! Were here! He booked it down the tracks toward a swarm of flashlights and I followed close behind him. As soon as Jamie reached his parents he collapsed, while I ran into my mothers arms and cried like a child. I couldn't hold it together any longer.   The police report says we were found at 4am  by our sense of time about 3 hours after the sun had set. We had spent less than an hour in the chapel and yet we seemed to have lost 10 hours there. We never told anyone where we had actually been, or that we had found the lost city of Deepwood. We simply said we went for a walk to the lake and got lost in the woods.    My family left Middlesbrough the following Monday  two days ahead of schedule. My father had another store to open and there was really no reason to wait. Jamie didnt come to say goodbye to me and after we left Middlesbrough I never saw him again. I kept a copy of the police report to remember him.   Over the following year, Middlesbrough slowly disappeared. At first, I could just feel the memory fading unnaturally from my mind. My parents couldnt remember that we had ever been there, which scared me more than anything else. I taped the police report to the ceiling over my bed so that Jamie would be the first and last thing I thought about everyday.     Then, the Middlesbrough city website disappeared as did that of the local paper and the towns two public schools.   The store my dad helped open in 2002 also disappeared from the companys website. After that I could never find any mention of Middlesbrough anywhere online ever again.   Over the years, I searched public records for Jamies full name and found nothing. I hired someone to illegally search private records and he came up empty too. In the end, the only proof that Jamie ever existed at all was the police report with his name on it.   And then nothing was left.  One day the paper I had had taped to my ceiling for so many years was blank. I remember what it was and what it looked like before, but now its just an old weathered piece of blank paper.   All that remains of Middlesbrough and the people who lived there are my memories. And this is why I am writing this story down and uploading it to the internet. Once its on the internet, it can never die, right? Or perhaps one day it will just disappear and you wont remember ever seeing it and I wont remember ever writing it.   And I can only hope that this ended with Middlesbrough. If it has moved on to other towns, who would know? Who would even remember?    I wish I had answers. But all I have are questions.

Yes I posted this a few days ago on AskReddit (I think the question was 'What has made you question reality) and someone linked this subreddit.   Dream/stroke/seizure/neuro blip are my only scientific answers.   Nada. When this happened I called everybody.   Well when I'm on my way somewhere I kinda get tunnel vision so I wasn't really aware of my peripheral vision at that moment.   My friend's brother met some people at a party one night. They decided to load up on beer and drive into the desert together to continue getting drunk. They took two cars.  He passed out in his car and woke up the next morning with no water and the battery missing from his car. They found him dead a few miles away trying to walk towards where he thought town was.    See edit.   Not what I am saying and weird that you took it there.   Maybe. Or maybe said creeper is a pervert who will run away to avoid having dealings with the police.    I have a problem with the actions of the woman in OPs story. If a stranger takes close-up photo of my 7 year old for personal use - that's an issue.     But where did the box come from? Was it there when you moved in?   In the frame - no problem.  A close-up photo of my 7 year old that a stranger takes for personal use - problem.    Nobody is debating if it's legal! We're debating if it's fucking creepy!   And that person can expect a punch in the face.    No, in the above it sounded like the woman was taking individual and close up shots of other people's children to bulk up her "portfolio".   Tom Cruise.   Holy shit!   I like this story. It's paced pretty well.  Something I have noticed on /r/nosleep is that longer stories have to work a lot harder for attention.   For example, my first story did really well. My second story, which I consider much better, didn't even do half as well (it was a lot longer than the first). A lot of people will gauge how long a story is before they decide if they want to read it.   So maybe if there is anything you can trim from your story, it might earn you more views.  Or if you're like me and refuse to alter your baby, you could just let it ride.    Thanks.   "The trees! I can't get the fuckin' trees! Damn, I will kill everyone in the world!"

(except Flagstaff)   I think they'd be pretty confused by reality TV.   About five years ago my husband and I decided to spend Thanksgiving at a cabin up north. We planned on starting a family the following year and so we wanted one last romantic holiday with just the two of us. We found the place online through a website weve used in the past and booked it for a week. The cabin was located outside of Pinetop, Arizona and the owner warned us that it can be hard to get back to in the winter because of the snow. The property was 13 miles from the nearest town and 4 miles from the nearest paved road. Aaron and I werent worried, however, since our jeep had snow tires and we were also bringing tire chains.   We arrived on a Friday afternoon. We had made excellent time on the drive as there was actually very little snow on the ground. We decided to take a tour of the cabin before we unloaded the car. The cabin, named Paradise Pine, was three stories tall and built into the side of a mountain. The top floor was simply the master bedroom, which was connected to a third story balcony via a sliding glass door. The front door was located on the second floor, along with the kitchen and living room, and the basement housed another bedroom, a washer, a dryer and a wood furnace that heated the cabin through a large pipe that extended up through all three floors.   Even though the views through the bay windows were beautiful, the first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the cabin hadnt been cleaned. Often times with very rural properties, the owner will offer to waive the $150 cleaning fee if you are willing to clean the place yourself before you depart. Most guests opt to do this, but in the rare occurrence they dont, the owner sends a cleaning crew.  The previous tenants in this cabin had clearly decided not to clean, and also not to inform the owner that they were leaving it dirty.  Since it was a holiday and a snowstorm was forecasted for early next week, we decided to clean the cabin ourselves and ask the owner to reduce our bill when we left the following Friday. We brought everything in from the jeep and got to work with dishes and laundry. Afterwards, we made an easy dinner, opened a bottle of wine, and played a few games of billiards on the pool table in the living room.   The temperature started to plummet at around six in the evening and I asked my husband, Aaron, to go down and light the furnace in the basement. I went up to the bedroom to wash my face and change into warmer clothes. The bathroom connected to our bedroom was oddly door-less, had a broken mirror and a torn-down shower curtain. *Wow, theres been some cowboys in here.* They hadnt even bothered to pick the glass up off the floor before they left. I did so carefully, regretting the stupidity of the drunken idiots who must have stayed here the week before. I took a few photos with my phone and planned to send them to the owner when we got back to town on Monday. I certainly didnt want to be charged for damage inflicted by the previous tenants.   I met Aaron on the main level of the house and told him about the bathroom.   Well, thats not the only thing thats broken. The lights out in the basement and I couldnt find a flashlight. I did manage to find the furnace though.  I squirted some of that cheap vodka your sister sent in there, threw in a match and hoped for the best.  Seems to be working, I stammered through now chattering teeth, I can feel the heat coming through. I held my hands up to the metal pipe that wound its way around the house. Keep the basement door closed. Its freezing down there.  One of our favorite things to do when staying at a cabin is to read through all the journal entries of the previous guests. Usually, it was just things like Went fishing with the kids, caught a bass or had a BBQ, played cards with the family, but occasionally you found something more interesting, like got drunk, set a tree on fire.  We found the Paradise Pine diary and snuggled up on the couch. Aaron read aloud the first four or five entries before I decided to take over. We were about halfway through the book when we called it a night and went to bed.  The following evening we stayed up late as we had had a long nap that day. The plan had been to go on a hike but it had been too cold out. Luckily, the furnace in the basement was, to our amazement, still burning. We spent the whole day lazing around the living room. After dinner, Aaron practiced pool while I read aloud from the journal, starting where we had left off. I read for an hour before finally arriving at the journal entry of the guests who had stayed before us. I was very interested in this one; these people had to have a good story.   The writer had chosen to format his entries into dates with time stamps. There were over 6 pages and I could already tell the handwriting sort of disintegrated as the days wore on.   Wow, they must have been drunk ALL weekend, look at how messy this handwriting gets! I held the book up to Aaron.  Can you read it? He asked, spinning the 8 ball into a corner pocket.  Of course! Im great at reading other peoples shitty handwriting by now. I sent him an impish grin and took another sip of wine before beginning to read. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  **Sunday, Nov 4th   3:30pm**  Wow, what a beautiful cabin! My wife and I booked this place for two weeks on a whim and we cant believe how lucky we got! Barely made it back here with the truck, theres snow everywhere. At least a foot deep. And its below 40 degrees outside  thankfully the furnace in the basement is HUGE, as promised by Marissa, so all three floors are warm and cozy!   **Monday, Nov 5th 11:30am**  Were snowed in! We had wanted to run home today to grab a few things we forgot but that is definitely not happening. The road is unmanageable so it appears we arent going anywhere. Looks like we will be spending most of our day inside drinking mimosas and playing poker. As you can see, we arent too upset about it!   **Tuesday, Nov 6th   7:25pm**  My wife Sarah is currently making roast chicken and Im finally going to start writing. This is the reason we came here, after all, and I refuse waste the opportunity to cure my writers block. Its just so gorgeous here I havent written a damn thing!   I also saw someone walking around the treeline today. I have no idea how they are surviving out there, we wont even go outside! It was 34 degrees last I checked.   **Wednesday Nov 7th 9pm**  Today Sarah and I made a snow man and snow angels! We dont get snow in Scottsdale, so we are taking full advantage of it. I havent been able to write anything new, but I did edit the previous two chapters of my book.  I think the beauty of this place is just too distracting. Im kidding! (Sort of).   I think we may have neighbors. I was having a cigarette out on the balcony last night and I saw someone at the treeline again. He is extremely tall.  And certainly close enough to say hello but when I waved he walked back into the woods. Will have to ask Marissa about this? She didnt mention any neighbors nearby.   **Thursday Nov 8th 1pm**  This morning I woke up to find animal tracks all around the outside of the cabin. I dont know what sort of animal made them. The prints were the shape of a rectangle, almost like they were made by the end of a 2x4. By the time Sarah got up at 11, the snow had mostly melted but you could still kinda see them. I think last nights snow is the last we will get while we are here. The sky is looking pretty clear. Sarah thinks I am succumbing to cabin fever, so today we are going for a hike since its so beautiful out.   **Friday Nov 9th 7am**  Last night someone tried to get into the house. I woke up at about 1 in the morning to the sound of banging on the front door. Not knocking, banging. I went downstairs and grabbed a pool stick. I asked who it was and the banging stopped. I waited a few minutes and then opened the door but there was nothing there. I started back up the stairs to wake up Sarah, as she is a heavy sleeper. The banging sounded again, more urgently this time, and from the other side of the room, on the wall next to the bookshelf. It stopped after a long minute and I sat down on the steps and waited all night for them to try something. Nothing happened after that.   **Friday Nov 9th 2pm**  I told Sarah what happened and she wants to leave. Im not really convinced, but Sarah scares easily. I will admit that Im a bit on edge. I tried to start the car this morning but nothing happened. Im not a car guy and I have no idea what to do. We cant hike out, theres no signal out here and we cant find a house phone. We talked about it and decided were just going wait it out here. I know people have this cabin rented out on the 16th so well just have to wait the week for them. I did find a wood axe which Im keeping in the bedroom, just in case they come back to harass us. I think its probably a homeless person living out in the woods. There were tracks around the house again this morning and Im no longer convinced theyre from an animal. Well see if they come back.  **Saturday 5am**  Last night the knocking was back. But it was something knocking on the sliding door to our bedroom  from the second story patio. I dont know how it climbed up there. It knocked on the window, gently, almost coaxingly. A thin curtain covers the sliding glass door so I couldnt see what it was. The knocking finally stopped and a full minute later it started again, becoming the loud, insistent banging of the night before. I reached over Sarah and grabbed the axe, bounding out of bed as she screamed. By the time I got to the sliding door the banging has stopped. I threw back the curtain but there was no one on the patio. In the moonlight, I saw it walking away from the cabin, back toward the treeline. Sarah stumbled over to the window and I showed her the retreating figure. She covered her face and cried. What we saw terrified us both.   Its not a human. Its tall, maybe 10 feet, and skinny. It looks like a black stick figure, impossibly thin. It has no hands or feet just stumps. And no face. Its just a black oval, with no features. The contrast was horrifying, this tall, black stick man walking through the snow. It reached the treeline and disappeared. I spent the next hour trying to calm Sarah down. She said we need to leave. I think shes right. When we were finally calm enough to lie in bed again, the silence was deafening. I felt myself slowly start to drift off. It was out of this silence that the knocking came again  this time on our bedroom door. I jumped out of bed and grabbed the axe again. Sarah backed into a corner and screamed. By the time I threw open the door the knocking had stopped and there was nothing there, but the front door was wide open. It can get inside the cabin.  I dont know what it wants.    **Saturday 5pm**  I am terrified. My wife is terrified. Today I considered setting the car on fire, just to see if the smoke would attract someones attention. Sarah wouldnt let me because its our only way out. So we packed the car up instead. Maybe when the snow melts more, well be able to fix the car. I catch Sarah staring off a lot and she hasnt said much since she saw the stick man. Seeing the thing, its affected me too. I have been having migraines today. Ive never had a migraine before. I want to protect my wife but I dont know what to do. I caught Sarah staring at me, almost in a trance earlier. I asked her what was wrong and she said It eats us. She seemed to snap out of it pretty quick after that and asked me why I was staring at her. She doesnt remember saying it and we cant figure out what it means. This thing is fucking with our heads.    **Sunday 10am**  Last night I stayed up all night. Its lightly snowing. All was quiet.   **Sunday 7pm**  I found footprints this afternoon on the upstairs balcony. The same rectangle ones the stick man makes. He was outside our window again. I brushed them away before Sarah could see. It stopped snowing an hour ago and its twilight now. I can see him in the treeline. I saw him turn around and walk back into the woods. His profile is as thin as a piece of paper. The stick man came back, though. I think were going to die here.   **Monday Nov 12th  9am**   Last night I went out on the balcony at around 8 for a cigarette. I heard a noise behind me and turned to see the stick man on the roof, 5 feet above me. I ran back inside to grab the axe and screamed at Sarah to arm herself. I turned around to run back outside and heard the stick man running above me on the roof, in the same direction. When I got outside, the thing was gone. I saw it running off into the trees again. But it was different. It was taller. I think theres more than one.  When I got back inside, Sarah had locked herself in the upstairs bathroom. She was hysterical and kept saying she was going to die here. I tried to give her the pool stick but she wouldnt open the door for anything. I sat on the bed and waited. At some point Sarah must have fallen asleep because all was quiet. It was then that I first heard it walking around in the kitchen. I backed away from the bedroom door, courage suddenly failing me. It was in the house. I waited for more sounds from the kitchen but none came. After a few minutes, I finally heard a thump. It was on the stairs. It was climbing the stairs.  Thump. Slowly, but loudly. Thump. I banged the bedroom door from my side and told it to leave us alone. Thump. Sarah was screaming again, sobbing. It could hurt me, but I would never let it hurt my family. It stopped when it got to the top step. I could feel it on the other side of the door. It didnt make a noise. I tried to think of a strategy that would give me the upper hand if it attacked. I finally decided that if I threw the door open, it would knock the stick man down the stairs. On the count of three I turned the handle and kicked the door. It swung open freely, and I saw the black stick man still down on the landing of the stairs, facing me. It was more than 10 feet tall. I was paralyzed with horror for several long seconds when it started running up the stairs at me without warning. I stumbled back into the room as fast as I could as I realized that death at the hands of the stick man was more than death. Worse than death. It ate you. It kept you.  It stopped at the top step and dipped it head through the door taking 2 steps into the room. It was just a tall black shadow. Almost more of a dense absence of light than a solid black. Realizing the axe was still in my hand I moved between the stick man and the bathroom door. I raised the axe to attack, and at that moment the stick man screamed. It was unlike anything I had ever heard before. I wanted to hold my hands over my ears as I felt an ebbing thunder in my brain. I heard the mirror shatter in the bathroom from the sound. I thought of Sarah. With the last ounce of strength I had I ran at the thing, axe high and brought it down in the creatures chest. Over and over again for what felt like forever but was probably no time at all. It threw me aside and I heard my wife scream. Thats the last thing I remember before I passed out.   When I opened my eyes again it was mid-morning. My wife was gone. The bathroom door was gone. And the axe was gone. I looked for Sarah all morning; I walked deep into the woods. I searched for miles. I am going to sleep for a few minutes and then go back out into the woods to find her. I hope I meet the stick man. If Sarah is dead, I want to be dead too. I think thats what it wanted all along.    **Monday Nov 12th 6pm**  Its getting dark and harder to search the woods. In my mind, all I hear is her voice. *It eats us.* Over and over again. What has it done to her.   I couldnt save her. After everything, I couldnt save her. When I first realized I had forgotten my medication, the snowstorm stopped us from leaving. But when I saw the stick man I thought it had been a blessing in disguise. I needed to be clear-minded and alert to protect my family, and I couldnt do that when I was on the Haloperidol.  But it didnt matter in the end anyway. I couldnt save her.   The car started on the first try this morning. Its letting me leave.  Im going to drive around to the other side of the mountain and walk back towards the cabin. Maybe Ill find the stream. Maybe Ill find Sarah. It would be useless to stay another day, the stick man is gone. I know it in my heart. And its below freezing and the furnace has burned out, the firewood is gone. If I find her Ill come back and write in this book. My only friend, now.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Aaron had stopped playing pool long ago and the wine hadnt been touched since I started reading. We stared at each other as the last words of the diary soaked into the air. We both seemed to wake from our paralyzed state at the same time. I threw the book across the room and Aaron backed up into the bookcase saying Jesus!  This is fake, right? I asked as I stood up. I didnt need the glass of wine anymore. I needed the bottle.  I dont know, Linds, I dontI dont think so.   The guy said he was a writer, I insisted, he probably just wanted to write a scary story for other guests. Although he really crossed the line into downright disturbing. I took a sip of wine and turned around to see Aaron eyeing the stairs, warily.   You cant be serious, Aaron. Its creepy as shit, I agree, but come on.  Almost like he didnt hear me, Aaron started ascending the stairs. I dont know what he wanted to see up there, but I put the wine down and followed him. By the time I got into the bedroom Aaron was sliding the glass door open. I followed him out onto the balcony. You could see the treeline from the patio very clearly. I searched the woods for any movement but saw nothing. I turned to say something to Aaron and found him studying the roof. He threw a wild look at me and walked back inside. I followed him in.  Aaron paced around the room.   What?! I was starting to get annoyed.  Its all just like in the story. You can see the treeline, the field and the roof from the balcony. And look-  He pointed to the attached bathroom.  -there are hinges but no door. There should be a door, its a bathroom. And the mirror-   What? I interjected. Was shattered by the stick mans scream?! He was starting to scare me. Aaron was usually the most logical person I knew.   The stick man? Did you even pay attention to what you read? There was no stick man.  No shit.  No, I mean, there never was. His last entry, about the medication - and how they got snowed in and couldnt go back for it  Haloperidol, its used to treat schizophrenia. Lindsey, go read it again. The entire thing is him slowly succumbing to his psychosis, page by page. Hell, his wife knew it was happening!  This is madness, Aaron. I walked into the bathroom and looked around. You think someone died in here? Four days ago?  Aaron shook his head. I dont know. I think its a possibility. The shower curtain is torn down, the mirror is broken. It certainly looks like there could have been a struggle in here. And the doorthe axe.both missing.  The logic of his conclusions began to dawn on me.  Oh my God, if this is real Aaron, we cleaned this place top to bottom when we got here. If there was a murder, weve destroyed all the evidence!  We didnt know. We didnt know that someone died here-  We still dont know.  Aaron, wheres the body?  I dont know. Maybe its buried out in the woods.  We need to leave; we need to go get help. Lets take the book to the police and tell them what we found when we got here. Just to be safe.  Okay. Okay, Jesus, this guy could come back anytime. Lets get out of here.  We had just started down the stairs when another thought occurred to me. I stopped on the landing.  Aaron  He turned around, Yeah?  He said the fire in the furnace had burned out. Did you put firewood in when you lit it?  Noit was almost pitch black. I couldnt see any firewood.  ButWeve been burning that furnace for almost a day.  I could see the implication slowly dawning over Aarons face.  What have we been burning, Aaron?  He ran for the basement door, and I followed. When he opened the door, I cant describe to you what came up from below. It was a hot, pungent, heavy air. I stood on the top step as Aaron descended into the basement.  The axe is down here.   I took a deep breath and followed him down. I stopped on the bottom stair, refusing to go any further. It was still very dark but for the light coming down the stairs and a soft orange glow in the back of the room. Aaron knelt in front of the stove door. He looked over at me and I nodded. Aaron slowly turned the handle and pulled open the furnace door. The fire inside lit his face and after moment, the horror expressed there told me everything I needed to know. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  They found Jason Harding less than a day later. He had hung himself out in the woods, 50 yards from the cabin. In fact, he had been hanging there when we pulled up on Sunday, the 18th of November. Ive often wondered if he hung himself because he wanted to be with his wife, or if he hung himself because he realized what he had done.   I hoped it was the latter because I hated him so much. Not for his mental illness, not for his crime  but for what he did to us. Sarah Harding had burned in that furnace for a day, and for a day, we had breathed in every atom of her body. We had kept warm by the flesh of her corpse. Why didnt it smell? We were given a very scientific explanation citing high burning temperatures, years of pine infusion, and the pieces of wooden door burning in there with her. But it didnt stop the nightmares.  The case made headline news, at least locally. Aaron and I managed to prevent our names being associated with Paradise Pine through an anonymity clause on our witness statements.  We never told our friends or families we were involved. We tried to forget.    Paradise Pine still stands today. It is available for rent, although the name has been changed. The owner insisted on keeping the cabin journal, so the police tore out Jason Hardings pages and gave it back to her. It still sits on the table next to the bookshelf, and tenants still read it and write in their own experiences.   I pity those people. They will wonder about the torn pages and never learn what was written on them. They will cringe at the door-less bathroom and never know someone was murdered there. They will light the basement furnace and never realize its dark history.   And they will never know that the quiet, charming, peaceful cabin theyre staying in is actually the Paradise Pine.   [C. W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)        Like most people these days, I had a fucked up childhood. Who doesn't, right? My father took off before I was born and my mother was left to care for me on her own, a skill she was sorely lacking.  My mother slipped right back into the drug-addled, party lifestyle shed enjoyed before I was born and had soon turned our two-bedroom apartment into an opium den.   For the first five years of my life, I walked around in a confused, terrifying mist. The smoky air would flood down the hallway from our living room and slip under my bedroom door. It always seemed to linger for days.   I know now that my mother wasn't a bad person, just a victim of her addictions. When she did have spare money, she would put food in the house or buy me clothes from Goodwill. The only pieces of furniture I had in my bedroom was a mattress set and a little blue and white toy chest. Not that I had a lot of toys to put in it, of course, just the three I had gotten for birthdays: one was an art kit, one was a red wagon, and the last, my pride and joy, was a doll named Betsy.   Betsy was my best friend. We would have imaginary tea parties together, sleep together, and even take baths together. Sometimes, I even remember her voice.   When I thought back on my conversations with the doll in adulthood, I realized that I was likely suffering from delusions, thanks to the always present butts of smoke that laid claim to the dingy hallways and drafty bedrooms of our small apartment.    Still, I remember the sound of her voice: a pleasant, tingling lilt that was almost always coupled with a raucous giggle. I also remember the things that she said to me and the things she wanted me to do. She asked me to steal, usual food or pens and pencils. She wanted me to bring her forks and knives and hit the bad man who slept on our couch. It was always something and I would always get in trouble. But she wouldnt. When I told my mother who had put me up to these games she would scoff and shake her head. She never believed me. Adults never do.   Around my 6th birthday I asked my mother for a birthday party. I wanted to invite the mean girls from school and serve them cake and ice cream to make them like me. I remember standing in the kitchen that day with such hopes, having just asked the most important question of my entire life. The glass bottle of coca-cola I held was shaking in my nervous hands. I waited with bated breath as my mother continued putting groceries away, almost as if she hadnt heard me. But I knew she had. Finally, just as I had failed a second time to muster the courage to repeat my question, she turned around and gave me a flippant shake of her head.   "A birthday party? Laura, that's ridiculous, I can't afford to feed 15 children that aren't even mine. Hell, I can barely afford to feed you! You eat like an elephant, especially for a girl your size. Or, Im sorry, Betsy does. There's barely anything left for me to eat around here, much less a classroom of other peoples brats."   My face fell as she shook her head, mumbled something else under her breath and stumbled off into the living room. I heard the music go up then as more people walked in the door. Some left, some stayed; I never knew them either way.    It simply wasn't fair, my mother threw parties all the time. What about me? I was a kid! All my friends had birthday parties and now the mean girls at school would know I was too poor to have one and they would tease me even more.   I felt tears start to well in the corners of my eyes and I choked back a sob while I ran to my room and slammed the door behind me. Betsy was lying on the bed and smiling. She was always smiling. Usually it made me feel better but today it just made me angry. She just kept staring at me, smiling. She was going to tell me to do something bad, again. This was why mother wouldn't throw me a birthday party. It was because of all the trouble I got into because of her. This was her fault! Betsy didn't have to go to school and Betsy never got in trouble like I did. And in my young mind, I truly believed it was the doll, not my mother, who was to blame for everything.   I snapped then. I screamed in indignant rage and I threw the bottle as hard as I could at the bed. It hit Betsy on her forehead and she fell on the floor. Good. I picked up the bottle and I hit her again and again. I thought I heard her laugh and I hit her harder. Then I laughed. When my rage was spent, I dragged Betsy to my toy chest and threw her in. I slammed it shut and kicked the chest against the wall; I never wanted to see Betsy again - ever.   I never owned another doll after Betsy. About a week later the police came and two nice ladies took me to live in a new home in a new state, with food and toys and no drugs. The trunk went into storage and the wagon disappeared. I never saw my mother again. As I got older, my foster parents admitted she was in jail, doing 25 years. That was fine with me; I felt nothing for her anyway. I still had nightmares because of my life with that woman. But then slowly, I began to heal. I focused on doing well in school and I ignored my mothers letters from prison. She reached out to me several times in my 20s, as well, but I always declined her calls.   That is, until this morning. Im 30 now, with my own children and a loving, honest husband. I have a beautiful house, two dogs and a career as a social worker trying to make a difference for kids who had it bad like me. Im happy, Im steady, and Im content. So when I got a voicemail from my mother informing me she had been paroled and that she wished to speak, decided to let her say her piece.   Since the kids were home from school I went out into our shed in the backyard to return my mother's call. The shed was the children's domain and they used it to play in the summer. I sat on my old toy chest which was currently being used as tea party table and dialed the number she had left me.   Three rings.   "Hello? Laura?"   "Hello, mother. How are you?"   "Oh Laura, thank you for speaking to me. I know you have your own life now and a family. I would love to meet them someday! I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am. For everything."   "Mother, you are not meeting my kids - ever. And since you called me, I am going to what I have needed to say for years. The opium, the heroin, they destroyed you. And the worst of it is that you almost took me down with you. I was five. That was no home for a child.  Honestly, Im surprised it took you so long to get caught."   Laura, I know how it seems, but I honestly know nothing! Look, it hardly matters and I do understand why you would feel that way. Why you would hate me and not want me to meet your little ones. I learned a lot about forgiveness while I was away and just...oh Laura, I am so sorry about Betsy."   "Betsy?" I paused, confused. "Why would you care about her?"   I know, Laura, believe me I do. It was all my fault, the drugs, the partying. And Betsy, oh God, if I had only paid attention, if I had only known. She's gone and it's because of me.   As my mother began to cry, I tapped my fingers on the toy box, impatiently. The drugs had clearly fried her brain.   "Mother, I sighed. Why are you talking about Betsy? And why do you even care? I know where Betsy is." Right underneath me.   "What are you talking about, Laura? Oh God, where is she?!"   I shifted uncomfortably. "Well...Betsy's in the trunk, where shes always been."   There was a beat of stunning silence.   "What do you mean your sister's in the trunk?"   "Sister? What the hell are you talking about? Back on drugs so soon?  Thats a record, even for you.  Betsy is a goddamn doll. I locked her in my toy box a few days before you got arrested for possession."   "Laura.. oh God, no...no... Laura, what have you done? I wasn't arrested because of the drugs, Laura, I was arrested because of Betsy's disappearance! You always called her your little doll, but we thought you knew! Oh God. We thought you knew. Laura, no, what have you done to my baby?!"   My mind had gone blank and with no emotion I set the phone down next to me and stood up. I could hear the muffled sound of my mother's anguished cries and feel the dark clutch of possibility in my own chest. Memories were stirring in the back of my mind, threatening to flood forward into my consciousness. They pushed against a door in my mind that had been locked so tightly for so long that I had forgotten it was even there.   Was it even possible? Could the trauma and the opium have really led me to believe that a small child was actually doll? Begging for food and utensils to eat with, asking me to protect her from the bad man?   No...   I slowly turned around and brought my eyes down the makeshift tea party table. Surely, it was too small; you couldn't fit a person in there. You couldn't. But then, what about a very small, starving, emaciated child? What about her, would she fit? Would an investigator even bother looking for a person in this chest? I knew I wouldnt. It was just too small. And I was sure we had opened the toy box at some point over the years, hadnt we? Or had something swimming in the dark recesses of my memories always stopped me? I couldnt remember ever seeing it open. I knelt down to the ground and opened the clasps. It would be better to not look. After all that I had overcome, this new life that I had earned for myself. It could all be undone by opening this toy box. I shouldn't open it. I should throw it in a landfill and forget it ever existed. I should not look inside...    I opened the chest.   I never had a doll. My mother never could afford to buy me one. I never had a wagon either, for that matter. But I did have a toy box; a pretty, blue and white toy box. And when I was five, I beat my little sister to death and put her in it.   [C. W.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/C-K-Walker/1503387386575559)          	80

Ask us anything!**  This past Tuesday, May 6, the White House released the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment - the most comprehensive national effort to assess the science and effects of climate change in the U.S. The report is designed to help officials, businesses, and members of the public in all regions and sectors of the country make the best decisions when dealing with climate change and managing related risk. The NCA also illustrates how these regions and sectors are connected. Unlike previous assessments, this NCA has been released as an interactive website, nca2014.globalchange.gov, to make it more accessible and useful to both citizens and scientists.  We are researchers at the University of Arizona who played a significant role in both the overall report leadership and especially the Southwest and Forestry chapters. We will be answering questions starting at 2PM EST.   Who is here: Kathy Jacobs - Recently returned to the University of Arizona to lead the UAs Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions after serving as the Director of the National Climate Assessment for the White House.  Gregg Garfin - Lead author of the Southwest chapter of the NCA and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment   Dave Breshears - Lead author on the Forests chapter of the NCA, drawing on his expertise on drought-related tree die-off, and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment   Dan Ferguson - Director of the Climate Assessment for the Southwest    Thomas McDonald - Project and Events Coordinator at the University of Arizonas Institute of the Environment, helping us navigate Reddit and input our answers.   tl;dr - The White House released the third National Climate Assessment(NCA) on Tuesday. It is comprehensive, designed to help everyone make decisions to deal with climate change, and released as an interactive website, a first for the Feds.

 I seem to still be alive somehow although others weren't so lucky. I've run into some of the old crew including "wild man" in jail/prison afterward. Sadly I was rooming with someone else and was very close that passed on. Everyone changed so much. It really blows my mind the 180 that Shaun flipped my utmost respect for his staying the course.   He's a recovering drug addict. Brain cells went the way of the Dodo      Confirmed. Sad but true. You have a You have a LESS than 1 in 32,468,436 chance of winning that lottery. Here are some other odds for the sake of comparison: You have about a 1 in 2,000,000 chance of being struck by lightning.  A pregnant woman has a 1 in 705,000 chance of giving birth to quadruplets.  Someone eating an oyster has a 1 in 12,000 chance of finding a pearl inside of it.  Now, lottery odds can be pretty incomprehensible. How can we possibly have any "feeling" for the number 32,468,436? To help you with this, here's a little experiment you can try to "get a handle on" what a 1 in 32,468,436 chance really means.  Get a piece of rope or string, that's 59 feet long.  In a wide open area, arrange the rope or string in a circle, end to end, the best you can.  Get a single grain of sand or dirt (use tweezers!) and place it anywhere you wish inside the circle.  Get a second grain of sand. Close your eyes, and "disorient" yourself as to where the grain of sand is that you placed inside of the circle (have someone spin you around or something!).  While you're inside the circle, drop the second grain of sand from 1 foot up.  Your chances of hitting the first grain of sand with the second is roughly equal to the odds of "1 in 32,468,436."  If the rope's length mentioned in #1 is a little unreasonable, for every foot above the circle that you drop the second grain of sand, you can reduce the length of the string by the same amount. For example, if you dropped the second grain of sand from a ladder 10 feet up, you'd need a length of string that is 10 times shorter than the one in #1, or a 59/10 = 5.87008 foot long piece of string.  The jackpot is so large, someone with enough money could theoretically buy up every single combination of winning numbers, thereby guaranteeing a winning ticket  but only if you suspended the laws of physics.  A $540 million jackpot, if taken as a $390 lump sum and after federal tax withholding, works out to about $293 million. With the jackpot odds at 1 in 176 million, it would cost $176 million to buy up every single combination. Under that scenario, the strategy would win $117 million  less if your state also withholds taxes.  But there are too many limitations. First, if it takes five seconds to fill out each card, you'd need almost 28 years just to mark the bubbles on the game tickets. You'd also use up the national supply of special lottery paper and lottery-machine printing ink well before all your tickets could be printed out.  And with a jackpot this large, experts say, there is more of a chance of multiple winners. If you have to share the jackpot with even one fellow winner, you've lost $30 million.  Mike Catalano, chairman of the mathematics department at Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, S.D., said he covers the odds of winning in lottery games with his students in an attempt to show them how unlikely it is to win big.  He concedes the math is clear: The more tickets you buy, the better your chances of winning. So, if you buy 10 tickets filled out 10 different ways, your odds of winning the jackpot 10 in 176 million.  "You are about 50 times as likely to get struck by lightning as to win the lottery, based on the 90 people a year getting struck by lightning," Catalano said. "Of course, if you buy 50 tickets, you've equalized your chances of winning the jackpot with getting struck by lightning."  Based on other averages in the U.S., you're about 8,000 times more likely to be murdered than winning the lottery, and about 20,000 times more likely to die in a car crash that hit the lucky numbers, Catalano said.  "You might get some psychological enjoyment from playing the lottery, but from a financial standpoint... you'd be much better off going to Las Vegas and playing blackjack or the slot machines."

 Learn a new language.   Don't ask us what your wife would like, ask her what *her* fantasies are.   He cheated on you and he's perfectly happy with not hearing from you for weeks. He's using you. Dump him and find someone who really loves you.   This article confirms that the picture is real but claims it's a year old and conditions aren't like that anymore.  http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2014/11/29/i905221_salud-pblica-confirma-foto-nios-amontonados-maternidad-altagracia.html (Spanish)         By relatively cheap I mean under $2,500.         It's not a perfect book. The mystery is actually the weakest part of it and the main character, Claire DeWitt, can be a little off-putting, but the whole thing is so unusual, mystical, thought-provoking, richly evocative of post-Katrina New Orleans and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, that I thought I'd give it a rec.  It's vaguely reminiscent of The Boy Detective Fails by Joe Meno, so I'm going to give that a mention too.  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9231999-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102504.The_Boy_Detective_Fails      You'll often hear people say something like "I (or a friend) doesn't really like reading, but I like book X." I think of these books as "books for non-readers" and I was wondering precisely what is it about these books that appeals to non-readers in a way that other books don't?   Also, is a book that appeals to non-readers similar to books that I call "brain candy" -- books that are light and fluffy and silly and require no brainpower to process at all, mostly romances but not necessarily?  Your thoughts?   It seems to me that a lot of SF and fantasy today engages in excessive worldbuilding to the extent that plot and character development almost take a back seat to description. The most notable example of course is Harry Potter and I think this is the reason why when people finish certain SF or fantasy books they wish for more is because the worldbuilding is amazing but the meat of what a book is supposed to be is lacking.  By contrast, things like LOTR, Star Wars (the movies, not the expanded universe of books), WoT and GoT do not have such extensive worldbuilding. They tell a story and when it's finished, it's finished, and you feel satisfied with it. "I wish WoT was 20 books longer" said nobody ever.  Conversely, Discworld has fairly extensive worldbuilding but you also feel satisfied at the end of most books because Terry Pratchett is great at telling a story and giving you interesting characters.   Edit: Now that I think about it some more, I see that I can't name as many series off the top of my head as I thought I could. My memory's been influenced by the many threads bemoaning the fact that people can't get enough of X or Y world that must make it seem more common than it is. But the point still stands that it is entirely possible to engage in excessive worldbuilding to the detriment of the characters and story.      As I was reading it, I felt like Mr. Mercedes was Stephen King's answer to the Cuckoo's Calling. When a character named Trelawney popped up, that confirmed it for me.  I think that Mr. Mercedes was the better book. Though Cuckoo's writing was a bit smoother -- some of the dialogue in Mercedes was eye-rollingly bad -- Mr. Mercedes worked better as a mystery. Stephen King uses all the conventional techniques and even comes up with a couple of new ones, while Cuckoo came across like Rowling didn't know the first thing about conducting an investigation. And while the characters are a bit silly in Mercedes, at least they're vivid. As soon as I put down Cuckoo, I couldn't even remember how the mystery got resolved, let alone anything about the characters.  I read that the Silkworm is better than Cuckoo and a sequel to Mr. Mercedes is coming out next year, so I'm hoping they both will be improvements.          ETA: Fight *against* ISIS, not for them, but if you want to fight for them, tell me about that too.   Anybody know of any with a reliable hashgacha? Willing to buy online.    In other words, not that it was touching or sad because somebody died or something like that. And not crying because you were laughing so hard.    Not the best characters or plot but the prose itself?             And why?   Have you ever watched a movie and found that you had almost the exact same thoughts about it as someone else but drew a completely different conclusion?      I found these two websites that have a long list of "If you like X author, try these other authors."  http://www.wakefieldlibrary.org/lists/zraifyoulike.htm  http://www.wcl.govt.nz/popular/fictionwriters.html   Why does it seem like mourning doves are more skittish than pigeons? And why are so much less of them in the same area? Like, in my neighborhood there must be hundreds or even thousands of pigeons and literally two mourning doves.         Here's a list of WWI novels from Wikipedia, but I don't have the patience to go through all of them to see their publication dates. Anybody know off the top of their head which is the earliest?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:World_War_I_novels                           There are some authors who were turning out decent books up until they died and some that seem to have run out of ideas but keep churning them out anyway. Who do you think should retire or should have retired from writing? My answer in the comments.      First the good. Besides for the utterly boring first 70 pages and the weak, college freshman essay last 70 pages, most of the middle was fairly engrossing. Also, I laughed a couple of times.  Now for the bad. It was engrossing, but not good. The writing was weak and unedited, as judged by the spelling errors and inconsistencies, and by the plot errors and inconsistencies. She repetitively described New York using an overabundance of banal and seemingly randomly-chosen adverbs.   The main character, Theo Decker, is a cypher. He tells us what he's feeling, but we never quite feel it ourselves. He doesn't particularly have much agency either. He mostly allows himself to get dragged around by whatever dynamic person who's around at the moment.   The plot is incredibly weak and relies heavily on having a death every 200 pages to advance the story and/or a Dickensian coincidence. In fact, toward the beginning of the book, I was sure that this had to be a parody of Dickens, it was that bad. Later it seemed to be a bit of a Harry Potter AU fanfiction and when Theo's friend Boris starts calling him "Potter" and does so for the rest of the book, I felt entirely vindicated. There also a lot of retconning. She wrote the book over a period of 11 years and I think it shows.   It's too bad the book didn't end with Theo successfully committing suicide. Then it might have been compared to Shakespeare or Greek tragedy and would be more meaningful for it. Instead we're treated to a long and pointless essay about art, which does nothing to life the book from its mediocrity. In 770 pages it says absolutely nothing original or insightful about art, humanity, or anything else. I am completely baffled why it won the Pulitzer.   One positive review I read started with something like "I can't explain how much and *why* I liked the Goldfinch so much." If even people who like the book can't explain what they liked about it, it can't really be all that good. It might be appealing, but appeal and quality are not particularly correlated.    It's really supposed to be Burn, Read, Rewrite, but I don't believe in burning books, even for fun.   Respond to someone's list of books and/or submit your own!    I went shopping for Fathers' Day cards and by the end of the week almost all the "for father from daughter" cards are sold out while most of the rest are going strong. Who decides what cards to stock? Don't you think they'd notice from year to year which cards are the most popular so they'd stock more of those than the rest? Sometimes I wonder the same thing about milk in drug stores, but my guess is that milk is a loss leader so they don't care too much about that. But greetings cards are expensive!    There's a story behind this question but I can't remember what it is.    Someone told me she heard that "they" are predicting a massive storm for this September for the northeast US but she doesn't remember who "they" are and Googling turns up nothing. Anybody here know anything about this?   I've always felt like if I ever published a book I'd have to use a pseudonym because my real name is so nondescript that nobody would ever remember it. Who are some authors with interesting and memorable names?   I'm an American, but every time I heard the announcements for these stops, I was like, that sounds odd or wrong somehow. What do you think?   (In NYC there are definitely stops that are pronounced poorly, notably DeKalb Avenue and South Ferry. It's not South Fairy. In the northeast we pronounce these words differently. Grrr.)   When the critics like a movie a lot more, most likely it's artsy and a little dull. When the audience likes it more, most likely it's a dumb crowd-pleaser.  But what does it mean when critics and audience members like it about the same?               It's a children's book that probably wasn't published later than 1985. It was about a boy that had a paper route but for some reason wasn't able to do it so his sister took it over despite the fact that people didn't think a girl could do it. I think I remember her having trouble collecting money from the people she delivered the papers to, and there was a dog, a chow, that bothered her and drooled a lot.   Any thoughts? Is it similar to any other Russian novels? Is it a difficult read?    How does it compare to other YA dystopian novels?  ETA: Thank you to everyone who responded. You've given me a lot to think about!   Does anybody know of any websites or mailing lists that keep track of Bikur Cholim, Hatzalah or other Jewish organizations' blood drives in Brooklyn and/or Manhattan?   Like how the first two books in Divergent are written from Tris's perspective, the last book is written from Tris and Four's perspectives. Or Narnia, where some of the books aren't even about the same characters.    I originally [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2191s4/amateur_shelf_reading/) about my amateur shelf reading in /r/books because that's where I learned the term, but apparently nobody there was interested, so I decided to give you guys a shot.  Last week I did some shelf reading at my library and found a bunch of misshelved books (see previous thread). I decided to do it again this week, but I only managed to get through three shelves on one bookcase because a library worker started hovering around and I felt self-conscious.   So now I'm wondering if somebody noticed the post or they noticed the books I'd left to be properly shelved and had the brainstorm that maybe people who actually work there (whether as employees or volunteers) should actually be doing it? If so, it's really awesome that I made an impact.  This week I looked at Par- to Patterson. Most of the misshelvings were relatively minor, though I did find a Sarah Pekkanen in there.       If so, what book(s)? Or author(s)?   Plot summary from Wikipedia:  Five of St Aubyn's novels, Never Mind, Bad News, Some Hope, Mother's Milk, and At Last, form The Patrick Melrose Novels, republished in a single volume in 2012. They are based on the author's own life, growing up in a highly dysfunctional upper-class English family, dealing with the deaths of both parents, alcoholism, heroin addiction and recovery, and marriage and parenthood.  They're sort of depressing and nihilistic at times, but the prose is clever, funny, easy-to-read, and thought-provoking. The best books are the first and fourth, which are written from a child's perspective.   The other books are weak (especially the second, which comes off like a re-written Bright Lights, Big City, and the third which barely seems to have Patrick Melrose in it at all) but despite how much you pity but also despise Melrose, you feel compelled to follow him on his journey.   The last book is a bit old hat, like the author ran out of new things to say, but it ends on a high note that doesn't lie and say that everything *is* okay, but that it very well might be okay, after all this time, finally. So you feel glad that it really is possible to transcend even the worst kind of childhood and upbringing.  Highly recommended for people who are interested in the subject matter, particularly the British upper class.       How do you go about renting an apartment without a real estate agent? Aren't all the listings in the newspaper or Craigslist fake or get snapped up the day they're listed?   After the discussion last week about shelf reading and my admission that it was unlikely that I would ever formally volunteer at the library, I decided to do some shelf reading on an amateur basis. It was pretty gratifying and I intend to do it again.  I did this during my lunch hour so I only had time to look over two bookcases. The books ran Sta- to Stevenson. In the two cases I found minor misshelvings such as SteiNberg ahead of SteiMberg; SteelE ahead of Steel; a book of essays that nobody seemed to realize was non-fiction and will probably be misshelved for the rest of its poor little life (because good luck trying to convince a library worker that it needs to be reclassified); some slightly worse misshelvings such as Strohmeyer; also Inferno by Dan Brown.   Yup, Dan Brown. In the S's.   Can't wait to see what'll turn up next.   ETA: There were other errors but I don't remember them all. Some misshelved books I put in the right place, others I left out depending on how easy it was to find where they really belonged.   I hope this is okay to post here; I figured you guys would be more familiar with plays than other subreddits.  (Background) I was writing a story that suddenly occurred to me would work better as a play, which is bizarre because while I've written a number of (unpublished) novels and took a couple of stabs at writing a screenplay, I've never been particularly interested in plays before. Plus, I've read plays, but I haven't seen too many performed.  (Question) So, what is your take on telling a story in a novel versus a play versus a movie format? Is there a particular type of story that lends itself to one format over another (aside from the obvious like action movies couldn't be plays)? What is the selling point of a play?  (Also) Would anybody be able to recommend to me plays with approximately five characters?             http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallus  Gallus, usually used in the plural, another word for suspenders  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspenders#History  During the nineteenth century, they were sometimes called gallouses.       Maybe the question doesn't really make sense, but I couldn't figure out how to phrase it better. Lately I feel like I've been reading two books around the same time that have nothing to do with each other but funnily have similar aspects or elements.  For example, Friday I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is a modern-day domestic dramady set in Seattle, and Saturday I finished The Abominable by Dan Simmons, which is a historical drama/thriller largely set in England and Mount Everest. But both books have a connection to Antarctica.   I didn't read these two books together on purpose, in fact I didn't know that Antarctica figured into Where'd You Go, Bernadette -- I took it out from the library without even reading the book jacket.   Has this happened to you?   Has been writing for a long time and/or has written a lot of books, and the opposite.   Seems they're trying to prevent people from crossing from the middle of the street, except I didn't see it stopping anybody but me because I was afraid the traffic agents would give me a ticket -- except they weren't paying any attention to what people were doing. (Do traffic agents even have the authority to give people tickets?)  Theoretically this is a good idea because far too many people cross when the turn signals are green and I'm amazed that nobody's gotten run over in front of me yet, but at the same time, the way this intersection is set up, if you wait to cross legally to get to the train station, you'll be waiting for much longer than if you cross in the middle. There should be a legal diagonal crosswalk light.   I'm pretty annoyed right now.  ETA: And now they've added a big flashing sign saying not to cross, to use the crosswalks. Like, duh, as if people don't know that. But the traffic agents are gone.       In any kind of book -- children's, YA, and adult.       Your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate totally counts.         Out of context!   Why or why not?  TIL that apparently a lot of people don't. I guess that explains why Americans are so fat.   Does anybody know who the vocalist is?  Song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IbZlTIAxdU      I only put clean dishes there after I wash them so I can't imagine that it's dirt. Could it be rust or minerals or something else that's in the water?  Picture: http://i.imgur.com/f2PyKJ6.jpg  ETA: If there's a better subreddit to ask this in, please let me know.      Has any other author written books like this -- same story but told from different characters' perspectives? (Not different perspectives within the same book, or professional fanfiction like Hamlet being written from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's POV.)  Any genre.   ?   I watch shows that I don't really care about but don't dislike enough to stop watching.         What was your experience? If I go sometime during the day, am I likely to get crushed by a mob?   **When did you read it?**      I put the serious tag because I'm not interested in a thousand dick jokes.   And where did they buy it?   And where did they get it?               Something silly, childish, or immature?  ETA: I mean something you normally wouldn't do at your age, but you did it anyway sometime in the recent past.       I'm reading Blue Has No South by Alex Epstein. It's a book of really short stories, flash fiction, I guess. I'm finding them incredibly hard to understand. Here's one story. What do you make of it?  The Man Who Lived in an Elevator  In his last years in the elevator old age had disposed of his hair (in the mirror he saw the reflection of a caveman whose hair was turning white). His children, who were ashamed of him, used to stop him on the lower floors and give him pictures drawn by his grandchildren.  ETA: If you're interested, you can read almost half the stories on Google Books.  http://books.google.com/books?id=ll-ryrlwqA8C printsec=frontcover dq=blue+has+no+south+by+alex+epstein hl=en sa=X ei=qrdxUsvKA8Hh4AP694HQCA ved=0CD0QuwUwAA#v=onepage q f=false   There was a recent thread that had a list of classic heroines and one of them was Katniss. The Hunger Games was published in 2008; it cannot possibly be considered a classic yet.  I was thinking that a book can't be considered a classic until it's been in print at least 20-30 years. In other words, it needs to be read a generation after it was published. (50 or 60 years would be even better -- two generations after it was published.)  And if you want to talk about a series, it's 20-60 years after the *last* book was published, not the first.  Your thoughts?   I remember a softcover science fiction novel that was probably published in the late 1980s or early 1990s. It had something to do with cat people and for reason, I'm thinking tea. I think the author's last name was toward the beginning of the alphabet.       I find that I prefer Russian, Japanese, and Spanish over French and German. Maybe it's the subject matter, maybe it's the translations or maybe it's the quality of the original languages themselves, I don't know.    You don't have watched them when they originally came out, only that you watched them when you were a kid. (Star Trek original series, 1966-9, Star Wars trilogy, 1977-83, Battlestar Galacica, 1978-80)   And by women's novels I mean stuff by people like Maeve Binchy, Elin Hilderbrand, Jodi Picoult, Fannie Flagg, etc. -- relatively serious books about women's lives.  I do not mean chick lit like Bridget Jones or the Shopaholic series. I also don't mean romance of any sort, whether hardcover or paperback.   When you see questions like this on Reddit, do you respond or do you ignore them?   http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ngygn/how_was_israel_able_to_create_its_own_country_in/   This past week I read Life After Like by Atkinson and First Sight by Steel and I rated them very similarly (3/5 stars and 3.5/5 stars respectively).   Atkinson's book is ambitious, creative, and fairly-well written, but overall it's just not that good. The characters and relationships aren't engaging, the basic story has been done to death, and the most creative aspect of it didn't pan out in the end.  Steel's book is pretty bad, actually. It's a dumb romance, dumb characters, fairly bad writing. Though there were a couple of plot twists that I genuinely did not see coming and that's what kept me from rating it lower.  So in the end, I slightly preferred First Sight because I wasn't disappointed by it. I knew what to expect and pretty much got it. To me it feels worse to have my hopes dashed by a book that turns out to be overhyped.   How do you feel about books that don't live up to the hype versus mediocre bestsellers that do what they're supposed to do?      I'm looking for creative ways of including movement/exercise in my day. I have a 9-5 desk job and overall I'm pretty sedentary. Currently I walk at least a quarter of a mile every day and stand at least an hour a day, on average.  I was browsing through this and other health subreddits and I saw one suggestion of sitting on an exercise ball. I like that idea and I'm looking for others like it -- easy to incorporate into my daily life but aren't totally obvious.    I hope I've submitted this to the right place.  Does anybody know of stores in Brooklyn or Manhattan that sell linen "church suits" by JSong or Night Studio, like this one: http://www.expressurway.com/items/jsong/jsong-1187CS-womens-suit-spring-2013-detail.htm?gclid=CMau-4r9mbkCFcme4AodRmQAyw   Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1kxsut/goodreads_drama_what_do_you_think_about_rating/) post about rating a book you haven't read.   How do you feel about someone writing/posting a negative review of a book that they deliberately haven't finished because they didn't like it?  Is it fair because not wanting to keep reading a book is a pretty good indication that there's something not good about it?  Or  Is it unfair because maybe if they'd stuck with it, they might have liked it in the end?  Or   Does it depend based on what they didn't like about it?   Or  Something else?  	117

Team Two toes is working hard to rebuild all of your entries on DN for review and testing.  Again, we are judging based on how well the deck is put together and how believable it is that we might see the deck in the anime, as well as which ones we like personally.  Boy did we get quite a few lights worn and chaos entries. Because of this, we will not allow two decks of the same category to place for a prize. If it so happens to be voted as such, we'll only take the one that was entered sooner.  Thanks for your submissions everyone.  Also, PGLD at my locals jumped to over 20 dollars to purchase. Target and Wal Mart don't seem to be of any help. Winners will have a choice to take Dragons of Legend packs instead so I can distribute prizes faster. Later, I'll update this post with a list of all qualified entrants.            I have a stage I want to use in my stage expansion, but the camera is annoyingly close to the players the entire time. Is there anyone who can point me to a guide that will help me fix this problem?      **These Guidelines are temporary**  Any complains or comments about these guidelines should be commented on in this post.  Please follow these guidelines strictly until we're done finalizing them. Failure to do so will result in a temporaray ban from /r/YGOSales only. Further non-compliance will result in a permanent ban across /r/YGOSales and its related subreddits.  **[Guidelines can be found HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOSales/wiki/guidelines)**  From now on, the initial submit button will take you to these guidelines to remind you of our rules.  Also, some of you haven't been assigning your own flair. This is not the moderators' job. It takes 3 seconds. Posts over an hour old without link flair will be taken down immediately.   So, Those who took advantage of it, so what mat did you get?  I got myself a playmat I was planning to get for a long time. I took advantage of the sale to get this [Project M playmat](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65160123/Playmats/Project-M-Playmat-flat.png)  ---  Those who you who missed it, what mat would you have wanted to get?  Also, here's the code I normally use for $2 off a regular order: **INKED10**   You can now put a link flair on your posts. THIS IS MANDATORY.  This obseletes the old way of making sure we have a user-written tag on each one. This doesn't just allow our site to look prettier, but it allows you to change from one kind of post to another without waiting 7 days and/or creating a new thread.  Link flairs will help others quickly seeing whether you are buying, selling, or both. Remember to assign this flair AS SOON AS YOU MAKE A POST. It's not that hard, and only takes 3 seconds.   I have done the front page a courtesy of assigning flair for them, but moderators will not be responsible for adding flair to each post. It is a user's job to distinguish their own posts.  ---  If you do not use a pre-approved flair, or forgot to put flair up, a moderator will tell you to assign proper flair. After that, if you still don't assign the proper flair, a moderator is free to remove the post without any further notification.  Soon, I'll be adding sort links to the side-bar so you can easily sort by the type of post you want.   **[Binder](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)**  **[Misc Cards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFLBcRk6Sp6dGR2aEVOa2h4cUJVRFZNeDNFbW9VQmc usp=drive_web#gid=0)**  If you want to buy either binder as a whole, I can do it for $20 or a card lot worth $20.

I revised the entire flair system to be a bit more accurate. Don't worry, nobody's flair was "downgraded" and nobody has been "robbed" of feedback or any priviledges related thereof.  **If you're flair is wrong, or you do not have flair because of this new revision, PM me! or message the mods!**. If it's wrong, I'd prefer you message me.  This will be in effect for the next week.   I cannot seem to figure out how to make this element appear somewhere else. This is for /r/arryugiohmods. I've tried just about everything. The drop-down menu ends up blocking the very top subreddit that you're subscribed to and I really need to change this if I'm going to make it work.  ---  I just figured it out. The proper CSS class is as follows:      .drop-choices.inuse  In case anybody else is wondering.   A recent conflict has brought to my attention the very real possibility that users can be scammed out of hundreds of dollars. I will be planning an overhaul of our safety guidelines and regulations. Until this overhaul can be finalized, please follow these temporary short guidelines.  * No transactions worth over 20 dollars. * Use tracking on all orders. * Never use "Friends and Family" in the paypal options. * Never pay more than half until you get a tracking number.  I don't want mods to become the "bad guys". When I started YGOSales, I wanted it to be a safe place for buying and selling away from eBays unfair share of your hard earned money. As the founder, i do not want the possibility, regardless of how remote, to be seen responsible for undeserving users losing significant sums of their hard earned money.      Today, I'm debuting a new feature for the subreddit. These are emoticons. You can use them the same way you would format a [link](http://www.reddit.com). For those of you who have never formatted a [link](http://www.reddit.com) before, you would do it like this:      [Text here](http://www.fullURLhere.com)  The difference is, you do not have to put a full URL, and you do not have to put text. Simply do the following      [](/exact-emoticon-name-here)  For example, to use the paypal emoticon:  [](/paypal)  You would enter the following      [](/paypal)  I'll be working on condensing the formatting on the list of emoticons. For now, simply refer to the sidebar if you forget how to do it.  ---  **Of course, with new features come new rules. For now, anyone spamming or abusing emoticons will be temporarily banned**. (This will not apply to the blanket ban across the sister and main subreddits.)  Please use wisely.  VOTE FOR NEW EMOTICONS IN THE COMMENTS!!!

It's what I've been trying to finish along with Airblade Turbo. Each time I look at it, I wonder how I can make it better, but I don't know how.  For locals, I'll need a side-deck that prepares for the following:  * Mermails * Fire Fists * Geargia * Bujins * Constellars * Harpies   If you haven't seen the last meta post, you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/comments/21hlql/meta_old_guidelines_new_guidelines_community/). We strongly recommend you read it.  Both /r/ygosales and /r/yugioh101 have implemented a universal link placed right above the tabmenu. (See those subreddits for an example.)  As a user/trader here, what would you like to see above the tabmenu?  *Note:* I cannot make this link user specific. So, putting your own feedback thread up there for personal reference is not possible.  Thanks for letting me know!  -Reiden Lightman   **Intro**  A new anime is coming. And it's called Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V. And as you may have noticed, Yu-Gi-Oh! characters don't exactly play on the level we do. Those powerful cards must be very rare. So I purpose this:  ####ANIME DECK BUILDING CONTEST  Let's all build a deck as if we were an anime character in Yu-Gi-Oh! Why not? it will be fun. And there will be prizes.  **IMPORTANT**  READ CAREFULLY  Entries posted here and entries that do not follow the guidelines will be ignored. I'm also receiving a lot of entires that do this   -monster -monster -another monster -yet another monster -why this monter -why not this monster  Please stop doing these. If I get too much more of these, I will ignore them.  **Rules**  Each deck must adhere to the following rules to ensure that each deck feels like it would be seen in an anime. It will also simulate the rarity of cards in the anime.  * Your deck may have 3 copies of 1 card, and 2 copies of another card. The rest of the cards must be 1 copy each. * Your deck may have up to 2 Limited cards and up to 2 Semilimited cards. * April 2014 ban list will be used for this. * You are free to use any card available to Dueling Network * You may use either synchros or Xyz monsters, but not both. * You may use fusion monsters. * Extra Deck extended up to 20 monsters. * No side-deck. We will not pay attention to them. * No custom cards. * Please,  make it believable that it would be in an anime.  **Submissions**  Submissions start immediately. Go [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=test_subject1372) and submit a message with both a *Dueling Network Screenshot* and a text list with the *full name of each card* in your deck.  The decks will be judged by Team Two Toes themselves, meaning me, Lily247, and a couple other players from our locals.  The last submission date will be on my birthday, April 29th. After that, Team Two Toes will take up to 2 weeks to judge the decks.  **Prizes**  Since judging is right after my birthday, I'll be able to fund a couple small prizes. Those who wish to fund or donate a prize should PM me. By default, 1st Prize will be 2 packs of Premium Gold (10 cards total). 2nd Prize will be 1 pack of Premium Gold (5 cards total).  Any changes to the prize pool will be announced on April 29th or 30th. At that time, the prize pool will be finalized.  **Example Submission**  ^(*Format your submission in the following manner.*)  Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/iv8wcIu.png  Deck List  * Malefic Cyber End Dragon * Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon * Malefic Stardust Dragon * Beast King Barbaros * Fusiller Dragon the Duel-mode Beast * Machina Fortress * Cyber Dragon * Machina Gearframe * Green Gadget * Red Gadget * Yellow Gadget * Tin Goldfish * Genex Ally Birdman * Card Trooper * Cardcar D * Swift Scarecrow * Geartown x3 * Terraforming * Iron Call * Mystical Space Typhoon * Machina Armored Unit * Big Bang Shot * Trade-In * Block Attack * Limiter Removal * Skill Drain x2 * Sakuretsu armor * The Huge Revolution is Over * Call of the Haunted * Dark Bribe * Breakthrough Skill * Cyber Summon Blaster * Covering Fire * Negate Attack * Magic Jammer * Final Attack Orders * Mirror Force  Extra Deck  * Malefic Cyber End Dragon * Chimeratech Fortress Dragon * Ally of Justice Catastor * Gaia Knight, the Dragon Champion * Ancient Fairy Dragon * Stardust Dragon * Giganticastle  Character Name: Reiden Lightman  Backstory: My father worked in a factory that helped make the cards, so he snuck me a few. I won a duel disc in a sweepstakes and started dueling outside the factory during my time off for extra money. ^(*Keep your backstories short.*)      A buddy of mine I met while pulling from Premium Gold told me that Primal Origins has a few cards that will cause **Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo** to jump in price.  Is there any truth to this? Am I holding onto them for nothing?   Right now, I have a neat message for hovering over your karma in /r/ygobinders. But, I can ONLY get the positioning to be the same between firefox and chrome if I set "top:" and "right:" to 0.      .userkarma:hover:before {       position:fixed;       top:0px;       right:0px;       display:block;       z-index:1000;       width:250px;       height:83px;       padding:3px 0 0 50px;       border:1px solid #333;       background:#FFF url(%%upstartgoblin%%) no-repeat left top;       content:"YOU WANT SOME'A THIS?";       text-align:left;       font-size:10px;       color:blue;       font-weight:bold;       border-radius:4px;       -moz-border-radius:4px;       -webkit-border-radius:4px;     }  Top and right were meant to be 137px and 4px (respectively) to breifly cover the subreddit information between the searchbar and the "show my flair" textbox. But, when I use 137 and 4, it appears in different places between different users. This happens because one of the accounts I use to test doesn't have the mod mail icon, and the karma field varies in size based on how much karma each user has.  But I need for this to appear in the exact same location to matter what. I'm at a loss.  **For some reason, it just decided to work correctly, and I have no idea what is making it work correctly.**   First off, I'd like to thank BBgun69 for the subreddit that is /r/ygobinders and the rest of the moderators for the hours they have poured into this ecosystem.  ---  **Breif Rundown**  As many of you know, /r/ygobinders started off as an iota of a trading community vastly overshadowed by trade binders on the main subreddit. At that time, feedback was submitted by all and tracked by one. All in all, it was not a very effective, efficient, or satisfying system.  I started posting here to promote the subreddit because I saw that it had potential. Strangely enough, /r/ygobinders and /r/ygosales began to blossom together when trading on /r/Yugioh was reduced to a single thread per week to cut the clutter. Nevertheless, it is you, the users and traders who keep this going.  You all deserve a thanks for that as well.  ---  **Old Guidelines**  I, along with the others, have been working on a newer more streamlined method of presenting basic rules and information to the community. Less digging should be required to find the same information, and we are happy about that, and we hope you are too.  All basic rules are in the sidebar. Each user will still be held accountable to their own defiance of these rules. Sure, concequences may be small in many cases, but nobody has a valid excuse for ignoring them.  Some users may need be reminded that /r/Yugioh and its daughter subreddits are on a blanket ban system meaning a ban on any of these subreddits will earn you a ban on the others as well. These will include:  * /r/Yugioh * /r/ygobinders  * /r/ygosales * /r/ygofeedback  ^(Side note: /r/yugioh101 is not officially part of this blanket ban, but has common moderators with a few of the other subreddits and will constitute semi-blanket bans at its own discretion.)  ---  **New Guidelines**  Continuous user feedback has allowed us to discuss necessary changes and guideline additions and that will be enforced as soon as they are available on our new [regulations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/rulesandregulations). Be sure to check that often to keep yourself up to date.  New changes will include but not limited to:  * less cluttered titles * descriptive, organized, and less lazy descriptions * shipping cost awareness  Not to mention, we have updates to writings of old articles such as [Scam and Trade Safety](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/scam_and_trade_safety). Don't worry, we are not relying on outdated information. We'll be making necessary updates.  *New*:  I've managed to hide the scores for each post, but we'll still have upvoting and downvoting available for binders. This is the take out the habbit of looking at certain posts or not looking at certain posts based on a high or low number. Thanks to upvotes and downvotes, the best posts and binders will still appear before the rest.  You are *HIGHLY* encouraged to search the "new" tab of this subreddit. Newer posts often don't get immediate attention resulting in decent and quality trades never happening.  ---  **User Feedback**  We are constantly encouraging user feedback on all aspects of our subreddit. This ranges from look and feel to stronger enforcement of guidelines. There will always be a button to message the moderators. As well, feel free to line the latest sticky with more feedback.  ---  **Closing**  We are a community of traders and Yu-Gi-Oh! players. Remember to respect each other and trade fairly. Once again, I'd like to thank everyone of you, my fellow mods, and BBgun69. This has been a great experience so far.  ---  *All Links from this Post*  * /r/Yugioh * /r/ygobinders  * /r/ygosales * /r/ygofeedback * /r/yugioh101 * [regulations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/rulesandregulations) * [Scam and Trade Safety](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/scam_and_trade_safety)      Put more clearly, what has someone thought about you for liking my little pony that was unusual or paculiar. I'm looking for the non typical stereotypes such as being old, living with your mother, out of shape, smelly, homosexual, etc.  I've actually had someone ask me about other hub shows like Strawberry Shortcake and Littlest Pet Shop. They were surprised to hear I strongly disliked both shows and asked me why My Little Pony is the "exception" for grown men to watch and not other shows.      **Where to Get It**: [Link to Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1vdar4/a_78_stage_build_for_project_m_302_back_and/)  **Build By**: GarbageHead4  This build is very unique. And there's a big reason why. It includes 78 stages. GarbageHead took a classic expansion build of Project M (which included stages from Smash 64, Melee, and Brawl) and now we have this piece of work.  A few gripes I have off the bat to get them out of the way:  * The Music menu is has completely inaccurate stage previews and icons making it hard to adjust anything. * JCaesar's Menu Music. * Feint - Homebound music. I'm definitely not going to be using this. * Incomplete Music information (blank names appearing when round starts). * Choosing Skyloft on music menu screen causes crash (should find a fix) * Most icons in Menu music are strike icon (no fix in sight)  Of course, not all of this will count against Garbagehead. It just detracted from the general experience.  There are a lot of stages included in here. Some of them I've seen in other builds, others I haven't. I'll be going over some of the bigger points of some stages later, especially music since music had to be put to each added stage.  * Yoshi's Mountain: Cool but unfitting song. I'd find something better. * Research Facility: I'd generally recommend staying away from screaming or metal given the very niche fanbase as well as it does not inherently fit well with technological stages. * Castle Sky: Pretty okay song, but it's metal on a medieval setting, which doesn't fit well. * SSE Forest: The song was fitting, given the visual context, but it wasn't what I would have picked seeing that it's supposed to be from Subspace, not Zelda. * Final Needle: Music was well chosen. However, I wouldn't include this stage because it goes from being hard to see to harsh on my eyes. It's very distracting. * Mewtwo Stadium: I much prefer this version of the stage to the brighter version I see going around. The other version has had shadow errors and wasn't as interesting as this one. Good choice. * 1337M: Fun stage, but just because a song is titled "King Kong", that doesn't mean it is good for battle or fitting for a DK stage. * Hyrule Castle M: Great music choice and love the stage. * Jungle Hijinx: Didn't expect such a fitting song. Girlfriend flipped out like a fangirl. * Bowser's Castle: Love the music choice. "Bowser's Castle". I once tried a version of this stage with tons of errors, but it's good to see a very well done version of this stage in use somewhere. * Yoshi's Story M: Great steage, although with thin walls. Has its original Music from the N64 version. * Summit: Cool flat P:M version with a fitting Metroid Prime song. Shoutout to Metroid Prime fans! * Spear Pillar: More balanced version of the stage was a nice touch, but the song was uninteresting. * Aquatic Ruin Zone: The music choice was meh. General remix of sonic sounds. It's called "Green Hill" but didn't sound anything like it. I didn't want to play on that stage anymore after hearing that. * The Whirl Islands: Really don't like the techno Pokemon love song. It's just... not that good in any sense. This song cause my friends and I to stay off the stage aside from the stage being incredibly huge with little interesting details. * Magnet Train: I don't understand the music choice. I would have put it on a main Pokemon stage. Not everyone is a Pokemon fan who will know what "Magnet Train" is. * Venom: I'd take this stage out. It is very boring compared to the Melee original and functions improperly when compared to the Melee version. * Twilight Realm: Has a remix of Midna's Lament (extremely over-rated song). I would have put in Zant's Theme instead since Zant is actually present in the stage. The High platform causes a balance/camping issue even with the moving platform. * Dance Party: Great sounding dance song for a great looking well-designed dance stage. I won't spoil the song, but I wasn't expecting to hear what I heard. * Paper Castle: A lot of Mario stages in thei sbuild. It started to get old. I do like that the Paper Mario Thousand Year Door battle theme was chosen. * Half Pipe Dream Land: Meh. Music was okay despite being what sounded like a vague remix of Nintendo sounds. * The Beginning: Good stage choice. Brings smash to its roots. The music was a great choice, but suffice to say, it didn't loope well with itself. I would have found an extended and/or remixed version to put in.  I cannot blame GarbageHead for a lot of this, and nobody should. I would however hold it to Project M fans to test their stages for fun, enjoyability, and noticeable errors. I didn't notice any lag on any stages, so there's that as well. And unlike some builds, there weren't any lighting errors.  The overall quality of the build's stage choices showed through, and I'm glad I can say that.  ---  **Why you might want it**: 78 stages  **Why you might not want it**: 78 stages. It is a con as well. Customizing it could be a bit of a um... hassle. Not all of the stages are very appealing or balanced or fun. Different players will like different stages. I may end up using a derivative of these codes to expand my build with a few stages, although, I'll want everything to look professionally done.  **Would I recommend it and why**: If you like having an overload of stages, why don't you have this build? Get it, customize it, love it, have a blast.  **What about for tournaments**? Definitely not. I cannot see any tournament accepting such a huge expansion without defined neutrals, counterpicks, and casual stages labeled in game.  **Score**: 6/10  It's mostly because of the music menu and some music/stage choices.  I think I'll be taking on [this build](http://www.reddit.com/r/customsmash/comments/1wyx7w/project_w_update/) next.      Earlier today I enabled /r/Yugioh101 as a public subreddit to let the posting begin. Small questions and discussions will be up for starting yourself. Bigger scaled discussions can be submitted to /u/DiscussionThreads (link in the sidebar). Articles will go through a mod to prevent multiple articles on the same thing.  We are looking for a lot of budget deck write-ups so just get whatever you have to a moderator.   I'd like to thank the 50 and more subscribers who are already willing to learn and teach with others to help the Yu-Gi-Oh! online community grow, flourish, and most importantly innovate. We want to think differently here at Yu-Gi-Oh! 101 with the mindset that EVERYBODY can be good at Yu-Gi-Oh!.  So, some basic guidelines on general posting.  ---  **Be Respectful**  If you are harassing others around you and demeaning others opinion, you are not only breaking reddiquette, but you're blatantly breaking our own rules. Do no attempt to make any argument without any elaboration.  **Follow all of /r/yugioh's rules**  This is a cousin of /r/yugioh and as such we will be following most of their posting rules. This includes including text deck lists along with screenshots and allowing room for everyone to contribute.  **Do no post coverage unless it is your own**  We are not here to observe coverage of any tournament experience other than our own. Deck lists and tournament reports etc. will not be welcome here unless it is your own deck list or tournament report. There may be exceptions from time to time, but not without running through the moderators.  **Check /r/yugioh for news and updates**  This subreddit is focused on discussion, friendly banter, and building each other up. Please, by all means, take into account any new cards that may be released soon, but don't post that news here.  **If you're looking for trading or sales, there are subreddits for that**  If you want to trade, you can go to /r/ygobinders. If you want to sell and buy, you can go to /r/ygosales. If you do either, make sure to keep track of your feedback at /r/ygofeedback.  ---  That's about everything. If you want to be a writer of on of our official discussion articles, message a moderator and get approval.      /r/yugioh101  **I'd like to introduce everyone to what I've been building recently**. We seem to have had a lot of self-hate disappear within ourselves with the dying of certain threads. But we still often see people bummed that R/F and "I'm new" and "getting back into the game" threads still exist.  I figured that if they still exist, then obviously a few links in the side-bar is not helping these players out.  So I founded a new subreddit which not only doubles its purpose of a R/F deck subreddit, but also helps new and returning players ease themselves into the Online community.  ---  **THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR /R/YUGIOH** and it never will be and it was never intended to be.  The Wiki will have a lot of great information and archives ready to help new players get right in. Anyone interested in helping build these archives or improve need only message me or another moderator.  Speaking of which, if it gets big, we may need moderators. And I'm also looking for a fellow judge or 2 to help me fill in the Wiki's simplified How-To-Play section.  Thanks everyone for your interest.  ---  **Features to look forward to**  * Occasional Budget Deck Features * Simplified How to Play guides * Tutoring/mentor Program * Feature of video explanations for those who dislike reading * User suggestions for other features are welcome. * Possibly: I'd like to get per-deck communities started where players all playing the same deck can gather around and discuss its strengths and weaknesses.   [Mellenium Puzzles](http://i.imgur.com/Zyi26M7.png)  It's an improvement from another entry I did. If I could, I'd switch that entry with this one. But, it is likely that I'll adopt this for /r/yugioh101 and possibly make a green version for /r/ygosales.   Here's a game we can all play. Ask some bullshit ruling question or questions in the comments below. Reply to others with a ruling that is also complete bullshit.  ---  **This is all in good fun**.

It is still a mixture of your basic build and the +1 engine featured in Joe Boglie's Fire Fist build. Unfortunately, it's going to take me a bit longer to build this since my extra deck was stolen. My friends want to help me rebuild it, and some of /r/yugioh (you know who you are) have been helping too. Thanks.  Any questions or suggestions are very **very** welcome. Please help me improve.

The only camera that could see me was from across the room.

Still have 70 dollars of cards to replace. Wish me luck.   My mom's computer, the one I would use to switch builds, is finally and fully dead in the water. I cannot switch builds. Our temporary replacement is old as hell. It doesn't have usb2.0 and cannot wen handle playing a small movie file.  I'm in the market for a USB-SD card reader. Until I get that or a new computer with an SD card reader, I cannot get to reviewing any builds.  I promise, as soon as I can, I will get back to doing more reviews. I'm especially excited for the chance to praise/rip apart that P:M+ build I just saw.   https://www.dropbox.com/s/97k7gcn51dvfjks/Photo%20Feb%2015%2C%201%2004%2046%20PM.jpg  Konami sent this as a gift. I'm sure my other two local judging buddies got these as well. I looked on eBay, and they are apparently very scarce and pretty valuable. (Around 50-70.) But I don't think I'll sell them anytime soon.  But look at me rambling on, let's have a bit of casual fun and show off what we've gotten in the mail.   Hello. We at /r/ygosales are trying something new. We received complaints about ebay links being a bit annoying. And we've discovered that it is a hassle to go through making a thread for a single card or small group of cards.  If you have something small to sell or would like to leave a link to an ebay auction you're doing, leave it here in this thread. This thread will last throughout the weekend.  Please limit your ebay links to 5 or less.      I can't stand this guy. Every day he comes to my house. He looks in through my window. I swear, if he wanted to kill me, he could have done it with a silenced rifle and been done with it. He probably would even get away with it. Nobody appears to have called the authorities to report this guy. He doesn't seem interested in talking to me or getting to know me or even steal anything of mine.  Every morning I look out my window. Sometimes he is already there, but on some mornings, he leaves me alone. Sometimes he will not arrive until I'm about to leave or eating breakfast. I guess it depends on when he wakes up and how long it takes him to get dressed in that redundant suit. It's the same black business suit he always wears. I never see him arrive. I always miss it. He's either there, or he's not.  When I get in my car and open the garage, he appears to be missing. Hiding near my bushes, I presume. They're not too far from where he normally stands. Can't he be more creative? It's not the most sneaky thing anybody has done. I just head to my office with a brisk pace, glad to be rid of him.  My office is on the second floor. No trees outside. I work in accounting with my nose on the numbers, and my numbers on the nose. I'm not bothered until I go out to lunch. I never stay in. No matter where or how far I go, that man seems to find me more often than not. I'm convinced it's not just one man anymore.  He wouldn't come in at all, but watch through the windows instead. Sometimes, when I try using a drive through, I could swear I see him inside about ten feet inside the building. A week ago, I started only going through the drive through. I have my meals in my office now.  End of the day, I'm at home, making dinner, and he is back here behind my tree watching from the outside. He looks a bit different now. He must be stubborn to keep an eye on me, since I keep the blinds and curtains closed now. Every time I peek, he is there trying to look in.  I don't know how nobody else sees this guy. He's at least six feet tall and standing in plain sight. I've started to believe he is part of some government surveillance. They could track me through my phone's GPS, and they could be suspicious of how well the company is doing with my clients. I can't leave my phone anywhere; a client might call me and I could miss something important.  For the love of god, I just want to be left alone. Sooner or later, I'm just going to run outside and attack him myself. Of course I've called the cops, but he's always gone by the time they come, which leads me to believe he's tracing my house calls. The cops refuse to stick around to survey the area since I have no proof.  Does anyone else have a problem with a tall man in a suit staring at you in secret?      http://i.imgur.com/XOYnEvA.png  This was strongly inspired by the *+1 Fire Fist* build by Joe Bulgli. I thought trying to get a +1 on every turn was a great goal. And since my spell/traps were so similar in Constellars already, I thought that adapting it a bit further might be a good idea.  And for the most part, this deck is pretty consistent. (It still gets those draws with 3 Sombre in the hand sometimes. Thinking about taking two out for Cardcar D or Upstart Goblin.)  I'd like opinions.  ---  Main Deck  * 3 Constellar Kaus * 3 Constellar Pollux * 3 Constellar Algeidi * 3 Constellar Sombre * 3 Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Bear * 2 Effect Veiler * 1 Honest * 3 Mystical Space Typhoon * 3 Fire Formation - Tenki * 2 Fire Formation - Gyokku * 2 Forbidden Lance * 1 Reinforcement of the Army * 1 Dark Hole * 1 Dimensional Fissure * 1 Mind Control * 3 Fiendish Chain * 2 Mirror Force * 1 Bottomless Trap Hole * 1 Solemn Warning * 1 Torrential Tribute  Extra Deck  * 1 Gagaga Cowboy * 1 Maestroke * 1 Starliege Paladynamo * 1 Photon Papilloperative * 1 Blackship of Corn * 2 Constellar Omega * 3 Constellar Pleiades * 1 Constellar Ptolemy M7 * 1 Volcasaurus * 1 Tiras, keeper of Genesis * 1 Wind-up Arsenal Zenmaioh * 1 Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger  ---  **INB4 SOMEONE SAYS "NETDECKER"**  Remember that netdecking is not inherently bad. I have experience running this deck, and I wanted to try running it a slightly different way. I heard different opinions about 1 or 2 bear in the deck, and 3 is completely unexpected, but I have 5 cards to get out the deck with bear, and 3 of those search either another bear or a Kaus.  It's great; I've been able to cycle tenki-bear-tenki-bear until I draw a Pollux or Algeidi that I can use with Kaus.  Also, I used to run the exact same traps in addition to 1 Compulsory Evacuation Device and 2 Dimensional Prison. So that didn't change much. I ran the 3 Tenki, 3 MST, 2 lance before this build came along.   /r/yugioh101  http://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh101/about/stylesheet  h3{   height:16px;   font-size:18px;   font-weight:bold;   color:white;   display:block;   background:#606;   border-radius:5px;   padding:4px 5px; }  h4{   font-size:14px;   font-weight:bold;   color:white;   display:block;   background:#606;   border-radius:3px;   padding:3px 5px; }  .wiki-page-content h3{   height:16px;   font-size:18px;   font-weight:bold;   color:white;   display:block;   background:#606;   border-radius:5px;   padding:4px 5px; }  .wiki-page-content h4{   font-size:14px;   font-weight:bold;   color:white;   display:block;   background:#606;   border-radius:3px;   padding:3px 5px; }  I cannot get the headers to display properly in the Wiki.  I did a search for this kind of problem and nothing helped. I still comes out the exact way it was looking before. Any help would be nice because I've had this problem with two subreddits now.   **Deck**: Dark Worlds  **Archetype**: Dark Worlds  **Cost**: $20-$150  **Description**: The first budget deck feature we have is a polarizing one. By that, we mean you either love and enjoy the deck or despise it with a passion. If you're new to the game, don't worry about this. No matter what deck you play, some players will respect you and others will hate you.  Dark World is an archetype that causes their monster's effects to be activated after being discarded from the hand. A lot of the spells and traps work hard to draw these monsters as fast as possible and then discard them. Their main tools for doing this are **Gates of Dark World** and **Dark World Dealings**.  **Building**: Structure Deck; Gates of the Underworld is a structure deck that comes with plenty of the cards you need to get right into the game. If you buy three, you will have the tools to play around with ratios of certain monsters, spells, and traps. These cost about $20.  If you want to change it up, after buying as many structure decks as you want, buy some traps that are not included with it to make it stronger.  Edit: viewers might like to know that we are a community driven source. This is also just a test/beta post. A different guide will be written to obsolete this one. If you want to write a budge deck feature, submit it directly to a moderator following this format.   I can't stand this guy. Every day he comes to my house. He looks in through my window.

I work in accounting with my nose on the numbers. May be hard to believe, but my numbers are always on the nose. No distractions to ruin my day. But, somehow, I always seem to be bothered at lunch. I never stay in. But no matter where or how far I go, that man seems to find me more often than not. I thought that changing my patterns or just eating somewhere different would throw him off. More often than not, he seems to always know where I'm going to go.  He doesn't even come inside the restaurant. He watches through the window. Although, one day, at a drive through, I could swear I saw him inside about ten feet behind the woman who handed me my meal. A week ago, I started only going through the drive through. I have my meals in my office now.  End of the day, I'm at home, making dinner, and he is back here behind my tree watching from the outside. That's how it used to be. It's hard to watch through blinds and thick curtains. Every time I peek, he is there trying.  I don't know how nobody else sees this guy. He's at least six feet tall and standing in plain sight. I've started to believe he is part of some government surveillance. The only reason I could think of them watching me is my recent success with my clients. I get a call from one once or twice a night. It's a relaxing distraction from what's going on. A fifty minute call goes from redundant to a blissful.  For the love of god, I just want this man to go away. Sooner or later, I'm just going to run outside and attack him myself. Of course I've called the cops, but he's always gone by the time they come. And they refuse to survey the area and stick around to see.  Does anyone else have a problem with a tall suited man staring at you in secret?      **Hello again.**  test_subject1372 here with another announcement.  In case you missed the previous sticky, ArcaniteMagician is now a head mod, and we're looking for feedback to make this subreddit a better place for everybody.  **So here's what we're working on!**  We have a user working on an upgrade to the GracefulCharityBot to help users quickly get prices to make buying and selling faster and more fun.  Due to user feedback, we are no longer allowing Ebay links in user-created threads. We will be trying Ebay/Quick-Sale threads for those looking to sell individual cards/decks. Please let us know if you would prefer these threads over the weekend or thoughout the week.  I have slimmed down the side-bar to make room for a new section I am planning on for urgent sales. You will be free to message the moderators with a link to your thread and an explanation of your situation. If it is urgent, and you need the money soon, we can keep your selling threads visual for all to see.  I hope everyone will find these changes satisfying. We are always accepting user feedback. There's a handy button on the sidebar for messaging the moderators.      **Are you a calabrel fan? Are you Calabrel?**  You're probably going to hate a lot of what I have to say. And I'm sorry I have to start off on that note, but please stay with me and understand where I'm coming from.  **Where to Get it**: http://smashboards.com/threads/calabrels-custom-3-02-project-m-build.346028/  **Build by**: Calabrel  Just from the page, I could tell that this build had a lot of promise. Everything on the front page was kept to a firm standard of maintaining Project M's original stage collisions and camera movements. I guess this was to prevent his build of being banned from tournaments. And it shows. The stages feel great.  All of the changes are even reflected in the stage select screen. What a guy. I love it when I don't have to keep a pen and paper or laptop on me to know what stage I'm picking. Not to mention, page 2 is filled with very competitive stages. This must have taken a long time to do.  ^(Side note due to complaints: the stages are mostly remixes of past stages so that it feels tournament friendly. Nothing too interesting outside of the addition of chibi robo stages and music changes to fit the stages. Doesn't do much for the build, but it is satisfying.)  That's almost all the good stuff I have to say about this build. And I'm pretty sure when Calabrel reads the rest, I'll be flamed and probably reported. Nah, he's a good guy, he wouldn't do that. Right?  Anyway, moving on, I have nothing to say about character additions since the fighters are identical to P:M with nothing added and nothing changed. No comments necessary.  But let's talk music. I feel like this was Overclocked remix on parade, and after a while of reading the song names and sources, it got boring. And who wants an entire game to sound so much the same? I did like his replacements over KK Slider's songs. I won't spoil that, so go figure it out yourself.  Starting at the menu, the music changes when you enter the character select screen which isn't necessary and is actually distracting. I said the same in BTBM's build. But let me bring up the music choices. Feint - Homebound was very obvious, and I'm tired of it being used. I also seem to find that intro the Smash Bros documentary, and I'm tired of seeing that in multiple builds as well.  You want to know the reason my build used music from Frozen? I didn't think anybody else would be doing it, it matched the look and feel of my build, and it was a fresh change from the techno and/or rock songs that everyone else seems to be using. On top of that, my choices make great, short menu tracks.  Menu tracks should be around a 50 to 90 seconds, but instead we get bulky files of 180+ seconds for MENU MUSIC. We're not in the menu that often, and it goes quiet after two minutes. A long file is not necessary and shouldn't be used as it takes up a lot of space and won't be heard full through.  Outside of the menu, the music isn't even that bad. There's a lot of OC remix, but it's good music at least. But I can't use this music pack with my friend Luke because he's a music major and will likely only hear noise in certain songs. Calabrel even has a few victory themes. (However, some are far too long, reaching up to 26 seconds. Victory themes should be kept to 10 seconds since most players rush to start a new round.)  It's also good to know I wasn't the only one who thought to put [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaBJpAS29qI) in P:M.  Now let's talk about looping!  The following files are not looped at all  * a03 * a05 * a09 * a10 * a13 * a14 * a16 * a17 * a21 * a22 * b03 * b04 * b05 * b07 * b09 * b10 * c02 * c07 * c08 * c15 * d01 * d03 * d05 * d06 * d10 * f06 * g02 * g10 * h07 * i04 * i07 * j04 * j09 * j10 * j11 * k05 * k09 * k10 * l01 * l06 * l07 * m02 * m03 * n01 * n03 * n05 * n06 * n08 * n10 * n11 * p01 * q01 * q02 * q04 * q06 * q10 * r02 * r04 * t03 * u06 * u08 * w04 * w05 * w07 * w09 * w11 * w12 * w16 * w24 * w25 * w29 * w30 * x02 * x05 * x25  These files have bad-sounding loops  * a20 * c03 * c11 * f12 * n12 * h02 * i02 * r03 * r10 * w03 * w15 * w19 * w26 * w27 * x01 * x04  Now let's read a little something Calabrel said.   Some of it is. I took some of the more obvious ones and looped them.   [source](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1vbn5w/calabrels_302_custom_project_m_build_enjoy/ceqqdvz)  Why didn't he loop everything properly? Fading a song out and having it start over again doesn't count as looping. HAL Laboratories didn't do this, and neither did the Project M Backroom. And what's with the Ballad of the Goddess loop? It's not looped very well, and all he had to do was take a file from a previous version of P:M.  Not to mention, the naming in the game and menu are not consistent. If you want to know more of what I mean, read my [last review](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wpnnu/review_bobby_the_broke_monarchs_project_m_build/).  The music is a drastic shortcoming of this build, and the vast amount of hype and anticipation for this build is just horribly undeserved in my opinion.  ---  **Why you might want it**: A plethora of awesome stages.  **Why you  might not want it**: If you take your set to a lot of tournaments, I'd recommend keeping this on a secondary SD card in case your TO doesn't approve. Also, everything I said about the music.  **Would I recommend it and why?**: Yes and No. If you want it, install someone ELSE'S music pack. I'd recommend [mine](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=35478 Vault=audio) or [BobbyTheBrokeMonarch's](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wloz8/btbm_302_custom_build_updated/).  **What about for tournaments?** Get approval from the TO a month in advanced so he/she can let others know that it will be there. The stages might be distracting and throw many players off if they are not used to these stages. If you go to a lot of tournaments, keep this on a secondary (not primary) SD card in case your TO doesn't approve.  **Score**: 6/10  Once I have plans for my next review, I'll let ya know. LEAVE A LINK TO YOUR BUILD TO GET IT REVIEWS. REMEMBER, A REVIEW IS GOOD PUBLICITY.  Edit: GenericallyEpic, I'm coming after ya! A new quota has been build. I look forward to playing more builds.         **Where to get it**: http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wloz8/btbm_302_custom_build_updated/  **Build by**: BobbyTheBrokeMonarch  I had a subliminal motive with [my build](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wdrdb/project_m_302_build_by_reiden_lightman/) of Project M. I wanted to make something that users would see as a standard for the quality and time put into both full builds and music packages for Project M. A fresh build can be as simple as changing just the common5.pac and mu_menumain.pac for a new visual theme, and some can simply be using codes to add more stages and skins.  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the sheer quantity of changes BtBM could list on his build's page. Support for Hackless, Homebrew, and USB methods, new sound bank for the announcer and menu sounds, Apex quality stage select screen, voice banks for more than 10 characters, and plenty more to offer.  While it doesn't ooze of originality or creativity from the start, it does hold up in a bit of professionalism. I see the same professionalism that PMBR insists on when they add new content.  But it isn't without its flaws. Once again, I encounter a music pack that is full of JCeasar's music choices, which we all know are my least favorite. Really, I would never suggest any of JCeasar's choices. At least this time, I could see the changes from the music menu. But, not all stages had music replacements to keep the music fitting. I'm looking specifically at Project M Mushroom Kingdom which still has all the music from Shadow Moses Island. You could imagine how unfitting that sounded.  Also, the naming system was inconsistent. It should be in line with how HAL named their songs in the game. It should just be the song name (unless you plan on changing every single song name in the game to be consistent with your naming system). The only time a source is named is when the song has multiple versions or is a common name such as "Boss Battle" or "Final Boss".  Sources should be in parenthesis (unless, again,  you plan on changing all other names with sources to be in line with your naming system). The purpose of releasing a text list is so those who really want to know can see the sources.  There is one thing that I was thrilled about, and that was porting Skyloft over a different level and modifying the CSS order to keep the first page the same as P:M's official build. This gave Skyloft more music. Hell, I might do this in a minor update to my build.  Sidenote: I did notice that two tracks from Magmoor caverns were my choices as well. I'm assuming this was inspired by my build, and I'm quite flattered.  The second page was filled with some very excellently created stages that feel balanced and up to P:M standards. But some of the names had text that was almost too small to be readable. Some stages had shadows appearing in mid-air, and one stage (Great Bay) prevented AI from fighting back (which was disappointing). At least I didn't feel lag on 1v1 matches. You may experience lag on matches with 3 or more characters, especially if you use the imported character skins.  Speaking of skins, this build uses CBliss to add many more melee skins. Combined with Melee sound banks, this build felt more like Melee than P:M does for brief periods of time.  Melee sound bank you say? What about the announcer?  Yes, he's there, and he feels... inconsistent. None of the Brawl exclusive names were changed which makes it feel like an unfinished project.  ---  **Why you might want it**: If you're looking for even more Melee-ified brawl, then this really is a good build. There are more melee alternate skins and plenty of melee sound banks.  **Why you might not want it**: If you're not a fan of JCaesar's music pack or are simply tired of Feint - Homebound being used for menus, or are tired of music packs that are just rock and techno remixes of the original songs, I'd steer away from here. The music changes when you enter the Character select screen which simply isn't necessary. It's distracting.  There were some great sources here, and a lot of it was fitting. But a lot of it felt same-old same-old compared to so many music packs. There's also the issue of the half-done name-calling sound bank. Yes, this is going to continue to be a pet peeve of mine.  **Would I recommend it and why?** Of course. Those looking for support for hackless, homebrew, usb, and forwarder methods have something to gain from this build. Remember to make sure you're using his codeset. This screwed me up at first. Portraits match their skins, which is awesome.  **What about for tournaments?** A lot of these custom skins may throw off some spacing for some players. If you plan to use this at tournament, make sure the rest of the builds are using this too, and announce it a month in advanced to give players time to get used to it. Or, simply disallow these skins (except in the case that both player's agree it is okay).  **Score**: 8/10  Next time, I have a special treat. I'll be spending more time for a review of Calabrel's build (a review I'm taking up by my own request).  I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME PEOPLE. Link me to your builds and let me review them!  Another footnote: I saw that [my build was breifly part of the "popular hacks" section on brawlvault](http://i.imgur.com/mg90GHM.png). Thanks for that everyone who downloaded my build.   **Where to Get it**: http://www.mediafire.com/download/9u61fwuakl3b3dv/PM+Custom+Build.zip  **Build by**: SelenHaar6  First off, I knew very little what I was in for. Every build is different, and unlike me, not every build will have the goal of tournament usability like mine does. I'd put this build on the same level my friends make their builds. It feels like it's unfinished, but that's because I'm used to doing more to make sure my build is professional.  The build includes character models, music replacements, and 1 replacement in the info folder.  The characters feel uninspiring. To get the obvious and my biggest peeve out of the way, Cloud is used as a model over Ike. I get it, Cloud is an iconic character for Final Fantasy, but he's pretty damn over-rated considering 99% of casual modders who know about Final Fantasy use Cloud over Ike hacks. I used to be guilty of putting Squall over Ike, so I'm not excused, but I got past my own fanboy services.  We obviously have a huge pokemon fan. Much huger than I can stand for a build like this. In this game, pokemon are already considered more over-represented than the Mario cast. And now the custom skins overload the game with even more pokemon. I spotted so many pokemon skins that I saw a few duplicates from my friend's build.  To make matters worse, the character selection portraits weren't viewable. I had to take more time than necessary to figure out what was going where.  The music was average. A lot of it was taken straight from JCaesar's music pack which so far is definitely my least favorite music pack. Final Destination and Battlefield definitely sound as epic as ever, but everything else feels like a metal version of what used to be there for the sake of sounding hard-hitting and non-Nintendo.  Skyloft, for example, starts off with a metal cover sounding Ballad of the Goddess. I'm pretty sure a lot of people are doing this. Hell, even I used to be guilty of putting a rock cover of BotG on this stage.   To make THESE matters worse, he obvoiusly knows how to use Brawlbox to change a few text entries. And exporting the music track entries from info.pac allows you to put them right into mu_menumain.pac. It takes less than a minute, and if you're going to release a music pack, you should make the names visible in the menu.  **But I digress**  This is not too terrible of a build. It seems like an average casual build. There's no bugs, glitches, or crashes as far as I can tell. But, remember to defragment the card after you install it. Otherwise, you'll encounter audio issues.  **Why you might want it**: You like lots of music and fighter replacements  **Why you might not want it**: You're competitive and only use builds geared toward competitive play. If you're casual and frequently play with 4 players, you may experience a lot of lag on high polygon stages.  **Would I recommend it and why?** I wouldn't. Not yet anyway. It's clear that SelanHaar6 isn't new to file replacement, but could probably use some help getting Character selection portraits and song names in the music menus to be accurate. If you leave out the fighter package and just use his music, it's a decent music pack that I would probably allow at a tournament since none of the music is distracting.  **Score:** 4/10  Next time, I should be reviewing a build by BobbyTheBrokeMonarch.  Want me to review your build? Leave a comment and P:M me.      Well, I've been working on [my custom build](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wdrdb/project_m_302_build_by_reiden_lightman/) for a long time, and aside from cleaning up loops, it's good to be done. I've received some awesome feedback through comments and PMs, so thanks for that. I'll re-upload my build over the weekend for those who really care about the small details.  BUT, as a designer, and just an avid smash player/modder, I wanted to see some other's builds. I have 3 SD cards that I switch between and I keep a master copy of my build on my external HDD. I can afford to see others' builds. If you'd like me to do a review of your build, leave a link to it here.  First come, first serve. Be patient as bigger builds need more time to review.

The desire of this build is to add a fresh look and feel to Project M while   maintaining the original characters and stages to stay tournament-friendly. Those   of you with custom stages and character models can continue to enjoy them.  This set includes a common5.pac file that is ready for tournament that   illustrates neutral, counterpick, and casual-only stages just like high-profile   tournaments.  **General Changes**  * New brighter snow-styled menu theme. * New announcer voice and menu sound effects. * New Sonic sound effects. * Japanese voices for Fox and Falco. * Over 100 music replacements.

Here they are. They will be an optional download for those who load through USB when I release my Project M build. This will also include the updated music pack I've put together.      http://imgur.com/rBnsR4C  http://imgur.com/k7xDQ2p  This is what I'm talking about.  Edit: Wow, downvoted for a legitimate question and a serious concern. Thanks assholes.   It was recent. It was called "Why it is important that the winner is who it is".  I wanted to read it but wanted to see the matches first and now it looks like I am too late. Anybody know what it said?      Hello everybody. First off, congratulations to Calabrel on his release of his entire Project M build. I've been playing around with it now and again, and I plan to do a written review of it later after I'm done sorting through everything it has to offer.  I did release my current music pack last Christmas in 2013 and I promised an update when I reached an even higher goal of replacements (and even more surprise replacements to find). I've been rearranging a lot of the songs which has delayed the update.  The update will be available both as a download by itself and as part of my full build (which will take far less room than Calabrel's). I'm not, however, planning to do any sort of stage replacements to keep my build acceptable for most small and mid-sized tournaments.  I'd like to give you guys a few videos as previews of what I've managed to find room for in my build. I hope this gets you to look forward to it. I hope you try out my build. If you haven't tried Calabrel's build and you have an extra SD card, I suggest you try that out as well.  * [Hyrule Field Reorchestrated](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpRasV4y_9M) * [Magnus's Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kPwTTQb6D8) * [Revived Power](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ParUJ9Ll7dk) * [Mr. Music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4cSCf83gn8) * [Bring Me To Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxaaGgTQYM) * [Boss Battle Kirby 64](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpiyrB-R11k) * [Bounty of a Brain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovZgfrBQtZY) * [Green Hill Acapella](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbVZPu_JM6I) * [Corneria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxa_8FSTkXQ) * [Aoi Hana](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGkhE49sgus)  A reminder: I take great care in my brstm files by editing them in audacity first to take out slow beginnings, normalize them to 0db, and make them easily loopable (if necessary).  If you'd like more previews, or have a song suggestion, leave your thoughts in the comments!   I've made a few changes to the Apex common5.pac file.  * Recolored all stage icons and map previews. * Changed "Banned" word to "Casual" * Changed Portraits for Dry Bowser and Shadow Peach * Filled in missing pixels on two of Falco's Special Costume Portraits (regular and blue)  The logo still says Apex 2014.

Our ability to recall differs from person to person. But imagine what it will be like when you can finally recall everything you have ever done. Like when you were born kicking and screaming and still covered in the liquid from your mother's womb. Not knowing what was going on, just screaming in anger and sadness because you weren't comfortable where you were. The air may have been too cold or too hot.  What about the first outfit your mother or father ever put on you. You didn't know what color it was. You didn't associate any sounds or names with what you saw or knew. Talking and making sounds like the others around you was so desirable. If only you could tell them what you were feeling or what you wanted. Until then you scream and yell until your discomfort was handled.  When you said your first words, your parents put it into memory. You weren't concerned with it at all. Did you have fun pretending to recall when you said your first words whenever your parents told you what they were? If you take all of that time, it would equate to about an hour of pretending time.  The truth is, most of us cannot recall anything out of what has been mentioned. It's unfortunate. It would be easier to learn from past mistakes if we could recall anything that we have heard or read or did. History class would be a lot easier. Where is our dedication to remembering? We throw away our memories like candy wrappers for someone else to scoff at.  When did you first pretend or make believe or convince yourself that something was real? I bet you felt completely foolish thinking back on it. Especially if the first pretend idea you had was a boyfriend or girlfriend.  Fast forward through your years and recognize all of your firsts. Oh how so many of them seem so insignificant compared to what you have accomplished. Your first bike, first ride sans training wheels, first game or video game, first phone or cell phone, first graduation. Your parents likely held a plethora of pictures to perpetuate the memories of all of your achievements which now seem like such small stuff. You're on to bigger and better things. Cars, movies, social links, jobs, work, having your own money and being your own person.  If you can recall all of this, it is likely that you have eidetic memory. Or it could just be the knife in your back.   I saw a post earlier saying a 3.02 patch was released and that it fixed a couple game-breaking bugs. Now, when I try to download a set, it doesn't download. It just takes me back to the Projectmgame.com homepage. Are the downloads offline right now?  ~~If 3.02 is reality, what files do~~ I ~~need to patch over to avoid~~ [have] to redo 4 hours of modding.  IT'S REAL:  CHANGES   Kirby's Aura Sphere storage bug is fixed.   Roy's Final Smash will no longer clank   Flaco's forward smash will now sparkle around his legs instead of his arms.   Names on the Character Selection Screen have been moved down to their original positions   Okay, let's stop it with clogging up this subreddit with alternate costume ideas. I'm pretty sure a lot of us are getting very bored with them. Just post them in here.  (You're welcome)  MAJOR EDIT:  Seriously, guys, be realistic at least. The PMBR says that they are not going to add in any alternate costumes that change who the character is. Butterfly metaknight is still Metaknight. Dr. Mario is still Mario. Mr L is still Luigi. Shadow Peach is still Peach. And so on. Stuff like Skull Kid over Toon Link or Master Chief over Samus is simply not going to happen.  THE PMBR ALSO SAID that they are NOT going to do megaevolutions for Pokemon. Those suggestions are getting very old. Remember that every reply to this is going into my inbox.

Here they are, ready for you to use. Have fun.  Bootscreen texture goes into projectm/pf/menu/strap/strap_en.pac      This is for all of the Yugioh players who think activating any sort of effect means that you are "chaining". I want to clarify this to hopefully end the ruthless onslaught of (necessary) comments explaining this.  How often have you seen the following (or something similar) in a post or comment?   My opponent summoned *XXX monster*. Can I chain *XXX card* to that summon?  The answer is no. You cannot chain to that summon. Chaining to a summon simply doesn't exist in the game. And here's why.  **[Read this if you don't know what a chain is or are not aware that they resolve backwards.](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Chain)**  **Starting a Chain**  Summons don't start a chain. Special summoning as a result of an effect doesn't start a chain either. it's only the result of an effect.  After summon, two windows pass: summon negation then summon response. The first window doesn't pass if the summon was the result of an effect. The second one can if it was the last thing to resolve. Activating an effect in either window starts a chain. Adding another chain link on top of that is considered "chaining".  **What Chaining Really Is**  Chaining ONLY happens after a chain link is already started. For example, if my opponent activated a Spell/Trap or Monster Effect, I can chain to that. If my opponent summoned a monster, I cannot chain to that. But I can start a chain. After I start a chain, my opponent can chain to that. In short, chaining is "adding a chain to a chain that already exists". Responding to a summon is not chaining.  **Summons don't start a chain**  Summons don't start a chain. Effects start a chain. Even if a monster is special summoned by an effect, it doesn't start a chain. The Special Summon is only a result of that chain link resolving. It does not start a new chain or add to the current chain link.  Non-Inherent special summons are often called "summons that start a chain". This is misleading and I believe is the case for players thinking that chaining to a summon is possible. These summons don't start a chain, an effect in a chain resulted in the special summon of a monster. For these summons, there is no summon negation window, which is why *Thunder King Rai-Oh* cannot negate the effects of *Geartown* or *Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos*.  **Pseudo-inherent Normal/Special Summons**  Some special summons happen from applying an effect of a continuous card. Continuous cards act like lingering effects that are applied as long as the card is face-up. Unless the effect has a **:** or **;**, the effect does not start a chain. This is true for cards like *Fire Formation - Tensu* and *Hazy Pillar*. Therefore, a player need not declare the card effect's activation and wait for a response. It is however common courtesy to say why the monster was normal or special summoned.  **So what did we learn today?/Summary for the Stupid**  * Summons do not start a chain * Starting a chain is not the same as Chaining * Chaining refers to adding a chain to a pre-existing chain, not starting a chain * Summons don't start a chain, effects do.  ^(Some of this may be wrong due to tricky wording in how game mechanics work for continuous effects. A more experienced judge may please correct this.)  Edit: added some examples. Thanks Ultimate_spaghetti. Also italicized card names.  Edit2: Trimmed the fat.  EDIT3: A couple important side-notes courtesy of Krylife  Cards activating and effect activating are different. There are spells/traps that have effects that activate separately from the card's activation. Best example is *Grand Spellbook Tower*.  Chaining refers to the activation of a card or effect. Resolving happens backward after the chain is built, and new chains cannot be added during resolution.  Chains don't special summon a monster. An effect that resolves can summon a monster.   **Video Preview**   http://youtube.com/watch?v=Skbq-lsum6Y  **Downloads**  *Full*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8FLBcRk6Sp6TU1rNkdzMGhYeXc/edit?usp=sharing  *Lite*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8FLBcRk6Sp6Y2JCd1g2a0JDQ0U/edit?usp=sharing  Please note: This should be the last time I post about my music pack until I update it with more songs.         **[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/IulMVLW.png)**  *Deck*  * 1 Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos * 2 Fire King High Avatar Garunix * 3 Fire King Avatar Barong * 1 Fire King Avatar Yaksha * 3 Hazy Flame Cerberus * 2 Hazy Flame Peryton * 2 Hazy Flame Hyppogrif * 1 Hazy Flame Griffin * 3 Flamvell Firedog * 1 Flamvell Magician * 2 Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Bear * 2 Onslaught of the Fire Kings * 2 Circle of the Fire Kings * 2 Rekindling * 2 Hazy Pillar * 2 Mystical Space Typhoon * 2 Forbidden Lance * 2 Fire Formation - Tenki * 1 Dark Hole * 1 Solemn Warning * 1 Bottomless Trap Hole * 1 Mirror Force * 1 Torrential Tribute  *Extra Deck*  * 1 Star Eater * 1 Crimson Blader * 1 Scrap Dragon * 2 Gagaga Cowboy * 1 Maestroke * 1 Daimond Dire Wolf * 1 Photon Papilloperative * 1 Utopia * 1 Crazy Box * 3 Hazy Flame Basiltrice * 1 Ptolemy M7 * 1 Photon Strike Bounzer  ---  **Notes:**  Please, this is a budget deck^1. It's also a fun deck. If I could easily afford and pull wolfbarks like everybody else instead of being a shit-pull magnet, I'd easily have Wolfbark in this.  I tried Hazy Flame Sphynx paired with Plaguespreader Zombie. It wasn't consistent enough to work. Pleaguespreader was too hard to have in the Grave reliably. Sphynx was often absent when the right time came around.  When Hazy Flame Hydra comes out, it will most likely wholeheartedly replace Hazy Flame Hyppogrif. I feel at 2 would be just fine since it puts the deck at 5 L6 Rekindling summonables. It's also stronger and works with Basiltrice to make a 5M Basiltrice much easier.  I had considered taking Blaster out. But, he's still very good in this deck at 1. He gives me Star Eater^1 plays about once every 10-15 duels. I won't get rid of Ptolemy^1 unless I pick up constellars again.   Yes 2 cowboy. There have been times where I wish I had that 2nd cowboy to do a 2nd rekindling into another cowboy for that last 800 for game.  Thanks to 2 Tenki, that's right just two, I am theoretically guaranteed to open with a monster, and I have better top decks. Makes 3 Onslaughts less necessary.  I know I ask for a lot of help with this deck, but since this is the most agressive and spamfilled deck I run, I'm not experienced with building it that way. I always end up trying to make some sort of control deck to better fit my more comfortable playstyle. Once in a while I OTK, but I kinda get lucky and go for obvious ones. Rekindling's not hard to OTK with in the right decks, and it probably should go down to 1 or even 0 if the right decks takes advantage of it too much.  ^(1. Star Eater and Ptolemy were both gifts from my girlfriend /u/Lily247 so giving those up simply isn't an option. Shoutout to my girl.)      This is the trailer for my new music pack. I'll be releasing it on Christmas on Brawl Vault and I'll also leave a link here. Check back here or on the video to hear more teasers.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5mfeboGjTU  Teaser Links  * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3GMM93e3h0 * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ItuJxLAUI   Here are my thoughts documenting my thoughts on what should happen vs what might happen.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTrDnAhLly0 feature=c4-overview list=UU1JChc4RHMrMc5KGnGPln2A  EDIT: Heroes aren't the problem with stratos, and hero players whining over it need to stop complaining. It was part of an FTK that also involved divine wind. My GF told me about that so I don't have all the details. Stratos was also used in teledad as I understand and players trying to bring it back after certain cards were back up to 3 also didn't help stratos stay out of the forbidden section.      Well, everyone's hyped, and now there's more people than ever on this iconic day asking so many questions. (So I'll probably be adding more questions and their answers to this)  ---    **Q: What time is it being released?**  *A*: Nobody knows. I'm not even sure the PMBR knows exactly when. Their site is down, and they will need time to finalize the demo, export it for all methods of loading, and fix their site. Not to mention, UPLOADING the hack.  **Q: How big is the new update? And/or Do I need a bigger SD card?**  *A*: It was said by a backroom member that it will still fit on a 512mb SD card. We would all still recommend at least 1GB so you can add as much custom goodies as you want.  **Q: Will stage x or feature y be introduced?**  *A*: If you don't know, or haven't seen it in a stream, default this answer to no.  **Q: Does anybody know what they did to character x?**  *A*: Please assume nobody knows. You'll know in less than 24 hours.  **Q: Will my custom content still work with P:M?**  *A*: If it's music or a simple texture or stage replacement, it should still work. If it's something fancy like a stage selection screen or weird code-set that adds more stages (dot dot dot), assume it won't be able to be carried over. Huge fancy mods to P:M (which is already a mod) should be reimplemented to plant bugs.  **Q: What's the first thing you're gonna do?**  *A*: Slay the magic dragon :P what do you think? My assumption is that most players will be trying either new characters, new costumes, and/or turbo mode. I will also assume that most people will be making sure their custom content works. ^(Some people may be trying 1P mode)  **Q: why do ppl even use their own custom stuff? it just adds to the loading and cause problems, nd they dont often look that good either** -SuperBARN  *A*: People like to have fun. Even the backroom members and testers had some fun with some custom costumes and music.  **Q: Question for [OP] because I feel like it. What's your favorite alt so far?** -Nyan_Ryan  *A*: It was teased in the alt costume release, so I'm hoping that Jigglypuff's crown is really back. Puff is one of my more fun mains.  **Q: Will the patch notes be released soon? :] On a side note, if they release a mega lucario alt, my hype will transcend reality** -Caketastic  *A*: The PMBR probably has a lot of patch notes compared to 2.6b. So far, what we know about the patch notes is the following: Yoshi, Kirby, Samus, Ice Climbers, Olimar, Roy, and Mewtwo added to the roster. Samus has new ice beam mode and morph ball crawl. Turbo mode added. Curry changed to Turbo item. Alternate costumes added. Stage X replaced with Peache's Castle. Wifi Waiting room now available to play on.  As far as in depth patch notes go, it could be another week and a half before they can gather up every change they have implemented.  **Q: Will all these alts come with the download or do I need to get them separately?** -Clayton_11  *A*: It's safe to assume that anything that is officially part of Project M will always come with the download. So, if the Project M BR announced that it will be a part of the next set, you will not need to download it separately.  **Q: I'm emulating P:M, how exactly do I change from 2.6 to 3.0?** -Skintay12  *A*: It should be as simple as setting up 3.0 the same way you set up 2.6. So remember to take out that virtual SD card and make a new one with 3.0 in it instead of 2.6.  **Q: Do you think they're more prepared for the amount of people wanting to grab the download this time around? Site's been down all day and it feels like there's 10x as many people that are awaiting the results.** -Rawkobo  *A*: hard to say without proper knowledge of networking or what the PMBR is doing to prepare (if anything). If they are doing anything in anticipation of huge download traffic, things should be just fine. And if not, some of us will just have to be patient.  **Q: Does anybody know how turbo mode works yet? As in, how do I cancel my attacks?** -PlaptheAwesome  *A*: I don't know the inner workings of  how Turbo mode is made possible, but it allows you to cancel any successful attack into another attack. There's no sequence or button to press to cancel an attack, just perform another.  **Q: So all we will need to do is put this on an ad card and pop it in and 3.0 will work hackless?** -Andy-J  *A*: Not quite. There are a lot of video tutorials on how to do this. Start up brawl regularly. Then insert your SD card. Wait a few seconds for it to load. Then load the stage builder. Some scary stuff will happen, but then you'll see a menu with the option "start game". From there, you start the game, and clever programming takes care of the rest.  ---  With all the hype, I just wanted the subreddit to not get a whole bunch of threads asking the same thing. Ask away, and backroom member, feel free to correct anything or answer any questions that are found in the comments.      I'm here to promote my first self-published book. Am I really resorting to using reddit to shamelessly promote my story? Of course. I wouldn't blame anybody else for doing it. We all need a little help.  My book, Oh Broken Angel is now available on Amazon.com and through the createspace e-store.  For the Christmas season, I have a few promotions going on. This is a great present for that girl who just can't stop reading. Mom? Girlfriend? Sister? Don't hesitate to take advantage of this.  **Promotion 1**  You can buy my book through Amazon.com. If you buy the Print version, you can then purchase the kindle edition for only a dollar more. That's two copies you can either choose to keep and/or give as a gift.

[Link](https://www.createspace.com/3741006)  Code: 4FQRDXPB  **Last Note**  If you do decide to read (or even just read the previews), it would be greatly appreciated that you rate my product and give an honest review.   Well, I recently got criticizes for taking ideas from a Gravekeeper's deck that went top 8 in a reigional. This wasn't a deck full of meta calls. The recent winning geargia deck was pretty risky and fascinating to see what he was doing. Calling that he would be seeing more Elemental Dragons than any other deck was a pretty smart call, although unfortunate that he supposedly had a rough time against Evilswarm.  But why are so many people dismissing it as luck? Or some fortunate meta-call? This was a smart move on the player's part. He wasn't some no-life who came from nowhere. He'd been part of the scene for a long time apparently and knew about what playing smart really means.  So all I'm trying to say is that when something that's not tier-1 (or meta) wins, don't rush to stupid conclusions.  In the end, mediocre decks will perform as such, even with their better hands. I know this from playing Hazy Kings in a few tournaments. Each player gets where they get for a reason, whether it be playing the top deck or playing against the top deck.  **Side 1:** It's just a lucky Metacall  **Side 2:** It's a mediocre deck that got lucky  Although Side 1 is closer, I can't stand people dismissing anything that's not a tier 1 win as pure luck. It would be a lot nicer if, when someone gets a little smart or creative, we don't start slitting eachothers' throats online because it's different.   **Intro**  I've been continuing to test Gravekeeper's and figure out where this deck lacks and what decks this deck doesn't stand up too well against. In my testing, my side-deck has shifted quite a bit. I'm still finding Penguin Soldiers a little more useful (and a lot cheaper) than Fossile Dyna. Didn't run into enough burn decks to justify running Des Wombat. I'd save that card for a local meta call. Even with EEV, decks heavy with back-row are a scary thing to go up against. I'm looking at you Fire Fists. So without further ado, here's my updated list.  [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/pddkshD.png)  [Text List](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65160123/trading/decklist.txt)  **FAQ**:  Q: 2 Upstart Goblin?  A: Yes. 2 Upstart Goblins. They speed up the deck considerably in game one and can always be sided out for something faster or more needed considering what you get.  Q: No Daimond Dire Wolf?  A: I've been thinking about it and considering it thanks to the reprint. There has been times where I seriously need to get rid of a problem monster.  Q: What decks are you still having trouble against?  A: I'm still tanking it again Vampires and Fire Fists. Fire Fists just keep that backrow coming and somehow have an answer to everything I do. And Vampires have their stupid-as-hell field card (which conveniently gets rid of necrovalley.  Q: Why the change to 2 MST and 2 Forbidden Dress?  A: Partly Frogs. The rest is other decks with similar back-row line-ups and even no line-ups. It's comforting knowing I can use two of my cards just just to save an important card but allow my opponent to waste their card in the process (if I do it right).  **Cost**  Main Deck: Around $120 but as low as $80 if you keep your rarities low.  Side Deck: Should be anywhere from $40 to $50 as long as you don't go bat crazy on EEV.  Extra Deck: Around $25 for the essentials. Around. $55 for the full thing.  **New Support**  Shut up about them. I'm not building this for the future. I'm building this for the current format.         For me, I can't help but put [Other M's version of Ridley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fje8t9Jyy-o) on a Metroid Stage (Norfair being the fitting one).   http://imgur.com/a/zBoDx#0  My album of High Resolution scans which I will do my best to update every once in a while. I got a lot of requests that I simply couldn't fulfill, but I did as much as I could. My apologies if I didn't get to your request, but I either don't have the card or couldn't find a friend to let me borrow it.         In Project M 3.0, we're getting a full cast of characters and then some, and we're all ready and excited to try out the new characters (most of us for Roy and Mewtwo, but who really cares?).  Since all of these characters that we've missed are finally coming together for Project M 3.0, will the single player modes finally be stable to play? I've had problems in stadiums, Classic, and SSE when non-selectable characters showed up. Only non-problem was Home-run contest for obvious reasons.  Also, was wondering about stadium records for Roy and Mewtwo. Will they actually be able to store their own records for Break the Targets and Home Run Contest etc?  A simple response from a PMBR should suffice.   I'm looking to get rid of **[this mat](http://client-cdn.crystalcommerce.com/photo/ideal808/file/d0e62ab7c408b464c63e265ccf1c2f0e/large/ycs%20san%20diego%202013%20playmat.jpg)** that I'm seriously not going to use anymore. It's going for 40 dollars on ebay, but I'm willing to go as low as 30 dollars wish included shipping. If you're outside the US, I'll have to charge more to cover the added insane shipping costs.  I also have plenty of miscellaneous bulk from Shadow Specters. Willing to sell it for super super low. (5+shipping).

Keep it random and entertaining. Keep in mind this thread isn't for actual rulings. It's for fun.  ---  **EXAMPLE POST**  If my opponent attacks with his pancake stack and the pad of butter hits one of my cards, does the sleeve's effect protect it from being destroyed?  ---  There you go! Have fun! I also forgot to mention that you are allowed to post fake rulings in response to other's entries. Go bat shit crazy y'all.  Edit: I'll send the user who posts the most entertaining post on this thread some cards from my recent pulls.   Keep them requests coming. Lol. Of course, I don't have an infinite amount of cards, not do I come close to having every card imaginable. But I can always try to borrow what I need. So here it is, 600dpi scan of Gagaga Cowboy. 1388x2044  **[Link to Image](http://i.imgur.com/MzhbWgc.jpg)**      Special thanks to Lily247 for letting me scan one of her favorite cards, and what's probably her favorite ghost rare. And, we all know this is her favorite ritual monster! IT'S A FAIRY!  Shout out to you!  **[Link to Image](http://i.imgur.com/ikR5gQ3.jpg)**   I had a scanner and a Royal Tribute available. Naturally, I got bored. So I decided to see if these scans I find on the internet were really as high quality as they get. Turns out, 500x500 card art at its max is pretty shit. There aren't people scanning at 600 DPI like I do. Just the art for the card came out to 1000x1000. I'm tempted to make a Royal Tribute mat out of this.  Note, the image of the quality good be better. But it's not the most high quality scanner.  **[Link to high quality image of Royal Tribute](http://i.imgur.com/fb7LOgq.jpg)**   I'm back with another game-ish thread. Everyone likes to be theoretical. I mean, why not? It's always fun to think about the what-ifs. Even as serious players, it's great to take a break and have a little fun with out brains.  ---  So, to get us going, here's my question for today...  **What if Konami changed the rules so that any normal monster need not be tributed to be normal summoned?**  How would this effect your deck? How would this effect other decks? Would normal monsters get more support? Is there anything they would need to add to this rule to keep it balanced? Assume Gemini and similar cards do not count. The monster card must be yellow, not brown, for this rule to apply.  ---  For me? I would probably run a huge beatstick deck that featured huge normal-monster beaters and skill drain. Of course, I'd probably still use Malefics in it, but it would be awesome to see what kind of cool new decks could be derived from here. Hell, I wonder if this would get any cards on the banlist.      I'm not going to make anybody pay. I have some free time though, and I wanted to make some playmats. But I need some ideas. So why doesn't everyone submit an idea so I can see what I can do?  [Chaos Goddess Mat](http://i.imgur.com/nXPasmF.jpg)   **[Dark Magician of Chaos YCS Mat](http://i.imgur.com/IKK2xOo.jpg).** Hoping for $35.  I have some Bujins. No Yamato, sorry. But I have  * 1 Mikazuchi * 2 Centipede * 2 Quilin * 3 Crane * 1 Kagutsuchi * 2 Susanowo  All 1st ed except the Quilins  Also have Shadow Specter pulls. Multiples of almost all the commons. Quite a few of the rares. Couple Super Rares. Someone already got the Felgrand. Sorry. Just ask about them. Notable ones are  * Dragard * Labradorite Dragon * Number 46: Dragulon * Numbr 64 and 65 * Battlin Boxers * some misc bujins * Ghostrick Jionshi and Specter * Mythic water/tree Dragons  Let's make some deals.  ^(Someone else got to most of my ghostricks already.)  **Not for Trade. Paypal only.**   I had a gif saved on an old account I threw away. the title was something similar to  "when I'm feeling down, I always look at this gif. It never makes me feel any better."  It had a pot-selling pony holding out her hoof and the words "eat a d*ck" appearing after sparkling in the BG. I wasn't able to find it, and I'm out of search ideas.  Just asking if somepony can help me find it so I can re-save it on this user account.      Let's play another Yugioh Based Creativity Game!  Did you miss my first game where we made small tweaks to archetypes to make them tier 1 matierial (pun intended, hence the mispelling)? Well, fret not, I'm back with another game.  ---  **Archetype Popcorn Game**  Here are the rules:  * You post ONE card in an archetype you make up. * Let others reply to that post adding to that archetype. * No replying to add more to your own archetype. * Leave your archetype name in *italics* and the card name in *bold*.  That's all there is to it. But, please, don't just break the archetypes. Be respectful, not a douche.  ---  I'll be leaving my submission in the comments.   So I have a friend who wants to build ghostricks. She went to the sneak peek and pulled quite a few. But the kicker is, she pulled a Bujin Kasauchi (i forget it's exact name). You know, the one going for 30 dollars. Of course, she could have sold it and finished her current deck.  And she knows I wanted bujins. She knows I would have just loved to have one meaningful bujin in my life.  She fucking traded it for a one dollar ghostrick lantern.  Never again will I let her go alone without telling her to check every fucking price she can. She called the excuse that she didn't know the price. She had her phone on her the whole time. She could have checked. Ebay and Yugiohprices.com are a thing.  I'm sorry, I'm just fucking pissed she had to spend 20 dollars, get a great card, and give it away like table scraps when she needed the money for her deck.   Day 6  I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. Who isn't hungry when they wake up? There was hardly anything to eat other than the cereal in the corner pantry which never seems to run out. I shouldn't even be eating this cereal because of my alergies, but it keeps my stomach full. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation?  I put the milk back in the mini fridge in the corner. The only other room I have access to is the restroom. It's been getting more and more empty every day. Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and noticed my toothbrush was gone. I at least used mouth wash to help my mouth feel fresh.  Then I got to doing the only thing I know that takes the migrane away. Playing games. I have at least a dozen board games to play with and even a bunch of video games from the 1990s. I had plenty to keep myself busy and entertained. What sort of game will I have to resort to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable.  So I went to a board game today. I pretend there are four other players there. I roll play them. Their names are Dan, Nathan, and Felix. They play with me. We're all psychic. Only with each other. It makes Clue no fun. I'm just waiting for that to disappear so I don't have to look at it any more.  Today I found this journal and a pensil. I think they want me to write in it, so I am. I can use it to keep notes for myself about what I've been playing them. Soon I'll hear the knocking. That's when I have to go to sleep. The knocking just keeps hapenning if I don't. I can't open the door. I'm not allowed.  ---  Day 7  I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. It was the same thing yesterday and it's going to be the same thing today. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation? I keep telling myself so I can put up with the symptoms.  Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and remembered that my toothbrush had disappeared. The mouth wash was gone too, as if it had vanished. I couldn't do anything but leave my mouth rinsed with hot water. I was prepared to take a shower today, but the shower curtain disappeared as well as the showerhead.  I got back to playing games again. What sort of games will I be here to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable. I'm rewriting this to remind myself that the games are worth it. They're worth it over laying all day with a head-ache. I can't sleep as long as the light is kept on.  So I went to a board game today. I pretend there are four other players there. I roll play them. Their names are Dan, Nathan, and Felix. They play with me. We're all psychic. Only with each other. It makes Clue no fun. I'm just waiting for that to disappear so I don't have to look at it any more.  I figured out why I can't use this journal to take notes on my games. They took the pages of yesterday's journal. I'm going to test to see if they take these pages too. It's almost time for me to get to sleep. With a migrane of course.  ---  Day 8  I'm still waking up with a migrane. It's still not changing. The migrane I bear while I'm not playing. I'm beginning to smell. Is this waht they want? For me not to be able to do what I want? The cereal changed, but I'm still alergic to it. The rash is still just as bad from this one as it was from the last.  I'm getting a bit sick of the board games. Some of them are missing. I won't be able to finish the game of Life I started yesterday. It was a 1 vs 1 match between Dan and me. I'm digging into the video games now. One system, one controller, one TV. All in my one little room. You know, if you don't count the restroom. i don't even count it as a room anymore. Nothing but a couples towest and toilet paper.  I kept myself entertained for the entire day. Not very hard. I got through three simple games. My head didn't feel too great while switching, but a few minutes at a time isn't nearly as bad as the hours I spend waking up and going to sleep.  My last pages were missing. I'm wondering why you're taking them. Why do you want my random thoughts? What the fuck is this going to prove? I don't even know where I am.  ---  Day 9  I still don't have a goddamn clue. What the hell do you want? Stop taking my pages. I just want to be able to re-read them once. Why are you making them disappear? What else are you going to make disappear? I'm out of food. What more can you take away from me.  You can't possibly think I'd rather be hungry than have a rash. I'm getting sick from the hunger. It's almost worst than the pain in my head. Is this the kind of notes you want?  The games are still keeping me entertained. They're keeping the headache away while they can. The ones I played yesterday are gone. If I'm not allowed to play games more than once, I'll eventually be left with nothing but a headache.  ---  Day 10  Bastards. The first thing to go was my bed. Then the chairs. Then the table. Eventually, everything else. What good is a game without the controller? What good is this last board game without others? Without friends? Without companionship? Worthless. This experiment is worthless. What you're doing is worthless. You're worthless.  Am I worthless? Is that it? Am I just a worthless mouse to you? I'll break through this door eventually. It has to break some time.  ---  Day 11  FUCK YOU   **Calling all fellow Gravekeeper's players.**  So a lot of us have a great time building up a main deck but don't quite get the hang of building side-decks.  I can already hear you saying, "Every deck needs sides based on its own meta and where it's going to be used. Just adjust it to your locals. You're a faggot. Get off Reddit. Fuck you."  Of course, we all have out meta-specific and locals-specific sides. But leave that aside. What cards are you siding and why do you think they're worth siding in Gravekeeper's?  * Penguin Soldier: Flip-activated Compulsory on crack, or a Spy Bluff. If you're opponent knows GK's, they're going to destroy your facedowns, not attack them. * Imperial Iron Wall: Works against plenty of decks, especially the big daddy of them all, Dragon Rulers. * Dimensional ~~Prison~~ Fissure: Helps against Mermails. Gravekeeper's can fill up their grave by using Xyz based plays to avoid dead Stele. * Thunder King Rai-Oh: Heavy Stun. Enough said. * Maxx "C": Opponent spamming the summons? Let's fix that. * Veiler: Because there are those problematic effects we just need to stop for one turn. * Gozen Match: All Dark Monsters except for 1 Earth that normally never hits the field anyways. Penguin Soldier still possible to set. * Rivalry of the Warlord: Huge ammount of Spellcasters. So why not? * Deck Devistation Virus: Usable with Descendant or Assailant while Necrovalley is on the field. * Eradicator Epidemic Virus: Usable with Malefic Stardust Dragon, Malefic Cyber End Dragon, and Master Key Beetle.  What sides did I miss? What reasons do you run your specific sides?  Edit: fixed mistake found by DiskJockey13   Okay everybody, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to help us get a little creative about what we think of our favorite archetypes and what we really want from them. If this gets some good reaction and discussion going, I'll be happy to continue to post these kinds of games on here.  ---  **Ground Rules**  * *DON'T MOD THE BAN LIST. This is a game for creativity, not posting your ban-list wish list.* * Don't create new cards for the main deck. Limit extra deck cards to 1 if you can. * Don't completely change their design. Just tweak it to make it more competitive. * Don't aim to break your archetype. That's boring. We just want to compete. * Do have some fun. It's a game. * Do discuss other's changes and respond to others changing yours.  ---  **My Submission**: Gravekeeper's  I love Gravekeeper's. They're slow. They're controlling. But, terribly inconsistent for most people. They're big disadvantage is not being able to recycle Necrovalley, being relatively weak without it, and resorting to Malefics to handle big beaters. Regardless, since Royal Tribute is so busted, they don't need many cards to be reworked. So here's my tweaks.  * Gravekeeper's Guard: Flip; Return 1 monster on the field to the controller's hand, and if you do, you can special summon 1 level 4 or lower Gravekeeper's monster from your graveyard. This effect cannot be negated by "Necrovalley". * Gravekeeper's Commandant: You can discard this card to the Graveyard; add 1 "Necrovalley" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand. * Gravekeeper's Stele: Target 2 "Gravekeeper's" monsters in your graveyard and/or Banished; add those targets to your hand. * You can Tribute 1 other face-up "Gravekeeper's" monster to target 1 card your opponent controls; destroy that target. If a card effect activates that would negate this monster's effect: you can normal summon 1 Level 4 "Gravekeeper's" monster from your hand in addition to your normal summon or set.  What these tweaks take care of:  * Gravekeeper's now have a way to SS from the grave without it being a +0/-0 trap. * Gravekeeper's can now Recycle Necrovalley if need be. * Gravekeeper's no longer tremble at bottomless trap hole. * Gravekeeper's can set up an Xyz play in case their main play doesn't work out. Makes Key beetle more consistent.   We're looking for ideas for bots that could help spruce up /r/YGOSales and make it more interesting. The same goes for anything else. If you have an idea to make /r/YGOSales a better place, don't hesitate to leave a comment here or message the moderators.      **[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/NoiyRHF.png)**  Disclaimer: I obviously didn't just pop this up off the top of my head. This is what I've arrived at after testing two different builds for a few days. One build was almost verbatim a profile I got from a recent regional topper (top 8). The other is almost verbatim SlimXTeamSymmetry.  Now that you know that, Here is the deck list.  ---  *Monsters*  * 3 Gravekeeper's Descendant * 3 Gravekeeper's Recruiter * 3 Gravekeeper's Spy * 3 Gravekeeper's Commandant * 1 Gravekeeper's Assailant * 1 Tsukuyomy * 1 Maxx "c" * 1 Thunder King Rai-oh  *Spells*  * 3 Necrovalley * 3 Mystical Space Typhoon * 2 Pot of Duality * 2 Upstart Goblin * 2 Gravekeeper's Stele * 1 Book of Moon * 1 Royal Tribute * 1 Dark Hole  *Traps*  * 2 Fiendish Chain * 2 Vanity's Emptiness * 2 Mirror Force * 1 Compulsory Evacuation Device * 1 Bottomless Trap Hole * 1 Solemn Warning  *Side Deck*  * 2 Effect Veiler * 1 Tsukuyomi * 1 Maxx "C" * 1 Pot of Duality * 1 Allure of Darkness * 1 Dimensional Fissure * 2 Imperial Iron Wall * 2 Deck Devistation Virus * 2 Gozen Match * 1 Royal Decree * 1 Eradicator Epidemic Virus  *Extra Deck*  * 1 Ally of Justice Catastor * 1 Wind-Up Zenmaines * 1 Leviair the Sea Dragon * 1 Number 17: Leviathan Dragon * 1 Gagaga Cowboy * 1 Abyss Dweller * 1 Maestroke * 1 Steelswarm Roach * 1 Wind-Up Zenmaester * 1 Number 21: Blackship of Corn * 1 Photon Papilloperative * 2 Number 66: Master Key Beetle * 1 Number 39: Utopia * 1 Gem-Knight Pearl  ---  I am welcoming feedback. If you think you have an idea to make this deck more consistent or faster than it already is, please let me know. Do you think I should be running some weird unknown tech? Just let me know.      I made a new account since my Rifall nickname is wearing off. My friends call me reiden, and Rifall is getting hard to remember, and it's no fun to keep correcting people on the pronounciation.

 WELCOME TO EMNITY LAB CORP  PLEASE ENTER CREDENTIALS  LOADING  LOADING  LOADING  WELCOME BACK JACOB LOCKHARD  RECEIVING REQUEST FOR FOLDER 18003429   LOADING...  REQUEST COMPLETED  RECEIVING REQUEST FOR FILE CODENAME: WELLSPRING  LOADING  REQUEST COMPLETED  OPENING   Tuesday, October 23rd, 2013  7:35 AM  Emnity Labs  Subject #2907  Class: Fertile  Topic: Wellspring  Transcript of Recording  Subject #2907: Id like to start with where I think it began. You know, the cassette?  Martin Howard: Sure, why not. Just let me update your status first.  Subject #2907: You werent recording that?  Martin Howard: I just didnt want you to feel pressured, like you had to put on a facade. [clears throat] Patient [NAME REDACTED]  Subject #2907: Please, doc. If you could include my status after I have already left, Id appreciate it.  MH: Well, its like I said earlier - although we can acknowledge that the paranoia exists, we shouldnt give in to it.  2907: I know, I know, but could you just humor me this once?  MH: Alright. So, then, start with the cassette.  2907: Well, as you know, [NAME REDACTED] and I read about geocaching and decided to try it out. Theres so much potential in that area. Its all so wide open, uncharted, beautiful...in places like that, theres bound to be hidden shit.   MH: Right, of course. Go on.  2907: So, we spent the week doing just that. We didnt find much, just trinkets, really. Kinda seemed like people kept getting caught up in the adventure and forgot to bring stuff to replace it with. So they just tossed out whatever their pockets happened to be carrying. [laughter] We found a penny from the seventies, an empty lighter, things like that. We wouldve been bored with it, if people hadnt made it so damn hard to find.  MH: Thats the point, isnt it? From what youve told me.  2907: Yeah, it is. So we didnt mind. But then we finally came across our first big find. Something that wasnt junk. It was a VHS tape in this tin can that looked old as fuck. I was kind of bummed at first, because there was enough damage on the actual film that I didnt think it would be playable. But I decided to try it out anyway, and after dropping [NAME REDACTED] at home so she could go to work, I popped it into my old DVD/VHS combo.  MH: So, [NAME REDACTED] wasnt around when you saw this? I thought you said she was.  2907: No, no, I just said I felt like I wasnt alone when I watched it. Like there was someone there with me.  MH: Someone like God?  2907: Definitely not. More like I felt like someone was watching me. Shit, I hope God wouldnt make me feel like that.  MH: Why did the tape make you feel this way? What was on it?  [long pause]  2907: You sure I have to repeat this? I thought we talked about it before, when it was recording -  MH: [talking over Subject] We did, but I actually didnt have it recording then, and I figured it would be better to get it now, now that your memories of the incident are a little more clear.  2907: Alright. It, uh, didnt really have anything at first. Just some static-y darkness, like when you first start a VHS, but before the actual film? And then, with those VHS blocked letters, it said 5:55 AM. Then, right under it, it said, SNOW in capital letters. And then the text went away and it showed this snow covered place. It was still lightly sprinkling snow, and you could tell it was late at night. The clouds were doing that thing when it snows, where it just forms one big mass? And no moonlight can get through? So the streetlights and whatnot reflect off it. I liked it before then.  MH: Where exactly was this video taking place?  2907: Near this one intersection. But, remember, there was a shitload of snow and no tire tracks or footprints or anything anywhere. It was a pretty even layer, and I remember that area usually being pretty heavy with traffic, regardless of the time of day -  MH: So youve been to this area before?  2907: Well, yeah. Kind of hard not to, being that its right next to [REDACTED]. I didnt recognize it right away because of the all the snow, but as soon as I did, the camera sort of panned downward and then behind. This person was walking barefoot through ankle-deep snow, maybe higher, and the only sign of, you know, life, were her set of footprints that seemed to go on for miles. Then it came back to the persons point of view, facing their surroundings again, and I noticed [REDACTED] had all of their lights off and appeared closed, which I thought was really weird.  MH: Arent they usually open twenty-four hours?  2907: Yeah, thats what made it so weird.  MH: Maybe they were constructing it at the time.  2907: But they had all of their advertisements up, and it looked the same as it does now, just dark and sort of abandoned.   MH: Okay, that is strange. Continue.  2907: So this person walks a little longer, almost to the intersection, and they just stop. It was sorta peaceful, like you could hear the snow softly falling, and this persons even breathing. I listened closely to see if I could hear any traffic, just any background noise, and I turned my TV volume all the way up, but I couldnt hear any signs of it. Thats when they turned the camera on themselves.  MH: And who was this person?  2907: You already know. Dont get why youre -  MH: Im just trying to get every detail down.  2907: ...It was me. And I dont mean like Hey, she could pass off as me! or Wow, we have similar features! No, it was me, like I was looking in the mirror. And I was smiling super wide, like I was excited or trying to take a ridiculous picture of myself. They - she - I, I guess? They got the camera pretty close to their face, or my face, and I could see that my gums were bleeding. And all you could see was my mouth when they said, They know about you now.   MH: They know about you now?  2907: Yeah, thats all she said.  MH: Do you know what they mightve meant?  2907: Nope, havent got a clue. But after she said it she pulled the camera back to show my whole face, and grinned even wider before turning the camera off.   MH: Was that the end of the tape?  2907: I think so. Kind of. It tried to show some other sort of text, but that mustve been where the tape was most corroded because I couldnt make it out. And then there was a blurry shot of a street name, or a building name, maybe [REDACTED].  MH: I see. Well, what did you think of it?  2907: Are you serious? What the fuck was I supposed to think? It freaked me the fuck out. I called [REDACTED] but then remembered she was at work, so I hung up and texted her.   MH: Before we move on to what happened next, I just want to clarify a few things. Do you have any memories of recording this tape?  2907: Of course not. Why else would it have freaked me out? Pretty sure I wouldnt be here if I did remember it.  MH: I know it seems pointless, [REDACTED], but I just want to get everything on the record.  2907: Who the fuck cares if its on the record? It doesnt matter anyway, seeing as it everyone keeps saying it didnt happen. If it didnt, why do you keep questioning me?  MH: Im sorry, [REDACTED], you have a valid point. Why dont we give it a break for today? Okay?  2907: Yeah, okay.  MH: I want you to really try to get your memories in order, though, so we can accurately document this. This will be important to your case. Just remember that.  2907: Ill try. But I honestly just want a break from thinking about it.  MH: Then let it come naturally. Just keep in mind that the sooner we are able to identify your problem, the sooner you can be out of here. Lets work on that. Okay?  2907: Okay.   MH: Have a good day, [REDACTED]. Go ahead and ask for some water on your way back.  2907: Alright. Later.   	1
 Pink fluffy dice, those things are the shit.   Marry me damnit    Spider man of course!   Passenger "Life's for the living"   I need to know... WHAT WAS IN THE BACKPACK SEAN!   Everyone is beautiful on the inside   What's a female?   Pop each others spots, that shit is nasty.   My first kiss, it feels... Amazing.   I'll kiss you on the lips.   I see dead people.   A Dodecahedron     Ah right I had no idea, first time I've seen one of these chubby fellows!   Thanks just did this on PS3 same thing happened, curiosity killed the cat I guess.   Haven't encountered this issue on PS3 what system are you using?   It has updated for me on PS3, what console are you on?   PS3 update is now available to download not sure about other consoles?   Yeah not like he moved his stick to place his hip fire reticle perfectly on the guy or anything, sure it added a tiny adjustment but not exactly game breaking stuff.   I completely agree everyone here seems to be completely over exaggerating it don't know why you got down voted.   That's not a log the Scots are throwing, it is clearly a giant bread stick.   What are you talking about they have a zebra hat now, they can wear it and sneak up on the Zebra more easily.   But the real question here is, black with white stripes or white with black stripes?  	22
 HUEHEUHEUHEH      Same thing here. It used to happen with me last year, i had 2~3 ''visions'' per day, and I got used to it just like you. My ''visions'' were from minor events of the day, not only when someone was about to call me. Nowadays, i think i have 1 ''vision'' per week, don't know why this happened =/   Edited, lol   I'll soon turn 18, and i play poker since i was 15. I really want to invest in my poker career, but i don't know where to start.  EDIT: I played in pokerstars since i was 15.  EDIT2: Thanks for all the answers, means a lot to me!   Wow!! That's an amazing experience/writing. In my country, the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms is a very discussed (and studied) thing: the presence of trusted people alongside you, during the trip, is very important indeed to the trip travel safer roads.  One question: do you remember the species (and the dosage that you guys used that night) of those shrooms? It is a valuable information, cause the totality of the trip fully depends of those partcular factors.  Again, nice experience, bro. Would have gilded if i had gold jajajajaja.   And you've been high for how long in this particular trip?   And you did not feel like trying crack again?   Wow, and with such an unusual metting, are you guys still together?   All types of drugs are accepted.  	10
  Outside of the US, people will celebrate a similar event at 05:06:07 on September 8th.    Apparently a single old Saxon ox can plow more than a team of oxen in 1592. A furlong was considered to be the length of a furrow (a long, narrow, shallow trench made in the ground by a plow) a team of oxen could plow in one day.  An acrewhich gets its name from an Old English word meaning open fieldwas originally the amount of land that a single farmer with a single ox could plow in one day. An acreone furlong in length and one chain wide.    Because it has a high molecular weight, I doubt that the enzyme catecholase would be able to get across the skin to the bruise. There might be another mechanism of action.  	3

    Was this just in the Beta or can it still be done?? Cause I have my fair share of hours on this game and I've never seen this happen.   meanwhile in /r/pics    https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/34eeuh/the_cover_of_time_magazine/   Also I have no idea what Ikr means.   sherbet   noun   noun: sherbet; plural noun: sherbets   1. BRITISH a flavoured sweet effervescent powder eaten alone or made into a drink. "disks of fruit-flavoured rice paper filled with sherbet"   2. (especially in Arab countries) a cooling drink of sweet diluted fruit juices. "the ladies floated around in diaphanous silks and served sherbet and other refreshments"   3. NORTH AMERICAN water ice; sorbet.   4. AUSTRALIANhumorous beer. "I went down the local pub for a few sherbets"   I do trust me. The worst part is doing something where you have to lay down on your back, always have to try and stretch my dick out discreetly beforehand so it not pointing up like a miniature golf flag pole.   Beats as a company suck. I buy the Pill, the speaker gets blown out within 2 weeks of purchase and they will not refund or even replace it and you cannot buy a separate speaker to repair it. Fuck beats and Fuck Dre.   Is that like foreplay?? I normally lay on my side and her on her back that way there is access to all needed areas.   Right, wtf is this guy talking about. Sherbet is rainbow coloured sugar.   I think people are just swapping the could and I. It's either "could I care less?" or "I couldn't care less". I prefer the first one as it's a bit more on your face because it's a question.   First time in my life I have seen that written, thanks buddy!   But im more of an "in here" kind of person   Stupidity is wearing that tomato-based fruit salad as a hat.   I know it's true and it has been tested rigorously but fuck me if there is any magic in this world it's in those doors.    Nuclear power and Planes are not really safer. The consequences of either of those two failing are pretty much always fatal and catastrophic and could easily end the lives of hundreds of innocent people in a second.   Run into a wall as fast as you can, which ever way you land is how your sleeping for the night.    Do the ones form my mum count??   I like the way you think, gonna have to give that try.   I've literally had a girl ask me;   "Well, are you going to kiss me?"   To which I replied   "I don't know, am I?"      The clothes hamper in my bathroom is perfect height and size to place your laptop on whilst sitting on the pooper. I've watched so many youtube videos on there, good times.   Because it's literally the closest we can get to them.   I'd like to turn you into a sexual innuendo.   When I work out it does it's thing and shrink but unfortunately my balls decide to join it and contract too which in turn give my penis a base for it to rest on so it pretty much lays horizontally on top of my balls making me look like a have a micro penis erection.    Don't worry, you're not alone buddy.   Bravo sir, Mission accomplished!   I'm hittin' up dem stationary shops, dose toners expensive yo!!   ...and this week's Darwin Award goes to..   Oh my god Johnson, open and shut case. Good Policing!   He must be so glad he wore that ninja mask.   I mean I feel bad for the guy and all **but** what really makes this gif for me is the initial left swing, it's like for a second he forgot he didn't have an arm.   Wasn't there a kick starter a while back with this exact idea?? Did Google buy them or are they just straight copying??   Edit: [They're just copying.](https://phonebloks.com/en) Fuck you google.

Edit: [Nevermind I got it](https://imgflip.com/i/ktnjf).I really hope this kid becomes a thing.   I was wondering if you guys know of any template that exists for a 24 person/team league   knockout table for excel, something along the lines of Champions League if you know what I mean. I don't really know how to explain it any better all I want is an empty template I can fill out but all the ones online already come pre-filled with teams etc. Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated by my friends and I who really want to get this little league started this weekend. Thanks!!   ..we still fall for click bait titles?         The counter has been going further down than usual lately so I decided to bravely unlock the button. As soon as I clicked the unlock the timer jumped from 51 back to 60 and I subsequently got a huge sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. It was only for a split second, but damn what a long split second that was until I realised the button was still blue.   I just need a cyber hug from a fellow grey right now.                               Dwarf  (_)   nbsp;  ( _)-    nbsp;  (_)   Shortage   nbsp;  [By Jimmy Carr]                     Please help as I am currently phone-less, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/31wjai/i_require_some_assistance_installing_lollipop_on/) is a link to the original post explaining the details.   My current situation is pretty much the same as my last update on that post.   Please reddit, pull through for me I need you!!   SO I decided to try my hands at installing the ROM myself with a lot of help from the internet but unfortunately I have come up short.   nbsp;  These were the steps I followed:   -Root the phone   -install custom recovery system   -install ROM + GApps + SuperSu + Camera Fix   nbsp;  At the moment I believe I have successfully rooted my phone using Odin and the CF auto root file.   The next step was to install a custom recovery system. Which according to Odin was installed successfully.   Now I have to get my phone into custom recovery mode to install the ROM and other files but this is where the problem lays. Everytime I attempt to get into recovery mode it skips it and goes to download mode instead.    I've been nearly an hour now trying to get into recovery mode with no success. Please help!!!    nbsp;  **Update 1**: Ok so I flashed a new recovery system and I am now using Clockworkmod. I wipe all the caches etc and then go to install the ROM, it installs in seconds [which isn't very promising] and then gets stuck on a black screen with slightly animated piece of text saying "android" and then nothing happens.    My phone is a Samsung Galaxy s3 Neo i9300i. I've tried various ROMs now, does anybody have experience installing a version that works on this model if so could you provide a link??    Also I technically have no phone at the moment so if I could get some answers that would be great!!        I've been told of an app that can warn me about the button running down?? I still have my click and I don't want to use it until it's really necessary.   Just kidding, but hear me out. Can someone with the knowledge actually make one to alert us when the button drops below 30 seconds. I want to sleep but I don't want to miss this so something like a siren would be nice [I'm a deep sleeper]. I shall reward you with a thank you.   Do not unlock the button until it has reached 30 seconds. This way you can avoid temptation a bit and we can double the current button lifespan!!!   I can't help bit feel this is some elaborate april fools joke that OP is hoping lasts all the way to next year...or am.i just being sinical??      My button wont load and I still have my press...what the hell reddit!!                     So I've been passing this idea around in my head for a bit and come to the decision to just ask you guys what you think.   My plan is to rent out an entire resort for a weekend of Shreddit madness. There is a Resort on Utah which for $100 each we can rent out the entirety of the slopes for 2 days.   Is this something you guys would like to be a part of??   Lemme know in the comments and I will get the ball rolling.            A little bit of background.   nbsp;  Last year was my first time ever seeing snow at 23 years of age. I tried snowboarding for the first time and fell in love. fast forward one year and I've bought all my own gear and started adding tricks to my book.   nbsp;  So far I have managed 180's on flats and jumps, various grabs, buttering, nose press 180 [buttering trick] and tripod [also buttering trick].   nbsp;  [Here](http://imgur.com/AT4uUv1) is my first every mid-air photo. Hope you guys like!   nbsp;  Also to anyone just starting out. If I can pull it off with my wonky knees, so can you!!

ELI5 - The mirror Johnny, the mirror..               so this happens to me pretty much every time I do arms. The inside part of my elbow tenses up to the point where I cannot stretch it out straight.    Is this normal?   Is my technique wrong?   Or am I over doing it with the weight?      So I finally got bored of my Xbone [until halo 5 releases] so for the meantime I thought I would get myself a Wii U.   Here are the things I'm getting: Wii U Mario Kart 8 Bundle, Smash Bros, Wii U Pro Controller and a Wii Mote.   Is there something I'm missing or am I good with that? Any other games or accessories you guys would recommend??     edit: Thanks guys for all the suggestions!!   Heres my final verdict:     Battery pack sounded like a good idea but I have a mains outlet right by my sofa so its not a real necessity.     Deffo going for the screen protector [better safe than sorry]    Mario 3d world seems like a must    Bayonetta 2 and some other games mentioned eg Monster Hunter etc sound like fun but the reason I'm buying the Wii U is more for local multiplayer so I'm going to give those a skip, for now.    Gonna try out that virtual Console thing    I'm sticking with my current controller set-up, only because this way I will have one of each type.             Ok im going to try make this short and to the point.   I've been having interrupted wifi connection problems for a while. Today I decided to uninstall the wifi network adapter in hopes than reinstalling it would solve my issues.   Unfortunately I now cannot reinstall it as I have realised I had no idea what I was doing   When I go to: control panel - networks and Internet - network connections. The only 2 options available are ethernet and bluetooth but no wifi.    I have tried to the best if my novice ablilty to try and setup a new connection but I cannot figure this one out.   Could some one please help me?? I will provide more info on request.   I fucked up bad.I uninstalled my wifi adapter in hopes that reinstalling it would solve my interrupted connection issues and now I cannot reinstal it.    On the network connections page there is now only the bluetoith connection and ethernet. Ive tried to the best of my ability to set up a Wifi but I cannot crack it.   I then located the broadcom folder and found the driver installer but it will not run. After the first step it message appears saying "wizard was unable to find any drivers for this machine".    If you think you may know how to fix this please comment and I will provide you with more details.   Hi Guys,  Im wanting to set up game sharing with a good friend of mine and I just want to make sure I have all the correct info before we start the set up.    We both want to have each others games on each of our consoles. So my guess is we would have to put his account on mine and set it up as my home xbox and then do the same on his xbox but with my account.   Is this correct?? I  know it sounds like a stupid straight forward process but I just want to be 100% sure that this is the correct way to do it.    Looking for boarders to shred with this season. Im from Gibraltar myself and already have a small group but would love for it to expand to the point where we could organise a coach full of boarders to go up for a weekend.    It's fair to say I am a complete noob to this but I don't want that from stopping me as being able to create my own game is something that I have always wanted to do. I'm trying to create a 2D sidescroller and want to place a Wooden platform that when the player touches moves a certain amount forward.   I started with:   When: Trigger Zone / Player  Do: Move/ Me/ Backandforth/ #20   But unfortunately it doesn't work. Where am I going wrong??   Thanks in Advance!       ..I asked the receptionist what appointments were available   She said "2:30"   I replied "thats why I'm calling."               Reddit is a community full of weird and wonderful people, unicorns and others, and i'm guessing many of you out there have weird and wonderful Christmas Traditions.  My tradition is watching Nightmare Before Christmas on Christmas Eve.  What have you got reddit??  Edit: MERRY CHRISTMAS!!              ..and today we all receive this amazingly worded e-mail from one of our work colleagues. It had me in stitches, hope you enjoy!!  "On visiting Jason's cake this morning  to help myself to a piece, I was  aghast though probably not surprised that one of our number had  helped themselves to all of the pieces of Flake that were, as of yesterday, generously decorating the top of it.   I was left with a sadness not only at the loss of the flake but on consideration,  that one of my erstwhile colleagues could have done such a thing   On further reflection I think perhaps we should dedicate one of our CPD sessions to Professional ethics with a particular emphasis on birthday cakes   Regards  Kim"   ..Staring aimlessly at reddit and clicking every link on the page as one does on a Friday when there is not much work to do when all of a sudden I catch myself staring at a pair of immaculate busty titties. You are probably thinking to yourself "and how is that a fuck up? you've just seen titties"...well unfortunately for me the only woman who works in the office (who also happens to be my manager) was standing within eye shot (trying out a new phrase there). Needless to say she wasn't amused, I have to go see her at the end of the day. Not the best way to start off your weekend :(  TDLR; got caught looking at NSFW posts at work by manager who is the only woman in the office...i think I'm screwed   these are the titties in question, please do not open at work...learn from my mistake!!..   update: link got removed due to violations update: I thank America for inventing the 3 strike system. I still have a job but a strike against me and a manager who thinks im a perv...got off lightly tbh :)          This is not really a new topic or something I have discovered, we all know about this and how it's getting progressively worse. More and more game developers jump on this money making bandwagon and we "the consumer" are left with a bigger hole in our wallet with each new game release. In most cases we end up paying for the game twice in order to have the complete version. I am just getting sick of it and it is starting to put me off gaming. I know a lot of people will tell me "well you moron just don't buy the Season Pass. You don't need it to play the game". I know i do not need it, but i want to enjoy every aspect that the game has to offer, which is something i do on all of my games. I do not like leaving a collectible uncollected, a map not being fully explored, a power not gained I want to see the whole game, the game i paid for when i went to the shops and bought it. Being a gamer is just getting increasingly more expensive with every year that passes and tbh i do not know how much longer many people, including myself, will be able to fund this hobby.   Do you feel the same? Do you differ? Any ideas of what we as a gaming community can do to raise this point with game developers? C'mon Reddit lets pull together on this one!   ...and has just set off on his first tour. Whilst travelling across the Atlantic just hours after setting off, he starts to panic at the thought of what were to happen if the ship were to sink. Walking around the ship with a worried look on his face he passes by a captain. The captain can see that the new recruit is worried and asks;  Captain: What is wrong recruit?  The Private looks at him and asks:  Gay Private: What happens if the ship sinks??  The Captain smiles and replies  Captain: Not to worry, we would send out a distress call and the US Navy and Coastguard will come to assist us. Now get back to your duties.  The private seems relieved by this answer thanks the captain and continues on with his duties.  The following day they are quite a bit further out to sea and have reached international waters. The private is having lunch when he realizes he cannot see any land in sight, this gets him panicking again. Luckily for him he stumbles upon the same Captain and asks him;  Gay Private: Captain please tell me again what happens if the ship would sink.  Captain: Again? Ok then...well this time seeing as we are in international water we would send out an  international distress call and the closet vessel to us would come and assist.  The recruit, again happy with the reply from the captain, continues having lunch worry free.  The following day they are finally nearing enemy territory and activity on ship is getting to a high in preparation for entry into the territory. All this hustle and movement on the ship is making the gay private nervous again. He starts searching the ship for the captain so that the captain can reassure him again.   He finally finds the captain who is extremely busy with preparations and slowly approaches him.   Gay Private: Captain?  No reply  Gay Private: Captain!?   He says a little louder, yet no reply.  Gay Private: CAPTAIN!!!!!!  Captain: WHAT!?!?! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT CANT YOU SEE I AM BUSY??? WE ARE ENTERING ENEMY TERRITORY!!  Gay private: thats what I wanted to ask...  He says hesitantly  Gay private: ...what would happen if we were to sink now?  The Captain, frustrated by this point with everything that is going on around him and the fact that this is the third time he has asked and shouts back at the private  Captain: WELL WE WILL BE FUCKED UP THE ASS WOULDNT WE!!!!!?!?!!?  The Gay private blushes, smiles and replies..  Gay private: I cant wait!!    at work, bored...so feel free to ask me anything about something or other and I shall do my best to reply with a completely unrelated topic.  Edit: Well that was an amazing 15 min. i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. the minutes have literally flown by!! thanks for all the support and if you missed me this time round do not worry....i get bored A LOT..             A father and son are walking through a park when the kid asks his dad "dad, why do they say gardeners have green thumbs? they're not green!"

 Sunroof  Tan, all over, while you drive   bossy bossy bossy   All that interneting will turn your nose blue :)   Reddit Gold to the best story that uses all those terms ;)   Got a ship from Stephen last year, clapped out near Uranus and I'd to hitch a comet the whole way home. Frozen, I was.   I'm against it as the consequences of failure could lead to the irradiation of an entire province. Plus our electricity demands don't require a nuclear power station.  To look at Germany, Spain   Portugal achieve 40% upwards of their needs via renewables last year - it would seem irrational of us to go with nuclear.  Then the cost of the radioactive waste disposal is a bill our childrens' Ireland have to pick up, and most countries with the capacity will not accept another country's waste. IIRC there are ships with nuclear waste which simply circle the globe while governments fight over who is going to take it.  I think nuclear is a solution to a problem we don't have, and there are better solutions available. Finally, when a country with the engineering expertise and reputation such as Germany reckons they can do without - why would we join the nuclear party when everyone else is leaving for very good reasons.   Cheers for the tip Eamon!  I've no interest in this government or any other one privatising domestic water provision by stealth. And it's unlikely this can be anything else, plus I really don't appreciate having to pay for the metering such companies will have to rely on. In fairness, Phil Hogan is in charge of it - and we all saw the suspicious fiasco he caused with Greyhound.  On a more general note, I'll do my upmost to make sure that any issues that effect the whole country will be "trawled in the media" at every opportunity I get.  Of course, in case anyone has forgotten here's a [little link](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2011/06/01/say-it-aint-so-eamo/) to just how two-faced that travesty of a TD truly is.      The closest I know of would be this image:  http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=62 t=2713  and there's a few more community images here:  http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=77 t=3410   The U2 / U3 images are interchangable 99% of the time, so don't let that put you off.  The user who creates the majority of these images 'robroy' is fantastic, so asking in the forums would be the best thing.  The first image should fit the bill. I'd certainly start with the images from the forums, rather than creating your own isos, as they work 'out of the box' and take away most of the fiddling around for drivers etc.    I absolutely love them. Versatile and small, I'm setting one up for a friend who wants a pc on their TV and I'll be able to velcro the odroid to the back of the tv for extra tidiness.  Here's a quick comparison [photo](http://i.imgur.com/hQ7KFAx.jpg), U2 on the left and the U3 on top of the Pi. I'm not sure they sell the U2 anymore.  If you do go for one, I'd also get an 8gb eMMC card rather than boot from an SD card - the eMMC are really fast.   Though it's very handy for testing to use SDs and a lot of people have SDs sitting around unused.   I use an Odroid U2 as a home server, NAS, book server, torrenting machine, motion server and all of that barely stresses it.  They've upgraded it now to the [U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) (an extra USB port, slimmer profile). It's $59 before shipping and is even slightly smaller than the Pi :)  There's loads of tips and projects on the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/) too. I use one as my main desktop too as they're fanless and silent.  Just to add, I still use my Pi for XBMC as its gpu is better at 1080p than the Odroid's, though not by much.   In other news, the price of quick-drying cement and expanding foam-sealant is going up; providing a much needed boost to the beleaguered Hardware Shop sector.

For good reason I have directed not guilty verdicts, Judge Martin Nolan told jurors. It will all be made apparent to you in due course.

Not really a problem, but I wasn't expecting it.                        If you've read a book already then it will appear greyed-out when you find another copy.

The story changed this morning, so here's [part 2](http://imgur.com/lD1ENPc)        Thanks, that sounds exactly like what's happening. I'm surprised digiweb are doing it too though.

If they're not on the other nail then I reckon it's the bullet and not such a big deal.  Seeing the youthfulness of the skin I wouldn't expect to see either horizontal or vertical lines on the nails, verticals will happen to most (eventually) - horizontals are worth a check-up.      Wow, that looks painful, ghastly   eventually relieving! Your pain threshold must be impressive at this stage.  Hope you don't mind the question but the horizontal striations on your big-toenail, are they on the other big toe too?     It's the Last of Us for me.  I enjoyed Bioshock: Infinite, its weaker parts are better than many other games' good parts - but I think the game doesn't work as a complete experience in the way TLoU does.  B:I has nowhere near as much tension, and so doesn't pull you in or make you care to succeed / survive to the extent TLoU does.  Often during B:I I felt like I was wondering around a deserted museum. A museum filled with glimpses of the game that could have been, and I suspect a game that was diminished so it could be coded for current-gen consoles (e.g. the difference between the final game and the initial [years old trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCiS0_ssLE) which still to me has more tension than the acutal game).  I felt I played all the game that Naughty Dog wanted to make and I would have played hours more of it.  I was glad to reach the end of B:I and kinda finished it just to see the end for myself - I was ready to finish the game hours earlier.         I let Steve Ballmer weigh in on that one:  ["We released fantastic games, and, **most importantly**, we expanded Xbox to go beyond great gaming to deliver all the entertainment people want  sports, music, movies, live television and much more."](http://kotaku.com/the-new-xbox-boss-is-steve-ballmer-638364468?utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Twitter utm_source=Kotaku_Twitter utm_medium=Socialflow)   We released fantastic games, and, most importantly, we expanded Xbox to go beyond great gaming to deliver all the entertainment people want  sports, music, movies, live television and much more.  So, maybe the multimedia focus wasn't all Don Mattrick's idea? I guess it had to be signed-off further up the hierarchy.      Do you think the XB1 has more compute units in the GPU? Wouldn't MS have mentioned that by now? I guess they can't seeing that it was an MS engineer that let slip the info that the XB1 has less.  As for the 'current leaks', that refers to the GPU clock speed. I'm sure if it was a differentiator between the consoles, the console with the higher speed would have announced it already.  If there was an XB1 tech-spec sheet with the same level of detail as the PS4 then we could all settle the differences between the two, when are MS going to reveal more details I wonder. What's the delay?      See for yourself:   http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2  On the graphics side its once again obvious that Microsoft and Sony are shopping at the same store as the Xbox Ones SoC integrates an AMD GCN based GPU. Heres where things start to get a bit controversial. Sony opted for an 18 Compute Unit GCN configuration, totaling 1152 shader processors/cores/ALUs. Microsoft went for a far smaller configuration: 768 (12 CUs).  Microsoft cant make up the difference in clock speed alone (AMDs GCN seems to top out around 1GHz on 28nm), and based on current leaks it looks like both MS and Sony are running their GPUs at the same 800MHz clock. The result is a 33% reduction in compute power, from 1.84 TFLOPs in the PS4 to 1.23 TFLOPs in the Xbox One.    So why not provide some links that contradict what is a well referenced post?   Oh I reckon they'll keep the eSRAM for games whenever possible - TV / Skyping etc. wouldn't require the time-critical benefits of it. If MS are aiming for 1080p games running at 30 or 60 fps - they'll want all the juice they can give it.  I'm sure it could be put to use when games aren't running. Though with the consoles expected to be on shelves in 5 months, these drip-feeds of info better not be what developers are also getting.   I reckon it's a blisteringly fast pipeline of sorts, as it's on the same chip and all.  To be honest, I think the article creates as many questions as it answers.  A detailed one-sheet spec from MS themselves would be handy at this stage, the speculation won't go away until there are some solid numbers.  I won't be getting either console until they've been 'out in the wild' for a while anyway. Though if details don't come soon - I'm betting that MS could end up with a warehouse full of lemons by January. Word spreads a lot faster than it did 7 years ago.   What's been said now suggests that the eSRAM is even better than MS thought but the details about speed   bandwidth (skimpy as they are) don't form a solid picture.  Either one hardware part has been slowed-down on purpose to achieve read   writes at the same time or one of the numbers is plain wrong.   The story is incomplete - be that on the journalist's side or from the story's source.   The PS4 hardware has clear advantages.  The XB1's response to these apparent advantages is its eSRAM - if this works as planned it should balance out, some to most of, the hardware differences.  There is only 32MB of the eSRAM available. So it has to used for something important, and also something that isn't (in data terms) very big. Probably data that needs to be quickly delivered and then replaced with an updated version and delivered again. Software will have to be written with that in mind.  If the eSRAM can't be used like this or if it's too tricky to make it useful that way - then devs might avoid it and the processing of the game will suffer. PS4 games would look better and cost less to get looking that way.   Yeah, they dropped the number of shares from [5 to 3](http://uk.gamespot.com/news/sony-getting-stricter-on-ps3-and-psp-game-sharing-6344077) but it's still going.  Basically, you put your account details on up to 3 consoles and any game attached to your account can be played on all three.     Yeap, I'm in the same position - have used it a good few times and then not so much lately.            Privacy is greater benefited by not having the kinect.  I notice the word 'protect' isn't used once in the document.   Ah, apologies.  The list above is directly from xbox.com, so that's the best guide.   True, I should have put that in the title.  At the same time, I can't find any dates for the grey countries. Asia is not coming on-line until the end of 2014 and I can't find info on whether that's all countries in Asia or a selection.  I really can't understand why Portugal isn't ready for launch while Brazil is.  If I find any dates I'll include them here.   Would you be in Spain? It's good for Live.  Though for people in Portugal, they're out of luck - which I'm not sure about as Brazil made it onto the list.

As for sports, I don't think there's any hope Microsoft can provide on that while even fully licensed national stations can't agree with each other pan-europa.  Plus each nation has its list of national free-to-air sports events that must be shown free-of-charge. Disallowing Microsoft from showing them to Xbox Live only subscribers - not a business incentive for them.   Oh, I know there's no solid info - yet when Kinect came out initially there were similar claims to have 'not-abandoned-the-core-gamers'. That didn't pan out and neither did a ground-swell of Kinect fans.  Microsoft will be in a great position if/when they've 8 new games to tout at E3 for the X1 but they don't have a previous delivery on promises to back it up.  Sony have presented many PS4 exclusives already, and they haven't shown the machine yet.  It's all very crazy, but either PR companies are toying with them both for shits/giggles/profits, or one of them will have some pointless advertising bills to pay.  I'm in Europe so the TV part of the X1 won't sell it to me - there needs to be very compelling games; the spy-in-the-cab isn't helping either.   So certainty   comfort all round, that's nice.  I guess hedge-funds won't be using Microsoft this Christmas.   True, but I don't think Microsoft used this as a springboard to E3 - now they really have to bring the fireworks.  Yesterday's announcement should have encouraged many more enthused people for their E3. I think it's creating the opposite.   If they had gameplay to show, they'd have presented it - an arbitrary wait wouldn't be mandatory (unlike the mandatory infrared Kinect camera   microphones)   Read your own headline, and finishing with 'discuss' ...

GI JOOOOOOOEEEE*   Actual case study of manuka honey on healing.  "Case series of use of Manuka honey in leg ulceration.  Authors  Gethin G,et al.Show all  Journal  Int Wound J. 2005 Mar;2(1):10-5.  Affiliation  Abstract  Gethin G, Cowman S. Case series of use of Manuka honey in leg ulceration. Abstract The historical and current literature reports the successful use of honey to manage a diversity of wound aetiologies. However, only in the last 40 years is research on its mode of action and contribution to wound healing being investigated. The challenge of managing chronic non healing wounds generated interest in researching non standard therapies. The aims of the study were to gain insight into the practical use of Manuka honey in wound management. The objective was to test the feasibility of further rigorous research into the use of honey in the management of chronic wounds. Instrumental case series were used to examine the use of Manuka honey in eight cases of leg ulceration. To collect the necessary data, photographs, acetate tracings, data monitoring and patient comments and observations were used to add greater reliability and validity to the findings. The wounds were dressed weekly with Manuka honey. The results obtained showed three males and five females with ulceration of different aetiologies were studied. A mean initial wound size for all wounds of 5.62 cm(2) was obtained. At the end of four-week treatment period, the mean size was 2.25 cm(2). Odour was eliminated and pain reduced. The conclusions drawn were that the use of Manuka honey was associated with a positive wound-healing outcome in these eight cases. Arterial wounds showed minimal improvement only."   This is correct. The idea of the article was that the lable of "alternative" has unfairly garnered the co-definition of "ineffective". Manuka honey on a staph infection heals it.  Even science agrees with that,  but its considered "alternative" because they can't patent honey and sell it for an exorbitant amount of money. The thing that I most agreed with was this assertion that our terminology may be out of date.    They call medicine that has worked for thousands of years in Asia "alternative" here in the west.

I think the pressure made it impossible for him to grow and perform in Cleveland. a more laid back atmosphere and time to learn without being under the microscope might produce a great QB. We have learned that Weeden does not turn into a Diamond under pressure, he crumbles. Maybe if he is allowed to age like cheese, he will ripen to a very strong and mature QB.   And you would be a crappy Cowboys fan if you thought differently. Huzzah and good luck on the road to that Ring!

Did you think he had the goods to be a starting NFL  QB?   My honest reply is "No. I would not be excited to have him." His stats dont paint a whole picture. Yes he has broken passing records. Has he broken playoff records? Also: he can spend a whole game knocking down receivers (hence his stat numbers) and then the last play of the game, the one to win it all, he throws an interception,  or a really bad throw. We have Greg Little. We would need no help choking on the final throw/catch of the game. Lol Do I hate Romo?  No. I just think he is more in league with Andy Dalton than Tom Brady.    I am not here to change your mind about Romo,  just to talk about Weeden.   Weeden is indeed a low budget choice for quarterback.  Romo is not an elite QB. I'm sorry. I've had him on my fantasy team more than once, and he has let me down time and again. I don't dislike him,  or the Cowboys,  mind you.    Im sure he picked him with the same "I like him. He's a good 'ol boy" mentality he keeps Romo around with. I can honestly think of no other reason he would hire him.   I am equally as sorry that you have to deal with JJ.   I apologize for having to leave the comp after I started this AMA. It seems to have been the single ruining factor. I am a minister, and I cant always predict how much time I am going to have to spend on a given appointment. I'm sorry, again. Good luck with Weeden. I was hoping to be able to shine some light on him for anyone who had questions, and mishandled the instant nature of the AMA experience. Sorry to waste your time /u/Cowboys. Maybe next time.   Sorry.  I'm a Minister,  and my job called.    Fried, Floppy, Weeden Scramble   That's funny right there, I dont care who you are. ;)   My eternal apologies. I am here and hope to make amends!    All of them. :) I work in Prison Ministries on Tuesday and it had me out of the house for a couple hours.   He needs to learn meditation and inner peace. Once he isn't afraid of the line coming at him, or the velocity of his throw, then he will have what it takes to put it all together to be a starter.   Weeden has a long progression, and he gets spooked easily. Many of his drops come from him throwing it too hard. (which is only half his fault. He WAS throwing it to Bess and Little, who are not the best at actually catching the ball) His sack record has a lot to do with his inability to get rid of the ball in time, and then panicking. He had Joe Thomas, Alex Mack, Greco, Schwartz. He had some good protection. He could be really good if someone could teach him. That 2012 game was a BARN-BURNER!!!   I had not looked into him at all. He was NOT who I, or anyone else expected to draft. I watched his college play after the fact and have always thought that we never played to his major strength, which is the Shotgun. I have felt that we hired a polar bear, and wondered why the hell it wouldnt fly in our eagle formation, and have punished the poor dumb animal for being a polar bear who cant fly.   I would take him over Brady Quinn, but I would take Thad Lewis over Weeden. He has a gun that he uses too liberally when a normal throw would do, and he fluffs it when he needs to drill it to a receiver. Maybe you guys can do something with him now that he is a backup, and no longer a high profile flop.   The game with the Dippity-Do-Underhand-Pass-Interception on first down.

That being said: Cincinnati did right by Paul Brown, and for that I respect them. Funk dem Stillers, though.   I say we trade our #4 pick for a first rounder for next year (to get the QB from Oregon), and then start our draft with the sec9nd first round pick, and choose any of the WR that are filling this draft.

LomBanner firing, DeQwell being let go, etc. I mean, you cant click the alert to go read an article about the alert because the app is pretty much useless, but they still send you the alert .   Rev. Terry Riley of March on Ft. God fame, had many doors closed to him until he was able to affirm his training through Seminary Certification. His experience and outlook is really interesting, and may help those with questions about Seminary Training vs Coven Training.       This is a really cool book about European Shamanism.  This author is really thorough, and more people should enjoy Mallory. What little of him I have read I have really liked. He is very scholarly in his style, and that can be a little dry for some, but for info hounds, he is great.      Yes,  the parent comment to yours makes very little sense.  There is no body within Wicca that can tell anyone else how to worship.  We don't have gun toting covens going door to door kicking altars over and demanding to see your ID Card, and your depictions of Aradia and Cernunnos, as sanctioned by the Brit Trad Collective. *edited for punctuation*   Hello, everyone. I am sharing this article here because for better or worse, for those that love Pete, and those that do not, Pierre Claveloux "Pete Pathfinder" Davis changed the face of Wicca, and these may well be his final written words to the community that he loved very much. Pete has written Menhir News even before Panegyria's inception. I hope you all enjoy what might be it's final edition.  +Blessings      I am a very close and personal friend of Rev. Terry Riley of SDCW. This will be the first year since I started going to Mayday that I wont be there   Have we met, before?     I didn't know you knew Alfred?! He's an amazing priest   Gotta love the ungrateful. Bye Weeden.   I think that Love is the Law, and we tend to withhold love from ourselves before we withhold from other people, and this makes us victims to the one person we cant fight way. This article by Alfred Willowhawk, a 3rd Degree Gardenarian from Wite Ravyn Metaphysical Church in Missouri, is a great article tackling just that concept. Happy Imbolg, everyone.  *edited for my bad spelling*      I bet he feels like a guy who just got a chance to race the Kentucky Derby at all. Farmer seems like the kind of guy to be grateful for his chances,  and he's going to do way better than Lombardi   Well with Banner at the helm, you can bet he wont make it easy to resign him. Mack is worth money, and Banner historically doesn't like to pay it out. This is worth being concerned over.   My grandma got me this gnome for Yule and He told me his name was Gnomar Lewzing. He says he's got this.      As a Die Hard Dawg, I just want to say: Ravens, I'm sorry. I cant like you. I would say "Nothing Personal" but it totally is. I would say "No offense" but I cant help it if you get offended. I CAN say: I love your coach, and I think he is the best one in the whole division. Pettine might make me proud, but Harbaugh is a good guy. You also got the better of the two brothers.  Steelers. Steelers Steelers Steelers. I dont know what happened last year. Aging team, too comfortable coaching staff, karma, I dont know. I see a serious dropping in your AFC North standings if you dont make some serious changes (which I see that you have started with the coaching staff) I think you have the dirtiest coach in the AFC North. It's true. He cheats. Boo on cheating. You know, I could go on about how I am a Browns fan and hate the Steelers, but instead I am just going to say: Good luck on the rebuild.  Bengals. We share a heritage. You took in a wonderful man whom we kicked out unfairly and finished his legacy with honor. Thank you for helping immortalize Paul Brown. You guys have a chance to make it to the Super Bowl, but you are going to have to shake the rust off that Red Rifle. Not to mention I dont even know most of the people on your O-Line. (that might be my fault for being stuck up the Brownies Butt all season) Get a better secondary receiver and maybe find the Law Firm in contempt. He didnt do much to help you last season.  The Browns are ONCE AGAIN the question mark. Maybe they will dominate with a new coach, massive cap space, and 10 draft picks with 2 in the first round. MAYBE. Or will it be same post 99 Browns, different year? I dont know. We're a mess. I think Hoyer can win, but can he? He seems to get hurt easily. I think Gordon can be a game changer, but can he? We didnt win any of the games he broke records in. I think Pettine is a good coach. But will he actually be able to lead the Factory of Sadness?    Well, thanks for letting me bitch and posture about how I feel about the AFC North. And I will leave y'all with this: I can talk trash about the AFC North, but if you aint following one of our teams, then shut yer mouth.   Peace, All  *edited for grammar*    So many hours into Final Fantasy VII...poor Aeris. There is just so much to do in that game, and the replay value is amazing.   Yes! I almost never remember what I say to people in those situations. We do a ritual called The White Goddess Ritual where the priestess in the center is veiled in white, and invokes the Bright Mother. Then everyone has a chance to come up to, hug, and get an interaction with the Goddess. This one time afterwards my partner Bella had been the one invoked, and this little girl came up and said "Can I have another hug?"  And Bella said: "Okay honey, but it wont be the same. I was invoked with Goddess last time"  Then the little girl hugged her, and kinda smacked her lips like she didnt like the taste of the tea, or something, and said: "Nah. That's not right. And you had blond hair then" and just wandered off with her mom. Bella's hair was red :)   Someone mentioned: ["Until you started posting your blog here I wasn't really aware of how Eleusinian the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was."](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/1wo46e/searching_for_the_kore_by_regina_cagle/cf3uxx0), in an earlier post. LOL Sorry about the lack of context before I started posting. We just happen to be in the middle of rehearsals for Spring Mysteries Festival, so many of these posts are blogs of what each priest/ess is going through as they work with their God forms. It's a way for people to get to see the kind of transformations that occur within the people that hold these monumental energies. I have done invocation and psychodrama for 10 years, and the changes and growth that happen through the process of working these energies is really amazing sometimes. Like Anansi says when he shares a story: "This is my story as I have told it. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet; take some with you, and let some come back to me". One of the things I was hoping to hear from people was their experiences holding energies in their own psychodramas and rituals. I'd love to hear stories from anyone who would like to share. :)   We just happen to be in the middle of rehearsals for Spring Mysteries Festival, so all these posts are blogs of what each priest/ess is going through as they work with their God forms.    You're very welcome. We are moving in directions that are not nearly parallel to the ATC of the past. Are we still trying to break ground for Wiccan Rights? Yes. Are we still trying to put out the best resources we know how to? Yes. Are those resources, and ground breaking going to be done in the same manner as the past. Most likely not. We are pretty much only ATC in name and possessions.  Talking about the Seminary: The Seminary has been staffed by hand picked teachers (many of which are not a part of the ATC Mother Church in WA, but by teachers from all over the country, and some not associated with the ATC through anything except the Seminary) by Bella for the past 5 years. Not only that, but the Seminary doesnt teach a tradition. We teach what are the Sacred Sciences behind magic. We leave it to the individual group leaders to teach a tradition. We also do not Initiate through the school (because it is mostly online) though a student has the ability to find a local teacher because of the scope of the ATC affiliate network.  The ATC cant decide to not use it's name any longer. The disaster that would come in the wake of such a decision would be apocalyptic. It's not just us in Washington anymore. The dissolution of the ATC would effect thousands of congregants world wide. The name (as besmirched as it may be in certain circles) is connected to Governmental infrastructures that would disenfranchise dozens of groups that depend on us if we were to not maintain the Umbrella Document as it is written.  It was only through all of the infrastructure the ATC built that we were able to get legal churches in the Mid-South. Tennessee Religious law is INSANE. It is made to keep non-Abrahamic religions out of the loop. It's actually only because of the legitimacy of the seminary that The Jenny Jones Show (I need citation on the actual show. Might be Sally Jesse Raphael, might be Maury Povich. Terry Riley knows) said they would be willing to call Terry "Rev. Terry Riley" and not "Self Proclaimed Witch Terry Riley". It's a crazy story that I would love to get my hands on and post here.   At this stage in the game, the only hope I have is by changing a complete culture that some people see within the organization that I love. There was a time when it was run my a closed fist. We could not do things more differently if we were an open hand. Love is our law, and just like the reputation that I have learned of, was built brick by brick, action by action, so shall it be disassembled. The ATC was ever only supposed to bring legitimacy and resources to the community, and as I sit here and tell you now please believe me: That is how the world will see it when I am done.   Blessings to you, and I hope I have done some to help you have, maybe, a glimmer of hope that the Aquarian Tabernacle Churches future will make you far prouder than anything that may have existed in the past.   Even if you believe Pete Davis is not Brit Trad, Belladonna Laveau is and she is the Archpriestess and Pete is Retired. Not that it matters, but Pete is initiated into the Kent Tradition of Wicca, as well as by Raymond Buckland, as well as Gypsy Ravish. Also, our 501 (c) 3 is not the same as a regular one. Its a common misconception that even the State offices make when we are affiliating new churches. Every time they talk the new affiliate into not filing the correct paper work, because not even the clerks are familiar with it. Its a rare classification, I can understand the confusion.   On the topic of Woolston Steen Theological Seminary: @ $39.00 a month when compared to any other college that offers Associates through Doctorate (Cherry Hill is a Masters and Doctorate program only) WSTS prices are almost free at less than $500 a year. Cherry Hill costs $95 a unit hour, which ends up being far more expensive per class, as well as being inaccessible for people without a Bachelors degree.    The ATC is not the same that it was 10 years ago. It's not the same as it was even a year ago.   There is a world of bad blood that we are cleaning up from Petes time; many blockages that the community has placed in the way of the ATC because of whatever it was that Pete did/said/acted like to upset those around him. I invite you to get in line so that we can do our best to patch up any wounds that you may have from past experiences, Bella and I have been spending the last year doing just that with the other community members who have the same issues. All we are trying to do is be accessible to the community, build our local communities (both magical as well as mundane), and help empower others to be successful.   And I would love to talk to you privately if you would wish to write me, but thought I should address your concerns in the same forum that they were raised. I don't know how the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was done before, but you might want to check us out again before you decide what we are and aren't. The times they are a changing. Blessings.  *Edited for Formatting*   I wonder if this would hold up in American courts?      This series of articles is supposed to follow the Egyptian Wheel of the Year. She told me she had not seen the content elsewhere, and wanted to make it available as the wheel turned, this year. :)   That may be true wherever you are from, but from the moment they stepped off the boat to escape religious persecution, Pagans have been political in America. Wicca may be 60 years old, but Americas Pagan roots are hundreds of years old. In America, if it wants to be relevant for another couple hundred years, then we need to make sure our voices are heard.   SMH. That's not hostility. All I've tried to do is participate in this community. I've only been here for about a week. People have voted every one of my posts up to #1 status, post after post. Dozens of people vote them up, yet the comments from 3 or 4 of the same people, over and over, seem to be disparaging, critical, or made to put a person on the defensive. I dont know what I did originally, but I'm sorry. I never meant to flare that nerve. And I'm sorry for pushing back instead of being receptive from the get go. I have not had a chance to peruse through the content here. I help run a huge church (in size, not wealth) that takes up a large portion of my time. I am working on learning the lines for a 4 day long play, in which I'm playing Herakles. Not to mention there is the Boy Child who has to be taken to school every day and picked up after band. It was never my intention NOT to contribute. I talk on Facebook all day. It was only ever my intention to contribute. I hear that it's important to add to the dialogue. My only objection has ever been that I have a natural 'push back' against being told what to do. I'm an Aries. LOL But I have a Pisces Rising, and an Aquarian Moon, so I am super sweet when I'm not cornered, and my friends are more important to me than just about anything. I want to have the people here to be part of those friends, and if we can move forward, I would love to make that happen.   (I am being sincere) Is a self populated rss feed the same as a multi-author website?    I was on WifeSwap. If anyone has any questions about that, I would be happy to answer them.   My personal favorite Witchcraft in the media was the episode of Charmed where they went back to Salem, and their powers didnt work. They had to use the craft of the day, because their powers didnt exist yet. So they had to do a protection spell, and so they cut an apple in half, exposing the pentacle in the center, and held a piece of Basil against it, and it made a protection spell. It was TOTALLY magically sound. Apples are immortality magic. The pentacle  in the center is the same as a pentacle in a circle which means "All four elements and spirit in perfect harmony" which makes things manifest. Basil is used to dispel negativity. So Immortality magic+Dispelling negativity+a manifestation circle(pentacle in circle)=Protection from evil. I was impressed. (both with the show, and my training. LOL)   The ATC is a 33 year old church, and the only one in the world with an "Umbrella Tax Exemption" which means that affiliates can get legal status through us, instead of the Fed. It is a REALLY rare classification that not even all the Christian Churches have. It is why we have as many rights, Wicca wide, as we do. The ATC and their status with the government enables ALL WICCAN CHURCHES AND PRACTITIONERS to be seen as legit. I hope that helps :)   I will do NOTHING to prove you wrong. "I reddit because I have things to share". Not "I reddit at your behest." I have read your past posts, and if people lived according to your weird views of life, I would be afraid of who I am, and hide my faith to protect myself from ridicule. You have suggested to new pagans to hide the symbols of their faith:  "I know, we have just as much right to wear a symbol of our faith as any other. And being out in the public helps fight the hate. If you know us, you don't hate us. The person spewing bigoted remarks is entirely responsible for their hateful behavior. But knowing that these confrontations will occur while wearing the symbol. One has to ask one's self why they are wearing the pentacle and if they should continue. I stopped wearing mine because I realized I had a chip on my shoulder and was begging the world to pick a fight with me. "  I think your attitude IS the chip on your shoulder. Dont blame your pentacle for people picking a fight with you. If you treat people irl the way you treat people online, I cant imagine you get much purchase with them.   Further delving into your posting past shows that to follow you is to believe that Wicca is a club of intelligent solitaries, and megalomaniacal group leaders.   "Covens can be a more structured environment to learn Wicca and see it in practice, but in my experience getting involved with a coven is a crap shoot. The best covens function as a group of friends, whereas ones made up of the public, or acquaintances can break down rather dramatically. Internal drama and megalomaniacal personalities are likely issues. "  I especially like where you speak for all of Wicca (which you seem to get REALLY bent about when you read what you perceive as people doing just that)  "Wicca is a highly unstructured religion."  The reason you enjoy the benefits that all the other major religions enjoy is because of the Highly Structured Churches of Wicca fighting for your rights. All you are doing is lying to new Wiccans, implanting your own psychosis and fears onto people who have come to this site looking for help, info, or support on their path, and driving away established churches/groups/people who would lend credibility to a number of the discussions that you are regurgitating on. Every page of your history has at least one comment where you are trashing someone and telling them to buy ad space for reddit. THATS spam, sir. You. You are playing the reddit police, and it seems by a few deleted OP's accounts, that you scare some of them. Bully on you. I cant believe you havent been reported yet.   So anyone reading: I am a 3rd degree Gardenarian. My lineage is through Ed Fitch and Janet Farrar. I cant speak for anyone else but myself, and myself is a Wiccan with STRONG lineage who works every day to further Wicca. You speak for ALL OF WICCA and you tell untruths.   You constantly rail about how you are Wiccan, but dont follow the major beliefs: "As I have so frequently said in this forum, I am Wiccan and I don't believe in magic"  Well Patricia Crowther details in "Covensense" that if you feel the need to change the BOS, then you arent Wiccan, so think on that when you're telling all these new people that they dont need to be Wiccan to be Wiccan.  So: You want dialogue? We're having dialogue. Lets start one about how you make /r/wicca a hostile environment for new people, and how that's against reddiquette.      I find it fascinating that the God forms of Spring Mysteries manifest in their priests/priestesses, in ways that go hand in hand with the archetypes. But Magic doesnt work, right? ;)      This sounds like professional jealousy.  We are rocking it with front page worthy content, and it seems to not be sitting well with some. Also: we don't profit off of traffic to our site. All of that content is put there for the community, not to line our pockets. I'm going to keep posting until I break a rule, (speaking of which the rule about posts/replies needing to be constructive might pertain to your post, as all it has done is trash a Wiccan news source and try to shame it into not posting on an open Wiccan forum) and thanks: maybe I'll buy some ad space to show my support. But the last thing I will do to "support reddit" is discontinue posting. Bless your heart.    I dont think the Gods understand "Next time" I think they are stuck in a perpetual cycle. As soon as Persephone has returned and begins making flowers, it is like she is the Kore again and has never left. Demeter would never think "I cant bear to lose her again!", because she never HAS lost her to that point.    I think that's an awesome idea. Maybe an amendment to the site posting rules? Also: more than 75% of my posts will be from Panegyria.com just like certain people only really post from Patheos, or any number of other pagan sites. I work at the Aquarian Tabernacle Church in the social media department. Our social media has been nonexistent for many years. I am changing that reality :) My point of posting is to share with the rest of the Wiccan community the amazing people that post through our online magazine. (to which we are always looking for spirited contributors) Though we do not have an Original Poster clause, 99% of our content cannot be found anywhere else on the net. My point of sharing it here is to give the community the best possible chance to have access to this content, and to create discussion about the topics there-in. If you would like a little write up before each one though, I am happy to do such. :)    It's pagan content from a Wiccan church. I didnt know I had to post a reason with it. I've been all over the site rules and the reddiquette, and nothing says there has to be statement of reason for choosing to post. I dont really have a problem posting why I am posting. I see that you are a moderator. I read over all the rules before I began posting, and have adhered to them. If anything anywhere had mentioned that we needed a reason to post something, I would have been doing it from the start. Is this just a personal thing, or is this a site wide known thing that is an "unwritten rule"?            I came away with much to say after a good debate of ideas on an earlier thread.          The ATC doesn't represent all of Wicca. If the writer is referring to ATC, then they should make that very clear. All of these issues could have been fixed by using words that don't generalize us all. "Most Wiccans," "Some Pagans," "We at the ATC."  I can totally understand why the above remark generated inside of you. The ATC doesnt speak for all Wiccans. And since Wiccans by definition are  (supposed to be) self responsible it can turn some folks off if they think people are trying to be their voice. When it comes to the Government the ATC is who they listen to about Wicca because it is the ATC that has been the engine behind almost every inch of ground Wicca has gained in their eyes. Even if The ATC doesnt speak for you directly, their contributions to you help you every day.   There is just too many folks attacking us from the outside for us to bicker and play King of the Hill. We are all helping each other out. Many people have done much. The Author of this article is an ATC fan. He credits the structure of the church for making it possible for Pagans to exist in the open, in the Mid South. The Arkansas/Missouri/Tennessee area is very volatile, and have a lot of criteria for churches that only the unique structure of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was able to meet. Also, when marched against a whole City, and  it was do or die, he sent out letters to everyone he could think of to help him. Only the ATC responded. It ended up being one of the greatest victories for Wicca that no one knows about, so is a bit of a cheerleader for them in that regard.   It's nice to meet you, btw. I saw that you are a Super Virgo. (I looked at some of your posts) I have No Virgo anywhere in my chart, [Aries/Sun,Pisces/Rising,Aquarian/Moon] but it is nice to meet you, and I hope we can continue to have really enjoyable discourse. We dont all have to agree, but I hope we can all get along through the process :) Blessings   The Aquarian Tabernacle Church and Pete Pathfinder Davis have done, as far as I can tell by looking at history, far more with far less scandal than the Frosts. Veterans Tombstone Pentacle, only .edu sponsored pagan seminary, umbrella 501 (c) 3 which just by the ATC having it, it gives all of Wicca privileges that other pagan religions don't enjoy in the eyes of the government, prisoner rights for incarcerated pagans, and a myriad other accomplishments from the making it safe to be open in the Mid-South, to defending churches from all denominations (Pagan to Christian and back again) from unfair laws levied against home worship. I think few people throw Pete's name around in the circles of Pagans changing the world, because his ministry has always been behind a desk and not in front of a camera. The video of him posted earlier in the month was the first video of him I have ever seen, though I have enjoyed the benefits of his accomplishments every day I have been a Pagan. Which is every year of my life since I was 5. I think that Pete has always been an administrative Pagan. Raymond Buckland called him one of the most influential Pagans in history. His life before Paganism was one of political service. He was the mayor of Hanover, NJ. No democrat had been elected as mayor in that town for over 100 years, until he ran. He kept the job until he decided not to run again. Wicca may not seem political, but as Wiccans we are charged with keeping the balance. The People in here may or may not be correct about there being/not being a conspiracy concerning Christians and the government, but we are woefully short of Pagan politicians on either side of the isle. That's an imbalance. Pete has always told me (because I've been lucky enough to know the man) that you get more done in a tweed jacket and leather elbow patches than you can get done in a cape. He means that we need to get out there into the real world and make our lives and beliefs a parallel to the places we live in. Its no longer shocking that were Pagan. Now that we can get past meeting someone workout them freaking out about our beliefs, some of us are ready to have a say at the school board, or in city council, or on higher levels of government.   One must also remember that the writer of the original post is located within the Mid South in the Jonesboro, AR area. The author in question also led one of the most violently protested (by very angry Christians) marches in Wiccan History: [ http://www.childrenofthecircle.com/videos.htm ] I am happy that the post has made people talk. I personally cant see Wicca as NOT a nature religion, since everything we do is based on the cycles of the seasons. Sabbats fall on Astrological dates (0 degrees Aries is Ostara, 15 degrees Taurus is Beltain, etc.) that coincide with harvests, livestock and planting schedules. All the creatures of the Earth are the voices, heartbeat, and children of The Lord and the Lady. In my humble opinion.          Hello, all! I work with The Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary (WSTS) @ WiccanSeminary.EDU We are a college offering degrees from Associates to Doctorate in Wiccan Ministries. We do not offer Degreed Elevations DIRECTLY. We have teachers from all over America, in Canada and in Australia. Teachers have the right to take on any student from the school that they find to be appropriate for training with them. So through the school, you are able to not only acquire your legal degree, but to find the teacher that is right for you. We do online course work through Second Life, which allows us to have tangible, virtual, classrooms in which you attend your courses.  In keeping with tradition as much as is possible while still keeping with the forward thinking needed to navigate an increasingly cyber world, none of our degreed elevations are done online, and must be done in person. You can attend the entirety of the College online, but to obtain your ordination through a High Priestess and High Priest, it must be done in person. This is the benefit that WSTS has in being sponsored by the ATC, which boasts a myriad churches around the country: It is increasingly easy to pair you up with someone local to you.  Our .EDU domain was entrusted to WSTS directly from the US Government to denote the validity of our school, and that anyone who was searching for a valid Wiccan seminary, would be able to do so at a glance. We are incredible reasonably priced (less than $1000 a year). We also have work scholarships for those who meet the financial requirements. I hope this helps anyone who has been looking for something like Woolston-Steen, and if you happen to need something different we wish you blessings on finding your path, and we cant wait to see you there as we walk it ourselves. Peace, Love and Light.         I see all the people who habitually surrender out of their games posting here, and I understand that you wouldn't want to be penalized, but the game ending and the lobby popping up before the game is over is penalization for those that dont have endless time to play. Some of us dont get to get home from school/work and just veg on smite. The people who want to play a game through to the end are already copping a punishment, so why should the people who cant make it a whole game be off scott free? If there was a penalty of some sort, people would think before casting a vote 10 minutes into a conquest match before anyone has even lost a tower. And people shouldnt be penalized for not surrendering. The point is to PLAY  the game.    I have been in too many conquest games where people vote to surrender as soon as it gets difficult. More than half the time no one has even lost a tower, or our team is actually ahead in position, but maybe behind in total gold and levels. What's more: more often than not we end up winning the matches that we stay in. It makes me think poorly of my teammates when the surrender is used like a reset button, willy nilly. I think the peraon who initiates the surrender, as well as everyone who votes to uphold the surrender, should incur a goodwill loss. It doesnt hurt their bottom line, its just a reminder that its unsportsmanlike to constantly leave games before youve seen them through to the end.   Just want to point out that through Woolston-Steen you can get a legal Associates through Doctorate degree, as well as have the opportunity to meet a dozen possible teachers that WILL take students down a 1st-3rd initiatory path. Those Degrees are not charged for. The only money charged is for the College itself (because it is a real college with a .EDU website and license from the state to award legal degrees.) Blessings, and I hope that helps!     	116
    I found lots of startup-related services being offered on Fiverr. Those look entire untrustworthy to me (in fact, everything offered on the site looks quite untrustworthy). But since Fiverr has such high traffics, they must be good for something I guess. Anyone (especially startup founders) has experience working people there?   No, I am not the author, but you can contact him here http://toddwschneider.com/about/      I didn't create this, saw the image somewhere else and decided to post it here. But you are right, this is misleading sometimes.      At the moment yeah, open open to two countries because opening up to more countries requires some additional development work (e.g. converting exchange rates and so on). There is one way to work around it though, sign up as US or Canada, and then go to your profile page and make the change. Sorry for the inconvenience.   No problem! Thanks for suggesting the question too!   If you go to the Entertainment section, you will see your question (which currently has 1 response). You will have to wait for a while before you can see results (because others have to complete it first).   Sorry about this! What is the question you asked?      Thanks for the feedback!   Thanks for the links!   Thanks for the feedback!   Tried, but never got them to feature us, they simply receive tooooo many submissions everyday.   Thank you! Very help indeed.   Thanks! Any idea where you may find these people and what do offer them usually?   If you browse as a guest, your default location is Canada (because we don't know where you are and also don't want to save your IP and figure out your location that way). We have to pick a location for you so yeah, we picked where we are.   I've been working on a site called Arima (http://arima.io) with a team for a few months now. We have built a pretty decent product (I think) and we are just in the initial stage of gaining traction (public released in 10 days ago). We get about 30 or so users a day.  Let me begin by describing what our startup does. We are a Q A site for mass opinion. Basically, unlike most Q A sites, where responders can freely enter text (which becomes difficult to browse once you get a lot of answers), we focus on multiple choice and numerical responses, and help you tally up answers so that it is easy to see what the mass think. We also try to get you some in-depth analysis of data, such as what people from you country/city selected or answered, their demographics information and so on. In short, think of us as Quora for Mass Opinion.  Like every consumer internet startup, we are a site requires a lot of visitors and a lot of content. For the moment, I don't know what is a good way to get initial traction. Here are some thoughts:  1) paid advertising (most obvious) - tried reddit, facebook and stumbleupon. Nothing too great at the moment. 2) Reddit - reddit has a huge userbase with a lot of users interested in this kind of stuff. I tried posting in /r/internetisbeautiful, for example, and got some traction from there. But once your post drop down to the second page you lose attention, and I am not sure how else I can utilize reddit. 3) I have a blog http://insights.arima.io where I write some articles, but again, haven't found a good way to push this out.  Please let me know what you think, and if you know any good ways to get traction, please let me know! Thanks!      thanks! map is on our backlog.   Thanks:), yeah we will try to open up to everyone as soon as we can.   Thanks for the tips!  We've recently added a guest login feature, now you can go in and start seeing content without actually having to register.      All the ads are charged in US dollars right? So if I am from Canada, and want to advertise on this platform, is credit card the only way to pay (in which case the bank would charge me an additional fee for process US payments). Are there any other ways to pay for ads (e.g. paypal)? Thanks.   http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29050114            **Name**: http://arima.io  **Elevator Pitch**: Arima is a number based question-and-answer website. Ask questions, get answers from users all around the world, and see how you compare to the rest of the planet.  **Stage**: site now open to public after a closed alpha test.  **Looking for**: feedback, help submit new questions.          Thank you!                  Agree, focus on one and put 100% of you energy in it.   why not try http://angel.co?   https://uservoice.com  this one has a free license.   I think a 3 people team is totally fine (if you   this Google guy are the only people on board now).   Is he the technical person or the business person on your team?  I suggest that you should consider some alternatives. Your partner will likely spend a lot of his time with his new internship (at least for the first few month), which means that he will have less time to focus on your project. While it is true that an internship at Google makes you look good on paper, this does not solve your current problems (i.e. build a product). His experience at Google will help you in the long run, but this does not mean anything right now. I suggest that you should consider finding another partner (perhaps keep this guy as well, but on a part time basis with less equity).   Which city are you from may I know?  I suggestion is to find a technical co-founder. You can find this person thru 1) your college/university, 2) local meetup groups, 3) angelist or 4) linkedin. Find people who like to work for startups (even on a part time basis) and start from here.   If people want recipes, why not just google and find some online?   The home page took a really long time to load, is that just me?   Can you do some consulting work in the meantime?  http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html read the section on consulting.   Honestly, I did not find the video. I knew you said there is a video, but I did not find it until the second time visiting. I was expecting more like a youtube/vimeo type video.  Still, I think having pictures is a good thing. Few people would actually watch the video because it take a long time to do so.    I suggest that you put fewer words on the homepage and more visuals. I don't think I would bother reading all of the texts.   I know engine oil changes are generally every 3-5 months or 3,000-5,000 miles, but how do you know I have driven 3k-5k miles? Do I self report that?  I think this is an interesting business idea. Personally I would not use it because I don't have access to a car now, but I think some will find it helpful. I am pretty sure that there are similar services (especially apps) out there about it, have you researched?   A few things  - I think you should purchase your own domain, and get a serious hosting service (not one that puts ads on your site). These things are cheap nowadays and they really make your site professional.  - I don't like sites with black background, this could be a personal thing.  - I think you should have somethings that explain what you do (other than saying you track maintenance), e.g. a video or a faq page or some visuals. It is hard to get people to sign up for something without know what it is. For example, I'd like to know (before I sign up) how you track my much I drive and when my next maintenance date is (I think that depends on time as well as how far you drove right?). Do I submit my mileage, do you estimate it based on my driving habits, or do you track with an app?   You should post it here if you don't mind giving it away.   you can try some ads via Facebook or Google targeting those interested in affiliate marketing. Or try to talk to some other sites (hopefully in the same area) and see if you guys can exchange links.   Here are my suggestions,  1) Do NOT start with writing a business plan (especially if your idea is around the internet). Not saying that they are useless (which I believe so), but your time could be used elsewhere.  2) If you have little cash, you better have someone who can code. This can be either through finding a CTO (your classmates, friends, people you find on LinkedIn, Angelist etc), or learn to code yourself (e.g. Codecademy). In these days, it's very hard to raise money from investors with just ideas.   3) Start with building an MVP. Find a decent designer (this you will have to pay for, because you can learn coding but design you cannot learn quickly) and make your site look pretty, visual is important.  3) Go and talk to people with your MVP (once you have it done) and see what they say. Have them sign up for a beta or collect user interest. You may be able to get some investment with an MVP, and then that's when you can start hiring developers.   maybe add a new feature called browse as a guest. Users can see limited things (e.g. the first 50 events only, or can see events but not the details). That way those 17% will be able to learn about the app before giving away their info.   I think that you should begin with testing your product among your friends and family first. Ask them if they would pay for your product or no, and if not why not. Sometimes people don't use your product because it is bad (in which case you know you need to go to work again); sometimes they don't use it because there are similar services out there which are free (in which case you can think about a free version, and then later add more features and make it premium account, like LinkedIn); and sometimes they don't use it because they don't realize its value (e.g. if you are a new product that does not exist), in this case you can consider giving a 14 days or 30 days trial. But in all cases, you should keep in mind that if you plan to charge money, don't offer it complete for free now because most people will not pay for something that was free.   Very helpful articles. Thanks!   I think you should capitalize the "i"'s . This makes yourself a much more professional person and encourages others to go on and read your blog....   Putting a video on your site (say you working in your studio/office) would be nice I think. Hearing and seeing someone talking videos make them more trustworthy.   I have some functions of x, in the form of d* sqrt(x) or d* log(x) where d is known. I would like to rewrite (approximate is fine) them in the form a/(1 + bx^c ), where a b and c are arbitrary.  I think one way to do this is to write out the Taylor series expansion on both sides, and then try to match coefficients. Are there better ways to approach this problem? Thanks!   Just my suggestion here:  Math/Probability foundations: -Real Mathematical Analysis by Charles Pugh -Probability: Theory and Examples by Rich Durrett -Something on Stochastic processes would be helpful, e.g. Probability and Random Processes by Geoffrey R. Grimmett and David R. Stirzaker -If you want to do cryptography, something in abstract algebra would be helpful, consider Algebra by Serge Lang.  For Statistics,  You could try Theory of Statistics by Mark Schervish (a good grad book for Bayesian analysis), alternatively, you can try the classic book Theory of Point Estimation and Testing Statistical Hypotheses by Erich Lehmann.  If you're interested in machine learning, read Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning or Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy.  I am not familiar with other parts of CS other than machine learning so that's my suggestion.   Including both job title and age should be okay, buy you need to make sure that the two aren't highly correlated (usually the older you are, the higher job title you have, and this is more common in some industries than others). Could try using levels 1-5, say, to code jobs, where 1 is no experience required, 2 is 1-5 yrs of exp, 3 is 5-10, 4 is 10-20 and 5 is 20+. Or can also try 1 = ordinary titles (like analysts, coordinators, etc). 2 = senior (e.g. senior analysts), 3 = manager, 4 = director and 5 = VP level or higher. This more or less corresponds to the yrs of exp.   I think you should first start by quantifying job titles. There are many job titles out there (which will be hard for you to fit in a model), and even the same job title can have very different salaries (e.g. a manager at a small company vs. a manager at Goldman Sachs). Perhaps years of experience is a better measure?   recall that (x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2, use this to find x and y.   Machine learning is something you should definitely learn, regardless of which branch of stats you do. I suggest try to take on a few consulting projects while you are in school (even for free) and start building a profile (much like a programmer or a designer). You can try to find projects through your university - most university offer consulting services - or professors, who typically have industry connections. Another thing you can try is through LinkedIn or through Meetup. Once you get to work on a few real projects, you will be able to learn how to communicate with non-stats/business people and really understand what the industry is doing. Then ask them for references and slowly move yourself to the fields you are interested in by taking projects from those areas.   graduate stats major is pretty promising these days, you can do business analytics, biostats, go work for a bank or even startups. My advice is try to take some (in fact many would be even better) computer courses while in university and learn coding before you go find a job.   amazing goal  	67

 Of course, exercise without proper hydration, diet, and rest can definitely exacerbate a migraine   Hey everyone,  I've never visited this subreddit before but my family actually suggested I post something online about how I was able to overcome my migraines of 10+ years. I'm not a great writer so bear with me.  A little information about me, I am a 22 y.o male and recent college graduate. I've been suffering with migraines since the 4th grade, and while I was in High School was diagnosed with "chronic, severe migraines" by a neurologist. I have seen a few different neurologists and between ages 17-21 was prescribed between 50-200mg of Topamax daily for prevention, and various triptans (both oral and injected) for treatment of pain. The past 1.5 years I have not taken any form of migraine medication, preventative or pain relieving.  After 10+ years of migraines I have largely been able to figure out my triggers:  1. Dehydration has always been the biggest one, and also easy to figure out since I played a lot of sports in school i.e. I didn't drink enough water at soccer practice I was puking and thumping myself over the head with a soccer ball to try to get the pain to stop. 2. Changes in the weather, mainly when it gets cold. If I spend too long outside in the cold without covering my head with a warm hat I will surely get a migraine. 3. Food and blood sugar. Not in the sense that I have dietary triggers but if I go to long without eating I can get a migraine. 4. The most PAINFUL trigger for me though has always been alcohol, and as an American college student and a member of Greek-life not being able to drink can put a huge hamper on your social life. Alcohol-induced migraines gave me an entirely different breed of migraine, completely untreatable except by emptying the entire contents of my stomach multiple times over and passing out for 10-12 hours.  Here is how I've been able to remove the prescribed medications from my life and live a fun and generally unrestricted lifestyle (including alcohol use) even though migraines are always something I worry about in the back of my mind:  1. Proper exercise: I lift weights 3x a week and run between 3-5 miles 3x a week. I cannot overstate the importance of a constant regimen of exercise. Both as a preventative and spot-treatment. If I am suffering from a non-alcohol related migraine, a quick run or gym session is sure to take the pain away. 2. Hydration: I drink at least 70-80 oz of water per day, and much more if I know I'm going to be consuming alcohol. 3. Food: 3 square meals per day, and a meal or large snack before consuming alcohol is crucial.  I know what I've said might seem like very typical advice, but when I adhered to it, it totally changed my life. I went from the constant looming fear of that unfathomable, nail-through-the-head pain, to confident and generally care-free. Of course it's hard to get migraines out of your life 100% of the time, shit happens as they say, but my life has transformed for the best.  Hope this helps at least one other person the way it has helped me.    	2

If not, do you really want to privatize it which means turning it over to Wall Street and having fees charged every quarter for managing "your money"?    I don't understand you as much as I try.                                                    http://www.netrootsnation.org/  I went 4 years ago and had a great time.                       This interview made me very anxious.  The interviewer sounds very reasonable.  How did Simpson get appointed to this committee?  And wouldn't it be great to have an intelligent interview with a committee member?         I'm a liberal, but this is getting too much for me.  Is it time that we "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."                              My laptop picked up some virus on reddit last November.  There was a post on it at the time, but it was already too late.  If I remember right, it was not in windows or directly in reddit.  Now, I have to unplug my computer and remove the battery almost every time (not always, but most times) I boot up.  Does anyboy remember this and know how I can fix it.  I would appreciate any advice on this.                                                                                                                                   	143
 It wouldn't let me because I just created my account and apparently I have low comment karma.   He did quit at one point, when Skylar showed him that huge stack of money.   You make some good points, but again, if he hadn't done that stuff then he would be dead himself, so he was just making that choice so I think the ends justify the means. I'm no saying he's right, but there has to be some "relatability" to him because he was always put in the situation where he had to make that choice. As for shooting Mike, yes he was wrong in doing that because "he didn't have to". But Mike was willing to kill Walter just a few seasons ago on Gus' orders. I say if someone smites you on one cheek, smash them on the other. I'm not saying the guy was a saint, and after reading all your comments I would venture to change the title of the post to something a little less polarizing, but he didn't deserve everything that happened to him-- and Vince Gilligan always said that Breaking Bad takes place in a moral universe, one where everyone gets what they deserve. My heart broke when everyone he loved turned on him and his family betrayed him and he didn't deserve that because he was a victim.   LOL I think I will actually I'm excited for someone to prove me wrong. Not that I know I'm right, that's not what I meant. I just would like someone to convince me of their opinion.   Good point. Thanks for your reply all my friends are just jokingly calling me a sociopath. But, although I forgot the context of Mike's death, I have to say Mike, although likable, wasn't entirely innocent. He was prepared to kill Walter before so it's not like he didn't adhere to the self-preservation idea. He was always a liability and he could have ruined everything Walter worked for.   Yes most definitely I would. I would hang out with everyone who I know will be famous but keep a low profile for the most part. The Greek philosophers, Jesus, Shakespeare, etc. Then when the 20th century starts I can have my real fun and meet every cool musician. If I get bored then I'll just fake my own death.   I can't rank these but I would love to see them on the list.  The Stooges (by the Stooges) was released in 1969. I love how Ron Ashton did so much with like three chords. The bass held its own while Ashton would masturbate for like five minutes and Iggy would sing the most ballad-y song ever. Everyone talks about Raw Power but they forget this album. MBV (by My Bloody Valentine) was released in 2013 and sounds so peculiar and nice. Innerspeaker (2010) by Tame Impala is so ethereal sounding and haunting you have to include it.   I recently watched Breaking Bad and enjoyed it a lot. But the whole time I was thinking about how Walter did nothing wrong. Yes, he killed Jane and orchestrated Gail's murder, but I don't think he was wrong in doing that. Jane put him in a position where it was either her or him and his family. I don't lie to myself and pretend to be righteous, when given the choice, if someone put me in a position where it's them or me I will choose myself. As for Gail, Wlater didn't actually pull the trigger, it was Jesse (not that he was wrong either). Gail was a liability and you can't blame either Walt or Jesse for choosing themselves over someone else. You can't forge a connection with someone and pretend that you would sacrifice yourself over them. I don't know, I've spoken to my friends and no one agrees with me but ultimately the gist of my argument is that we shouldn't lie to ourselves. If we're given the choice to either die or have someone else die, we will choose the other person. It's self-preservation and it's a natural instinct that we shouldn't hide from or be ashamed of.  Edit: when I said recently that was a bit of a stretch. It has been like a year since I watched it so I forgot about the whole killing Mike and poisoning Brock stuff, but I stand by my statement (albeit not as strongly as before).  	8

Disclaimer: I don't work for, nor am I anyway associated with ChicagoVPS. I have one VPS with this company, and I paid $40 for it. They aren't giving me anything. Yes, I know they should, but they haven't.   What is this, you may ask? It is an online Linux computer that you have root access to, and can install and run practically anything. Read the TOS, 'cause that doesn't include P2P sharing, folding, bit coin mining, seti stuff, and anything else stupid like that, that might kill the performance for everyone else.   Anyways, like I said, you get root access to a Linux box, and when you screw that up, no problem, they give you a control panel that lets you reinstall a new OS in minutes. Pretty cool. With a small effort, you can even vnc into it with a full GUI.  Don't expect the world from this, you get more than you pay for. Think twice before you bet your business on this, although I think there are people that do.   Not a problem!    I'll just wait for a better sale.   http://hellstern.deviantart.com/ is a 'she'.

I guess NewsBlur changed it from 64 to 12 free feeds due to the incoming traffic?      I think because FeedDemon relies on Google Reader for synchronization.   The few times I requested support he responded.   Nick Bradbury, the author of FeedDemon is closing. See http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/the-end-of-feeddemon.html  That was the nail in the coffin for me. I hate to say goodbye to FeedDemon after a decade of working on it, but it's time to say goodbye. When Google Reader shuts down on July 1, FeedDemon will also disappear.   Same here. Most of those have disappeared over the last few months but I also went premium.    If you are concerned about privacy then I would look into a self-hosted solution like  http://www.feedafever.com/ ($30) or http://tt-rss.org/ (free) maybe.   Yes, I like it as well. Seems to work well and it looks like it imported most of my feeds in one shot.    http://tt-rss.org/ is back up but it's a self hosted solution (free).   Same, I am most likely going to go with a self-hosted one like http://www.feedafever.com/ ($30) or http://tt-rss.org/ (free) as those seem to be the best for me right now.    This is probably from the crush of traffic? Mine updated automatically before all this.    I had trouble with some feeds on import. But then again I can't be sure if this was due to the load. It was simpler to manual subscribe to the ones I had problems with.    I'm using http://theoldreader.com/ now to test. I also need to check out and recommend looking into https://www.newsblur.com/ http://www.feedafever.com/ and http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki   Since October 7, 2005 you have read a total of 87,559 items.

Via http://blog.reybango.com/2013/02/04/making-internet-explorer-testing-easier-with-new-ie-vms/  Time Limits on the VMs  All of the VMs have a time limit before the images will become either limited or unusable. Heres what they are:  IE7  IE10: 90 days of total time from the moment you first use the VM. Basically its 30 days usage with two 30-day rearms. To rearm, go into a command prompt and type in slmgr rearm IE6 on WinXP: Will expire 90 days from the time we upload it to modern.IE. Theres no rearm it but well keep this refreshed when the 90 day kill date nears. At the end of the 90 days, heres what will happen:  IE7  IE10: Youll be able to use the VM for an hour before it shuts down IE6/WinXP: Youll be prompted for an activation key with no way to get past it   So do these still expire after 90 days?

 That's rather brilliant! I was just thinking of getting some actual baby diapers to use as stuffers and putting one on her.   I agree with /u/Mattykinss. Munches are a great way to ease into the community and get to know others. Most munches are vanilla type events due to their public setting.   The biggest key is to communicate. Check out the Big Little Podcast episode on [Communication](http://www.biglittlepodcast.com/2012/07/episode-56-communication/). If she already supports you in this, it sounds like you would be able to talk to her about it and have her listen. It's going to be tough, but it will be worth it in the end. Trust me, going behind her back is no bueno. And even if she doesn't want to go, at least she knows you're being upfront with her and open about it.   One additional thought would be to find out what kink she's into (assuming you haven't done this already) and support her in that. But that's just my two cents.   That is adorable!   *makes grabby hands*   I've got a stuffed Hello Kitty that I want to put a diaper on.   I am so super excited to see this company relaunching. I didn't know much until today when I started digging. But I'm excited for where you plan on taking ABU and can't wait to see what fresh ideas and changes you bring to the AB/DL community!   I've been there before! Quite a bit. Thankfully, I've gotten past the binge and purge stage but it's taken a while. I'm at the point where I'll wear (when I can), but I've realized that this is a part of me. I hid it with my ex-wife and let's just say that things did not go well when she found out. But, I wear when I can and have also realized that no one really knows but me. And if anyone **does** figure out, chances are they won't think it's because I enjoy wearing. So, I know it's hard to not feel that shame, but once you accept that it's a part of who you are, and the rest of the world be damned, it gets a lot easier and that shame fades.   I've found that pinching them together after they've gone on helps too. I haven't tried your method but I will next time I get a batch :)   All my friends are dead.   Burn it to the ground.   Alex the cum dumpster...  You don't want to know.   Serve him breakfast  Implying that I have food in my house!   I would contact the company you purchased them through. Talk to customer service and explain what's going on. They might want things that can be found on each package like the lot number. If it's a good company that cares about their customer, they should either offer to replace it or offer a refund. They might want you to send any unopened packages back though so that they can return them to the manufacturer.    That is amazing!!!!    It's always a great feeling to get it on just right! Congratulations!!!!   Ever since I got my Twilight wig, I've been in love with the purple and pink combo!   I want more cloth .  Mainly MLP AIOs...   This conversation is bringing out my little :D   RAWR!!!!! :D   I want the dinosaurs! However, my little side wants the hearts and skulls though!

Red Panda, Totoro and a summer totoro.   Shiny Captain!   Those are adorable!!!   I love the Wheel of Time universe. You're dropped in at a cataclysmic point in the history, one who's repercussions are felt through out the entire saga. During this, the journey of a multitude of characters is chronicled and you're often found wondering if one of them is the chronicler (Loial). You follow the path of Rand al'Thor as he journeys along the path that has been set for him, fighting it most of the way. Watching characters change and grow into who they will need to be is rather unique as well and one that I love. With each character, you start to develop a bond and get excited over their victories and saddened by their defeats. For example, my favorite character is Mat ([Matrim Cauthon](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wot/images/3/32/Mat.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091212050852)). I love how he's put through a version of hell and comes out on top on the other side. From the loss of memories to those becoming a great General, it's an amazing story and one that I can go back to time and time again.   Additionally, the community that built up around it has been amazing. There's [artwork](http://seamassketches.blogspot.com/), [table-top games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_Roleplaying_Game) (as supported by Wizards of the Coast), even [a video game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_%28video_game%29) was created. All of which take place in this universe with an [absentee God](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Creator). A very real [Devil character](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_One), even its own unique brand of [magic](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/One_Power) which introduces even more into the lore.   Overall, it's one of my all time favorite series and worth the time to read.   The issue I've had is to do with the sides. Even with everything set, if I go while laying down, there's the chance that it will rise up and leak down the sides that have no padding what so ever. Plastic pants might be able to help keep everything contained.   Fun fact! I used to eat sunflower seeds by the bucket. And then my body developed an intolerance to the baked shells! Now I haven't eaten sunflower seeds in over 18 years.    Everyone knows his parents are dead. Everyone except the person who wrote in that shitty caption.

It gives regular people a chance to interact with the celebs.   Well said good sir!   I am a random person and I want to wear fuzzy hats...    	31
 Forget the ads unless you want to compete against a hundred other applicants. No matter how good you are, if you're coming off the street you're going to get lost in the pile.  Instead, identify 5 companies you want to work for. Think about what you are actually **qualified** to do, even if the only thing may be to push a broom and scrub a toilet. Try to find out an important person in that department and arrange a 15 minute meeting with them. Almost everyone will give 15 minutes to somebody who shows initiative.  Now, you have to know what they're looking for, and know something about the culture of the company. Do your research. Explain to them why their company is a fit for you and vice versa.   If you get the job, remember 3 things:  1. Show up 5 minutes early. 2. Do something every day that isn't asked of you. 3. Stay 5 minutes late.   You girls want to think that about yourselves, that abs don't mean anything and you like nice boys. You are just lying to yourself. You're not fucking any boys in your friend zone.

Blow it all on 2x Kosta Browne Pinot Noir and dinner. :-P  Edit:  Never mind, they don't have it. :(   I would. You'll have plenty of chances to drink KJ at parties and weddings. When you are searching for yourself, try something different. Those vineyards are trying to make a name for themselves so you might discover a real gem. I have a friend who is an excellent sommelier. He started a winemaking operation a few years ago and just released his second vintage, a 2013 sauvignon blanc, for $16.99. He put a TON of time into getting it just right for him.   It's always a gamble, whether at $15 or at $100. I think what you enjoy is very personal. My wife and I have very different tastes but neither is "wrong." What I like about $15 is that I'm not out a whole bunch if the wine makes me say "meh."   It depends on the vintner. Some $20 bottles might as well be $8. But for more reputable small-batch vintners, a $20 wine probably has a little higher quality of production. The sugars are monitored more closely to determine harvest, the destemming is more thorough, the blending is a little more deliberate to create more complexity and balance that the winemaker is seeking, and it's probably aged a little more and perhaps finish-fermented in oak or cement.      Thank you, Ohio State, for showing why we needed a playoff.   Urban Meyer has always been a gambler. We'll see if it bites him in the butt this time.   Where. The. Hell. Was. The. Safety????   displaced??? WTF??? That was inches from a torn ACL.   At the end of the day, it's still about viewership for ESPN and the SEC can deliver that better than any other conference.   **This** is why we've needed a CFB playoff. Because OSU obviously deserves a chance to make it to the championship game.   Damn, Alabama is the best tackling team I've ever seen in CFB.   start delayed to 9 pm EST.   Ohio State is the only team that will give Oregon a game. Alabama would get steamrolled.   You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field.   FSU defenders not used to defending an option. You gotta make a decision. You can't be undecided.   Now let's just hope for no injuries. Ducks deserve to play the championship game at full strength. Well played, Oregon.   Exactly. Keep your team in the game mentally. If you don't convert a 4th down, the game is over. That was not the time to make that decision. That's a last-5 minute kind of decision.   I can not believe the coach was willing to put the entire game on the line in the 3rd quarter. How much is FSU paying him??   When a coach makes a call like that, they're telling their team that they are panicking. Dumb decision.   FSU deserved to lose after that stupidest decision of the entire year of any coach.   No way. They are risking the entire game in the 3rd quarter? Dumb decision. Bad decision. Take 3.   That was seriously an awesome play. FSU defense has never seen an offense like this. Class is in session for FSU.   Oh boy, now the ball goes back to Oregon with time left for them to score.   FSU can definitely move the ball on Oregon. They're just not sharp inside the 20.   Cry me a river. Fucking white people.       All it means is that Americans are unimaginative idiots.    I bet her mother was the same way.    Overreaching Legislators create sentencing guidelines (20 years for this, 10 years for that, etc.). Overreaching Prosecutors use these to threaten and bully the accused into taking a plea bargain. Often the weaker the case the more threatening the prosecutors become.    All empires follow the trajectory of an arc. Why would you think America could/would be any different? You can't change it because of the fundamental flaws in the structure of a winner takes all, non-proportional republican system.    They are trying to satisfy their emotional needs by using and abusing you, including a need to feel power and superiority. Take care of yourself and try to let go of the guilt. It's ok to attend to your own needs.  They'll be ok without you being a punching bag.    You must be amazed by your partner's thoughts/deeds/abilities. If you don't find him/her amazing, keep looking.         Metamorphosis by Kafka.       Christ, the picture of the jackstones will haunt my sleep tonight.      It's Texas. Do you expect anything else?   And their website uses a white on light blue color scheme.  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/RqPo16E.jpg)      Correct rule, wrong interpretation. You should round down to 20.    The rule is half plus seven.    A progressive tax does not necessarily eliminate the incentive to having higher income unless it's up near 100%. There is, of course, a curve--The Laffer Curve. All economic models show that a progressive tax will produce the most tax revenue while still enjoying economic productivity.  In the 50s and 60s, the United States enjoyed a tremendous boost in productivity and wealth yet the top tax rates (for the top 0.1%) are almost double what they are today.   No tax targets only the area in which a corporation or individual is based. It all goes into a pile and is apportioned. To look at taxes as being earmarked would lead to a gross misunderstanding of the federal revenue and apportionment system of the United States.  Second, corporations do not benefit themselves. They are set up to benefit individuals, from wage earners to shareholders. By shifting the corporate tax burden to individuals, you can more accurately tax the benefit that the individual receives.  Third, eliminating the corporate tax also eliminates the incentive for keeping profits overseas and brings more money back into the U.S. where it helps Americans, rather than helping foreign economies.   If you ask economists, some of the proposals that almost all of them agree on would include:  * Eliminate corporate taxes - companies can reinvest more money into their businesses and create more jobs. * Eliminate mortgage interest deduction - this deduction distorts the housing market and tends to give more benefit to wealthier people.  There are others but these are the two biggest ones off the top of my head.   As others have already stated, Duverger's Law is at work here. The "winner takes all" system practically guarantees that up to half of a district's citizens will be disenfranchised. I see it as a major reason for today's voter apathy.      What a great design.

U2 - The Joshua Tree   The Germans have always been pretty good at propaganda.             Charles Bronson!   Glucose is a monosaccharide, meaning that its a single sugar molecule. It's pretty much the only thing cells burn for fuel. You are right that when you eat glucose, it goes directly into the blood to be used by your cells. Fructose heads to the liver where it's metabolized into lipids (fat). Here's where you went off track:  sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it has two sugar molecules bonded together. Sucrose is 50/50 glucose and fructose. HFCS is 55% fructose, 41% glucose so the two really aren't that different. It's best to get your glucose from grains and avoid sugar altogether.    "You can be whatever you want to be."  Bullshit.    I had an awesome BK experience a couple of days ago. I put in my order for 2 whopper combos and I watched as my cashier overfill the French fry holders (what are they actually called, anyways?). He actually pounded the scooper and holder on the counter to get as many fries into the holder as he could. Then, after putting the fries and burgers in the bag, he took the scooper and dumped a bunch more fries into the bag. That has never happened before and may never happen to me again.    Monitor and Merrimack.    There are a lot of social and financial factors at play. Essentially this is the result of cheap, easy debt and the 30 year mortgage. The price of something is set by how much somebody is willing to pay. If somebody is willing to spend 30 years paying for something and are able to get a loan with a monthly payment of upwards of 35% of their gross earnings, it will likely drive up the price of that item. And because the fed keeps the lending rate so low, banks can charge lower interest rates on mortgages. Does that mean people will lower their mortgage payments or be willing to pay a higher principal for homes? The latter. Again, this drives up the price of homes.   But that money comes from some other part of the economy. Food, clothes, vacations, retail goods. All of these suffer.    The problems in Congress are largely caused by a few people who want the government to be smaller and leave more things to the states.    One word: Metastasis. That's what makes it impossible.    Given the relative size of the aircraft to the objects on the ground, there is no way this shot was taken from orbit altitude.  More likely it was taken only a few hundred feet from the F-15.  Physics don't lie.  	84
 Poor Taric... They're taking his gemz :(   I really hope it's a new support :P Probably not xD   As a Support main, Thank you!   LOL my bad :) Tought OP made it over the Endportal in The End.

Its still nice to win, even if its only ARAM :)   Too bad you can't do this over the portal in survival -_-   LOL in every game I loose ARAM, the other team say GG Easy. Hate it...   This happend for me too bro. Lost 200+ LP. We lost almost every game due too leavers and flamers. In bronze, players think they gonna loose if enemy gets first blood or they are 4 kills after.

 "The Left hates the automobile because the automobile represents individual freedom and the Left hates freedom of any sort."  No. Most Democrats support manufacturing and domestic car manufacturing. To say that Liberals hate cars, isn't really the case. You may oppose a gas tax increase because it is a tax increase. Sure. People that want a gas tax increase to promote efficiency and pay the true cost of driving as stated in the article.  "For the leftist's ideal world, the roads would be reserved for government bureaucrats and leftist leaders while the disregarded masses would walk or take some form of overcrowded, filthy public transport."  Traffic tends to get really bad in city centers. Discouraging car usage is a good way to free up roadways. Freeing up Roadways increases car usage, so it is very inelastic in demand for car travel, which is good for slight tax increase because the deadweight loss is low. Look in the other countries with high gas taxes, people use public transit a lot and their infrastructure is considerably better than ours in many aspects.   Yes, it will move some to public transit. Improving Public Transit and Putting Riders into Public Transit allows the government to make some revenues off of it. Also, it is environmentally friendly, since more people are placed in vehicles, so we don't waste excess energy in traffic or driving in excess to places, where you could have walked, take a bike, etc.    This isn't Appeal to Popularity. This is policy making and determining what most Americans want/support on an issue.  If the majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana, Is that Appeal to Popularity? No.    Yes, but conceding on Keystone will make the Republicans focus on Energy Regulations. They claim that Obama's high amounts of regulations are causing coal jobs to end in West Virginia, Kentucky, Appalachia, etc. Most Americans are opposed to removing regulations on pollution, toxic waste dumping, etc.    Not really. He should concede on Keystone, so Obama can have some agreement with the Republican Party on energy. Energy Production and Energy Extraction has been increasing under Obama's watch and it is helping the economy. Environmental Efficiency has been increasing as well. Politically, I can foresee Republicans using this potential veto in a a campaign to claim that Obama is "Anti-American Energy". During that last campaign cycle, Republicans used Keystone to claim Obama is anti-energy even though energy production has been increasing under his watch.  If Obama wanted to be bold, he should rather his position on TPP.   Bad Idea. I am pretty left on environmental issues, but I do know that more energy production and infrastructure is a good thing for America.   Obama shouldn't veto Keystone. He should instead sign Keystone XL to show some bipartisanship. Why?  Republicans can't campaign against nor attack Obama on energy issues because they can't claim that Obama is anti-energy or his polices such as Keystone are the cause of rising gas prices. If gas prices start to rise in the next months and Obama did veto Keystone, How will Democrats, Liberals, and Obama respond to Republican Congress's claim that Obama is causing prices to rise?  Even if an Environmental Disaster occurs from Keystone, Obama can easily blame the GOP. After all, GOP wanted Keystone XL more than Democrats.    Even though environmentalists will get angry from this, at least you will rally the base in 2016 and give candidates a chance to differentiate from the previous administration.    Either way, you can generalize that infrastructure spending in the stimulus is ranged from 50 to 100 billion dollars. It isn't most of the stimulus. It is definitely less than 25% of the stimulus   I wouldn't say all protectionism is bad. America up until the World Wars was on a protectionist policy.   Most people aren't advocating isolation. Most are just advocating for fair-trade standards.   Read what is in the Stimulus first: http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus   Honestly, just look at the detailed link of what the Stimulus was spent on.  http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus   Stimulus only provided at max 75 billion dollars for infrastructure depending the definition of infrastructure. There are tons of research and articles that will tell you how the Stimulus was spent. 1/3 of it was Tax Cuts. 1/3 was Health/Unemployment/Education/etc. 1/3 was random spending.   By the way, our infrastructure is a 3 trillion dollar problem.   Farmers tend to use rail to send massive quantities of food stuff. I don't think mega farms are going to use truckers all the time.    Agreed. by the way, farmers tend to send massive food goods by rail. Trucks are used for short of medium distances to reach markets.   Infrastructure is mostly a government responsibility.    The problem of infrastructure is a 3.6 trillion dollar problem. The stimulus only addressed that problem with at max 100 billion dollars depending on the definition and criteria.   http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/   It was less than 100 billion dollars and in the range of 40 to 75 billion dollars.  http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus  It is not enough to address close to a 4 trillion dollar problem.  http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/    It was part of the Stimulus, if you didn't read the news back in 2009 to 2010 or looked into it.   Here is how it was spent:  http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus  The infrastructure spending within the Stimulus is just minor patch to a major problem. Of course, we can't fix every problem, but less than 100 billion to fix a 3.6 trillion dollar problem isn't enough.   How does an ad hominem attack on Obama address Bernie's concern on infrastructure?  Obama's Stimulus was basically 1/3 Tax Cuts. 1/3 Health + Education + Unemployment Benefits. 1/3 Random other Government Spendings.   http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus  Infrastructure Spending was only around 40 to 75 billion dollars in total depending on the definition of "infrastructure" in your own opinion.  It also provided some funding to build High Speed Rail, but most of the cash went to California, since states with Republican Governors rejected federal aid.   By the way, repairing all infrastructure costs would cost 3.6 trillion dollars according to the American Society of Civil Enginners.  http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/  Clearly, the stimulus provided only minor patches to a major problem.    I want to see which members of Congress will oppose this.    Generally, European Workers cost more than American Workers with vacation times, paid leave, maternity leave, higher minimum wages, more private sector unions, etc.   TTIP is more for Europeans to worry about, but we should worry about it as well, but the anti-free trade agreement with TTIP has less points than with TPP. If anything, TTIP might bring jobs to America, while TPP, might outsource American jobs overseas.    It is easy to pack Democratic voters in to small districts because they tend to be densely populated or live in urban areas.    TTIP has a lot of benefits for Americans, so a lot of Americans aren't actually against this freetrade deal. Both regions are relatively similar in standards, so once we sign the deal, massive outsourcing won't necessarily take place. America compared to Europe has lower cost of productions in many areas some European Jobs will mostly likely be outsourced to America, but at a lesser rate than American Jobs to developing countries.      She should tell the truth in a way that doesn't make her look bad because you can't fully survive on a pure pro-Obama statement, when most of Kentucky disapprove of him. She could have responded back to the reporter and ask her, "Who did you support?"   I don't think it is the case with Mexico in NAFTA.  1. Mexican Illegal Immigration hasn't slowed as a result from NAFTA, even though promoters of the trade deal said so. People, who don't like manufacturing and are former farmers, migrated to America.   I don't need evidence, since conservatives have been complaining about the increase in illegal immigration for awhile now.  2. Mexican Government isn't stable. The area is very hostile, violent, corrupt, and there is no signs of standard of living improvement.  I don't need evidence to prove this because there has been many gangs, violence, etc reported from the area. It is already widely known that Mexico has a lot of violent problems.   Big Businesses do have an easier access to the global market than small businesses, but it isn't corporate welfare unless the government is actually subsidizing to have the transfer of jobs to the region.  They have the ability to all market expansion and do cost-cutting measures.     False Dilemma  It is the same thing.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma  Either-Or fallacy works as well.  Sometimes those yes or no questions have motivations.  For example:  When a reporter asked Grimes whether or not she supported Obama, Grimes was put in a lose-lose situation. The reporter clearly had a motivation. Grimes should have sent back an either or fallacy question.   It may be advancement but the conditions in the industrial manufacturing Mid-West is so bad.  Those cities never had the ability to slower transfer to new industries. The former union workers and manufacturing workers are still struggling in cities such as Fint, Detroit, Gary, Buffalo, etc    I don't think there is a motivation agenda behind the pro-trade idea. There is tons of evidence to suggest that more trade = good, but it doesn't mean that sometimes protectionism can be better than trade.      If we continue with this "free-trade" process, soon we will sign free-trade agreements with every country to bring all countries's domestic prices to world price equilibrium.   If all Domestic Prices are equal to the World Price, then what happens next? There is no gains from trade since every opportunity cost of creating a good somewhere else in the world is equal.  Usually, in free-trade agreements is basically abolishing national borders and national protectionism without actually abolishing sovereign borders itself.  Since, Free-Trade is so good. Shouldn't America be attempting to sign free-trade agreements with China, Russia, Iran, African Union, etc to allow low tariffs, easy transfer of laborers, etc?  Clearly, if we do so with those "hostile" or underdeveloped or growing countries, we could ease tensions, produce goods at lower costs over there, and "contain" the growing markets by making our businesses invest over there.   Actually you do. NYC and LA are giant metro areas. 1 team would completely monopolize a regional market, which isn't good.    Perot did support Romney in the last election. Probably, he felt that Romney was moderate enough for him when Romney was Governor. Though, I can't understand why he would think Romney is more moderate than Obama.   Sometimes, Questions can't be yes or no. it is False Dilemma when people can have multiple views, moderate views, agree with differences, disagree with differences, or concession with differences.   Interestingly, Ross Perot would be identified as a moderate liberal by today's standards.  http://www.ontheissues.org/Ross_Perot.htm   This trade deal will be important in this new Congress. This trade deal along with Obamacare, Foreign Policy/Military, Impeachment, Keystone, Benghazi, etc will be discussed from this GOP majority in the legislative branch.       To create drugs and new advances in medicine, it is usually best in competition rather than a single government controlling the findings. A lot of drugs and medicine have patents because those cover the cost of investment and time to find new advances in drugs/medicine/etc.  Of course, I agree that the all of society should be covered by healthcare. I just don't necessarily agree with the single-payer format.    I know but Healthcare isn't a natural Monopoly, so there isn't a need for socialism in the insurance market or services in general.         For my original post, please watch the 1992 Presidential Debate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg9qB_BIjWY. You can also find Gore vs Perot CNN debate as well on youtube.   For point 1: http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/11/24/what-weve-learned-from-nafta/under-nafta-mexico-suffered-and-the-united-states-felt-its-pain  Point 2: Basic Economics + General Observation of Conservatives  Point 3: From your own trade source  Point 4: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1993/h575 + http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103 session=1 vote=00389  Point 5: Basic Economics  Point 6: General Observation of the Midwest Industrial Centers + http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFTA%27s_effect_on_United_States_employment  Point 7: General Observation of Current Labor Market and https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ohanian%20Figure%201.JPG + General Look on Images on Bing http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=unions%20as%20percent%20of%20private%20sector%20workers%20since%201950 qs=n form=QBIR pq=unions%20as%20percent%20of%20private%20sector%20workers%20since%201950 sc=0-0 sp=-1 sk= + http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_automobile_industry_in_the_1950s  From wikipedia "Automobile manufacturing became the largest industry segment in the US, and the largest ever created; the US auto industry was many times larger than the automotive industries of the rest of the world combined.[2] By 1960, one-sixth of working Americans were employed directly or indirectly by the industry, but automation and imports eroded the need for such a large workforce within a couple of decades. The 1950s were the pinnacle of American automotive manufacturing and helped shape the United States into an economic superpower."   Of course, you can claim that wikipedia is not a primary source, but it does have source links on itself. It still summarizes the details well enough to understand the basic point.   There, you have all the citations.   Single Payer would put too much accountability on the central government and states. It could lead to corruption. I don't support that, but I support mandated healthcare insurance or a public option vs private option.    And Mitch McConnell will repeal Obamacare and keep the website of Kynect?    MLS is a retirement league.   1. Our Agriculture Businesses were able to put some Mexican Agriculture businesses out of the market. Those workers had to either work in the factories or find some other opportunities. Many come illegally in search of better opportunities. Since NAFTA, Mexican economic/social climate, the new manufacturing jobs and social conditions aren't better than jobs and social conditions that they had before.   2. You are talking about the producer and consumer surpluses, right? I understand that. It is just a transfer of welfare. If migration doesn't harm the US or Mexico, why do conservatives complain about the mass migration illegals?  3. For your third point, if you look at the graph, the trade deficit increased throughout the mid to late 1990s. In 1995, after we past NAFTA, we started to have a negative trade balance. It is -15,808.3 (add in the graph's key) compared to +1,349.8 (add in the graph's key) in 1994. Every year since to now, it has grown to -67,000 at its height. Those are HUGE number differences.  "It only ballooned in the 2000's, so tough to blame Clinton for this, right?"  Also, Clinton, Some Pro-Trade Democrats, and the majority of Republicans in Congress past NAFTA. I only blame the policy, but people, who agreed on it, each share a piece of the blame.   4. Ya. Obviously, if you allow trade without guidelines, tariffs, quotas, etc. Then, businesses will obviously outsource. I agree with your next statement.   5. Yes. Also, true, but it also causes a huge economic declines in the Rust Belt of America.  6. Most manufacturing jobs were already unionized and were middle class jobs in the 20th century. In order for the workers to compete, they would have to reduce their wages and cut benefits, which in turn made them lower class. Some had to leave to retail jobs, which have less pay than their manufacturing jobs.    Yes. That is also true for some, but they don't have the enough political power to discriminate the majority or others like many conservative politicians throughout America. There are tons of examples.   The effective tax rate would still be higher than today's effective tax rate. If the marginal income tax today is 30%-ish, Why do we still have debates on loopholes? Nobody pays 30%. Many pay less than 30% and sometimes have a negative tax rate. With a high marginal tax rate of 90%, Wouldn't you expect an effective tax rate higher than today's effective tax rate?   Ya. They try to get party unity on votes.    True. Not all republicans are racist, but you can not deny that the Solid South excluding cities and minority areas are all Republican dominated now. Also, the Solid South is known for having some social groups based on hating minorities in the past and today-ish. Those groups wouldn't necessarily vote Democrat in today's politics.    A whip is basically a party's main person to gather/rally members to support/vote/agree on the majority of the party's views on a issue.   Whips try to get moderates or the fringe to support the establishment view.    The article is an opinion. It is pro-Trans Pacific Partnership and Free-Trade.   I know the Diamond Political spectrum. There is one created by Libertarians themselves.   http://theadvocates.org/quiz/quiz.php  Ron Paul is definitely more economically conservative than Hillary and Obama.   "Clinton and Obama mass-murdered and tortured people. " Source?   How about John Tower (R) Senator from Texas, who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964?  Why do Republicans cite Byrd to claim that Democrats = racist when obviously when 99%+ of all southern Republicans and southern Democrats opposed Civil Rights?      Ron Paul is more rightwing than Obama and Clinton on economic issues. He is only left of them on social issues in some cases and on some Constitutional practices.    George HW Bush, Al Gore, and Clinton promoted that NAFTA will reduce illegal immigration, export more goods to Mexico, and create more "jobs".   Today: Illegal Immigration increased. Trade Deficit with Mexico Increased. Many Manufacturing Jobs left America.    The Parties are different. it is just that both are influenced by some similar sources. To change, you either vote lesser or two evils, primary the establishment, or vote 3rd party - (not the best option on change depending on the outcomes)   I don't think it is much. The stimulus only provided only around 50 billion dollars to 75 billion dollars on infrastructure.   American Society of Civil Engineers states that the government needs to spend 3+ trillion dollars to fix every problem, but we know that is not achievable.    the word Chiefs isn't really "native american" per say fully. You can have a "chiefs" name and random logo of a strong figurative leader. I do agree that MLS should stay away from logos that are Native American based.   What will be the name of the Atlanta team?   Why did Defoe sign a 4 year deal and want to go back?   You will.  "Although Lampard's loan deal runs out on New Year's Eve, an agreement is in place for him to stay with City until at least mid-February, with the new MLS season not starting until March." from the article  Lampard just won't be able to practice with the new club in the preseason.    Not necessarily. Spending on Public Works Projects boosts demand for Manufacturing Products and American resources such as Steel. Those projects provide medium term union construction jobs because repairs take longer than building pipelines. Also, those resource demand can build public transit/repair highways/introduce competition to the very profitable airlines via rail transit, which will increase mobility and boost efficiency in travel.    Urruti should be the starter because He has faster goals per minute than Gaston.    "compassionate conservative might see the social problems of the United States, such as health care or immigration, as issues that are better solved through cooperation with private companies, charities and religious institutions rather than directly through government departments." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassionate_conservatism  You are using a hard-core definition of what it means for a conservative to be a RINO. George Bush was Neo-Con as well. Patriot Act, Illegal Spying, Tripling the Deficit, etc came with the need to fight wars in Afghanistan and the fear of WMDs in Iraq. Cutting Taxes is also a conservative position, which reduced expected increases in revenues, which in combination with military spending, created more deficits. We do not have Open Borders with Mexico. We do have one with Canada. "Big Government" was the result of increased military spending and general increases in revenue/spending based on population growth.   George Bush is still an establishment conservative, but more moderate leaning on some issues than the typical modern conservative. As evident in this link:  http://www.ontheissues.org/George_W__Bush.htm   I agree. I wish more politicians would address the issue of rail transportation. We haven't heard much since 2010's Obama/Biden's HSR proposal.    Bush isn't a progressive. Bush was a compassionate conservative. "compassionate" is another meaning for moderate without being labeled as a "leftwing progressive" or "RINO" or "socialist" and still be considered a normal conservative.    Just a thought. America funds a lot for airports and highways/roads/cars for domestic transportation. Why is Amtrak still behind in competitiveness?   I think MLS needs more color diversity.  Green, Orange, Purple, Yellow, Brown needs to be better represented.    Not even. Jeb Bush is a populist leaning conservative on most issues.   http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm  He is still at best 90% the same as an establishment conservative.   It is worth to have a discussion because economic policy is always debateable. After all, since free-trade is so beneficial, Shouldn't America negotiate more free-trade agreements with India, African Union, more South American Countries, Russia, Iran, Iraq, etc? Every country has a comparative advantage is something, right?   I think people have the wrong definition of populism.  Populists are people, who are economically liberal and socially conservative.   Progressives/Liberal are people, who are economically liberal and socially liberal.  Note: There were Progressive Republicans in the early 20th century to mid 20th century.   "a course in economics" meaning that I taken basic microeconomics and macroeconomic courses. As you can see my link in one of my comments, I can understand that gains from trade graph. Of course, there are many other factors when countries trade for goods. Also, I could be proven wrong by people, who study more economics than me.    um... This trade process has been occurring since forever. Many products move from country to country.    It is on WikiLeaks   Ya. Of Course, In any economics textbook, Comparative Advantage of Trading benefits both countries. Though, I wonder what area Americans are specializing in. Probably, High-Tech and Science, but ya.    I agree. Gore, Clinton, and HW Bush pushed the idea that NAFTA will create more jobs, end illegal immigration, increase American exports. These are lies. The American Trade Deficit increased with Mexico. illegal Immigration increased. Manufacturing Jobs declined throughout the 90s.  I know where these Pro-Free experts get their evidence from. It appears in any economics textbook with this simple graph. Of course, the majority of economists are pro-trade. Some are pro-protectionism.  Example: http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg    It is simple Supply and Demand Graph. It can applied for any business market.   I agree. I tend to not agree with those textbooks data and evidence, but a lot of economists would say that Pro-Free Trade = Good   I have taken a course in economics. American Produces lose some Producer Surplus because they can't compete with low prices of the world market. American Consumers gain Consumer Surplus because they can get cheaper goods. The producer surplus loss and the consumer surplus gain is basically a transfer of surplus within the original economy. The consumers, who can access cheaper goods below equilibrium now from trade, adds to the consumer surplus. It is shown by the triangle in the graph.  http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg  Of course, I think those economics textbooks promote that free-trade "can" improve surpluses/welfare/etc  They cite tariffs as causing more dead-weight losses and hinder ability to a competitive free-trade market.   Supposedly in economics, if the World Production Costs and Price of goods are lower than America's production and product prices, then free-trade actually benefits the consumers of America through trade. Consumers could expand overall surplus. The American producers are the ones, who will suffer.  Example: http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg      Montreal has a decent pick there. The defender was among the top in total points for the Fire team in fantasy.        Only with the fusing of opponent's monsters for fortress. Otherwise, it doesn't help much.   DNA surgery counters the swarming of monsters. Though, I feel there is movement to destruction effects in yugioh.          It is so slow with so little support. The mega fusion is nearly impossible to summon. I think Konami and Yugioh have basically forgotten it or don't even bother to add support.   Any thoughts?                                          Some thoughts....  Are Tolls inherently protectionist (supposedly not a good policy in economics), if placed between residential and business and/or Industry, or between 2 maps?  Good idea to make money off of congestion? Toll Congestion good for businesses? How should players use tolls effectively in the game?                I recently got out of my budget crisis/recession. I borrowed a lot for economic growth earlier in the game 10 times of $200,000. In the crisis, I tried to cut services and raise taxes. Basically, I used 20% on everything except for low income residential, low income business, and high tech. For spending, I cut education, police, healthcare, parks, and roads. I maintained power, fire, water, trash, and public transit.  I used a lot of "weaknesspays" to maintain surpluses, if I went into the negative range. Now, I got out of the big time crash with some BIG time business boom, since I had 90,000+ people before and after this mess.  I want to know your plan of action. How do you survive your crisis?   	108
 ...would they be injecting the water if they weren't fracking?   And could they frack as cheaply without injecting the water somewhere? If so, why don't they?   It just seems arbitrary for the public to make the distinction between the fracking process and the fracking wastewater disposal process causing the quakes. It's not like the latter happens without the former...   That's probably the stupidest argument I've ever heard.   And I've spent a lot of time on reddit, so that's really saying something.   It's like saying "If smoking causes cancer, why don't terrorists just start giving out cigarettes!? Since they're not, obviously smoking doesn't cause cancer!"    From a [comment 10 minutes ago, in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l2mw/whats_causing_texas_earthquakes_fracking_most/cr5ro87?context=3):   When they stop fracking the quakes stop, when they start fracking the quakes start again. It can't be a coincidence. The other day we had a 4.0 the other day and we have had some gas mains explode because of this and people lost their lives and their homes.

Also, that'd be a cool template for one of those post-it note wall murals!    Me too. It's a little pixelated as my desktop though...                                                                     Thanks, Penny  I lost my shit there.   Not only because it works so well in the pasta, and i'm honored to get the kenny pasta, but also because my aunt Penny insists that I was named after her because my initials are PEN.    Yep. Removed because technically it's not an official gov't report (and obviously not a study) but instead a data update.   Haha no, it's just my favorte /r/shittyanimalfacts name for them.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9mCnxiHVk   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9mCnxiHVk   Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9mCnxiHVk                                              This is the first time it stayed there for a whole month.   Official government source: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html   Hard to say for sure, but the scientific literature suggests 350ppm...               Yeah well "Foxes actually make great cock house guards" just didn't have quite the same ring...    Oh and [about the 2/3rds number](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-26/climate-change-and-the-two-thirds-imperative):   The two-thirds imperative was enunciated in the 2012 edition of the IEAs annual World Energy Outlook: No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 degrees C goal   According to the[ Congressional Research Service](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/just-how-dirty-are-canadas-oil-sands-anyway/2012/05/23/gJQAGdlkkU_blog.html):   oil from tar sands produces 14 to 20 percent more carbon emissions than other oil the U.S. imports.  So no, this is not a clean fuel alternative. But please, don't let facts keep you from rationalizing and grasping for straws...   Yeah I honestly expected some right-wing outrage about a foreign company using big government to steal private property of ordinary Americans, but by and large it's only the locals who seem to care (on the conservative side anyway.)    The point is that the science is telling us we need to leave 2/3rds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground.   How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure?   It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon.   And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate.   The Jargon-Believability relationship is a strong one. With your formal training, there is great shitty potential.   I don't know the fancy names for things (and am too lazy to look up), so I just resort to using nature documentary syntax to make them believable.   If the pipeline doesn't make it cheaper to transport the oil, why would they build it?   Do you really think the industry that knows it's destroying the climate but continues anyway is pushing a pipeline on environmental grounds, and not for its profit?    Binomial Nomenclature shitty?   You're raising the bar here...    Yeah, I get it. Next time I'll try and use an ellipses then, thanks.     Okay, I just deleted an irrelevant portion of the quote for length. Not that it really matters since the post isn't going anywhere, but is that not ok?   I left a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3521fl/stanfords_jon_krosnick_on_climate_change_most/cr06cji) with the full quote, which as you can see doesn't differ in substance from my title...   80% of Americans  I never see 80% of Americans agreeing on anything when it comes to other issues, so this is very unusual  believe the federal government should limit greenhouse gas emissions by businesses and in particular by public utilities.  I know rules are rules, but it seems like editing out a side thought shouldn't be worth removing the post...   Sadly, it was the other way around. Not long after this photo was taken, the rooster savagely murdered and ate the fox.   This lie brought to you by /r/shittyanimalfacts.             Full quote: 80% of Americans  I never see 80% of Americans agreeing on anything when it comes to other issues, so this is very unusual  believe the federal government should limit greenhouse gas emissions by businesses and in particular by public utilities.                  Feature story with info that got the author fired from his previous job, concerning the most powerful brothers and their unyielding pursuit of profits at the expense of the public and environment.               The drawing of someone holding one makes me have to ask:   How long until we get all Jurassic Park-y and have designer dinosaurs as pets?   Alternate question: Assuming we're already in Jurassic Park times where you can have any dinosaur, which one would you choose to keep as a pet?                                                                     	141
 Every department pays differently. Attractions isn't that great.   We get some evenings during the holidays for just CMs. Grad Nites suck ass... but we have had them since the 50's and yes we run all the rides from 10p-3a.   Yes I do :)  It was simple. I came down here for school and already knew I wanted to work here. I applied online (disney.com/careers) and a week later I'm hired.   I specifically work in attractions and in guest show operations. I work at the World Famous Jungle Cruise and Big Thunder Mountain. At guest show operations, I make sure that the parades and fireworks go smoothly from the guests' point of view and I guest interact all day and get to "make magic" as we say. It's wonderful.  It's not hard to be cheerful because it's freaking Disneyland. Mostly everyone is having an extremely good time. I come to work after breaking up with my girlfriend of 4 years and get lost in the show of Disneyland... which is an extremely good thing. Walt made Disneyland to do just that, have it's inhabitants forget about the outside world.   I actually hear more funny things from adults! The other night at guest show operations (GSO) I was talking to a group of middle aged women and we were shooting the breeze and joking and laughing. The apparent leader said "Michael, we are romance novel writers and we want to write a story about a strong male Asian lead now!" I couldn't stop laughing all night. Once I had a very foreign Asian man walk up to me outside the Jungle Cruise asking for the King Kong ride (which is at Universal Studios) with a California Adventure (the adjoining park to Disneyland) map.    Not this weekend, sorry man! It's down for about a week. Making some safety changes.   I'll say them like this: The "friends" of the characters like Mickey and Minnie that walk around and take pictures, are mainly women except for the tall ones like Goofy.  There is a basketball hoop at the top of the Matterhorn (fact).  In retail, if a CM says "customer" they are referring to shoplifters.    I'm going to say this in terms of attractions (which is my line of business), but it also applies to retail, food, outdoor vending, etc.   You get hired into a certain location. In attractions, you get either Tomorrowland, New Orleans/Critter Country, Fantasyland/Toontown, and Adventureland/Frontierland/Main Street USA (The Best).  You are "landlocked," and are only allowed to learn the attractions in your area. If you wish to go to a different area, you may, but you would lose your seniority and knowledge from the current area.  So you hire in at a hire-in attraction, something easy and not too dependent on fast paced thinking or experience. Then once you accrue seniority and rapport, you may cross train to other attractions. For instance, I get to work at Big Thunder Mountain, The Jungle Cruise, and Parades next week over a five day period.    Have fun over there... but when you're ready for some real magic, come to the west coast!   Coming right up http://i.imgur.com/pWyQs.jpg   I really enjoyed the World Showcase at Epcot. As for a specific ride, I really enjoyed the really cheesy Great Movie Ride in MGM Studios and also the Rockin Rollercoaster. All great rides that play to all sorts of audiences and audience wishes.    I've been a Disneyland enthusiast ever since I was little. I went to WDW (Walt Disney World) for the first time in May 2011. I loved the originality and innovation and execution of Epcot and Animal Kingdom. I really didn't like Magic Kingdom and MGM Studios.   It's such a large place... it's an event park hopping. At Disneyland, it's not like that. You walk 100 paces to get to the adjoining park.    On these guys, I sized down one. This was with the intention of curing them myself... as in like fading and all that stuff. So I did that, I cold soaked to get rid of the excess dye and wore them for 8mo hardcore before any problems occurred (see my comment below). The cinch is what sold me at first. It was really neat. However, the more I wore them, the less I felt a need to call attention to the cinch and the more it just became a thing for me to enjoy.    I purchased these denims on two separate occasions. I spent 8mo in my first pair (which I came across in a shop in San Francisco) until I busted a whole in the crotch. It was a tragedy.... so I went back and luckily they still had bigger sizes (I wear a 36) and so I bought the last two pairs in my size they had.  At this point in my style life, I was really into curing my denim on my own. I was into APC first, then PBJ, then Samurai, then I tried LVC and loved them.  As far as I know, they only make indigo. It's all I had. And for the record, my third pair is still alive and look awesome. I should post a pic...   This exact pair of denim.   I have 3 pairs of these. Take care of them and they'll take care of you!    Whoa....   More like... it's a hard dock life.... *groans   I like America's Got Talent :(   Let me just take a picture of these two random strangers who are sleeping peacefully... FOR KARMA.   The problem you may encounter with wearing patterned pants is playing them out. A good colored chino can do you some good... like maroon or dark green.      And you are friends on FB with a sixth grader. Chris_Hansen.jpeg   Only guy in my fraternity who doesn't drink yet. I have not met someone like this GGG yet.    At first I thought you were talking about the fact that it looks like she's taking a huge shit under her chair.   It's really funny to click on the link, then clicking again to zoom.   I have not laughed so hard in a long time.   Andy Bernard/Ed Helms?   "Stay there. Don't fucking move. I need to take a picture for Reddit."      "Thank you. Please try again."

       Dude, Where's Batman's Car?      While I do think this is well done, it's just another poster of someone looking away at something. Too many of those   I'd say one of my favorites is Coffee of Lies.   I remember back in the pre-season where Rex Grossman and John Beck were competing for the starting job, and The Redskins went undefeated in the preseason. It looked like we were on pace for a great season, but ultimately had once again another terrible one. I know RGIII looked less than good but I'm just saying that this is preseason so don't get too sad yet.   Which role did you have the most fun playing?   I don't carrot all what you say.         You fuck......that's pretty funny though   What does that mean?      RIP      I asked this question on the same day, and yet you get the credit. Fucking balls   The movie, 'Little Fucker' it looks terrible but oh so good      Hey I wanna pla      I think Lebron is doing this because he realizes that Cleveland does not have the players to win a championship. Make the finals? Sure why not, East is pretty weak (getting better I may add). But against the west? I don't think so.         Come on guys don't have a cow.      Pet Sematary, after the Dad trips and......you know.    From the picture I thought this would say Tom Hardy used to be a stand up comedian.      Who else thought this was Jason Bateman to direct a new Star Wars movie at first?   Only God Forgives red band trailer.   Walk into the club lik......*sigh* you get the damn point.  	32
 Yea these rock. I use em for methadone sometimes. It makes a really nice fine and airy powder that absorbs nicely up in your nose.    On this topic of having money and its dry... That really is ALWAYS the way, I dont know why, maybe supply and demand. I mean if you get a paycheck everyone else is getting a paycheck also and you would think dealers would be re-uping but I guess its the opposite. Anyways hope you score soon man, good luck.    Well there's the obvious which is if you eat them and throw up your removing the drug from your stomach. But if you snort them or boot them I dont know why your high would go away unless you weren't high to begin with. Not sure if that is any help.   Yes I have come across these a few time's. I think there great. Sometimes I actually prefer doing 3, pink 10mg oxys because it kinda tricks your brain into thinking your doing more than just 30mgs cause you have more powder. But yes these pink 10mg k-56's will have the same effect as a blue 30 if you do three. The extra filler doesn't add up to much. Enjoy!          Haha Probably both   Title Should have been Taming instead of training... my bad               They do have a version for the Wii but I haven't played it. Anyone try that one? I wounder if it is as awesome   This store in my town called 3D games buys and sells every kind of game and console. Its like a pawn shop. I just pawn my old games for credit for my new ones. They pay good money too.   I remember I went to movie gallery or blockbuster and printed off my best pics when I was a kid and that game was still new   And the pokeflute that made them dance!         Your not alone kind sir   I do this almost ever time I'm on the pooper.   Oh ok that makes a lot more since. Yea i am offering the complete collection  of the first 3 sets or what people will offer. Its still not that valuable  I havnt got an offer over 20$   Yes.   Exactly. Your mind takes over   no, I didn't mean to lead you on. I didn't realize these sets have hardly any value. Its been about ten years and all the cards are in mint condition. I assumed I could get at least 100 or more but someone said they saw a set on amazon for 7-9 dollars. Guess I'm going to have to wait until they become more valuable.    Yeah I have seen these sets too. I am offering all three sets though but I guess I'm going to have to wait awhile till they become more valuable. I've never seen a set that low but I have seen a fossil set for 20    I would but that's about the shipping cost   social network  noun      1. A network of social interactions and personal relationships      2. A dedicated website or other application that enables users to communicate with each other by posting information, comments, messages, images, etc  add derp face here   You obviously have no idea how rare a complete collection of all three base sets are. there are individual cards worth more than 40 dollars      I am looking to sell my collection of Pokemon cards. I have every card from the base, jungle, and Fossil sets (all Pokemon and all trainers). I have a binder that has keep all my cards in mint condition for the last 10 years. There is a mix of fist edition, promos but I have every Pokemon from each set. If there is anyone interested my e-mail is test_subject201@yahoo.com Please feel free to asks questions or anything. Ebay suggests to sell each card individually to make decent money but i don't have the time or patents. I'm willing to sell for a cheep, reasonable price. I am hard up for money right now so any offer would be pondered. I can send pics, lists, or anything for any serious inquiries.   What is your e-mail address. I am looking to sell my collection.

Thats a comic on its own. Maybe that will be my next one.   would be a lot easier to read and maybe a bit funnier if the spelling was better. But still a crazy story worth telling   my mind has its own mind!   That would make an awesome meme. I would use it.      The bear is the best. I FUCKING TOLD YOU!   Yeah man. This incident was when I went to see NOFX in road island one year. I was so fucking star struck. I bet I looked just like that         Yea there defiantly are.

 A relevant book on this mass extinction scenario is Under a Green Sky, by Peter D. Ward (2008). Its hypothesis is that global warming will shut down ocean circulation, resulting in the formation of a Canfield ocean (after geologist Donald Canfield). Warm, stagnant and low in oxygen, the oceans will bloom with bacteria that release hydrogen sulfide gas as a metabolic by-product. Hydrogen sulfide is the highly toxic gas that smells of rotten eggs, and its accumulation in the atmosphere will turn the sky a shade of green, hence the title of the book. This concentration of gas should be toxic to most terrestrial organisms as well, hence the terrible sweep of these extinction events.  According to the Wiki entry on the Canfield ocean, Donald Canfield thinks this process is triggered at a carbon dioxide concentration of 1000 parts per million. We are currently at 400 ppm. At the current rate of anthropomorphic increase, we would not breach this threshold for, perhaps, a couple of centuries, but the given that we may have already activated positive feedback loops for the release of planetary carbon stores (especially artic methane), it may already be too late for humanity to avoid seeing a green sky.  As for the leadership our corporate/democratic systems provide us, let us consult the prophet, Lewis Carroll. From his Second Testament, Through the Looking Glass:  Tweedledum and Tweedledee/ Agreed to have a battle; For Tweedledum said Tweedledee/ Had spoiled his nice new rattle. Just then flew down a monstrous crow/ As black as a tar barrel; Which frightened both the heroes so,/ They quite forgot their quarrel.  I wish the monstrous crow would come! thought Alice.  Be careful what you wish for, Alice.    I am coming late to this thread and so apologize for any redundancy in my comments. First, let me touch on a few points of agreement. Yes, in some aspects, Vonnegut is a mediocre writer and often seems to be deliberate in this underachievement. He acknowledged this through his literary alter ego, Kilgore Trout, whom he describes as a terrible writer with great story ideas. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim can be viewed as suffering PTSD (battle fatigue as they euphemized it in that time), or he may be entering a psychosis unrelated to his wartime trauma, a fear that haunts Vonneguts work and private life. Slaughterhouse-Five and Catch-22 do share a core, satirical vision  both their participation in the Good War and the world that resulted from it left both authors disillusioned. However, Vonneguts loss of faith is complete and his literary vision bleaker. Sirens of Titan questions the purpose of civilization. Cats Cradle is a Cold War meditation on the inevitable and likely accidental doom that will result from the combination of human nature and high technology. Mother Night twists the concepts of ethics and loyalty. And so it goes, through most of his writing. Vonnegut intended Slaughterhouse-Five as more than an anti-war novel. Anti-war novels are a futile exercise, he mocked: Why does not someone write a novel opposing a future Ice Age? I understand the book as a post-Christian attempt to find some consolation for our dreadful existence in this indifferent Universe. Here, having no copy of the book, I must paraphrase, On the planet Tralfamadore, they have no interest in Jesus Christ, but do appreciate Darwin, who taught that everything that lives is meant is die and that corpses are improvements. In remedy, let us become unstuck in time. Then, as the Tralfamadorians do, we will see our lives are not a journey of discrete events that have purpose or transcendence, but as an eternal landscape of ambiguous contingency, from which we are free to choose what landmarks we ponder. It is a book that I admire.                  	7
 Who is your favorite character in any show and why is it Oberyn Martell?   No problem man! I agree with your thoughts on the "lack of realisation" by peers. I always feel like I'm the only one actually contemplating this stuff whilst everyone else is caught up in things like religion as you say. I am not trying to offend religion or say that God does not exist in any way but I feel like a lot of people get scared of stuff like this and religion or the idea of a God is an easy solution. You've gone the hard route by truly contemplating one of the scariest things which is the mere meaning of existence. It is not at all irrational to have this anxiety. I think curiosity and contemplation of the universe should take form in awe and excitement rather than anxiety. Just because its uncomprehending doesn't necessarily mean its scary or a bad thing :)   Yeah! It's when you think to yourself "I'm really tired I'm just gonna have a quick lie down" that you always end up napping. I mean I never lie down whilst tired and then after 5 minutes go "Okay, thats that done!" I always end up waking up 2 hours later feeling like death.   This thread actually reminded me that when I got my first panic attacks when I was younger it was always during/after naps. I would go in this kind of delirious/ sleepwalking state and walk around the house saying really weird stuff like "where am I?" to my family whilst crying. They would try and calm me down then I would wake up later having no recollection of it.   I guess napping wasn't built for everyone! Anyway I actually think its a good thing because it makes you more productive. One of my friends naps all the time and never gets anything done, also makes him stay up later at night procrastinating. Its good to have a stable sleep cycle.    bro! I have the exact same thing. After watching that video with the new picture of amdromeda where it slowly zooms in i felt like i was gonna have a panic attack. It seriously puts everything into perspective making u feel extremely insignificant yet at the same time significant by your mere existence. I also find it funny because most people on this subreddit have things like social anxiety or health anxiety yet I also have this like existential anxiety, its usually worse at night when you're lying in bed just questioning everything. It is literally the most terrifying thing when you truly sit down and try and comprehend your own existence and existence of anything in general. Even typing this now I'm beginning to feel a bit weird.  HOWEVER. At the same time its fucking awesome that we are all in this crazy boat together. I mean in the complete and utterly incomprehensible face of it all, we still get up every day and go about our business and try and lead meaningful lives.   The way I look at it is that you are not an insignificant thing INSIDE the universe but you literally ARE the universe contemplating itself. You are this big badass scary thing, that is you!    I'm literally going on a tangent here just getting excited about all this crazy stuff :) One last thing though, I seriously recommend you listen/watch some Alan Watts videos. He is like a psychiatrist for all existential induced anxiety. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I -Thats a good one.   :) hope u feel better   Dude! Every time I nap I literally wake up in physical pain. I get so jealous of my friends who always can take naps but I literally can't. I wake up feeling like I've been in a coma or been knocked out, I have no idea where I am, my teeth feel horrific and even if i brush them they still feel weird like they are covered in sugar and i get a pounding headache.It literally will make me feel bad for the rest of the day until I actually go to sleep. fuck naps bro!   That was way sadder than I was expecting :( Is there no like ending to the book? I feel like all the stuff with the mice was just dropped.    Whats wrong with the 5th book?   I am about to finish the fourth book in the hitchhikers series. While I loved the first few I feel like they have gotten progressively worse. I feel like nothing even happens in the fourth book. Is it worth reading the fifth? What are everyone else thoughts?   If you could have one thing now that would make you happier, what would it be?   You look like Christopher Nolan.   This truly made me feel the significance of that quote about whether or not we are alone are both equally terrifying. I mean after looking at that picture how can you say we are alone? That is one glimpse of one speck in the universe and it seems utterly and unfathomably gigantic. Yet at the same time, the thought that even amongst the sheer size of the universe, we are alone makes me feel like I could explode from incomprehension. I am one of 7 billion. 7 billion. That number is so small in the grand scheme of things that it practically does not exist. Trillions of stars and billions of galaxies. I actually exist. I am one of the 7 billion and I am proud to be part of the 7 billion.  	11
 Silly SoSo, Leanns amish. She doesnt know what a walmart is, lol.   I know right. We all love to hate Penn, but after this season, damn that girl is messed up! I used to think Morello was one of the normal ones, but we learn last season just how crazy she is.   Everything about this makes my jaw drop. You are..... Wow!   I think it was just supposed to be playful.   I like how SoSo goes from being an annoying character, to one of the most sympathized characters on the show.   "You were so hot before you were a cunt."   Wow, you're hot! I love your hips :)   Shes a camgirl. Her name is Rileyster. She can be found on several sites. Links to them can be found on her tumblog. rileyster.tumblr.com   Same here. I know everyone loves Tyrion and Bron, but personally I prefer Tyrion and Varys.    Thank you! I could not have put it better myself!  	10

                                     I recently rewatched D R, and reviewed that in the final moments of GNR, her neck gets sliced and splatters a stream of blood across part of the surface of the moon.  In D R, this shown starting at time-code [1:15:56].  Is this not the same streak of blood we see in the Rebuilds - supporting the theory that they are a sequel of events?   Throughout the shows, we have seen the candidates/children as well as the EVA's numbered.  I recently noticed by the end of Rebuild 3, that some of the candidates also have Greek alphabet designations on the backs of their uniforms.  1. Shinji:  (alpha symbol on his back), meaning first, or in astronomy the brightest 2. ? I didn't notice who had beta. 3. Asuka:  (gamma symbol on her back), meaning third, or in astronomy the third brightest  In terms of "order", this contradicts who is 1st candidate/child, 3rd candidate/child, and so on.  Anyone else notice this or have any thoughts on it?    edit: fixed typo                                                                                                                                                                              Problem:  * Apparently Pangu doesn't like something in your iPhone profile and can't continue the Jailbreak - even though the Pangu app has been injected on your phone.  Try as many times as you want, but its never getting passed "dump caches failed" (red question marks with the progress meter at stopped 10~20%).  Solution:  1. Perform a "Clean Recovery" and create a new iPhone profile 2. Retry Pangu per instructions 3. ... 4. Profit!  HTH.  I tried everything else recommended in this subreddit, and online forums.  As soon as I tried with a fresh profile, it worked perfectly.   Today, case-in-point, two emergency vehicles are going north San Vincente in the 55 zone.  My traffic group is coming to a stop at Stocker St with the emergency vehicles approaching from behind.  I can see and hear them approaching.  I'm in the center lane at the head of the line, but I leave room in front of my car so I can let the guy in the front left lane pull to the right to let the emergency vehicles through.  He doesnt do it.  I yell to him in his car, trying to get his attention over the fact that he's listening to headphones.  He finally takes them off, takes a moment to open and start eating a Redvine, listens twice more to what I have been repeatedly trying to tell him - and then he tells me to "calm down."  I tell him, "dude, I left you space in front of my car so you can get out of the way!"  Meanwhile, there are other people in my lane pleading with other cars in the left lane behind me to move out of the way of the emergency vehicles.  He stares at me and will not move until all the other cars behind him have moved - wasting precious minutes for the emergency vehicles.  What the fuck is wrong with people?                                    They made a point to show that Asuka notices that she has similar bandages on her fingers, although not to the extent of Rei.  We saw a bit of what Rei was going through, but what happened with Asuka?  Why the girls, and not Shinji - if its a pilot-thing?                                                                           I almost wouldn't mind if it did its thing in the morning, but its going off for apparently no reason in the middle of the night.  Thanks for any and all ideas!                                 1. No mentions of anything AoS-related 2. There are the standard (2) tags after the movie: serious/continuity-related mid-credits, and a fan service one post-credits.  3. I highly recommend AoS fans see this movie in continuity order.  Feel free to AMA, provided you use spoiler tags where applicable.       'nuff said   1. anagram of the word "keys". 1. anagram of the word "syke", and is a common misspelling of "psych" in English. In Finnish is means "pulse" or "heartbeat".  1. a fancy way of writing "sky". 1. "Sky" in Italian is "Cielo", which can sound similar to "cello" when when spoken. (I'm not implying anything here - it just sounds similar to me)  Personally, I'm a fan of #1 since she is so adept at getting into computer systems.       [In a reply to comments on another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/20rebg/new_clairvoyant_theory_may_contain_spoilers/cg6ir2s), I started to self-analyze background opinions I have been having since the T.A.H.I.T.I. episode, which have lead me to a branch of the original theory.  I came to the theory that Nick Fury left documentation clues about the location of Coulson's operation and the Guest House that specifically required a human interaction/element to decipher.  It wasn't anything that could be data-scraped/deciphered in a programmatic way. It required holographic projection and visual analysis of an image.  To oversimplify, this to me seems similar to a [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) to inhibit programmatic automation from scraping the data.  So to summarize, The Clairvoyant couldn't see information about Coulson's operation past what would require human interaction and perception.  Following this theory, it makes me lean toward a technologically-based intelligence being at the root of the big bad.  Thoughts?  EDIT: grammar fix, changed "passed" to "past"           	129
 I've been a member of theistic satanism for a little under a year now. [Here's a helpful list of demons](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/HELP.html) And [How to summon them](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/DEMONOLATRY.html)   I would choose half-life 3 and release the Game files to everyone on the internet. Hey, I might go to prison but HL3 would come at last.   You should post this to /r/techsupportgore   Oh my god. I remember this. It is sooooooo hilarious.   I want to get into the game as it seems fun but I know nothing of how to get into it. What do I do first? Buy a set? what set would you recommend for a beginner? Do I need any special knowledge to host a game with some friends or would it all be in the manual? How much would it cost?   I'm prettyy sure he was gonna do HL2 regardless    I do, just thought everyone would like to see this.      My guess is that this is some kind of attempt at having an english name. I know in many parts of asia it's considered high class to use a little english inter-mixed with whatever the local language is. This was probably some proverb or something with shoddy translation.   Marcus. Fallout 2   I snapped the UE up for $3 during the last summer sale. It could've been that or an overpriced coffee from starbucks that morning. I was happy with my choice.   Pfft peasants  *opens new vegas and enter's player.additem 00123054 1000*  I. Won.   I admit defeat.   The hammer and sickle design was the symbol of the soviet union representing the two main jobs in the union and giving power to the proletariat.  China never had that design. Also. I'm not even sure if the soviet union ever existed in the fallout universe meaning that that symbol might not even exist.  Anyone who saw you with it would thing your crazy.  Just saying :/    Thanks! I'm gonna experiment with adding other custom sounds for other playthrough's. Thanks so much!   Andrew Ryan.      How to change hit sounds? I'm currently playing a game with an un-armed character called Ken. Fist of the north rawr. Using the fist of the north rawr gauntlet as my weapon to destroy my enemies.  My question is this. How do I change the sound a weapon makes upon contact with an NPC? I looked in my steam FO:NV folder and couldn't find a folder for weapon sounds. If anyone knows than it would be much appreciated to tell me how.  (I plan on changing the hit sound for the fist of the north rawr weapon to the fast punching sound from the fist of the north star movie.)   That's it. Your story's over. You've walked out of the land of the living and into the halls of history and legend. (Of course you could also try another playthrough for a new faction.)   /r/Fallout   ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN! CHOO CHOO   "FOR CANADA!"   I bet a laser pistol would turn out awesome. You might also try to make T-51 B or T-45 D Power helmet.   Speech. Speech is the most over powered skill in any game ever.   Mass effect? this is my decision making in real life   If I were you I would forgo the risk of software/hardware incompatibilities in the the future and print all the photo's on some high quality paper, Dig a hole in the ground. Put the paper in a waterproof and lightproof container, bury it and come back in 40 years   To me this doesn't sound like a problem.   [This](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide) Is a pretty good guide that doesn't spoil the game to much.   Shoot me a PM, I can't say I'd be much help as an editor as my grammer is quite horrible but I consider myself rather knowledgeable in terms of lore.   This is not the suggestions thread. this for the challenge's posted above.   Try updating your video drivers sadly I can't direct you to the website you would do that at as that list is a list of possible specs and not absolute ones.  But say you got the model with the GeForce GT625 2GB then try searching "GeForce GT625 2GB video driver updates" into google without the quotation marks. To find out which card you have open up your start bar and right click on "My computer" on the drop down menu click properties and the window that comes up should have an option somewhere that says "Device manager"* click on that and expand the menu that says display adapters. Take the name that appears there and search google for video driver updates for that card. Install the updates and all of your games will run smoother not only NV.  *If your using win 8 then use [this guide](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/device-manager-windows-8.htm)   This sounds like a pretty good idea. And once fallout 4 is released and a large influx of new people start playing 3/NV then it could serve as some form of guide for beginners.  I might as well contribute a tip myself.  Whenever your going through the wasteland at early levels, always pick up any junk you see so long as it doesn't over encumber you. You can always sell it for some caps. Even seemingly worthless things like dinner plates can help you when your saving up for that new gun.   Freddie mercury.   Teamfortess athlon.    Mother ship zeta is my favorite FO3 DLC and Old world blues is my favorite DLC ever.

 The Shabazz hangover.   Sweet 16 game, but basically haha. When that game started I was the only one at my house watching. By the time it ended there were 15 people there shouting at the TV   Only reason I like this right now is because I want Davidson in. VCU hopefully you guys figure it out in the next week and a half   Yesss it's a beautiful thing. Our finals week was always the first week of the tournament...which sounds awful. But then take into consideration that I never had a final later than Tuesday afternoon for those quarters = I'm free all week to watch all the games, plus Spring Break the week after. It was pretty much perfect haha   Agree it's worth reading, it's just way easier to find the scores for the bubble teams if they use a button on the scores page.   Jeez. Does Nantz realize no one likes him anyway?   Look a bit down the thread, it's been discussed   You're a champ. I just graduated, I remember balancing finals and March (we were on quarter system). Just think of all the wonderful basketball that awaits when you get through em   I see why it's done though. Reward the best teams in the regular season, make it mean more. I'd argue that has at least something to do with why the Horizon has made so much noise in the Big Dance recently.   Damn that's a tease. Hope he's alright and that he gets to play next week.   He cried? I thought he just daydreamed for a bit   bahahaha best manifest destiny joke ever   LOL YOU ALL LIVE THERE IT'S 77 DEGREES IN SAN DIEGO TODAY   SHE IS A SAINT, YOU HEAR ME, A SAINT   Gotcha. What does he use to weight it?   Best thing about it is we'll get to find out! I love TJ for you guys though, and Stanley Johnson is the truth, he went to high school near me. I don't wish you bad luck at all   I guess I don't understand this as well as I'd like. How does he adjust it exactly if you don't mind me asking?   Did anyone see Sacred Heart-Bryant? Double OT, huge shots back and forth. ITS MARCH AND IM SO EXCITED   I think Mercer left?  Yeah they went to the SoCon   Just a feeling I have. Really am not that high on them this year. No flow offensively.   Bill Walton is amazing, no idea what you're talking about     I'm pretty sure the CIT is what you have to pay to play in. They even have a fancy sales-y brochure. http://collegeinsider.com/CIT2015/   Oh totally. I mostly threw that in there to praise the job Archie Miller has done at Dayton. He's had a phenomenal stretch there the past 2 seasons, and he should be getting more hype for COTY awards.   This sounds so fun.   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXe-zJDZGIE)   Bitch he's Frank Mason   No one in the Pac 12 makes it out of the first weekend.   Teams would still be unlikely to do it, given that taking a spot in an empty game means someone seeded lower than you is guaranteed to play you.  And in the cases that it does happen, it would be exciting as hell. And if you really deserve the higher seed, go beat them anyway.   This makes me feel like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHtlnWNkma8   "Who would've thought having 0 capable players over 6'7" would turn out poorly in D1 college basketball?"  Survey says: http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/roster/_/id/2168/dayton-flyers   He's referring to the power-conference/his own mindset towards mid-majors.   http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000427085/article/larry-foote-jim-harbaugh-isnt-leaving-nfl-for-michigan  Was talked about more than a month in advance. As soon as it became clear he might not be coaching the 49ers, Michigan was discussed as a possible destination.  Anyway, this is a college basketball thread. I'd love to see Stevens back in college, it just ain't happening in the near future.   Except everyone knew that there was a good chance Harbaugh would go to Michigan.   I love that your bracket seeds small conference winners over a lot of the at-large teams. To me, this is how it should be, because a lot of those teams deserve to be given that respect.   But not on the list of games for each team, where he provides the number of possessions the game had.    Well actually..http://kenpom.com/blog/index.php/weblog/entry/the_pre-season_ap_poll_is_great   The more I think about it the more I feel that Nantz isn't gonna let Raftery talk and I'll hate Nantz even more.   I'm so torn by this.  Raff finally getting to do a Final Four will be awesome. Splitting up him and Verne makes me wanna cry.   Flashbacks to Dayton-Ohio State last year. Which was also fun as hell.   Wofford's no joke   I read this to the rhythm of the Rock Chalk chant and it made me giggle at work.   Lol you're very much on the bubble.  EDIT: totally thought that was IU flair.   Can Indiana fans stop with the Brad Stevens wishing? It's not gonna happen.   I'm rooting for Albany because I remember them being in the game against Florida last year with 5 minutes to go.   It has been for the past 5 minutes   He does that every game, it's comical   That was a textbook finish in transition to ward off the shot blockers. We're cookin here   Mostly laugh.   lol Stevens is not coming. Put that one to bed.   Thing is he really doesn't care about his skillset. Question is will someone pay him (read: take him in the 1st round).  Doesn't look like it right now that's for sure   Is that not every game?   Is Mosquera-Perea staying though?   Fuuuun. At least we get to laugh watching him coach.   It's games like this that make me wish I paid for cable.   What's his contract situation?   The intensity of the Big Dance is there for the small conference tournaments, cuz they know they're basically in the Dance already at that point: it's win or go home.   Well, you do get the tournament at home   Am I the only one who gets almost more excited for the small conference tournaments?  At least I trick myself into thinking that every year and then the Big Dance starts and I watch 16 games in a day and I spend the rest of the day screaming about how oh so wrong I was.   I love your team and Tony Bennett by the way. I'm just saying, you don't get much credit for adjusting to something you knew was coming.   What about Syracuse is tricky? Did you guys not know they'd come out running the same defense they've run for almost 40 years?   That's a generous interpretation   Don't get too dizzy spinning that hard.   I mean if you like being salty.   Score 2 points in 13 minutes?   Oh, SDSU too.   Point taken. You know your schedule better than I do, what quality teams have you played that are low-tempo this year? I can think of Utah and Gonzaga. Which to be fair, Gonzaga took you guys to OT at McKale where no one wins, and Utah I think is a little overrated.  I mean, that's one way to look at the strategy of a low-tempo offense. The more positive spin is that you're working to get the best possible shot and you're willing to let the shot clock run down to get that shot, working to get the little inefficiencies to stack up in your favor over the course of a possession through ball movement, cuts, and screens. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of those two viewpoints.   I know it's not my team, but it's gotta be pretty hard to stay angry at Kemba and Shabazz.   Right, that's exactly what I mean. A team that's comfortable playing at a low-tempo offensively will be less dissuaded by Arizona slowing them down, especially if that team is still efficient offensively, like Northern Iowa is.  Agree with you about Stanley Johnson though. You need him going. Entirely different team based on how he's playing.   At best they show an ability to go high tempo if the game calls for it. Their Tempo numbers on KenPom right now are propped up by their games with Oregon and games against bad teams.   Obviously a lot of 1 and 2 seeds are gonna be picked. They're supposed to be the best teams. But there's years where they get picked, idk, 75% of the time and years where they get picked 90% of the time. I'd love to see the difference.   **Life Itself, by Roger Ebert**  Love Roger's ability to capture small perfect moments. And he's intelligent without pretension. I'll finish this one quickly I think.  **Six Rivers, by Peter Coates**  Super interesting history of six influential rivers around the world. It's slow reading, and designed to tell stories that are river-centric rather than anthropocentric, giving the river agency, that kinda thing. It's interesting stuff. I like filling in my ecological knowledge like this, and I've always liked bodies of water.   I'd love to see a compilation of expert picks going into the 08 tournament and compare how often those 1 seeds were picked to go to the Final Four compared to the aggregate from other years, but I'm not sure such a database exists.   Yeah, that's why it's not as much of a knife in the resum to me haha. That's exactly what I'm saying.   Yes for Utah, I'd say for Arkansas it's probably got more to do with no one is getting penalized for losing at Rupp at this point.   VCU's still good though, Dayton's just underrated right now. Archie Miller is doing a hell of a job. Wouldn't be surprised at all to see them in the second weekend if they get the right matchups.  Anyway. Teams with multiple bigs of a caliber that could give Okafor problems are few and far between, and most of them are on this list of 7 haha.   I get that, I've followed college hoops since I was a kid. But I've never looked at the top group of teams and felt like they were as separate from the pack as they are this year.  That being said, it's a single-elimination tournament played by 18-22 year olds. Anything can happen   The upside is there. Just not convinced, personally. Better shot than my alma mater!   Gotcha, better than a lot of people dismissing em out of hand!  Hard to judge the Waves against Gonzaga because they just don't have the size to matchup effectively. They got killed in both matchups by Wiltjer (6'10") and Sabonis (6'10"). And those losses were by a combined 10 points.  I don't wanna say they're excusable losses for BYU, just that Pepperdine is a lot better than most sub-100 teams.   Thing is, Duke also plays at a fast tempo and is used to riding their horses for heavy minutes at that pace. West Virginia and VCU don't score enough to keep up with Duke unless they shoot the lights out of the ball, which is always the great equalizer of the NCAA Tournament (see: Norfolk State-Mizzou. God that game still blows my mind)  If Duke loses to someone outside this group, it's gonna be because they just didn't play defense. All of their losses are that way.   The thing about these teams is that it wouldn't surprise me at all if all 7 of them made the Elite 8. There are no real matchup nightmares for any of these teams outside this group, because they're all damn good teams.  I guess I'd say Arizona doesn't want to face another low-tempo team who's big enough to match up with them but also efficient on offense. Both the MVC teams come to mind.   That's a fair enough point haha. It's also probably unfair to assume that if you were in the Final Four you guys would still look like you have lately.    Say what you want about him, the man makes a great drinking game if he's calling a matchup you don't care (that much) about.  1. Take a drink every time he disagrees with a call. 2. Take 2 drinks every time he says something is "ridiculous". 3. Take 3 drinks every time he brings up the NCAA. 4. Finish your drink every time he proposes a rule change.   Seriously though I like Bilas for the reasons that have been laid out here already. The man knows hoops and is refreshingly free from a lot of the media narratives about teams. Don't always agree with him, but always want to hear what he has to say.   Pepperdine is underrated. Definitely not there yet, but the building blocks are there. Have you actually seen them play?   I hate the Seattle pod in the East. Northern Iowa and Butler, two smaller schools who could legitimately make a regional final if things broke the right way? And two of the more dangerous mid-major teams in the country in Valpo and Murray State?  FUCK YOU SAME POD.  Seriously all 4 of those teams could win a game in the tournament, if not two or three. I know it's all done on bracketing principles but I'd be so bummed if that was a real pod in two weeks.   Except you wouldn't be the favorite on Monday. You'd be the team people were surprised was there.   Wofford yes. Baylor is playing great basketball right now, and really have flown under the radar all year. Pretty much the only reason people look at them like an upset candidate is Scott Drew, which is lazy thinking. He's been proving he's not a joke for awhile now.   https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/haithitrain.gif?w=694   Kind of an aside, but the Rays are building our old bullpen out in Tampa haha. Jepsen is obviously out there, but they signed Frieri and Kohn too.  Obviously now that Zobrist is in Oakland they look a lot better though, which is frustratingly predictable.   Honestly Chuck feels lazy now. It's kind of sad. Tried reading Damned and it just didn't do shit for me.   Only thing about Goodreads is that Amazon bought it not too long ago, and the recommendations are now generated off of that platform. So you'll get basically what Amazon thinks you'll like. Other than that, Goodreads is good stuff.   Cowart has been done for a while now in the eyes of the organization. Kubitza had a .405 OBP at AA last year too. And that's with a high strikeout rate apparently. This is the guy we're looking at as our 2016 3B.   Either that or Narcissus and Goldmund  	92
    "because I didn't hear anyone saying any of these in this video? Please, quote me where people have said this."  I'm sorry but at what point did we relegate this only to the video, you brought up sjw's on tumblr, i assumed we are referencing all instances  including campaigns and instances outside of the video?  "o... do you think that coercion does not count as sexual assault? Because if so, holy shit."  the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats. "it wasn't slavery because no coercion was used" welp i really used the wrong word in this context, i apologize, i was thinking of persuasion not coercion. It is shown in my original post that the definition i used for coercion does not correlate to how coercion is defined, but yes coercion would be under every definition rape, i agree with this, but persuading your partner to have sex no i do not believe so.   "Falsely reporting a crime is already a crime. Does falsely reporting rape need to be an extra super special crime? You don't see why this might make people afraid to actually report rapes out of fear that they'll be unfairly accused?"  No it's not, what are you talking about? falsely filing a police report is a crime, falsely reporting a rape even if it is later found not to be true is not remotely criminalized, if you retract your claims they wont charge, if you file a police report, go to court and he is found guilty and later own you retract your statement he will be freed but you still will not get charged, their are actual instances of this occuring, like the highschool football player falsely accused and who went to jail for ten years, while his accuser ended up suing the school district and won, she does not have to repay, the court system has never even attempted to go after her, she got 5 million dollars from the state in tax payers dollars and wasted another couple of thousand by having the state incarcerate an innocent man.   Wow if you think that false accusations of rapes are actually prosecuted you're extremely delusional. Rape culture, the only culture where men can be accused of rape and immediately have their life ruined yet women still think society is unfairly victimizing rape victims, i think rape is the only crime where a person does not need to provide evidence, testify or show any facts concerning the crime yet somehow their is a high chance the accused will be sent to prison.      I love this, lets ignore the statement and then ask who is saying this, if i have never heard of it, your point is invalid. Seriously you never heard of the yes does not mean yes campaign? seriously i have a friend in the uk, feminist was telling me rape laws were not inclusive and they need to add more definitions like how being coerced into sex(if your partner badgers you but you don't feel like it, his continued persistence even if you're reluctant) should be considered a form of sexual assault, how regret should be considered valid.  In false accusations should be punished extensively, you can't declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue, you're making a mockery of rape, you're basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it's perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future, has no one ever read a boy cried wolf, same concept applies.     So they did a recent study a few months back, most male on male relations are consensual not forced.    But that makes little sense, you're saying that rape culture is based off of men feeling entitled to women's bodies but in reality is the opposite of this, while there are the dbags who think they're Adonises and can get any woman they want, most guys have to work towards just being liked by the average woman, that's why men who can repeatedly have sex with women are seen as an example of something to emulate and admire.  The pickup artist crowd, the guys like the dude who shot up that school because women did not pay attention to him, those are the jerks who believe they're entitled to women by right of being a man, but you can go up to any guy, say wanna have sex and they will feel like they won the lottery and are at that moment king of the world.     Call bullshit, the new world made Spain the most envied nation in Europe, everybody wanted a piece of that pie.    Proxy implies we were fighting on behalf of another power, ie France or Spain, both allies in the revolution, which is not factual, in fact France wanted and believed it would gain territory after the war ended(been awhile since I looked this up) but we kind of screwed them over when we made peace with general Cornwallis.    Why would Tunisia care? Hannibal barca was Carthaginian which were a Phoenician people, Phoenicia was in modern day Lebanon where their descendants(estimated to be around 20% of the population) reside, their closet relatives would be the Hebrews(ancient Hebrew/Phoenician languages were mutually intelligible, the kingdom of Israel and Phoenicia formed a trading empire together, both were conquered by Assyria and their is speculation that Hebrew writing script derives from Phoenician) so in reality Lebanon and possibly Israel?  Would be the ones not amused.   They already do dbag, this guys is more humanized then you treat the israeli's? what about the decades the israeli's have suffered, the lynched soldiers in ramallah? the jews beat and killed for being jews? the israeli's are not the dehumanizing aspects.    Yeah i know but i thought it added to the overall title it's more of a play on the struggle is real meme.   Palestinian hamas leader khaled meshaal is currently suffering from the trauma,exhaustion and pressure of being the leader of an oppressed, besieged people during the recent war of israeli zionist occupation and aggression. Here he is currently sitting in a gym in nice part of Qatar as another ceasefire was horribly broken by Israel after the brave and glorious  martyr's of the Palestinian captured an Israeli soldier for the first time since this conflict began. 32 Palestinian people have been killed so far in this recent flare up. Please spread this, pray for the innocent gazans and this horribly oppressed leader. The world can not stay blind to the oppressed people of Palestine and their elected officials. LOOK AT THAT BELLY THE MAN IS STARVING!      The last time israel allowed in constructions material was about a year ago, they used it to build a terror tunnel into israel. These are the same people who used piping and waste to build rockets.    I'm talking about the second intifida.    Listen my bad. I get what you're saying the narrative of a freedom fighter is someone else's terrorist is a great point. Even in america after they won the war of independence which we in the us consider the great american revolution many slaves who would of been granted freedom 40 years earlier then they did under if not right after the war had Britain won i'm sure probably consider the american patriots terrorist. Hell the op himself considers the political establishment a problem but believes the military wing are freedom fighters. I can cite the fact they deliberately target kids but he will consider them always to be patriots for their national cause.   I get that. I understand. I'm just saying from my perspective on why i do not even looking from a Palestinian narrative could consider them either political or paramilitary wise freedom fighters. But that's just my  opinion. In no i'm not an Israeli, i'm an american from chicago southside. Don't want to go into details but lets just say, my mom would of slapped me had i not voted for obama in 2012 lolz. Honestly if i was an israeli... ok not going to say it might just come of as propaganda or biased but if you want look up the israeli left side of the conflict. It seems the jews by and large are more pro-pali then pro-israel so eh. But anyway have a nice day.     Bro you need to read the context of my post before spouting off. You clearly posted a point about kids writing their names on missiles then inferred they would be targeted at kids like them, which is not the case. Those missiles are not being targeted for children but Hamas(in the kids who die are not intentional, not even the most biased news sources state such things, unless you live in switzerland or something more then likely you know what collateral deaths are don't try to act like everything that occurs in war is completely intentional), while i may not agree with the idea of pride in your national military forces or patriotism it's entirely common for kids to be taught as such. Them signing their names is nothing different then us pilots marking jet fighters with naked women or writing slogans on their tanks, yes the inner leftist in me thinks why would you be proud of a weapon of war but we know how morale goes in any conflict. Anyway you generalized both sides hate each other, i was trying to show you by the humanitarian rights orgs(many of which are anti-israel government) such as btselem is that's not the actual case.  If i wanted to be a propagandist instead i would post vids from the idf youtube channel showing them sending food to gaza and the great humanitarian programs israel has, telling you about the stories of hamas pm grand daughter being allowed into israel for medical treatment instead i made a simple point about the conflict not being black and white.   Secondly i never claimed they did not exist. As we understand now the Palestinian Arab people do exist, rather or not this is historically factual matters little. More then 7 million people believe they're Palestinians so they're Palestinians. In the historical context though and the origins of the national identity is what i was referring to. Secondly i never claimed any such thing jesus read my reddits correctly.  "Hamas never called ahead before sending a terrorist (not a fucking freedom fighter) Seriously dude, it depends on perspective who is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. You are only seeing it from your perspective, try to see from other perspectives. permalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply []test_subject2180 1 point 4 hours ago Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?"   I was making a point about rather or not hamas can be considered freedom fighters and if so who's freedom are they fighting for. To sunni's in iraq the isil caliphate could be considered freedom fighters but to their fellow shia they're barbaric terorrist whereas to some sunni these guys are nothing but pure thugs etc. Please understand context.  No need to insult me friend. BTW if i was a propogandist i would not put "zion" in my name. That kind of gives me away as a mossad israeli puppet who is trying to promote propoganda:)     Explain to me one good thing they have accomplished then in concerns to the freedom of the Palestinian people? in your point makes no since, how are they fighting for my freedom if i am a Palestinian and apart of these people. How are they representing me? any body can say they fight for the people hell china's army is called the People's liberation army does not mean people in tibet feel liberated. Yeah but here's the difference, even  the worst extremist in israel like lets irgun/lehi who's members like begin later became israel's pms.  Begin for instance was an extremist going by a narrative he could be considered a heroic freedom fighter or a terrorist. But his actions deliberately attributed to the modern israeli state, a state in which he as pm ended the between israel,egypt and jordan. A state where now arabs can live in a secular democracy albeit they're still problems but this state does have equality. If hamas is to be called freedom fighters whose freedom are they for?    Wait i can get paid? for being pro israel? really now? how much? are you offering? unlike you moron i'm pro-palestine/pro-israel zionist from chicago. I'm on here because i believe in peace but you seem to be biased all around and promote a agenda. How much does pallywood pay you?       http://www.btselem.org/ Bullshit they're hundreds of israeli ngo's name one arab ngo that supports or has sympathy for the israeli's in then you can tell me they both hate each other. Ever heard of chomsky,feinstein?mondoweiss? why are jews the main ones calling for peace and yet the arabs call for deaths of jews?  Look at this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_Peace_massacre The perpetrator was Jordanian Army Corporal Ahmed Daqamseh, who stated that he attacked because he was insulted and angered that the girls were whistling and clapping while he was praying.[12][1]  Speaking on Al Jazeera in May 2001, Daqamseh's mother said, "I am proud of my son, and I hold my head high. My son did a heroic deed and has pleased Allah and his own conscience. My son lifts my head and the head of the entire Arab and Islamic nation. I am proud of any Muslim who does what Ahmad did. I hope that I am not saying something wrong. When my son went to prison, they asked him: 'Ahmad, do you regret it?' He answered: 'I have no regrets.' He treated everyone to coffee, honored all the other prisoners, and said: The only thing that I am angry about is the gun, which did not work properly. Otherwise I would have killed all of the passengers on the bus.    http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-25518813   Russians are saying. He died of aids ha just kidding but poison is proven to be false. Died of old age. Don't trust wiki it's heavily biased.    Bullshit op. Before the infitida you could travel to the west bank you fucked up by supporting hamas.      This no offense to the op but obviously skewed info. The Sabra and Shatila massacre was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, by the Kataeb Party, a Lebanese Christian militia, in the Sabra neighborhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982.  It was christian phalangist not sharon. Op please don't be biased. In he is a refugee due to the refusal of lebanon to make him a citizen.  In there were weapons next to the kid.    Because this aid ship was not really an aid ship but basically a militant organization, the commandos were armed with paintball guns and got horribly ambushed and beat by these "activist" don't believe the media hype it's all lies.   Anyway israel allowed gaza in tons of concrete and they built a terror tunnel. Now they're allowing it in. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/14/israel-blocks-construction-materials-from-gaza-after-terror-tunnel-discovery/ http://www.jta.org/2014/01/26/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/israel-to-allow-more-construction-material-into-gaza    This is even worse. It ignores the simple fact even when it was not a jewish state you had conflict, go back to the nebu musa riots of the 1920's and the hebron massacre. Israel has 1.2 million israeli arabs, many of these people are sitting on the knesset like haneen zoabi yet she campaigns for the destructing of israel never mind she is only allowed to speak due to the jewish democracy. An arab majority state(not being racist) would be crap, not only for the arabs but for the jews also.  They would immediately vote on a constitution based somewhat on islamic principles and beliefs basically sharia law. The democracy would be a majority democracy, which is inherently flawed. Look at rome, look at how dictators like Caesar and before him sulla. They used the mob to their advantage to cause chaos and control the senate. Later own in america our forefathers realizing this decided against a democracy in favor of a republic.   Allowing the arabs to control israel would not only effectively end israel it would end the jewish homeland ideals, the main point of israel is to be a jewish state free of persecution of jews and centuries of anti-semitism. This state would probably end up being a theocracy like iran or end up a corrupt nation under a dictatorship like syria or egypt. Secondly israel agreed to the partition plan(it was not offered by the arabs but the un) which would be multi-ethnic. The arabs refused.    Sorry but that does not add up to facts. The arabs decimated their own greenhouses and economic prosprity, then they later beg the jews to help them run the new green houses. The arabs always get second chances and they f up.  http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9331863/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/looters-strip-gaza-greenhouses/#.U8pMp_ldUaQ http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/10/16/did-palestinians-destroy-their-own-olive-trees-and-then-blame-israel-settlers-say-they-have-the-video-to-prove-it/http://www.militantislammonitor.org/article/id/1463 http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/139012#.U8pM1vldUaQ    Also the video has been edited heavily, 20 minute prior call and 15 minute from the warning missile to the actual strike look at the smoke in the window at around the 1:35 mark it suddenly dissapears. The footage is propoganda.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21dIRCMfnHs Um no allot of anti-semitism exist from the pro palestine crowd. In they don't mean the jews. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-13/palestinian-israeli-jews-future-state-israel-PLO/50394882/1 http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4122473,00.html  Especially in the west this jew hatred continues by arab immigrants.    The rest was owned by the british,turks or absentee arab land owners. If your grand dad has a certificate, talk to an israeli ngo, bring it to the supreme court, it's chaired by a israeli arab(i believe a muslim or druze). If it's valid you can move back. This is what 90% of arabs like to ignore, israel has a proper justice system, the israeli's also keep plots of land open for arab land owners in jerusalem or parts of israel i believe. At worse you may need to simply accept compensation.   It's really complicated, they don't wanna give Palestinians passport cause they want them to go back to their country. Palestinians in Lebanon don't even have the right to own anything or even work in public fields... You can read more about this online.. its really terrible.."  Scroll up this is from another palestenian user from lebanon, lebanon refues them citizenship, career access and other basics that could help improve their situation so that they can continuously be used as a way to keep international opinion against israel at the same time keep their populaces distracted from what they do that's usually even worse. Look it up.    This is  the part where gazan bias comes in. Israel never stole your water. Israel is the reason the region has water. The gas they speculated and found is there gas. You can have tourist from the egyptian side but they refuse to open the border. Israel stole your sand? seriously 0-0   Because the coastal plain of Judea samaria had few water resources, Theodor Herzl already envisioned the transfer of water from the Jordan River to the coast for irrigation and drinking water supply. In order to realize that Zionist vision, the water company Mekorot was created in 1937, more than a decade before the creation of the state of Israel. In the first two decades of Israel's existence, substantial financial resources were dedicated to create the National Water Carrier, a complex water supply system including the Shiloach Pipeline along the Burma Road to Jerusalem built during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War, a first pipeline to the Negev in 1955 and the transfer of water from the Sea of Galilee in 1964. Furthermore Mekorot began a Rain Enhancement program in 1961, increasing rainfall by 13%-18%. Also, a Brackish Water Pipeline was completed in 1965 to divert brackish ground water from infiltrating the Sea of Galilee.  Water reclamation (1970s and 80s)[edit]   Drinking water being collected by hand in Neot Mordechai c. 1947 In 1969 the Shafdan wastewater treatment plant south of Tel Aviv was completed to treat approximately 130 million cubic meters of wastewater per year for reuse in agriculture. However, wastewater from other cities and towns remained largely untreated. In 1970 there was a cholera outbreak because of illegal irrigation of salad with untreated wastewater. This gave rise to major investments in wastewater treatment under the National Sewerage Plan, which emphasized the reuse of treated wastewater. In 1984 the Kishon wastewater treatment plant was completed in Northern Israel, It provides 20 million cubic meters of treated wastewater per year for agricultural use in the fertile Jezreel Valley, maximizing distribution potential during high-demand periods.  Signing of water sharing agreements (1990s)[edit] The 1995 Interim Agreement as part of the Oslo Peace Process provided certain quantities of water to the Palestinians, but prevents them from drilling any new wells in the Mountain Aquifer. The surface water of the Jordan River remains disputed with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Only with Jordan Israel was able to reach an agreement on the sharing of water resources in 1995 as part of the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty.   Israel provided the water in the first place. A full decade before the creation of israel. No offense but you guys refused oslo and israel still gives you their water.  Ihttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Israel#Development_of_conventional_water_resources_.281937-1965.29   This is ignorant af. First off the jews never came to anyone's land and told them to go. The original zionist bought the land from absentee turkish/arab land owners, the majority of the land outside of that belonged to the british authority. Even know arabs still sell land and are prosecuted(even killed) for doing it. The average arab "land" owners living in the land was irreverently small to be a joke. Actually yes. Arabs like haj amin husseini recruited for the waffen ss gathering bosnian muslimss divisions, the ss were the main jew hunters in eastern europe. He was so successful by the end of ww2 it was 60% non german.    Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?            Um how do you stop a bomb that's already in place and a previous attack was actually stopped by the jewish authority. The brits who had a military HQ there refused to evacuate.    Falafel, hummus, and shwarma aren't Palestinian culture.    *filfal, from Aramaic pilpl, "small round thing, peppercorn," derived from palpl, "to be round, roll". Thus in origin, falafel would be "rollers, little balls."   Besides it dates to middle-eastern jews and egyptians.    This is incorrect. The jewish peple settled in the land in the 1800's under theodr herzl. Groups of arabic nomads and bedouin were the only people left in the region until more arabs showed up with the return of the jews, not being racist but yes the arabs believed that if the jews returned that the land would prosper and they could get paid by working for them. It's culturally ingrained by people to believe jews have money and can turn anything into a paradise. Which they did...   Anyway these people living in the mandate of palestine eventually by the british came to be known as palestenians, the only people who identified as this however were jews. The arabs got offended and declared themselves southern syrians. In 48 after 2 decades starting in 1921 with the neba musa riots(jerusalem) in which a man by the name of haj amin husseini tried to eradicate the jewish immigrants living in the land. Shit got cray cray, the jews set up defense forces like haganah, the arabs kept trying to exterminate the jews like during the 1929 palestine riots, the jaffa and hebron riots etc till the point where the jews got tired of there shit in started their own paramilitaries since the british(who controlled the mandate) refused to protect the jews. Something about antisemitism being an ingrained right of people. So the jews developed orgs like stern gang,irgun and lehi. Jewish extremist groups. These groups then basically went on an all out back and forth tug of war between the jews,arabs and the british forces. The arabs killed jews, the jews killed arabs in return, the brits stepped in, got both arabs and jews killed or ignored it, in turn the jews/arabs killed the brits.   The mainstream zionist authority tried to keep the paramilitaries at bay and calm, which never worked out, they cooperated and helped the british authority. Eventually the brits after getting tired and ww2 coming and going. Decided to let the newly formed un handle this "palestine" situation. The un mandated a partition plan where the jews would get 45% of the land, this land would be about 40% percent jewish and 50% arab. This was in the negev mostly and along the coast. Arabs would get 55% along with some 15,000 jews. With jerusalem now officially being a un mandate governed city. The jews agreed thankful to get this and arabs said hell no. They launched a war and lost to the jewish forces holding their ground. For 20 years jordan/egypt occupied the land allocated for the arabs, after israel retook this territory, the plo formed by egyptian born arafat. They took the name the jews discarded when they founded the jewish state of israel and began a war against the jewish statehood. Since that point we have a palestine national caused based on a political ploy nothing more nothing less.   Way back on March 31, 1977, the Dutch newspaper Trouw published an interview with Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member Zahir Muhsein. Here's what he said:  The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.   Simply put. Their not claiming your "land" they're claiming the ancestral home of the jewish people. As exemplified by the numerous jewish artifacts,holy sites,cultural sites and historical evidence that points to it being a Jewish state. The country of israel was founded not by religious orthodox jews, ben gurion, theodr herzl and the rest were all atheist/secular jewry. Biblically speaking the most religious jews are anti-israel believing only the messiah can create a jewish statehood, which is why whenever you see an orthodox jew at a pro-palestine rally they're usually the radical guys who don't have a problem chilling next to the former iranian president who host holocaust denial events. They're also the reason why you hear about little girls being spit on and women told to sit on at the back of the bus. They're firmly anti-zionist. Zionism is exclusively about giving the jewish people a homeland to free them from centuries of antisemitism.   Hell golda meir the first female pm of israel had this to say in concerns to moses.  "Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil"  	37

After fully understanding nietzsche i have discovered just how flawed the society around me and myself are. I found all my delusions, rationalisations, false interests, escapism all of it and it does feel terrible but I am willing to improve myself bit by bit. When exposing the overwhelming amount of flaws my mind kept on switching between giving up with a sense of nihilism (it's all going to end anyway so just live life and let it go) to the will to life and the will to power (Life happens once, be completely honest in every moment) the eternal recurrence started spawning ideas in my head, If I were to repeat this life with the lack of meaning and delusions for eternity how unfulfilling would it be? Though if there were times when I stood up and acted against delusions and become brave and powerful, then a repeating life may be worth it just for the moments of greatness. Where to begin though? When my mind is solving a problem I just ask myself, is this the most important thing I could be thinking about right now? am I spending my days truly improving my life or am I just wasting it because of escapism and more delusions? Is the question "Am i doing/thinking the most important thing in my life?" a question worth asking, is it an important question? what if it is a result of a delusion? There are so many variables that my whole life is making me feel lost and powerless but the will to life still remains      bump      "I should wait until I am on day 10 to apply for jobs, to see my friends, to go out, to work on projects, because on day 10 i am in super power mode"  Days pass then i relapse and feel guilty, the cycle continues, how can I get out of this mode of thinking, I even remind myself of what day I am on rather than using the counter as a way to measure progress I rely on it, help   My friend Shin Dong-hyuk escaped from a north korean concentration camp and from our conversations and all of our interactions I can tell how profound his situation was, it's beyond imagination.      are you feeling it now mr crabs?   opamine receptor and neuroplasticity conversation You: i tried to develop a strategy You: neurons are strengthened better if pleasure pain or emotions are involved You: right?

Stay powerful and be cautious of emotions, self pity and other forms of weakness. Finally the most important way to travel in this journey is to "pour the water on the ground" as someone else on this forum once said. The water is tempting to drink in the desert but once you realise beyond the self doubt that you are powerful enough to pour the water and continue walking through the desert then you will be on your way to sure success. When you arrive in a situation where you are tempted to just fap or just watch one more video or any types of distractions, you should identify that they are glasses of water that you should pour on the ground and keep fighting in the desert.**   Swinging so mundanely from a metal garage door support, with her gorgeous neck twisted like an animal's with a $3 Home Depot extension cord.

Yes, because seeing things in context, the "big picture", is one of the most difficult intellectual challenges. Most lifeforms can't do it.

LET'S DO THIS SHIT   exactly, rather than saying yes to nofap you are saying yes to life      can you elaborate on the difficulty though, how long and how many attempts   Testing out a recent study, type of you are cut or uncut, and how your progress with this has been going/longest streaks etc.   your link isn't working, what do you mean by "elaborated" in this context   that's what i said   bump   circumcised guys are more prone to relapsing, uncircumcised guys can last long streaks of 90 days+ etc is it true? tell me if you are cut or uncut and how your streaks have been going there are theories on this that I will explain after I get the replies   don't get it   The last part reminded me of something in my childhood, i can't quite tell what it is, make me wonder if I have memories that are "blocked" out or if I am living a life that denies one aspect as if I am in denial then again it could be that i'm imagining things, makes you wonder...   Yes, my family hid 25 grand in a small room instalment behind the house, I was contemplating faking a break in and taking the money. Someone give me some perspective or advice? Not sure how insurance works but insurance companies might not believe they hid money there.      In my case i think i am very sexual and when the drive comes back i just can't let go. i PMOD,   1. felt bored and was getting image like flashes of a girl from my school  2. Started to imagine her in the room getting naked wanted to have sex  3. imagined some of the ex  4. instead of studying i disabled my filters my google chrome extensions so i could google stuff about sex stories, i felt very curious to read about what sex feels like in detail  5. felt the urge to watch a girl getting satisfied vaginally it was like OCD something is seriously wrong here  6. watched porn videos of girls getting satisfied vaginally from the front (this satisfied that ocd like urge)  7. erection with a lot of precum, felt like orgasming but i had a strong urge to also stop it all and go to sleep  8. *you've already come this far close to orgasm + porn might as well orgasm* that statement always leads me to failure, i don't know if there is some truth to it  9. came  URGENT HELP BROZ   How many times did you relapse, i've relapsed around a dozen times   though what if a consciously focus on what i am doing to the point where i don't notice the noise, idk this situation is very confusing for me, there is time pressure as well and i feel so scared and lost, all these opinions from others "only a day until your exam!" "wow that noise is really bad how can you study" idk whether to believe or what so lost omg fuck    If you have music from your neighbors that is fairly loud, would you suggest staying where the noise is and studying so that I can get used to studying with noise, or moving all my stuff which is a hastle     that's irrelevant to my question, it's a matter of me getting used to noise or if nose is not something you can get used to for intense concentration like exams and studying   If you have music from your neighbors that is fairly loud, would you suggest staying where the noise is and studying so that I can get used to studying with noise, or moving all my stuff which is a hastle   If you have music from your neighbors that is fairly loud, would you suggest staying where the noise is and studying so that I can get used to studying with noise, or moving all my stuff which is a hastle   smacked? docked?   I would also like to add to the example of a forest with an overall improvement in enjoyment and quality of life/happiness/satisfaction also the nofap forum would be an example of those abstaining from (pmo) porn masturbation and orgasm which includes other forms of stimulation      It's hard to measure if one is truly happy though, I can go ahead and believe that I am in the best state I can possibly be but every day there is some frustration to an extent mixed in with despair and it seems to part of an individual's progress.   @takei what's happening   a fulfilling relationship or fulfilling aspects in their lives, elaborate on these  points      wtf is this shit feel achy, anxious, sick in my stomach, hopeless, depressed, apathetic  throughout these 8 days i have held on to my D, provoked some erections for the feeling of horniness, and sexual fantasy has been on my mind non stop      have you realised that you could zoom out and see life for every second as very valuable as this is the only existence you could get, you could be spending your time doing what is really the most important, the neurons that lead you to choose something more comfortable can be replaced by neurons that want you to make the most out of life, every second is the most valuable you will ever receive in all of existence  	87
 I wrote a paper on zebra stripes for my intro evolution course last year.  It was difficult to find studies on zebra stripes because everyone has just gone with the explanation someone came up with in ~~1890~~ 1867.  EDIT: Looked up the date - it was 1867, not 1890.   I'm an undergrad and do research in an ecology lab on my university's campus.  In my ecology courses, I learned about Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and even did some small experiments in those courses pertaining to OFT.  In my lab the other day, some of the professors were talking during our weekly lab meeting about behavior and one said that ecologists haven't used OFT to explain behavior in decades, ehoch surprised me since most of my courses devote so much time on the topic.  The professors in my lab are always busy and are out of the lab half the time, so I figured I'd ask other ecologically inclined people here!  Are there major flaws that make OFT a bad explanation for behavior?    Here are a [couple](http://www.care2.com/causes/wind-farms-and-eagle-deaths-the-dilemmas-of-green-energy.html) of [articles](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-impact-wind-farms-get-pass-eagle-deaths) about what /u/DonnieS1 is talking about.  I know that wind farms kill far fewer birds than other forms of energy production, but they should be held accountable if they commit the same federal offenses as the other guys.  If they aren't made to pay the fines though, I'd like to see wind farms that kill birds put money towards conservation of affected bird species (if they don't already do that).   I just got a friend request about 20 minutes ago from someone I didn't know, but whose name I had seen before but couldn't remember where. When I read your comment,  it dawned on me, and sure enough, this person's name appeared on my phone's caller ID when he tried to call me last week (I don't answer for names I don't recognize). That's really unnerving...   Taylor Swift's reaction looks eerily similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/NMNqH.gif).   These headphones definitely make the vast majority of the songs I listen to sound glorious, but I've never listened to any other headphones so I can't say whether or not they're the best out there.  I would recommend them based on my experience and general stinginess though, at least until (or if) I come across another kind that I think sound better and are in the same price range.   I got myself the Audio Technica ATH-M50 a few months ago for about $100.  This is my first non-earbud listening apparatus and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones at a fair price, especially since I've spent $150 for Bose earbuds before.   [Is that one of the Yip Yips?](http://www.venganza.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/yipyip1.jpg)   Dr. Ingrid Visser has [permission](http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/marine-mammals-regulations) to participate in these interactions according to the website of the research trust she [founded] (http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/research/our-team).  She's written an [autobiography] (http://www.amazon.com/Ingrid-N.-Visser/e/B003BWZFFO) and there's a BBC [documentary] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0147dw3) about her research style, if you're interested!  Also, here's a BBC [interview] (https://soundcloud.com/orca-research-trust/bbc-swimming-with-whales) about what it is like to swim with killer whales, the New Zealand population of killer whales in general, and Dr. Visser's feelings concerning cetacean captivity.   Mmmhmm.   Last year, as I was walking down a campus street in the afternoon, a middle-aged couple approached me.  The man began to tell me this story about how his lady has been in the university hospital, so they needed money because their car was parked in the hospital garage and was also out of gas and they haven't eaten all day and needed food.  The lady even showed me a "hospital ID bracelet" she was wearing to prove she had just left the hospital.  I knew this story was BS, because they were in the academic core of the university which is about 10 blocks from the hospital and they both looked homeless.  I told them I was a broke college student, but they wouldn't take that for an answer.  The man kept adding to his story and was getting closer to me and the woman started to move to my side and was heading behind me.  Since there were 2 of them and 1 of me and the street was unusually deserted at the time, I gave them the change in my pocket and they immediately left.  I figured it was better to give them ~$1 in change and get out of there than to stay and potentially get robbed.   [Don't say that...](http://i.imgur.com/hSAtVdn.jpg)  	12
    Shame and thanks for the confirmation. Ill just have to back up a bunch of the music, even the ones I have not fully decided whether I "like" them currently or not.   What happened with Ozzwald and his/her youtube channel and all the associated music/remixes they made? I could not find any information other than that they are all gone.  Its a real shame at least to me because I really appreciated their Gypsy Bard remix but all I can find is a speedycake and one poor quality upload such as this. http://youtu.be/v4rNysM51kA   sidenote: I have his original song still and I was trying to tag it with a link to his youtube upload.  	3
 I live in a Canadian town along the St Lawrence river.  I moved here with my parents when I was in my early twenties (ya, still living at home, pathetic I know) and until I learned to navigate this retirement community with little to no activity for young people, being along the river was pretty much all I thought this town had going for it.  I have spent long hours walking and biking by that river, getting into some very secluded areas.  Im pretty burly for a girl and sharp enough to be able to just talk myself out of most problems, so during the day I feel safe in a lot of different situations.  And maybe I shouldnt.    At the time of this encounter I was not even in that secluded of a spot.  I was sitting by a stream in a wooded area of a public park.  Nice day, and there was a bit of walking traffic.  A college class from the school nearby even came down to the stream where I was sitting to get some water samples and catch fish, by the looks of their instruments.  The teacher (prof, whatever) seemed increasingly alarmed as he led his class down to the water.  I gave a head nod like hey hows it going, dont worry, just sitting here watching the water.  Still, he hurried his pupils to another spot along the water looking horrified but I just thought whatever.  Hearing a rustle in the bushes right beside me, I became aware of what the prof had seen and why he was horrified.  I also realised the head nod Id given him made it look like I was in on this, but I honestly had been oblivious.  In the bushes next to me was a woman, which was confusing because she was clearly playing with her penis.  Had breasts, was presenting as a woman but was clearly a man.  She looked over at me, then down at her erection, and in my stupor of disbelief she had time to actually point to it, like look!    As I noped out, I actually said nope! and started climbing up the hill to the path.  He (?) jumped out of the bushes, still playing with himself and trying to get hard in a hurry.  His face was really focused as he came at me and I was really glad it was me in this situation and not some tiny matchstick girl because looks dont scare me and I give as good as I get.  Like, Ive been in scuffles.  This guy was especially puny, but you really never know whos got a knife or blood diseases or just how nuts someone might be, so I was just rathering not and hurried up the hill.    I guess I could have screamed something at him and in retrospect it really weirds me out how quiet the scene was.  I guess we were both just focused.  As luck would have it, the students and teacher were still close by.  Its funny, I didnt call for help or think to walk up to them for help (which is too bad, because maybe we could have caught the guy), I thought to walk through them to dislodge this creepy predator.  Which I did, and it worked.  I then thought I really should keep looking back as I head to the police station and report because no effing way am I leading this guy to my house if he is following.  Still, my number one priority was getting the hell away.  I reported the flashing, gave a statement and all.  The officer asked if Id seen a backpack around when the guy was in the bushes.  At the time I said no but looking back, there was a ton of rope in a coil and some other things that Im not really sure of.  I guess the makings of a rape kit.  There was a possibility this guy had been following me and knew when Id be by the water, which I find unlikely because my routine is incredibly random and I dont even know when Ill be by the water.  The officer guaranteed me this guy would do something like this again and hopefully theyd get him before he really got serious.  Makes me wish Id tried to beat the shit out of him as an early deterrent.      So, fledgling rapist, lets not meet again.            	2
 Police Constables in Ontario make about 90K a year as a top base salary.  The average Ontario salary is 49K.  He is in fact way off with his 5 times #.   http://www.workopolis.com/content/advice/article/how-much-money-are-we-earning-the-average-canadian-wages-right-now/  Suspended cops get no extra pay.  Just base salary.    If there's no money in the government coffers, there's no pension.  How could you **not** know that?   Do you take any solace knowing his corruption was investigated, Prosecuted and he was fired by his own police forces internal affairs?  They did the right thing, It's the law in Ontario that suspended officers retain their pay.   Metal poles are deadly weapons.     Old people are terrified.  Middle aged are scared.  Young people want to party in the Street.   Guards were likely paid not to notice.   It's how things operate in Mexico.   Very often when you make a bad loan, you can collect by seizing real property, garnish wages or accept a negotiated new payment plan.  You don't necessarily have to walk away empty handed.  Neither does Germany.  Pay what you owe.  Problem solved.   What you call pushing insane terms, I call pushing realistic terms.   No love for that genre, but that video was hilarious.     You find the results online, it was studied...by this man.  Get a hint of what's in the dust if you read the story.  "Your" dust isn't a rare specimen that likely won't deviate greatly from the mean.   I can't even imagine the crazy that /r/conspiracy will come up with.   You can still carry concealed.  By your silly argument, every business in Canada is regularly shot up by armed bandits, what with our strict gun control laws and all.   You can't just fire all the union members.  You can shut your business down though.     It's not a community garden.  It's a privately owned garden on the city owned easement.   Hmm, seems like you could have asked him.     	16
 well I'm sure you'll be very pleased at this ending then.   Unfortunately this really isn't a subjective thing, people can and will validly flag you for this. Nudity is a valid reason for a copyright strike, just the same as putting up licensed music unedited. Youtube doesn't give a damn about quality of content or power of creators, they just want the PR of saying 'your kiddywinkles won't see no boobs!"   Yeah, essentially any nudity shown for erotic purposes isn't allowed on youtube, this need to be fixed quickly sips.   If you tell him not to cheat, Simon will skin you and wear your head as a hat.   Oh God, I had this and the TPP reddit open in different tabs. THE WORLDS ARE MERGING!   That's what I tell myself about robocop 3, it was all just a dream wasn't it?   SHADOW OF ISRAPHEL CONFIRMED! TOMORROW AT 6! BE THERE OR BE SQUARE SUCKAS! I for one will be starving myself, waiting tfor the glory that is SOI to nourish me.   "SPAM IT! SPAM IT DUNCAN!" -Lewis Brindley 2014   That's nothing compared to toady one, lone creator of Dwarf fortress. He's been making the worlds most realistic simulation game non-stop for 5 years now, and plans to work for another 15   Weirdest dream? Well it started out with me riding on the shoulder of a giant robot (It kinda looked like Gypsy danger from pacific rim,)  made out of bears,(And I don't mean teddy bears, I mean hyper realistic bears and all the bears were talking to me, with the voice of Nintendo characters, bears were talking to me with mario and princess peaches voice, saying things like 'how was your day, what are you so sad, can I have a chocolate sandwich please'  However, as the dream went on the robot made of bears started walking over a town , more specifically, Brighton, England, I had to keep ducking my head because for some reason, and I have no idea why, the people walking on the street, people I knew from school and stuff, were pulling out SNIPER RIFLES and specifically trying to shoot me. I didn't really care, as y'know, it was a weird ass dream, when I felt a really painful, dull thud in my head, in real life, I had woken up, tried to sit bolt upright (because that's what they do in movies) but had leaned too far forward and smacked my head into a wall, I went back into the dream, only this time things had changed. I was in a concentration camp, and this robot made out of bears was standing right next to me, but it was around my size (and thus composed of really tiny bears) The bears mouths were now full of blood, and against the wall of the concentration camp were all my fictional characters, everything my imagination had ever created. The Bear robot then spoke to me, with the nintendo characters, thousands of them, speaking at the same time like the voice of legion. It said "We are your new friends now, kill your old ones" (I even now think that my subconscious should have come up with better dialogue) I asked how I should kill them and it said "With an imaginary gun of course"    And then the dream just ended, I woke up of course, and was left to look at the ceiling of my room.   SPOILERS! I'm actually hoping they screw up the main quest of this a couple of times, because you get sent back into Khare to travel the paths you didn't go first time around, which would provide a tonne more content.   Exactly, if you delve too far into these theories they eat themselves, as 'Simon and Lewis' aren't actually characters, they're avatars. Hell, if they were really tying up loose ends they would explain why Commander Riker was on an adventure with a dwarf.   Have you bought the DLC's? 'reefer madness' would be a cool one to see.   I would say that may not be the case any more, as once a twist is discovered pre-reveal(and this is fairly obviously the twist) some creators irrationally change it to keep ahead of the fandom. Some creators, not all mind you.    But Simon isn't necessarily going to 'roleplay' perfectly, remember from a meta perspective Yoglabs and SOI don't exist at all, it's just characters and roles.   That's because they're in the same genre, known as a MOBA, that was created by the original DOTA. Therefore, SMNC, Smite, LOL, and dota 2 all share ver similar mechanics.   I would love to see a playthrough of space marine. It's a perfect fit for Rythian   I've just finished playing sorcery 2. Can't wait to see them lose all there money, get thrown into sewers, try to become pirates and get turned into dogs.   I think you should E-mail the yogscast about this. A reddit post called 'a suggestion' isn't the best way to attract attention, but I wish you luck all the same!   You should have caught and trained that goblin.   Yeah, I'm sure Sjin will be JUST GREAT at the wonderful 101   Wallys loss was donut boy's gain!   Don't worry, I'm sure Lewis will be able to save them :3   Foolish Duncan! You have to hold a PIECE of space, like some moon rocks, then if you make a wish, you'll land.  It's really quite simple, It's frankly baffling the Yogscast haven't grasped it yet.   I may be in the minority here, but I don't think WOW is necessarily the most easily accessible or dynamic game. A lot of it revolves around mechanics that are simply arcane to a regular viewer. I would prefer to see you play another game with a similar theme, such as a single player RPG, roguelike, or non RPG MMO, it would be cool to see the yogscast develop guilds in planetside, DC universe or EVE for example. However, I would watch a WOW video if it had a podcast type format, with a raid in the background. That way, if people don't like WOW they can enjoy chatter with sips and the like, and if people do like WOW they can appreciate the stategy.   Hey Sips, seeing turbo Joe led to this, can this lead to Toribash, seeing as it also has stupid ragdoll physics and hyperviolence? More specifically, I think it would be cool if you tried out the popular 'duel sword' fighting online multiplayer that is popular with the kids these days. Not only would an online multiplayer game be revolutionary new content (Literally never seen before on Lets play!) but it would also be damn fun to watch you cut some poor clowns arm off.   Holy crap, Exalt WAS a nigerian Email scam!   I bet special agent Parvis is pissed.   But what about xcom Teep, I mean, he has those amazing hands for snipi- oh, wait, he doesn't anymore.   Hey, did you read my fictionalization of the CIV5 came I did? Reddit badly screwed up the paragraphing, but someone was kind enough to post a paragraphed version in the comments. You'd enjoy it.   It's worth noting that the old blip video player was IMO far more stable than youtube. And is still used occasionally today, I don't know many specifics, but maybe it can be set as a theme?    I swear, if youtube doesn't cut this crap out soon, there will be a mass migration to blip.   Cool, that's all I ask. Thanks for the reply!   But they were defending the block throughout the entire game, but this didn't count as a win condition because the attackers hadn't failed to STEAL the block.   I was trying to compose a comprehensive argument, as it's a game that needs some thought and reasoning applied to it, rather than 'play ac 4 pls'   OK, so I'm just going to say that I'm a huge fan of Dwarf fortress, and I personally think it's one of, if not the greatest roleplaying videogames ever made. I also love Rythians commentary and gameplay style; namely, cool, competent and collected, letting the games provide any humor, that's why I think Rythian should make and attempt to make a playthrough of Dwarf fortress, after he has of course learnt the game. Here are some of the Pro's and cons of doing a playthrough, for your consideration   Pros: *Dwarf fortress lends itself extremely well to a continuation of the themes prevalent in the Xcom series, namely, the yogscast vs the world. Dwarf fortress is a game where you start with 7 dwarfs, which in the playthrough could be named after various important members of the yogscast. In game, these guys already have incredibly detailed personalities, backstories and abilities, and have to essentially build a fortress to protect themselves from the nasty, sprawling, world. This naturally lends itself to roleplay and hilarious events.   *Exclusivity. Dwarf fortress is traditionally seen as a game that doesn't lend itself to video lets play, and thus, very few lets plays have been attempted. However, at the moment, Rythian is in the exact right place to make a lets play of Dwarf fortress. His fanbase is much older than the 'main' yogscast fanbase, would be more welcoming of this style of game, and, as shown by Prison architect and towns, as well as Civ 5 to a lesser extent. Therefore, you have the perfect set of people to accommodate this game. Furthermore, the yogscast is in somewhat of a lull at the moment, with no major non MC series, Civ 5 is showing the live stream stuff and Sip's has stopped skyrim. Therefore, t's the perfect opportunity to make the next big series, something that Kid's will be talking about in playgrounds and saying "Holy shit guys, did you see the latest dwarf fortress ep where simon lost an arm and a leg? And lewis valiantlly sacrificed himself to save his friend from the Goblins? You have to watch it!"   *You're style of play naturally complements dwarf fortress. You're one of the most serious members of the yogscast, and tend to get heavily invested in the games you play. Therefore, the events of dwarf fortress will easily be able to allow you to show emotion in your lets play. For example, Elves in dwarf fortress will become deeply angered if you offer to sell them wood, sometimes even starting wars. So Rythian would be deeply shocked when elves start turning up his fortress RIDING UNICORNS and lay siege, and waste, to his fortress, even killing his hardened warrio dwarf, zoey Proasheck. Rythian swears revenge, and kills the next dwarven caravan to enter his base. When the next siege arrives, Rythian tries to set up an elaborate lava trap to kill them all, however, this backfires and ends up killing everyone. I mean, How cool would that be? And it doesn't need an elaborate script, it just needs Rythians personality and a copy of Dwarf fortress.   Cons: *Graphics, I'm not going to deny that Dwarf fortress isnt the prettiest game in the world, or the most visually friendly to a casual viewer, however, mods like this [lazy newb pack] (http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076.0) Help to alleviate the problem by making DF simple and cleaner, with a better tileset and more utilities.   *Time and work investment, similar to the above, DF takes quite a while to learn how to play, and will require a significant time and work investment to be able to play properly, although it's not as intimidating as it initially seems. But oh, Rythian, the results are glorious   *Down time in videos. When stuff is going hilariously wrong/right in DF it's some of the most entertaining stuff in games, but when You're just managing boring things like stone stockpiles and the like, it can get kind of tedious.  see 3 ways to alleviate this: 1.Play in an evil biome, where stuff is going wrong all the time, and things are always trying to kill you 2. Edit the boring stuff out in videos, although this should be a last resort. 3. Always be working towards some grand goal, such as a 'fuck the world' magma cannon or megaproject, which will help keep the series focused.   All in all,  I definitely think the eventual Pros of this risk will longterm outweigh the Cons, and I think this will be a series people will want to see in their inbox, and look forward to at the end of a long day of work.   Because It's not making them 'think they're winning' It's just letting them win, deliberately putting yourself at a disadvantage for no apparent reason. Besides, they weren't whining and breaking the rules to win, they were disillusioned by the very concept of the adventure map being against them, and the fact red team is able to do all kinds of strategies, where theirs are limited to letting them take blocks, and then hopefully killing them.   But that's a stupid idea for a game. Defenders need to defend, they shouldn't need to think up Bond villain strategies to win a game when the other team can't actually get the iron due to their own lack of ability.   I'd a;also like to point out that Rythian was obviously the most experienced, and was the only player other than zylus to know what the super bar did, and the only player to know how to charge it.   This was a really great Tournament, It's really fun and tense to watch 1v1 yogscast videos like this. I would love to see more of divekick, and I would also suggest Toribash (Sword fight or normal, could make for some interesting fights) and Nidhogg.   They did for wonderful 101   Or a lego videogame, that could have lots of lego talk.   Sips, please play lego marvel Super heroes! You can play as the hulk and smash shit! you can fly about and blow stuff up as Iron man! You can swing on buildings as spiderman! Plus, it has co-op, so you can do this with your best bud Sjin! But seriously, iit would make as marvelous playthrough, with plenty of lego talk, hilarious moments and a fast pace.   But redshirt could be argued to be as much of a member of 'team yogscast' as teep, being an ascended extra. Zhang is just an unrelated x com character   Thank you so much for this, I actually really appreciate it.   Reddit screwed it up. It was originally formatted in word, I have done a hasty edit.   Ok, So I thought I would post my epilogue to the Last Civ 5 game here. I haven't done a hugely through editing Job and It was written on word, so reddit may screw things up. If that is so, please forgive me for it, please.  Lewis was kicking pebbles on the sands of the 'for sale $10' shore, his last city due to the peace treaty. That damns peace treaty! He thought to himself, cursing his rotten luck, why, why, why had he decided to start that blasted war, when he knew that damn dutch venetian alliance was unbeatable if they worked together? He supposed that was the problem really, if they had been at each others backs like he expected them to, he could have swooped in and taken world leadership for himself! He could just imagine it, sipping cocktails from his own private brewery in his tundra palace, eating the best butts from France, the crabs from the dutch, and watching that sniveling toad Rythian of cry-venitian-penissulababia grovel and beg for support. Instead, he gets this shitty, hot Island in the middle of nowhere, and this weird, grey, spongy mass at his feet rather than his beloved snow. What the hell was this stuff anyway? Aren't beaches supposed to have sand on them? He should ask sips about it, he has been on the island longer than him.  "Hey sips, what the hell is this stuff that's on the ground everywhere! Lewis hollered over to the other side of the island, which, as for sale $10 was only around 500 foot across, wasn't saying much. "I don't go by that name anymore, use my real name" "'sigh' please tell me the meaning of this mysterious substance, oh holy ruler of France, eater of the finest butts, the best guy, the real guy, the big bastard himself, sips" Thank you, jeez, you'd think a little formality would be in order when addressing the true ruler of this island" "You sold it to me for free! You didn't even sell it for 10 buck!" Lewis replied angrily, the worst thing about this was that, in some respects, sips was right, he was the equal proprietor of the Island, and, since they were both effectively immortal without the intervention of serious firepower, that was unlikely to change anytime soon. So what did you want to talk to me about, you want in on my super-duper top secret plan?!?!?!?" Lewis jumped, he still hadn't gotten used to how small the island was, and Sips' appearance was, frankly, frightening. He was entirely, naked, aside from a small reed skirt, had somehow gotten tattoos on his knuckles with fuckin' a and fuckin' b on the side, and had a chest tattoo simply stating his French national anthem:  *Big money *Big women *Big fun  However, by far the most disturbing aspect of his appearance was his, disgusting patchy beard. Lewis, having been bestowed with a magnificent, well-kept beard since beard since birth, was appalled by the conditions this innocent creature living on sips face had been subjected to. Sips, please just tell me what the crap were standing on is, and maybe Ill listen to your plan Lewis was exasperated, how many days had he been stuck on this island, having to look at that beard, listening to sips ramble on about how he beat pyrion in an arm wrestle for control of China. Worse still, despite his best efforts, the state of his own beard was rapidly deteriorating, what will happen when his only remaining pride and joy had no pride, nor joy, placed into its upkeep?  Sips looked around at his surroundings for a while, poking the grey mass with his toe. Lewis observed that it looked buoyant enough to not take in water, perhaps it was some mystical substance that the French people had invented, about to be used for a mobile battalion of Islands? Jeez, I dont know everything, guy, it was like this when I built this city, why would I sell this for $10 otherwise? Im not an idiot, Im a savvy genius that will one day rule the world, I mean super planet 3 million has been foretold by eat a butt as the successor to terra or whatever the planet is called nowadays, I mean, this may look bad for me now guy, but I have access to the most valuable resource in the world, and therefore the greatest superweapon, for sale $10 has ever seen! I mean, you didnt think I wasnt doing anything while you guys were just ignoring me did you, Im an enterprising individual! For some inexplicable reason sips, your words dont exactly fill me with confidence Well if youre not going to use my full title, you obviously dont have faith in me, spaceguy of the Girl Guide Corporation At those words, sips ran away, off to his end of the island, whilst Lewis again started absent-mindedly kicking pebbles, willing something, anything, to happen.  Astonishingly, at that very thought, the sound of metal cutting through the sea was brought to his ears. A battleship! Come to rescue him and take him away from this dreadful pla- oh, It was Duncans, as identified by the hasty paintjob of a skull and crossbones on its side, as well as a plank, waiting for people to walk it. Its large speakers spread the sound of Duncan the Pirate kings voice over thousands of Mile of Sea as Lewis realized something: This wasnt his saviour, it was his tormentor.  Ahem, uh hello, I mean ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR YA SCURVY KNAVES DONE BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH ME TREASURE HOARD, AND NOW YE PAY THE PRICE OF FAILURE  Duncan, please, just let me talk over the intercom. Theres a reason Im world leader NAY!!  YE BE A CONNIVING, LIMY SOD, AND SOON YE BETRAY ME JUST LIKE SJIN! IT IS JUST AS THE EAT A BUTT PROPHECY FORETOLDYE-At this point, Lewis could quite audibly hear a loud scuffle over the announcer, when it next came back, he could hear rythians, smoother, calmer demeanour over the audio. Anyway, what Duncan was meant to say was that Sjin betrayed the Shoshone/Venetian/Dutch/ Moroccan alliance, and for that he has, unfortunately, been sentenced to walk the plank. Let this be a lesson to you all, my words are backed with nuclear weapons!  You broke your own damn alliance by kicking me out to this Island! Lewis furiously shouted back, hoping desperately that Rythian would be able to hear. Oh what was that Lewis? We betrayed you? Well tell that to the people of Prague. Prague remembers. My words are backed by nuclear weapons! Rythian was mocking Lewis, but Lewis had no leverage. It was hopeless. Sjin was on the deck now, walking slowly across the plank, and fear in his eyes. The Dutch pirates, with tiny tulips attached to their cutlasses (not even dutch, thought Lewis) were edging Sjin closer and closer to the end of the plank, whilst doing terrible impressions of Pirates. Lewis Knew he couldnt let Rythian and the worlds worst pirate king do this to Sjin, his only friend and ally, so he did the only thing he could, he picked up the Largest object he could find, a tiny pebble, and threw it directly at duncans ship making a small chink noise as it bounced harmlessly off the destroyers bow. DUNCAN, YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PIRATE KING, A TERRIBLE WORLD LEADER, AND A TERRIBLE DUTCHMANbefore long, a terrible, bellowing voice came from the bowels of the battleship. The Duncmeister obviously hadnt been allowed access to the pa system again. WHOS BEEN QUESTIONING MY AUTHORITY OVER THE GREATEST MAN THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN! CONQUERER OF BOTH LEWIS AND SJIN! DUNCAN THE  UNSTOPPABLE? I have Duncan, and you may strike me down, but I will become stronger than you can even imagine Lewis was making stuff up as he went along, wasnt there something in eat a butt about reincarnation? Uh, Lewis, you do realize, that, theyre arent like respawns in this game, if I kill you, you die, thats it  Yeah, get him boss! said Sjin, rather feebly; he wasnt sure who he should be a lackey for. Im done playing these games after your INSOLENCE lewis! I mean, ARRRR, we give you dis bootiful Tropical paridise, and dis is how ye repay us? I do believe they be a double execution today boys! Well, you may, want to rethink that strategy, Duncmeister, because I have a superweapon trained on your ship at this very moment Ok Lewis, har har, youve had your fun, but come on we all know you dont have a superweapon Duncan had walked up to the top deck now, Flanked by Rythian, who had a tired, exasperated look that only the partners of the pirate king could know I DO BELIEVE, I CAN ANSWER THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION said a voice lewis hadnt heard in a long time; Stepping out of the bushes, garbed in full navy uniform and a sword that seemed to be glowing with energy, was pyrion flax.  However, the most fascinating thing about Pflaxs appearance was his beard, which was extremely long and grey. So long, in fact, that It almost seemed to trail off into infinity. And thats Lewis realized to his horror, what he was standing on. He wasnt standing on an island, he was standing on pyrion flaxes beard. Ysee Duncan, whilst you were away from me, I was here, getting XP and Gold in the Jungle, getting Items and levels. And now, its time to take out the trash  Pyrion, what the Fuck are you talking about, this isnt Dota 2 either. My words are backed by nuclear weapons Duncan just seemd to be annoyed by the lack of executions and Rythian was clearly shaken, but Pyrion was oblivious to his words. He was running across the beach at great speed, his sword in the air, running straight at Duncans ship. Apparently ignorant to the several miles of sea between him and Duncan. As soon as he reached the water, he ran straight in, not even bothering to attempt to swim, until he was completely submerged, and didnt surface again.  Um, ok. On with the current, scheduled, uh, execution of Sjin Hold it right there! Despite being Miles apart, Lewis, Sjin, Rythian and Duncan all had the same thought: oh no, not again Out of the jungles of the island came a huge monstrosity, a Kaiju in all but name. Sips had found the rarest and best luxury in Civ 5. He had found a giant crab. At that moment, everyones unanimous second thought was Fuck it after that, everything became jumbled. Rythian pulled a nuclear detonation device from his coat, evidently having gone mad, and trying to kill himself, the crab, and everyone who would remember this mess. Duncan, unsurprisingly, didnt take kindly to this revelation, and was trying to fight his way through to rythian, past his royal guard Sips, who had apparently gained control of the crab and was putting down a helpful claw for Sjin to latch on to Dont worry Sjin, that nuke wont be able to hurt us, this crab is protected against uranium! Whos ranium? Whatre you doing in Tehran Sjin? Lewis was panicking, and running from one end of the small Island to the other, He had no idea what was going on the crab seemed to have eaten sjin, and Sips was climbing into its mouth to be engulfed. Duncan had had finally managed to fight his way to Rythian, and was wrested control of the detonator. Lewis saw something out of the corner of his eye; pyrion was alive and climbing up the side of the battleship! And that was when Lewis set his master plan into motion. The crab was immune to uranium and (presumably) radiation, Rythian was trying to kill everyone, but would only really kill himself and Duncan, and Duncan had secured the nuclear detonator but was standing perilously close to the edge of the ship that pyrion was climbing up. If Duncan and Rythian died, he would be able to restore glory to the glorious Moroccan empire!  Hey Duncan! I have an important message for you! Duncan looked around to see lewis, ignorant of the peril coming to get him from below. Cant it wait Lewis? No, its vitally important for the safety of humanity Fine, tell me! Work the shaft and cup the balls What happened next would remain with Lewis for the rest of his(extremely short) Life. Pyrion grabbed both of Duncans legs, and dragged him into the sea. Duncan attempted to fight back, and then swim away, but both of them were becoming tangled in Pyrions enormous beard, and they were engulfed by the sea, twisting into the Darkness below. Rythian grabbed the detonator and jammed his hand on the button; the sky became filled with the hum of nuclear missiles. For the first time in days, Lewis was happy; all he needed to do was ask sips for admission into his bizzare crab creature mouth. Sorry guy no can do, you should have shown me more respect, and I always have a plan. Oh, oh no.  Actually, you know what?  I dont want to rule a world with Giant crabs and a crab based economy. Fuck it. I can win the next Civ game.  And with that dear reader, Sipsco dirt factory conquered the world, The nuclear bombs lit up oblivion. Sjin took for sale $10, and sips took the rest of the world. In some ways, everyone was happy, but, on the other hand, Im guessing theyll be lots of grudges in the next civ game Because, yknow, Im sure the yogscast will DEFINITELY take this work of fiction on reddit into account.    Well He didn't give me the money to buy the Meld, however, Simon will be... appropriate payment.  I remain   Karl Pilkington need an antagonist. Lewis and Simon are far too polite to fill that role.   Ok guys, I've been caught with my trousers down, I haven't been able to make a Civ game 'epilogue' like last game because I thought this game would end on Friday. However! I Can write an epilogue in a reddit post, or just put it at the next games first episode's reddit comments.   Everyone ignores sips, you just know he's building nukes.   It may be wishful thinking on my part, but I would really like to see the xcom units and giant robots brought into this game. I also plan to write a short story to wrap up the last episode like I did with the last Civ game.   Nah, sips has this in the bag.   Well that's the problem, LLTQ has objectively less content, and, if you played princess maker, you'd know that the amount of content/endings is the best part of the game   Long live the queen just isn't very good in it's 'genre'. Being based on an old SNES game called princess maker 2 but having much less functionality and gameplay length.   Okay, sorry about this repost from the democracy 3 thread, but I really think you should put this game up for consideration. I think your main strength is that you're an amazingly entertaining character on your own merit, thus, you need a game where funny events naturally happen, rather than as part of cutscenes and setpieces, to help your style of editing and commentary really shine, hence my suggestion  **dwarf fortress** now, I fully understand that dwarf fortress is a complicated game to play, learn and understand (although not really more complicated than democracy) but this can be greatly alleviated by a few simple mods, and the role playing potential is so great i honestly believe it become the next 'fan favourite' yogscast series(ala skyrim and civ 5) for example, many of the things sips speculates about his towns members doing in towns are actually possible in df. you can name a dwarf uthgerd, give her the name uthgerd, she can get married to old beardo, give birth on a dinner table to uthgerdbeardo3million, have her fight a giant elephant, lose an arm, become the fortresses chief medic, and then become a wearboar(because a wearboar fell into her personal water supply the previous) go beserk and and kill a bunch of elves, all before being killed by uthgerdbeardo3million whilst he's still a baby. the possibilities are literally limitless. I know you've talked about df before in towns,and i think you may have been distracted by it's complexity, but if you liked diplomacy, I will **guarantee** you'll love dwarf fortress just give it a try ya' magnificent bastard.   But why would he need to when I am already sending my men into his base to help him 'secure' the meld?   Nein! Ich Bin 100% canadian.   Greeting friend!  It has come to my attention that you are short on meld,a disastrous occurrence that puts any persons life on hold.However, I have just inherited my fathers small fortune, and would be able to buy plenty of meld for you and all of your xcom operatives, however, times are tough in my country, and, as Canada is a harsh and desolate place, I have not been allowed access to this vast supply of meld, and may not be for quite some time. However, we must always look to tomorrow! All I need to put the political cogs into motion is for you to tell me the location of your precious xcom base, and I can send a few of my men to 'ahem' Finalize the arrangement.  _Zips Ceo and head of Exalt operations Canada, and proprietor of _zipsco gravel  I remain   And so ends the fall from grace of Sips, the greatest leader France ever saw, conqueror of China, master negotiator, passionate leader, and all round big bastard! Take heed children! Learn your lesson from sips's greed and avarice, and above all, if a strange bald man with a beard offer to let you own 'all of his China' it will probably end badly.   So Duncan was trying to kill martin freeman? I knew it!    I liked the concept and idea of a game where you run the country, however, in execution, it was made up of less of the kind of comedy policies you would expect sips to implement ("Free dirt for everyone!") and more of pleasing trade unionists. It was too complicated to be comedically pleasing. However, I do present sips a pitch for a game he could play which would replicate the ideals of the redditors who wanted him to play democracy, namely, terrible decisions affecting people with hilarious consequences, I realize it's not the best game VISUALLY but the potential is such that I want sips to at least give it a try.  **Dwarf fortress**  Now, I fully understand that dwarf fortress is a complicated game to play, learn and understand (Although not really more complicated than democracy) but this can be greatly alleviated by a few simple mods, and the role playing potential is **so** great I honestly believe it become the next 'fan favourite' yogscast series(ala Skyrim and Civ 5) For example, many of the things sips speculates about his towns members doing in Towns are **actually possible** in DF. You can name a dwarf Uthgerd, give her the name uthgerd, she can get married to old beardo, give birth on a dinner table to uthgerdbeardo3million, have her fight a giant elephant, lose an arm, become the fortresses chief medic, and then become a wearboar(because a wearboar fell into her personal water supply the previous) go beserk and and kill a bunch of elves, all before being killed by uthgerdbeardo3million WHILST HE'S STILL A BABY. The possibilities are literally limitless. I know you've talked about DF before in towns,and I think you may have been distracted by it's complexity, but if you liked diplomacy, I will **Gaurantee** You'll Love Dwarf fortress  Just give It a try ya' magnificent bastard.    I think the problem is that everyone is POTENTIALLY on the same skill level, but are less 'tryhard' than lewis, Nobody is really trying to beat lewis, as they know that it won't make an entertaining video if everyone gangs up.   So the real world equivalent of this is essentially America giving up in world war 2 and giving the entire continent to sweden.   Rythian seems to be one of the best players in the civ 5 series, but refuses to EVER stop turtling, for no apparent reason.   Yeah, I had a guy who did that decide we should only use agility heroes, because, in his own words, "I've never lossed with it before and if we get farm we're op." We lost, horribly.   So just before I was about to go to sleep, I had a moment of inspiration. Rythian should do a playthrough of IJI! Iji is a little known indie freeware game, and a sort-of combination of RPG and Metroidvania. I would quite like to not spoil any more than that, but It would be an excellent series for Rythian to do. It's short,(5-6 hours) has lot of surprises, excellent gameplay, and, more importantly, moral choices and an intriguing story! I really think he should check it out.   So is everyone going to be really rusty for the livestream episode?   Great! Thank you for the reply, it would be awesome to see a playthrough of SMT x fire emblem whenever that comes out.   OK, I will admit somebody has probably already asked for this in some capacity, but after watching him mention it in CIV I think it would be really cool to see Rythian play fire emblem, It would be a really cool follow up to X-com, wouldn't be flagged by nintendo (It's not on the list of games you're not allowed to make money from recording) and you could have even more Iron Man shenanigans than X-com. I gathered from Civ that You'd presumably finished awakening, but honestly you can play every fire emblem in a completely different way, and the series could last for ages with all the DLC's, particularly with all the entertaining and fun rommances and role play.  PS. I realize that this should have really been on the game suggestions thread, but I thought you wouldn't notice due to that thread being a month old.   Political affiliations are VERY poor between japan and those two countries due to various wars and nasty stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if Japan needs its own server due to racially motivated attacks from players in China and South Korea (although I'm sure it's not entirely one sided) It's not pretty, but reckon it may be the problem.   Tangos were significantly buffed.   There's nothing more satisfying from flaring someone on the top tower before the game even starts.   Well looks like it's another one of these: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4KJTS3bYIs    Beyond NEVER changes the story, The actions of being homeless are essentially slightly different alternative actions, The ryan choice I was talking about was how leaving the bar in a scene(completely arbitrarily) is the only way to keep the relationship open in the ending. Saving one person over the other in walking dead completely changed scenes and kept them alive for 1 and a half episodes to interact with other characters. In Beyond, you can't even die, and choices are ignored that even the most idiotic writer would think of, for example, the party scene has you choose some music, a action that doesn't matter and only wastes your time, BUT what if, for example, Jodie listened to that genre of music you choose all throughout the game; that's far more meaningful than almost every other 'choice' in the game.   Really? I watched VGA play it and Literally every choice was heavily signposted and didn't change the overall story at all, Walking dead brought up your choices all the time, whereas in beyond the only real significant choice I saw was whether you got with Ryan or not.   Barely any,because it sucked.   Yeah but You weren't separated by 20 kills with none of there towers down and 4 people.   I think the game whose name duncan was searching for was bionic commando.    Rythian,sips,sjin,zoey and nilesy on sipsco, duncan, lewis,simon,turps and strippin on giel guide corporation. Hannah can do commentary.   I wanna see some clockwerk, those cogs and flairs are a recipe for hilarity.    She could commentate instead if they really wanted a fair game.   I would like to see a ten man dota2 game, which would be easy to edit and lots of fun to watch.   Love Monster Hunter! Love to see it with other yogscast members.    It's incredible how youtube seems to know nothing about people who view Youtube videos other than cute cats.   I wish Ridge had helped sips and sjin. Derping around is fine, but when they spend so much time making a flashily designed spy car that they can't create so they have to give up without anyone else seeing it, It can be a bit tiresome.   Pretty dick move by Lewis to Fire him right after Simon let him join, Why did Simon send that E-mail then?   Why aren't they using the lighting mods anymore? Those sunsets and coral reefs seem perfect for them.    I'm glad lewis got reprimanded for attempting to get in the flying machine. Man was not meant to fly, dwarfs were.   Funnily enough, and this may be off-topic, but I've actually written a comic, and it should be coming to the webcomic space soon!   Especially as from a metagaming sense Stanley canonically has a wife.   The apartment ending is terrifying.

It only applies to videos **without** commentary. The garrys incident stuff was the devs being douchebags. Beside, nintendo doesn't take videos down, they're just allowed free advertising on them.   As Duncan stared at lewis from across the table, his eyes painted a portrait, a portrait of a man who led his country to war, with disastrous consequences. A man whose adamant refusal to focus on anything other than science led to widespread famine and drought. "Where did it go wrong?" He mutters to himself, as he takes a laser pen out of his scraggly beard to sign the peace treaty. He hadn't heard from queen sjinsabella of Spain in years, rumor has it she left to the new world with a device to live forever, he wishes he had invented that, but alas,ultimately all that science had led to was a cool pen. If only he had followed religion, apparently he defeated that treacherous Rythian of Crybabia in a mighty battle in a previous life, or so he claimed as the reason for his treachery.  " Are you going to sign it or what, Duncan" said Lewis indignantly, Duncan being little more than a cockroach, wasting his time in its death thoes. "I have a international games in Tesco to attend, y'know **your** city."Rythian began to laugh, a cold, crooked laugh. Duncan didn't say a word, he pressed the laser pen to paper, felt the weight of the dynamite against his chest, and put his thumb over the detonator concealed in the pen.  "TESCO REMEMBERS BIATCH"  Said Duncan as he jammed his hand onto the detonator. As he was engulfed in the ensuing explosion, he knew he had finally won.  In the end it was sips who took over the leaderless byzantine states, and led the world into a better tomorrow,but he knew making the world a fuckin' paradise was only down to Duncans sacrifice.   The co- optional podcast was flagged by a bot, and they're now allowed to profit from it and of course, you again ignore the fact that the co-optional podcast was the first time CROSS THE ENTIRETY OF POLARIS that nintendo's policy affected them.Entitled gamers like to think that the big,bad corporation is out to get them, but non commentary playthroughs of MK 7 not being profitable doesn't affect them at all.   From another board:Turns out this is not a unique thing. In fact, this is industry wide practice. Nintendo have simply finally decided to do what the rest of the industry already does. If you read the terms of Youtube's monetization service it says:   This is something that other publishers have already been following. This is the reason why networks like Machinima have licensing agreements with game companies in the first place. This is, at this point, standard industry practise, and I think it reflects poorly on every journalist who took this and tried to portray it as some unique attempt by Nintendo to shut down Lets Plays.  Removed the rest of my post, as at this point, it's irrelevant. Nintendo are simply doing what every other game company does. The only exceptions that I can see are Valve, Minecraft and FTL.  So to everyone huffing and saying how they're going to swear off Nintendo for this, I hope this is now going to extend to every other publisher or developer working in the industry.  Furthermore, the only games you can't make money from advertising are very recent games with no commentary, such as mario kart 7, games that weren't being picked up by LPers anyway. Of course, everyone misinterpreted it as THEY WON'T LET ME SHOW MA GAMES EHRMAGAD.   Yeah, because not being able to make advertising money from mario kart 7 totally affected the yogscast.   From the way they talk about it, all of them already know, and it would only take an hour or two off-screen.   also everyone's adamant refusal to play dwarf fortress.   The way none of them know much about videogame news and going on, but they all state the bits and pieces of hearsay as fact, like 'we can't record nintendos e3 booth or we'll be banned'   That was almost how sips won the last game. Shame they didn't realize the game wasn't over yet.   Will Rythians racial(more oil) ever come into play in this series?   	104
 I watched the movie after reading Emma's praise about the story.But i was really disappointed with the movie.A total disaster and waste of time.   Nah.Diesel is not a sword guy.He's all muscle.Looking forward to it.   Good film.Unique and excellent screenplay.Jake and Tony did a great job.  	3

 Lovin' the "TE-DDY!" Chants at TCF. Skol!   What each person thinks their spirit animal is. It's a light hearted way to learn about each other's personality.   I'm studying to be a PA as well. 6 months in, just passed Pharmacology. Great answer! Our faculty always scoffs at self diagnosis, but I had a buddy who saved his life by researching on line. I feel the patient knows their body better then I do, so it is definitely worth a listen.   Yup. 3 years, 4,000 comment karma, 2,000 link karma. Had to get rid of it because my username was not appropriate.  	4
 Hahahaha - there was talk of using Montgomery Clift or Farley Granger...  We just thought the "named after Alan Ladd" element was too good to pass up!    Thank you :)        	4
 Now I don't like this game.   I like this game.   Seahawks fans should just be happy it's 13-0, instead of 21-0 like it could be.   This is reminding me a lot of Niners-Saints 2011.    I never wash jeans.   If you work a blue-collar job where your jeans get dirty and beat-up, this is bad.  You really need to wash them to preserve the fabric, or it'll wear through pretty fast.  Holes in jeans might be trendy, but not if you need them to stay intact for work.   Well, fuck it, I wasn't going to be sober today anyways.   I just can't decide who to hate more.   The underwear one is goddamned blasphemy.  And yes, I am single.   A good reminder of just how much an armored division wasn't actually tanks.    An orchard near me lost several dozen bottles in a hurricane one year.  "Lost"      Supposedly $1.75 for 5 minutes work, but I can't actually submit the HIT - the "Submit" button doesn't work.  Given the nature of the work, it looks like they're just trying to generate click-throughs to ads.  Anyone else?  Here's the HIT:  https://www.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=3ZAK6NWIY2J4B1BCW8CLUDIC41Q9VM   I'm looking to cook up some packaged salmon (it was on sale - don't judge me!) into salmon cakes.    So, what can I use to hold it firmly into a patty shape instead of egg?  I'm not allergic, or anything, I'm just kind of tire of the taste and texture, and looking for an alternative.  Also - is buttermilk good for frying up salmon cakes?  I was just going to go with flour   breadcrumbs, but it's not chicken ... so I wasn't sure about using buttermilk to fully batter.                              I have a big plastic jar of a vaguely trail-mix type of stuff, including a lot of dried cranberries ... which I don't like.  But I really like both cranberry sauce, and especially cranberry mustard (pref. the Beaver brand).  So can I turn what I've got but don't like, into something I have and do like?  Because I have feeling it's not quite as simple as "mash them up and add them to mustard."            I was mixing a bunch of Type S mortar for brickwork, but got interrupted, and left it overnight with about three inches of water sitting on top of the mixed mortar in a bucket.  So it hasn't been exposed to air, and is still quite soft ... but has anything essentially changed in sitting wet for so long?  Is it still properly usable mortar?    Or should I just toss it out and start over, wasting nearly half a bag?   Like, say, creating a Duke of Maryland, or an Earl of New York.  Seems like it'd be the usual thing to do, but I can't recall hearing of it.  Land grants were handed out, but no titles to go with them - it would've especially made sense in the case of someone like William Penn, where you'd almost expect at least a Baronetcy to be granted.   Be it a scent, a fragment of song you catch in passing, whatever - it randomly occurs, and just takes you back.   I can't remember if it was a TV show or made-for-TV-movie, but in any case, it was about two brothers (IIRC) crossing the U.S. in a refurbished old biplane.  Fictional, not reality show - this would've been the very late '80s, with a somewhat patriotic theme.  For some reason I associate it with the 1976 Bicentennial, but watched it in the late '80s on broadcast TV.   If you were a kid in the '80s, you know what I'm talking.  Slightly grainy, muted-color nature documentaries narrated by a guy with a slightly backwoods accent, and a tendency to treat the animals like people.  You know, "Old fox here, he might've missed out on catching himself a rabbit today, but there's always tomorrow."         By my vague, addled understanding, the barrier to detecting particles is mass.  The higher the mass, the more energy you need to detect a particle.  So why was the up quark detected by the relatively low-energy SLAC in the '60s, but the Higgs took until less than two years ago to detect in the *much* higher energy LHC?   Because I haven't been able to come up with an answer via Google.  Which positions are associated with which "technique #s"?  I understand what each DL position *does*, it's just this specific terminology I don't know about.   Because I really, really doubt there's another school out there that goes by "Volcanoes."  Well, maybe in Hawaii.      I have an old 3rd generation iPod Shuffle.  I like to load up lectures onto it to listen to while I work - problem is, once a file hits the 30 minute mark, the iPod skips to the next track.    Is this a common thing?  Can anything be done about it?      Not in their own hand, of course ... but when it comes to people like Horace, Virgil, Tacitus, Cicero, etc., do we have any copies of their works that were published either in their own lifetime, or shortly after?    Because I've always wondered if we're just relying upon copies of copies of copies of copies, and so on.  Were the humanist scholars of the 14th Century just copying Carolingian documents?  Or did they have original material from Roman and Greek times?   I don't want menus, scroll-bars, or whatever.  I want a perfectly black screen with a cursor ... and *not a damned thing else*.    Does such a word-processing program exist?   And yes, I have Open Office, which still surrounds my so-called "full screen" with a bunch of toolbars and brightly lit margins.  I want a black screen that I can knock text into, like something Smith Corona made in 1993.   So I'm going to use some canned spinach in a quiche to up the vegetable quotient ... and while I usually like it, it has a very mushy "green" taste to it, if you know what I mean.  Is there something I can to do balance this out?  I was thinking spiciness to cut into the blandness - maybe some chopped jalapenos, and some Sriracha.  Other thoughts?               Especially on /r/nfl, I think.  Basically people saying things like "I was salty as fuck about that call."  Its reddit use doesn't really seem to match the UD definition.         Because I'll occasionally see it as a response, like:  doe?  I have the feeling it's a painfully obvious acronym, and I'm going to feel very stupid when it gets explained.         So ... have at it.         So, I installed the latest version of the Gamefly Downloader, as it's the only way I can re-download a game I had a while back.  Only ... I can't do a damned thing with it.  This: http://i.imgur.com/VLa0E5j.jpg is what it looks like.  Maximizing the window just leads to this: http://i.imgur.com/JLiTN1Q.jpg which is, of course, no better.  There's just no way to sign in.  I've disabled Adblock on my browsers, as recommended by their support FAQ, but still nothing.  If I can't fix this, does anyone know of an alternate way to download from GameFly?         Didn't see it in the initial options, so didn't set a reserve price.  I'm starting to regret it - can anything be done?   For some reason, I simply can't connect to moddb.com.  Any alternatives?  Also, is the broken single-player campaign fixed in later versions?  I have v. 3.3000, and am aware there's a newer version.   Looks like I'm going to have to add them to my hosts file, because my ISP's DNS is crap.  There are plenty of whois tools online, I know, but it seems to be kind of a crap shoot as to which are free and functional, and which you have to pay to get info from.   I bought a frozen cornish game hen sort of randomly, and now I'm wondering what to do with it.  All the recipes I've seen are very ... bland.    More importantly, I thought about stuffing it with wild rice before baking - is there anything else non-bready that I could add to the stuffing?  Not real big on cranberries, so what else could I go with?   "The Walking Dead" style zombies, not the "WWZ" nightmare-fuel zombies.   I'm talking scans or pictures, not transcribed.  So much of what we know seems to have come from letters and journals - are there any good archives of these?  Preferably in English, any other language and I'd just be seeing examples of handwriting.   The package of cheap, Costco-purchased, tailed raw shrimp from Vietnam says to thaw only by leaving for a while in the fridge, and specifically says to not force thaw under cold water.  It doesn't mention microwave thawing or going straight to frying from the freezer at all.  Any particular reason why not?      First - is it really a bad idea to use starter fluid in a two stroke engine, especially if the starter fluid has a cylinder lubricant?  Second - Is there such a thing as 10W-30 for diesel engines?  The cap on my Kubota says "10W30D," but I use Delo 15W40.      I tried making dolmas a few months ago, and while I enjoyed the filling ... the bitterness of the grape leaves was just too much.  Is there anything that can be done about it?   When I click on a thumbnail with a + sign, the images no longer expand to full size right there on the page.  I have to (*quelle horreur*!) actually click on the link to open an image in a new tab.  The + changes to a - without anything anything happening.  I've changed absolutely no settings between when this function still worked, and when it stopped working.  - RES Version: 4.3.0.4 - Browser: Firefox - Browser Version: 24 - Cookies Enabled: true - Platform: Windows       I know these used to exist, but I'll be damned if I can find one.  I'm basically looking for a program that will download all images on a site within a certain sub-address.  Not something for fuskering (I'm not looking to raid personal archives on Photobucket), but for sites that just have a lot of linked images, even some subreddits here - like, say, downloading a few months worth of pictures from /r/EarthPorn, without having to sit there and right click for hours.         I absolutely love what I've read of *A History of Western Civilization*, but I'm wondering if I should bother with the earlier volumes.  I'm concerned they may have been drastically outpaced by new scholarship, especially "Our Oriental Heritage," which was written in the '20s.  I'm not concerned by volumes like "The Age of Voltaire," which was not only written much later (the '60s), but about a more recent and better documented era.   Because "He looked to be about sixty, and maybe I was ten, my momma would whup me but I'd go see him again" is way up there.    So, what other ones?      I don't even have pictures of it.    Anyways, back in the mid-80s (young people can go ahead and just leave now), a local pizza place had a billboard-style game on one wall.  It was about 6' x 3', and was played with an IR remote.    There was a illustration of a hunter holding a shotgun standing in some reeds with a dog, and there were five cut-out positions for the shotgun.  They'd light up individually as you directed with the controller.  The ducks were also lit up sections of an otherwise black panel, and you'd have to have the gun aimed at the right angle to hit one.  Anyone else remember this?         So, I have a desk lamp made of wood and metal.  If it's off, I can touch any metal part and it will turn on. Another touch, it becomes brighter.  A third touch, it goes to its brightest.  A fourth touch ... it turns off.  There seem to be no moving parts.  So what, exactly, is going on here?  Are there moving parts inside of the (very small) wooden core, that switch around like those in a car's turn signal?   Please use them.  Seriously, you can't smell yourselves, but those of us that live in the towns you pass through *can*.               I have to constantly do factory resets to get it back up to full volume.  Is this a common problem?  I'll probably move on to the latest iPod Touch this summer, but for now this is really annoying.               Because for the "Greenville" quake, we're up to about 300, a decent number of them in the 3.0-4.9 range.  Is this normal?   Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale, here.  About to temporarily switch to water.  The rest of you?   Just had a moderately strong one here in northern Plumas County.  Everything just shook and rolled for about fifteen to twenty seconds, and I could actually hear the rumble.  Kind of neat, but slightly disturbing, given that an active volcano is less than twenty miles away (Lassen) - I thought it must be erupting.  Anyone got any info?  EDIT: A 5.7-5.9, according to the USGS.  Epicenter was about eight miles away.   Preferably in English.  I'm kind of curious as to how right they get things.  Also, may as well exclude Canadians.  I'm just wondering if there's like a Russian equivalent of Elizabeth George.                  Perhaps not strictly following the guidelines of "events prior to the past twenty years," but I feel it fits the spirit of the subreddit.  Namely - who do you, professional or amateur historians - consider the worst published writer of history who is fairly well known?  Thus excluding revisionist cranks or other fools.  First nomination: Norman Davies.                                   	112
 Gave you an upvote purely for your username.    Pennywise the clown in the drain at the start of IT. Tim Curry, stick with Frank N Furter please.    There was a case of a conjoined twin assaulting someone in a barroom brawl. It was decided that he couldn't do any time because that would impinge his twin's freedom. And "it is better to let a guilty man walk free than imprison an innocent one. Here is Stephen Fry on the subject.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNgMncOqlA8#t=1005   Mine totally is if I haven't gotten laid in a few weeks.    A woman having sex with a lot of men is a bad thing. You wanna get laid, I wanna get laid, and hey maybe next week someone we both know wants to get laid. We're all grown ups here. Just don't lie or cheat.    First 'grown up' game I ever played was Borderlands 2. It ruined me for all other games.    Anything by Tim Minchin.   My Doc Martens. They would be the coolest, most comfortable guy ever. And big.   "I could care less" That means you DO care. Idiots.   Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. http://hpmor.com/ Because science is awesome and HP is awesomer.   Caipirinha. Boom.   Not a teacher, buuuuut... I flirted with a teacher I had a crush on all through school, convinced we had chemistry.  Ran into him about 2 years after I graduated and ended up taking him home.  I fucking knew it.    I lost my virginity to a millionaire ninja named Dr Clever in a castle in Ireland owned by Eric Claptin.    Oh I should specify that this approach is for "cold call" type situations where you don't have a lot of time. E.g. The cute girl/guy on the bus. Obviously if you lock eyes in a bar or something have a chat to see if you actually get along.    The best pick up line is: "Hello, I think you are really pretty. Here is my number. If you would like to call me sometime I'd like to hear from you." Then walk away. Make sure the number is written down, don't try to get them to put it in their phone. This way she doesn't have to reject you if she's not interested and she can call or message you at her leisureif she is. It's forward and polite without being creepy.   	15
 Yeah I'll have to check that out   I'll have to find some to try   I have them all downloaded on my laptop. I watch the Christmas one every year   Idk I've noticed a paradigm shift in which the top comments are always "the nice things" to say   IPA's are my favorite type. Elysian is my fav brewery so really anything by them.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is always a good go to though   Pretty much any Stone is a good time   I love that episode so much. Makes me want to give Hermes a hug   I've submitted a few now and gotten a couple interviews. It feels a lot better once you get an invite but now I'm all anxious about the actual interview   Grab the pitchforks!   It's lines from a very famous song   I eat my skittle's out of a bowl with a spoon   Why this deserves to be in /r/pics:  Good action shot complete with blurr lines  Ornate wood floors and stairs  Segue to discuss dog social behavior  Or ya know, put it on facebook   Is there any real point to having a dildo that's 2 feet long?   I know budgets can be tight but you'd think between now and 1970 they'd upgrade the phone and calculator   Lately I've come to realize that beer is actually the only thing that has kept me sane in college   I see OP is taking full advantage of the new Nudity rules   Are a combo of Bloodflood pt. 1 and Fitzpleasure? I just listened to it for the first time and thought that was awesome   Owen libary is my favorite. 6th floor has a great view and usually empty, and the downstairs has the best computers.  Basement of Holland Terrell is also great. or if you like some distraction the first floor of  the CUB is pretty nice   This may sound weird but how old are you? I really can't tell      You should have that little dog to the right blow up in some Michael Bay esque way   Dammit now I don't know what to believe. How do I know lions even exist??   People complain about that? That's like most of Jim's job at the office   It's the cheerleader effect   "Oh my gawwwd"   I think there's another Pink Floyd song where at the beginning you can hear the Beatles playing, and it's because they were in the same recording studio.    /r/thatpeelingfeeling   Well the lack of anything substantial in this picture would suggest /r/pics, and the content would suggest /r/mildlyinfuriating, but since this is so incredibly not funny it's gotta be /r/funny   Wow yeah you know my life so well from one exaggerated post I made earlier   Not sure where you live but most places internships/volunteer opportunities are scarce  I guess Im in the minority here. I need to volunteer at pharmacies and theres only like 2 with dozens of other people goin for it as well   At least 3 nights a week my roomates and I bust these 2 games out and play for hours   I know right? Like whats next cigarettes?   I believe this is "standing up". People who stand up don't actually stand all the way up   I would partake in the meet up   I love the season's tree one.   Your smothering me!   Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike    I always think that too but of course you can wear jeans with other outfits and what not so it's not like $200 for one day's clothing. The perspective is still scary though   And Mr. 99999946121081009472 said math never did anything for anyone..   Going to college in the middle of nowhere has its benefits   I like the original one posted the best. It has the best "huge" quality too it, my eyes had to scroll up to realize what all I was seeing   Apparently the Torpedo is more than just an extra IPA   Anyone interested in chatting on kik? Message me your username. I like science, running, video games, tv shows like Seinfeld, stuff like that.   Elysian pumpkin beer though. So good   Super soakers were the best back in the day. My neighbor had a full arsenal   Thanks, now I can study for anatomy here at home!   I will judge the swim wear contest. Maybe the talent part too but I'm pretty busy   It also wasn't 2014   /r/funny has really outdone itself today with reposts. This is 4th top rated thing today   This is how I take all my shots now   He could not get out of there fast enough   Are all those bones named? Are there any lizard anatomists on reddit?   I'll take 5 standard packages   /r/shit  I'm just assuming...   Glad someone spoke up here. I don't really enjoy dubstep but Skrillex has a good sound and was always fun to dance to   My cat is actually pretty good at capturing flies but he can't seem to kill them   What has everyone been listening to this week?   I personally have been listening to Woodkid I think his tracks are awesome and has a great voice.   Why would there be a doorbell on a chemical plant to begin with?   That has been my thought. That was a huge parking lot. Not only that but it is right in front of Scott coman, like they can't even walk outside now type thing      Mustache man in the back wants it   "I traded it in for  a microphone"  "Yeah I can see that"   I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs!   Not just landfills but the middle of the Pacific Ocean   I'm rewatching the show and I just finished Season 7. Over the seasons I think he is one of the most diverse characters  and although it doesn't always make sense I love that he switches persona's each season especially after he gets back from corporate.   Don't tell Ayn Rand   That's awesome! Now if only the buses were even a little bit on time            I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts?                     www.speedtest.net   Assume very hot   What would cause every stock to simultaneously "crash"?                  I got a tent last summer and haven't been able to use it and don't have a car. I'm wondering if there's any secret spots in Pullman that you could set up a tent for the night without anyone noticing. Anyone know of spots?         Could be school work, yard work, boat building anything                        Learn anything new?         These things can't even breath without being loud      I know we have spy satellites and what not up there so why can't we just track the plane with one?      If a post is bad then it will not get to the top. If something is funny and hasn't been posted then why not post it?      I'll always go to beer personally, too much good flavor            What was facebook like when it was limited to college students?  	110
 If he's gaming, he won't see the 30$ difference in the 6000 series.  It performs about 3% better in games than the 4300.  Also,  in response to not witty, the gtx 760 is nearly equivalent to a gtx 670. Your CPU is probably bottle necking your 760 slightly, but it's nothing that would be noticeable and I wouldn't go buy a new CPU over it.   Pcpartpicker.com is probably the site.  My general rule is: CPU: if your using a gtx 760 or above go intel (4670k or 4770k are great CPUs)  If you go with a budget CPU anything up to a 660ti, go with the amd phnom ii x4 965 be or fx 4000 series.  Gpu:  if you are going to do 3 1080p monitors or go with one 1440p monitors, go with 2 gtx 760s in sli. If you are using one 1080p monitor, something from amd should suffice.  The gtx 760 has the best price/performance ratio at the moment and you can sli 3 of them. They also have a very high frame buffer so you won't notice microstuttering much. 2 gtx 760's in sli perform better than a gtx Titan for 500$ less.  Storage: Samsung 840 pro series for ssd.  Western digital caviar black for hdd.  I personally go for raid 0 hard drives over one ssd, so I have storage (2tb vs 128gb-256gb) and some speed to go along with it.   Monitors: yamakasi cat leap. Find it on eBay, best value for a 120hz monitor.  If you need more help, go to the forums on pcpartpicker and go to partlistopinions wanted. I'm a regular on that sub forum and a lot of other people would be glad to help you :)!

 ....um, racrenlew I see what you mean now after looking back up at what I wrote but I didn't write that. I didn't write a lot of the things that are showing up in my post. I tried to write [11:4-9] which I felt really uncomfortable even trying to write once.   Wait, what bible verse? I didn't write a single thing related to the bible at all.      I think it's funny that movies always have a part where somebody says don't go looking for trouble or you won't like what you find when someone starts digging for info. It's funny because nobody does that in the real world so finding something out is almost always super easy. People love to gossip, right? It fills the gaps in boring work conversations and makes daily life seem way more interesting. You all do it, don't even deny it.  The problem is when everybody that's sharing the same gossip has a minor detail that's different in their version. Like who the fuck was your source? Why would anybody change the story? It's usually never a very interesting detail anyway.  That's not the issue here though. This time not one of the answers was even the same. So let me start from the beginning.  About a year ago, I moved into a really fucking sweet apartment on the outskirts of **[74686520636f6e667573696f6e206f6620746f6e67756573]**. I'm sure you all know that the rent here is cheaper the farther out you go. (if you don't, there's a little pro-tip for you, free of charge) The buildings usually look like they should be out of your price range too, but they're not. I got extra lucky at my place with a corner loft on the top floor with a vaulted ceiling that stretches really high so the whole thing is super spacious and comfy. Or it would be comfy if it weren't for the construction behind the apartment. It started about 3 months after I moved in and hasn't really stopped since. It seems like all hours of the day I hear stupid trucks beepin and boopin all over the place, hauling things from one end of the construction site to the other. The sound of the steel girders clanking in to each other is the worst part though. That awful boom of metal against metal. It became so consistent that I couldn't resist the urge to find out how much longer it was gonna take.  So last Monday I get to the office I work at and start asking around about this building that's going up. I started with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** in the cubicle across from me. Oh yeah, it's going to be a hospital. Then I asked **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** three cubicles away. My brother and I were just talking about that yesterday. He's positive it's going to be a plastic manufacturing company but I heard it was going to be another Microsoft building. he said. I finished off my rounds with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** on 5th that says it's going to be a law firm and the secretary on the main floor that heard on the news it was some up and coming web marketing agency. It was strange but I figured somebody was bound to say the same thing as someone else eventually and then maybe I'd have my answer.  I went over to my friend's place after work to play smash bros and we invited over a few more people to even the odds since he was way better than me (thank you internet for keeping me anonymous because I would never say that to his face). Once **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** and **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** got there, I started up again about the building. I was sure **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** knew because he was an editor for the local paper but even he told me that nobody he worked with could get a solid fact down. More than that, none of the journalists could even get ahold of anyone to ask about it's progress.  Flash forward to today; it all got so much weirder and became the major reason why I'm writing this in the first place. I didn't notice it until just a couple of days ago but they've started removing the steel girders and have instead started building up the main elevator shaft in the center of it all. Here's a picture I took yesterday: [tower photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/4yb0WxY.jpg)  You can see by the tilt of the rope in that photo that the girder is swinging away from the building. I'm not making this shit up! They're removing everything they worked on for the last year and have switched to working on the elevator only, like some kind of giant tower.  I was confused and a little freaked out when I realized what was happening so after taking the picture I went over there to ask questions but everyone spoke really broken English and every time I stopped someone they just yelled and kept walking. It made sense, I probably wasn't supposed to be walking around inside the gated area anyway. It was getting late and I was getting nowhere, but just as I was giving up and started heading back to my apartment, I noticed a single lone sign off to the left of the entrance that read **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]**. Now that I'd thought about it, this was the only sign in the entire construction site. There weren't even any labels on any tools or work trailers. The porta-potties didn't even have labels! Seriously, like every company gets their porta-potties from the same place so that didn't even seem possible. After looking more closely at the sign I noticed **[11:4-9]** was scribbled in red marker all across the bottom. I knew nobody affiliated with this construction could've wrote the bottom part because it was too rude (even for construction workers) to be on public display and actually made me a little uncomfortable to be standing so close to something so graphic. I left quickly after that.  Now I had a name but I needed to know more, I decided to go back that night after midnight. Here's a picture closer up from when I got there: [tower photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/y4FajHi.jpg)  I walked along the side of the wire fence until I came to the truck gate. I thought I'd have to hop it but it swung open with the slightest push. This was unreal, it shouldn't be this easy to get inside something like this at night. I kept going until I came to a decline in the dirt leading into a basement entrance to the building. Here's are some pictures of the basement entrance area: [tower photo 3](http://i.imgur.com/6favdIT.jpg)  [tower photo 4](http://i.imgur.com/JtZxYB0.jpg)  As you can see, there was a single light on in the back. I stopped abruptly when I noticed it but there shouldn't have been anybody at the construction site this late so I assumed somebody had just forgotten to turn the light off. I slowly started up again on my way down the path when suddenly I heard a box fall deep inside the building with an echo that I swear to god couldn't have been as big as it was. It sounded like it came out of a football stadium. No, that's not even big enough. It was like it bounced off the side of a mountain or deep within a canyon except it was inside! It sent a chill down my spine that forced me to turn back and just as I did, out of the corner of my eye I'm fucking sure I saw a huge beastly face that looked just like **[546865206f6e65207468617420736c656570732062656c6f77 ]** barely illuminated by the light of the room just behind it. From what I could tell in that instant, it was completely motionless. Just watching from afar.  I screamed and sprinted all the way from the basement entrance back to the front door of my apartment. I knew what I really saw had to be the silhouette of what was likely just boxes fueled by adrenaline and that effect being alone in the dark late at night has on you. I started to feel a little better from working that part out. Then just as easily as I got my pulse to slow it sped right back up as I remembered that something had to make that box fall and if it was a person, I'm sure they would've seen me and called after me to get off the property, right? So what the hell was it? What the hell is this building? I couldn't go to the police because they'd know I shouldn't have been there in the first place. I don't want to, but I need to go back tomorrow. I need to know who's building **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** and why.  Somebody please look back at the pictures and tell me if you see the thing I described in the darkness. I doubt you can see anything because the photos are so dark but I'm too freaked out right now to verify anything myself. I plan to bring my laptop and a better camera with me tomorrow so hopefully I can update right on the spot.   -update- I just added the events of part two [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/2ebuq5/palms_tower_part_2/)   I think it's funny that movies always have a part where somebody says don't go looking for trouble or you won't like what you find when someone starts digging for info. It's funny because nobody does that in the real world so finding something out is almost always super easy. People love to gossip, right? It fills the gaps in boring work conversations and makes daily life seem way more interesting. You all do it, don't even deny it.  The problem is when everybody that's sharing the same gossip has a minor detail that's different in their version. Like who the fuck was your source? Why would anybody change the story? It's usually never a very interesting detail anyway.  That's not the issue here though. This time not one of the answers was even the same. So let me start from the beginning.  About a year ago, I moved into a really fucking sweet apartment on the outskirts of **[74686520636f6e667573696f6e206f6620746f6e67756573]**. I'm sure you all know that the rent here is cheaper the farther out you go. (if you don't, there's a little pro-tip for you, free of charge) The buildings usually look like they should be out of your price range too, but they're not. I got extra lucky at my place with a corner loft on the top floor with a vaulted ceiling that stretches really high so the whole thing is super spacious and comfy. Or it would be comfy if it weren't for the construction behind the apartment. It started about 3 months after I moved in and hasn't really stopped since.

    http://np.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/17cyql/are_all_exmuslims_on_here_atheists_or_did_any_of/         Their confused little brains don't know how to argue with his fundie logic.  So many lols.  http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/16kmfj/a_pollbecause_im_curious/   I've read on some other credit card review websites that Capital one and some others do this.  When they pulled their personal credit some months later, their business credit card showed up, even though they were incorporated.      http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/14mcj0/does_islam_allow_men_to_beat_there_wives_detailed/c7eembj         What's the cream they keep rubbing on themselves before training?   A lot of them have trouble traveling due to visa issues or whatever.  So, could it be possible to have a fighter that simply does not fight in the US?  With as many international shows as the company puts on, many countries have much more relaxed visa programs than the United States, so it would allow a fighter to build up a resume against top quality opponents on international cards.  Why couldn't Glover fight in London, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Canada, or Japan (and of course, Brazil) in the last two years under a UFC contract while his U.S. status was being sorted out?   Holy fucking shit.  What a god damn disgrace.  Unfortunately, Dana sees nothing but potential ratings with alpha douche nozzles like him, so we'll keep getting these assholes in TUF and in the UFC.      Two sites I've noticed are Pinemeadows.com, and Gigagolf.com  -Both websites claim that their clubs can play as well as the big name brands for a fraction of the cost.  Any thoughts?  Are they legit?  Or will these clubs fall apart after three holes?   I would like to use my savings as collateral (roughly $25k), since I have no fixed assets.  I think that's called a cash-secured loan, right?  My question is, are the big banks the only option, or are there websites out there that can help me shop around for good rates?   I would like to input my league info, and have the analyzer recommend free agents and trades and what not.  I currently use Ziguana, but they are kind of confusing sometimes, and I was wondering if there is anything better.      Jered Weaver and Josh Hamilton.  Weaver is 30, and Hamilton is 32.  Which one can sustain their dominance longer?  Edit:  Thanks for all the advice.  I was gonna trade away Weaver for Hamilton and some prospects, but I feel reassured in my decision not to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I haven't been contacted by mods or anything like that.  Just some political correct and oversensitive "just a few bad apples" religion defending types.  I do this to highlight the backwards culture that I was raised in.  As an exmuslim who's lived in Muslim countries, I have more experience with Islamic brutality and injustice towards women than most.  If political correctness demands that we never say anything negative about Islam, then I will stop posting here.                 More interesting are the mental gymnastics being played by the more liberal muslims, trying pull "no true scottsman" arguments out of their asses left and right.  http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/wnzqz/apostasy_laws_in_islam/                                                                                                                        Iran is a shia country which claims to follow Shariah law.  But whenever they enact a new law, or carry out a severe punishment of an existing law under the guise of Sharia, most muslims will say "They are shia, so it doesn't count, etc..."  My question is this:  Is Shia sharia so severely differnt than sunni shariah?  Most of the differences in the two sects are historical and are based on theories of succession after the death of the prophet.  So how does this make their laws any different?  When they execute adulterers/whatever, is it not the same sharia law followed and understood by sunnis?  I understand that there are some serious differences in beliefs.  But the laws carried out by Iranian authorities rarely reflect those differences; rather they are laws which are held by both sunnis and shias.  If I am wrong, please correct me            I see videos of these guys posted here quite often, and have been wondering why?  Why these guys above other scholars?  Is it because they are young, and have a better time communicating with the youth?  Because, honestly, their message doesn't seem too different from what the older scholars say.  TLDR:  Just wanted to know why you guys are fans of these guys.   EDIT:  That title should say "What is it..."  sorry, typo.   A lot of people here don't subscribe to /r/atheism because it is a cespool of memes and facebook screenshots.  But there is also a lot of substance there.  Most of the good discussions involve Christianity because that is what most western atheists are familiar with.  There are a lot of good links to videos and articles in this subreddit that don't get the attention they deserve because there are just too few of us.  We want /r/atheism to join our cause, but we don't want to get meme'd to death.    So why not cross post all the good articles and videos from here to that sub?  Are there rules against this?    Basically, should I be working out?  My understanding of juice fasting is that we are severely restricting our calorie intake and relying on the nutritional content of the vegetables we ingest to sustain us.  If we start working out, will we just eat through our muscle, since we aren't putting any protein in our bodies?         Meaning, is there some kind of device, like an XM satellite radio receiver, but for internet radio instead?   It's called Les Mills Pump.  I know this is the P90X sub, but I see Insanity discussed here a lot, and didn't know who else would be knowledgeable enough to give insights.  My question is, for weight loss, is this as good as p90x?  The reason I ask is because I am very intimidated by p90x, and I believe that I must do another, less intense bootcamp before attempting p90x.  Especially because of the cardio and pull ups.  This Les Mills Pump workout seems to be all weigh lifting, all the time.  I know the guys at r/fitness would probably like it because they pretty much rail against cardio whenever they can, so I came to ask you guys.      It used to be that in order to be best-of'd, someone would be providing some great insight into an unknown subject matter for a curious redditor, or some great act of kindness that went unnoticed.   Now, it just seems like every pun thread, or even slightly funny joke gets posted here, as if the OPs want credit for finding some hidden secret of reddit that no one else on the entire internet has seen.  But I guess such is the say of reddit.  After seeing the downfall of Insanity Wolf, r/WTF, and r/trees, we shouldn't expect anything less.   Gegard Mousasi and King Mo come to mind.  I remember a few years ago people were talking about a Mousasi-Machida superfight.  Would that kind of fight be beneficial to both guys?  What about King Mo?  Being a former Strikeforce champion has to earn some cred in the UFC, right?   Even though every article states that this stopped in 2008.      Especially with modern electric and ultrasonic brushes that seemingly do as much as dentist tools, it would seem that toothpaste is nothing more than polish.  Do we actually need toothpaste?   I'm kind of getting sick and tired of all these 70's and 80's movies clogging up every god damn genre.  	163
 Ok well the common answer is free will...  Ok I'm not gid (surprise!) So that is a great question since he would be right there unless of course the answer is free will.   Okaay...   Ha, ha I can imagine what that would be like :)   Ok. I'll pretend to be god...  Because if everything was perfect then no one would be human. Our experiences make us so and we must get into heaven, if everyone was perfect no one would be human.   Ok it's a bit rude but too each his own.      I'm not God (obviously... stop starring at me, I mean it!) I'm sure you will :)   Oh and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in the navy and good luck at med school :)   Well since I was young I've wanted to be a doctor but I've also always loved history and just recently I've been inspired and I want to persue that or medicine.   Aaw that's nice. I like that more than anything I've seen so far. Just the reassurance :)   Sad, the cancer not your question.   Maybe, why don't you try and see, you never know...   Ha, ha good luck at med school (that's what I plan on doing, well either that or archaeology. It's always been medicine but now I'm questioning that).   Okaay...   Interesting :)   Okay I'll pretend to be god in two scenarios and answer with what you'd say:  1. You go to heaven, if you're good and hell if you're bad, in heaven you can get what ever you want whenever you want. See dead relative's and friends and live in eternal peace.  2. You do essentially just rot but you still have an overwhelming feeling of peace.   What do you do?   Ha, ha sorry about that :D   Yup, I mean it would be nice but I guess that's just the way it is we could try and change it, people have but I don't think people can go without having conflict.   Ha, ha I can guarentee if you ask that to God you'll have sex with God :D unless he said maybe.   7, 4, 17, 32, 34, 27   Just joking I know what you meant :)   ?? (Sex talk time :) )   Ha, ha inney?   That would be nice but I doubt that we will ever see it happen.   Aaah, well lets just say he is tired and wants you to simply ask him :)   Ha, ha what would *you* do?   Well with every answer comes more questions so it'd be nice to know so we can search for more answers.   I think he'd say something like "me"... I think   I wonder what he'd say   Lets just say you won a raffle and he wants you to ask him :)   Ha, ha, simple :s   Ha, ha! :D   I'd like to know that too :)   Ha, ha "still under development"   Ha, ha :)   Why? Nice, I guess it would be cool to hear the answer :)   I would love to know that too :D   Lots of people could *probably* answer that but God would answer it better, obviously :)   Cool question?   Wow guys! You have all asked some really awesome stuff! Keep 'em coming and I will talk to you guys and maybe answer (even though I'm not God, I mean it stop starring... I'm not!) :D   I see what you mean. Well I guess others would feel, shocked?   Also I just did a quick google search and tons of results came up from last week to last year to 2012, this has been posted a million times.   Okay but it **was** on the front page just the other day.   Don't get me wrong I love science, I'm acing biology and chemistry and I don't force my beliefs on anyone but I do have a religion: I'm catholic.   Actually they did it made the front page not too long ago.   Well religious people (like myself) would have reinforced beliefs and others would feel stupid for not believing. I think it would  be simmilar and maybe stop all the stupid internet arguments.   Man bear pig, South park! :D   This is a repost!    No I love dogs and everything to do with them :)   Good luck! Here's what I do:  I answer most questions with yes or no. Am I going to get my work done now instead of procrastinating? Yes. Am I going to fap? No. Am I...? Yes/no.  I'm also doing it to have a better outlook on life and change my views about certain things and for religious reasons. Good luck! :D   http://www.yourbrainonporn.com   You numb your dopamine receptors and it makes sex with real people less pleasureable and fun things in general but only with excessive masturbating. You **CAN** become dependent. It can lower self esteem and make you lazier (and more but this doesn't happen to everyone, like me I chose to stop for personal and religious reasons).   Slugs! (Or snails)   South park! :D   Cause it's easier to sing like that and sounds nice but many still sing in their home accents.   Hey good luck and meditation helps a lot! :) Oh by the way I think you should reset your badge.  Anyway don't think of this as bad it's actually great now you can learn from it. :)   Hi, I'm 15 so I obviously haven't had sex yet and I don't want to... well not yet, not for at least another 3-5 years and I would only do it with a girl I really care about. Anyway I want to know if there's anyway to get rid of sexual frustration? Since some of you have sex you don't need to worry about it but what kind of things could I do. (Oh and side note, don't know if it's important, I was never addicted to pmo but I wanted to stop anyway for a few reasons).      So I'm fifteen years old, I tried nofap a while back for a few reasons. Religion (I'm catholic), for myself, I wanted a better out look on things and to change my view. PMO made me feel like women all fake orgasms and that they're whores (if they're in porn) I shouldn't have judged them.   I made it to four days last time and decided I would fap, I've never been addicted to it, because I said if I balance it, it's healthy and I don't need porn I can use my mind. All was going well but then I thought ok one porno isn't so bad so I watched some cartoon porn, I was watching it around 3 times a week then I went back to real porn. That's when I said no! No more. I'm gonna do nofap and I'm going to do it right this time. Tomorrow I go from a smiley face to a number 1. It isn't much but it's a big step for me. I've thought, over the last week, you're still early in just do it once, no big deal but straight away I said no. It'll be nice then but what about after? So I always said no and focused on something else.   I read a post that said always say yes or no for things you're unsure about. Not maybe, not if this happens then, just yes or no. And so far no has been great here and yes has been great in other parts of my life. I know it's early and I have no huge results yet but I can do this and so can you. Good luck.   Thanks guys all of you seem to think it's fun with a friend, I'll pick it up :)   Hi I'm Devlin, I'm 15 years old and I'm from Scotland. AMA!  ***Short Bio***   I live in a city called Glasgow and I'm going through high school. I play a lot of xbox and I love to read, be it books, comic-books or short stories. My favourite genre is Science-Fiction but I'm open to read any genre. I love to write and I spend a lot of time studying.   ***Update***   thanks for all of the questions guys/girls! Keep asking and I'll keep answering. I think I should answer this since a lot of you have asked if I like haggis. I've never tried it, I know that's strange but I do love other scottish foods and drinks like lorne sausage, shortbread, tablet, porridge (with milk and sugar) and of course irn bru (I'm drinking some now). :)  Oh and if any of you want any proof just ask and I can link my facebook :)            **EDIT** It now shows me the percentage, it's been around half an hour and it's only at 3 % help!   Well I started nofap as an experiment, of sorts. Now I never went long like some of you have and that's fine with me. This is because    I was never addicted to porn   and    I learned what I wanted from this.  What did I learn? That nofap is not for me, however, I'm not just going to go and watch a ton of porn but what I am going to do is moderate what I'm doing. I used to fap at least once-twice a day, I would occasionally miss one but I digress. Anyway now I'm going to only do it once-twice a week and maybe miss it every now and then. I think this is perfectly healthy, I won't be consumed by fapping,I'll have more time to spend on other things and I don't have to fight urges like I did these past few days.   I do owe thanks to nofap because now I know what I want to do. Thank you all.  Who knows, I might want to try nofap again someday bt for now goodbye and thanks :)   **EDIT 1** Thanks every one for answering, don't worry I won't be expecting the stuff from porn in real life and I probably won't even use it but if fapping starts to have any kind of negative on me I will stop and come back here also I will only be doing it once, maybe twice, a week.   Hi, I'm relatively new here and I haven't relapsed since I started, actually it's been pretty easy. Now, however, all day I've been getting urges. I've been able to put them to bed but now it's just... It's getting to difficult. Even when I get rid of one boner another one isn't far away, and it's not like I'm thinking about or watching porn. I don't want to start again,I know if I make it through the first week I can keep going and I know I'll be disappointed if I fail, HELP!   Okay so I want to make it to ninety days and see where it goes from there. I heard the early parts are the hardest, no pun intended, and these first few days have been easy. I've kept my mind busy and when I've thought about fapping I just say no, I don't want to and I focus on something else but today I've had more boners than any other and I thought to myself it's fine because I'm only a few days in but I forced myself not to.  Do any of you have any tips on how I can stop urges when they arise?      I was playing games when I was 3 and first completed a game, gta vice city, when I was 4. I completed the  story in a few days and got 100% within a week or two. Then I went back and did all of the previous gtas before continuing on to tomb raider and halo etc      I know it's a bit unrealistic but anything can be done. I've been reading up on some tips. Do any of you have any that might help?         I just started here and went to add a badge, I thought you mailed them your birthday so I, apparently, haven't fapped since '99 :D      Hey, so I recently started meditating and I asked someone (who had been doing it for nine years) if I was doing it right and when I explained what it was like they said that it sounded like I got pretty close to jhana. He then said that that usually takes years for people to achieve. So I did some light reading on it but I don't fully understand it can someone who knows what it is or has experienced it explain it to me please.  **here is what I did the first time**  http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2ssn39/am_i_meditating_properly/   Hi. I recently started meditating which is making me feel great and I've known about lucid dreaming for a long time. I hear the best way to have them is to train yourself by you know doing something like trying to put your finger through the palm of your hand or holding your nose and still breathing but I've never been able to stick with them. You know getting into the routine of doing them naturally.  I have a few questions...  * is this right? Training yourself?  * if I do do this how long, roughly, should it take before I can lucid dream  * I hear before you can lucid dream you get sleep paralysis and must go straight back to sleep. Is this true?  * does the sleep paralysis happen to everyone?  Answering any of these is greatly appreciated. Thanks.   Hi everyone. First off I don't and never have smoked pot but my older brother does. To be honest I can't stand the smell of it and I'm against drugs in general even ones that don't do harm like pot.   Anyway you all probably know that in school you're told   "People do drugs to get high... drugs are bad"  But in my school they tend to make a point of it being a personal decision. So they explain it in detail that I know some places in the world don't but of course the teacher hasn't done the drug so...  While I don't smoke it I'm interested to see the appeal of it to those that do. How often do you smoke? Why? When did you first do it?  **EDIT 1** thank you all for your answers so far, keep em' comming. I'm still against smoking it myself but I have found it interesting to see why others do it.  **EDIT 2** Thanks for all the answers guys/gals. I have a different oppinion on weed now. I still don't and won't smoke it, I'm still against drugs in general, but I'm not going to lie I was pretty judgy to those that do now I see that there are a ton of reasons people smoke and I respect that.   Hi, I am very new to meditation, seriously I just started today.   So my first try only lasted a few minutes. I stretched before hand breathed a bit then sat down with my legs crossed. I had my back straight and simply focused on breathing in and out. I imagined a flower opening and shutting with my breath. Then I started 'feeling' (not touching but actually feeling) my body. I started with my toes and move  onto my feet and heels. Then I worked up my legs and into my torso untill I could feel my stomach. After this I started focussing on my breathing again. Then I pictured myself in a beautiful and lush green forrest. I heard birds, smelled flowers and saw a deer. It was beautiful but I only saw it for a few seconds or so.   Finally I stopped. I felt incredible, so relaxed. To be honest I only did it llike half an hour ago and I still feel great. My stomach feels 'funny' I don't know how to describe it. My hands also feel funny but for them it feels like I'm shivering even though I'm not cold.   I'm just wondering if this is a good start? I'm definitely intrigued and I'm going to do it again the morning but I'm worried about the possability of an out of body experience. I've heard people can have horrible visions and some feel connected to their hody through a thin chord. To be honest I feel fine about the visions but the obe scares me.   Is it possible to have one through meditation? If so is there anyway to prevent it? Finally am I doing it properly?  **EDIT 1** is it weird for me to feel this happy?   So I have a friend on the internet (through xbox) who recently lost a friend to cancer. He said his brother was a Buddhist monk and taught him how to meditate. He seemed to be dealing with his friends death pretty well although he was obviously saddened.  Anyway I've heard him speak of meditation a few times now. I've done it once before but I was like half asleep and never knew what I was doing.   I was intrigued so I read up on some basic mediation. I stretched. Felt my body parts. Breathed calmly. I took my self to a forrest in my mind and just relaxed. It only lasted for a few minutes if that but it was really nice feeling and I'm catholic, I've been told meditation is good for religion which I'll definitely have to look into but this looks promising for me.   I loved 'psycho' so I was worried that they made this. Season 3 starts soon and I read some reviews which say it's very good. I was worried that it might ruin psycho for me. Anyway is it worth watching?      Hi, I'm from Scotland, UK and like I said above I'm fifteen. Go ahead ask me anything!         When I play my xbox it will randomly freeze in game or on the dashboard.  This is happening alot! Seriously it just keeps happening, I've tried doing a power cycle but still it keeps happening, any suggestions?      I watch a lot of US tv shows and movies but what do they miss out that would be weird compared to the way I live?      It seems like we hear a lot about cancer nowadays but why did we not hear about it in say in medieval times or quite as much in the fifties etc? Was it due to fear or just that it has been mutating more in recent years?  EDIT: Thank you everyone for your answers you've all been a big help :)   Edit: thank you everyone for your great answers! :D      I've been seriously considering teaching as a career. I love kids and I would love to be able to imoact them and make school fun while still teaching them what they need to know.  I'm from Scotland, UK so the education system might be different where you're from but I have a few questions...  1. Is it rewarding? I like to think it would be but I don't want to go into it and be disappointed  2. What don't you like about it?  3. What is your favourite thing about it?  Also I want to either teach at a primary school age (elementary) or as a history teacher in a high school.     Please don't get angry at me for asking and if this question offends anyone I'm sorry. Im catholic so I don't understand why you wouldn't want your prophet shown, please explain it.   He was looking at pictures of women in thongs were spiderman was walking behind them and he said:  "Yeah, I have a whole subreddit for superhero thong shots"  Other people wouldn't have got that joke. After the episode aired I checked and someone had already made a new subreddit for superhero thong shots...  /r/superherothongshots      Okay so I'm from Scotland and I'm in high school. In two weeks time I have prelims, they are essentially practice exams but they're still important cause, well I won't get into it but failing them is bad.  Anyway I'm a pretty smart guy and I never really fail tests but when it comes to exams my mind kind of blocks. I really don't want to fail.  Also I play way to much xbox, I know this but when I have to choose between studying and xbox 7/8 times out of 10 I'll go with xbox even though I know it's the wrong choice.  Anyway I need to know how I can force myself to study and not sit on xbox/reddit.  P.s please don't tell me to pull out my xbox plug I've tried that.    Ok before you answer please don't say that we wear kilts, we only wear them at formal occasions and only some of us do it, they're normally only worn at weddings and funerals.   Hey everyone, I'm a HUGE xbox fan. I've had the original and 360 since their launches. I was going to get the xbox one on launch day but decided to wait a year because that's when the games I wanted came out. Anyway I know about the ability to video gameplay and upload it to skydrive and youtube but is it easy to use?   Can you... add in music? ... make and intro?  Also can you tell me any cool features that you can use with it?         Okay so I'm 15 and I've wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. My twin brother has cerebal pulsey (I think that's how you spell it) and slight autism. He can walk and talk and do everything everyone else can do to some degree but when we were young he was in the hospital for an operation and I knew after that, that I wanted to be a doctor.  Anyway I've been well on track. You know highest grades in all my classes and getting great reports but I don't think I'm up to it. I've always been a gamer, seriously I got the original xbox when I was 5 and before that I had the ps2 anyway I've always been able to balance school and gaming but now I find myself on my xbox and writing fanfictions more than anything.   My grades have started slipping and I know if I stopped gaming I could probably get them back but I don't want to stop completely. Also I have pretty severe asthma so I miss quite alot of school during the winter when it gets bad which makes catching up hard aswell.  I still want to be a doctor but even if I put in the work I don't think I could make it so I would rather focus on something else and pass rather than try for years and fail.  I love writing and I love history. I've considered becoming a history teacher but I don't know if I would enjoy teaching the same stuff over and over again for years. So I thought about becoming a writer but I'm not sure if I would like to write a book or work for a company or anything else. I've started stressing because I don't know what my future will hold and to be honest I'm scared I'm going to mess up and get a crappy job.  Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do? I want to do something that makes me happy but I don't know what that is yet.                  Hi everyone, I have an account with everything on it but my sister doesn't. She has only just started playing and I was wondering if anyone could help her out. She doesn't use reddit and she asked me how I got my stuff when I said through reddit she asked if I could get her some. If you can please comment or message me.          Ok so I need one that can, as the title says, run both the Sims 3   4, my budget is 400, please leave a link to one that I can buy that I don't need to build (if it's a desktop). I know it's alot to ask but if anyone could help it would be much appreciated, I can  also add delivery charges if I need to.   Hey everyone, so I've always been more of a console gamer, only using my laptop for the Sims when gaming on it. Anyway it broke and I need a new one that has the system requirements for me to play both the Sims 3   4 with expansions for 3. Please help. Leave a link to one that I can buy but I only have 400.                 	119

Snapchat doesn't make any money  Instagram BARELY makes any money...  I can go on and on...but how many of these social apps and e-businesses/websites truly are interested in making money?   From what it seems to me, many of these firms are looking for buy-outs from bigger firms...not actual inventions that change people's lives and improve social experiences or fix problems.   A lot of the instant fame and accolades from the creativity of the app world may start out with a legit interest in creating something fun and enjoyable, but when it comes to making money, so few of these items seem to be able to truly turn any legitimate profit outside of the endless pit of buyouts and acquisitions.    It stuns me that theres not one available for the iPhone...and I'd much rather have my phone than an extra piece of hardware.  Plus, if I needed it for a test or secure location, i'd know it.                                                                   *sigh...*   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WUYN1wtyv4                                                             http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Scorched_Earth  www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/world/middleeast/09yemen.html?_r=0  Sounds to me like one of the richest nations on earth really didn't handle it as well as they claim to have.

 Thanks for the answer. One of my goals is to bring the price down for more casual players too, and make it easy to transport.    I certainly will, it will be worth 40% of my grade for that course. Apparently, we would be outsourcing the designs to producers, so if I could be able to make several boards, I would love to give you one for free! But I just started designing it, so don't expect it any time soon.   Wow, thanks so much for the detailed post!  2) I will post pictures of the designs and specifically tag you to hear your advice.  3) Aluminium just seemed an interesting material to use for white pieces, but I will certainly think of all materials available for me.  4) I hope I will not make them finicky.  5) Yes, I will certainly make them weighted.  6) I will try to add magnets, but will not make it a priority.  7) I didn't think of that, but I will still strive to do it, but I think its not a necessary.  Thanks so much to the post. Another question, how much are you willing to pay for a chess board?   Yep. I was thinking of also a way to make the puzzle pieces to click on the other side of the board to keep it together.   Thanks so much! That certainly looks nice! I will try to use the puzzle design, as well as making the board look like the "perfect one".   Four pawns on one tile? Isn't that a bit too much? Looking at chess boards I own, it seems to much. Is there any reason for your advice?   Thanks :)   Will do! One more thing, what is the price range you are willing to pay the most for a chess board? Thanks so much mate! Do you mind if I will be using some of your answers in my project? Just quotations. User tag could be optional. I dont think examiners will care to much.    That is exactly what I was thinking. But it would still be visible, making it less appealing. Trying to think of a way to make it better.   That is what I am striving to do!   Wow! Looks incredible! I wish everyone in this subreddit could have one. I could answer this question myself, but im interested in what your thoughts are: what makes this board so amazing?   Will certainly try!   Thanks! Since I am just a beginner, sadly I dont think I will be able to pursue pieces that look beautiful like the first two links. I will try to make wild designs, and will try to make sure they are not terrible. As for all the other links you posted, I will try to do all the suggestions you posted!   Wow! Interesting design. Is it practical when playing?   Silly me, I thought I read weightLESS pieces. I was also puzzled by the idea of having light pieces. But this makes sense. I am sure your idea is much more favorable.  However, I was curious about what you think the design of the pieces would be. Is there any style you prefer? For example, do you prefer medieval looking pieces, or maybe more modern?   1) What the hell did I just see! Do people actually play on that!?  2) Its true, those colourful boards are plainly a pain. However, why do you want Stauton peices? I was thinking of making newer, more elegant and simple designs (but certainly not abstract pieces where you could not tell the difference between a rook and a bishop).  3) Thanks so much for the advice! You are the real mvp! I can use any material really, and wood certainly is the easiest option, but I really wanted to experiment with "new" materials, such as aluminium? I was not thinking of glass as I imagine it could be easily broken when travelling (saphirre or gorilla glass may be too expensive).  4) Will do! In your opinion, do you think I should?  5) Sounds interesting and aesthetic, but how would that help?  Thank you so much for the detailed post! I didn't expect such a great answer!    I agree, those small magnetic boards are impossible to play with! That is why one of my main goals is to make a chess board that would take the least space possible while not used, but explained/unfolded to be easily playable. Why would you want the pieces to be wooden? What do you think of other materials?  And finally, what do you mean by mountable from 4 pieces?  Thank you for the post, and good luck in games!   Can you please explain why you would want to see that? Do you want the pieces to be hollow or made out a light material? What materials would you prefer? Thanks for the answer :)   PS. Sorry for the strange title, my retard friend submitted the post before I finished writing it.   Hey r/chess! For a school project, I decided to design and produce a chess board (for those who know, Design   Technology course in the International Baccalaureate). I really love chess, and therefore I really want to do a chess board that will be amazing. Do you have any suggestions? Has there every been some aspects you wished you could improve? What materials do you prefer? Designs? Feel free to tell me if there is anything you would want!      Is it really that bad? I can imagine every country over states what it did (been in both UK and Russian systems, which does point to that). I wish education about WW2 could be less biased towards the home country. I also wonder how the German lessons are about WW2.   I fully agree, and what the US did was certainly amazing and important. However, it seems to me that you are stating that what the USSR (and to a certain extent the UK) did was insignificant compared to what the US did.   Why? Just interested.   Hey r/euro! I hope this subreddit is alive, I hope this post will kickstart a discussion! What do you think about the ECB interest rate? Do you think it will change, why, why not? Will it be affected by the QE? Feel free to share your thoughts!   Thats a lot of support to the US, but what about the USSR (and to a certain extent the UK)?  	25
 In all honesty, being in love. I know it sounds cheesy and rather ridiculous, but its true. As a kid, I never grew up around lasting relationships and didnt experience dating until after my first year of college. So, for the most part, I had a bad start. Luckily that changed nearly 2 years ago. I still cant believe what Ive gained and cant imagine anything greater!    I can just imagine it thinking: 'Don't hate me for being short and fluffy!'     Not to mention immature and illiterate. ^ Future teen mom.    We should start a wager on how long it remains open or at least brings in a lot of business. I recall when one opened in Wichita - a month or two later, no one cared.   No hating against Krispy Kreme (and their fried dough of deliciousness), but do realize it's part of the fastfood fad.     See now, this makes us all look bad. Though I typically never admit to living/being from 'that state'.  Also, it snowed in southern Kansas and around the Wichita metropolitan area. I only know that b/c people won't shut up about it on Facebook. Ermahgerd it's snowing - in February - in Kansas!    I know you're heard this time and again, but you're only 21. I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 25. Take time and don't rush into anything.    Even if I were to find new coverage, my current diagnosis still wouldn't be covered:  http://www.khiastatepool.com/KHIA-FED/eligibility_requirements.htm  How does that work? Plus why a -6 month- time-frame? I've never understood this....    Are you trolling or are you really completely unaware of Obama attempting to fix everything you just said?  No, but you clearly are.    EXACTLY! Anyone can apply for insurance or get insurance, but those with pre-existing conditions are forced to suffer - and - be denied coverage that could help save their life.    Too bad I live in a state that doesn't offer government funded programs.   Coverage in KS: http://www.statecoverage.org/coverage/kansas  Coverage in CA: http://www.statecoverage.org/coverage/california (CA since it offers MSI)  There's a clear difference on how you're covered, based on the state, and premiums received.   I recall coming across something last month that showed which states receive government funds and which did not - I know KS was on the non-funded list. (Or I have this backward - I'm searching for the site to validate this comment.)   That's my current situation, plus thousands of dollars worth of medical bills that weren't covered.    I keep hearing too many sides to the story and I can't figure out which is true.  By living in KANSAS, of all states, receiving input on the benefits of ObamaCare are slim to none. I've tried to make sense of it all, but until something is put in place, we really have no idea what to expect.  I should also add that I'm 99.99999999999% against most politicians (and take neither side). What comes out of their mouth and what's written on paper (and mandated in to law), are two different things. I'm afraid whatever Congress has hidden up their sleeve might actually have a detrimental affect on society.  That's also a year away and I'm thousands of dollars in debt for something I can't afford to fix - yet it has a huge impact on my ability to function 'normally', and to hold a job.    I understand this post may come as a duh for some redditors out there, but I have something Ive wanted to get off my chest for the past few days.  A couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with a medical condition. Low and behold, it was the underlying cause for every medical problem I have had since I was in high school (12 years). Theses consisted of blackout headaches, sudden vertigo (that would last for weeks), uncontrollable irritability, and the list goes on.   Now I am left to wonder, how can insurance companies deny me for pre-existing conditions when none were, in fact, the correct diagnosis. I applied for insurance within the past year, after losing what was  provided by the university (as a student), and found myself in quite a struggle because they continuously denied me coverage. Oddly enough, one was a company I had previously received coverage under before turning 18 (parents insurance).   Now I am left, unable to find reliable insurance because I was misdiagnosed for most of my life.   Am I the only one out there who feels this is in need of change? If you're denied insurance for reasons that weren't in fact true, how is that working in favor for both the companies and those needing coverage?    Oh it was! I just find it astonishing, given all the research provided, that people still do this. Then again, I have smoked, drank, etc. Now that I'm a few years older, I no longer do either (for the most part) b/c I realized how detrimental it was on my overall health (and well-being).   Sadly we live in a society (UK, US, etc) that promotes activities that aren't necessarily good for your health. Do realize though, back in the 1940s, smoking was considered cool and was featured 'as the thing to do' in most movies and other cinema. 70+ years later and we (given the scientific proof) know that people weren't as informed as they should have been. Perhaps this is a sign that we need to further inform younger generations of the true hazards this may cause to their health.    It's still a classic! If you ask any child of the 80s whether or not they liked 'Men in Tights' (and of course 'Space Balls) - expect a clear YES! We might have a bad taste in films (to some extent) but they're often better than most Hollywood flicks, today.    There's a reason we've been told (for how many years now?) to avoid high levels of UV light (aka tanning beds). Of course UV light becomes a problem, when out in the sun, but you stand a greater chance the closer you venture towards the equator OR if you spend a day at the lake and forget to reapply sunscreen.   Ended up turning bright red (in Playa del Carmen) b/c I was too focused on having fun with the open bar, beach side view and relaxing pool. Didn't realize I was burnt until someone (coincidentally from the same part/state of the US) pointed it out. That trip dramatically turned south. I'm forbidden from using tanning beds by my doctors (increased chance of skin cancer), so when something like that happens, I do my best to never do it again.   Honestly do not understand peoples fascination with tanning beds. I know someone who's 3 years younger but looks over 10 years older because her skin is permantely damaged and looks leathery - how is that appealing? I understand the warmth is nice, but is it worth it in the long run?   I honestly don't care anymore. Just found it odd you used brown when you have blonde hair. That would be the same as if I drew on blonde brows, even though I have dark brown hair.   Things people post on reddit typically make no sense and I try to sort through and make sense of everything.   I tried making a point, but all the posts managed to do was take down my karma - clearly not worth it anymore.    I meant to post this, but since I was posting via my phone, I couldn't find the link. Here's the link to NIH:  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000371.htm   It depends on the individual. I hate relying on sites like this, but it provides a lot of info on different types of thyroid disorders. If you think you might have one, be sure to contact an endocrinologist:  http://www.m.webmd.com/women/guide/understanding-thyroid-problems-basics   Do you experience any other problems with dryness - dry skin (aside from hands), dry hair, etc?  I have the same problem and found out it was caused by a thyroid disorder.    I grew up in the 'middle-of-fing-nowhere KS' so I did the same. After a microburst blew through here a few years back, the thought of doing so (again) scares the cr@p out of me!   I know the sound of silence, that accompanies these sort of storms and yeah, I'll pass on purposely seeing one/ hearing one again. (No hating against storm-spotters, amazed at what they do)   Events like this make me lose complete hope in humanity.    If you live in the NE and still can't figure out snow - there's clearly something wrong.    It would be equivalent to people in the Midwest, standing outside and watching a tornado.     I called her office several times over the past few weeks to get my appointment - scheduled for April 1st - move to this coming Friday. She will not provide any information until I get more tests run. Clearly that doesn't help me b/c I'm struggling now....  Hints, again, why I asked people here.    Thanks for the obvious, but since I can't see my doctor for nearly a week - decided to ask reddit.      I use to do yoga until the vertigo started. Never thought about just doing a weight version. Thanks for the tip!    I'll look in to the B12. My Endocrinologist insists I do not start any supplements until my next appointment, but I'll see what I can do.    I've had an endless battle with vertigo since 2008 - that ended may daily runs and exercise schedule. Any sudden movement will result with abrupt dizziness  I only drink purified water - looking in to getting a better system since the water here isn't too great. Also, I do not drink alcohol and maintain a vegetarian diet.    Clearly, being literate isn't a prime focus in these areas.....      I maxed out on laziness with this one. Great to see someone made it even better!!! Thanks for sharing!    Pardon my typo: 'Drizzled' Honey     Oh it is! There's no denying that! :-)   Lol thanks. More like ma'am and it was a collaborated effort with the bf! :-)   This post reminded me that I wrote a paper (in 2010) about 1940s propaganda cartoons, focusing prominently on Theodor Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss. Cant believe I forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder! :-)   Just imagine how it would look if you switched the creams :-X. Then again, I'd probably still eat it or at least try to (without laughing).    There comes a time when being immature is socially acceptable - this would be it.    There comes a time when hoarding isn't such a bad thing. This would be a clear example.   Whenever I travel, I always buy a shot glass or two. Unfortunately I dropped a box after my last move and lost a few. Sad times, but they can easily be replaced.     I buy locally grown, organic produce. My boyfriend is in the process of looking in to what would be required in becoming self-sufficient, but we'll probably need to hold out on doing so until we move to a bigger place. So are we doing everything we can to lower the chances of receiving bad foods - perhaps not, but we're doing what we can to get by.  Plus we never eat out, so that makes a tremendous difference.   People assume we eat salads. The closest I've come to a salad is a thai spring roll. Maintaining a vegetarian (not vegan) lifestyle really isn't that bad, plus it does wonders on your health. Several cultures even rely on vegetarian based diets, so they must be doing something right.  Oh and I still eat dairy and eggs, plus the occassional bacon.       people have got to work this out for themselves  They live a way of life where incidents like this are 'culturally acceptable'. By knowing that, there's little we can do and if people within the area try to speak up - we know very well what would happen to them. We've seen it on the news recently.   Citizens are denied to right to speak up against such things and sadly, we can only wish for it to stop.    I agree with that too, but we can't always go in and just stop what they're doing. Same would go for what we do here (US) or wherever you happen to live.   World peace and cultural understanding for all would be a triumphant achievement for man-kind, but it doesn't seem likely to occur anytime soon.    I see a dog shaped dust rag, that happens to be lovable, and can still get the work done!  Have to admit, it still looks adorable!    The US should look in to implementing such a program. Before graduating high school (2005), I was never offered a course concerning finances. Even after taking college accounting and finance courses, I'm still lost on what it entails.   But then again, that's why we pay so much this time of year to have someone else do our taxes. Right?   Being a vegetarian doesn't seem too bad of a choice when you see this in the news. Not to mention, you never buy prepackaged (especially frozen) food.    Sam Brownback and every politician from Missouri would be proud!     This is truly unfortunate, but it is another culture, and there's very little we can do.    Too many comments to scroll through, but if my math stands correct (please tell me if it doesn't and be sure to explain why) this won't be possible for quite some time - and exists quite a distance from Earth.   1 light year = 5,878,499,810,000 miles   13 light years x 5,878,499,810,000 miles = 76,420,497,530,000 miles  It will be several thousand years before humans are even capable of reaching such depths of space.       lol I've tried to do just that, but once I've read the book, I always look for dissimilarities. After taking a class focused on acknowledging this in sports literature, it's hard to stop.    Just found it ironic they changed it that much. I loved the book but lost interest in the film for reasons such as that.   In the tunnel scene:  Book: 'Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac  Film: "Heroes" by David Bowie   By omitting 'Landslide' and instead using 'Heroes' the meaning to the scene changed completely - at least in an emotional sense.       Taste and texture need to match. This is just too weird for me.    May I ask what that is?   I know this through experience. I suffered a TBI after being hit by a car around the age of 3 (1989). For rehabilitation purposes, my mom was told to buy me a cat. By maintaining a form of companionship with every cat I've had since then, I view it as a learning experience. Especially in learning how to care for another living creature. I understand caring for a cat and caring for a human are completely different things, but it still requires an understanding that's essential for children and adults, alike.   Also, after the accident I stopped playing with toys. That was due in part to the injury and a 'shift' in my cognitive and neuropsychological abilities - but further emphasizes the companionship maintained with the fury feline friends.    HA! I thought the same! (But a little on the heavy side)   Thanks for the video! I'll be sure to check it out. I recall the guy appearing on Tosh.O or one of those shows.....   Serious mother issues.   **Clear sign for future generations:** *to avoid incidents such as this, truly know and understand your child. It could have a tremendous impact on what they do/become later in life. Even to this extent.*   People have strange obsessions that never make sense. This is a clear sign of that.  Then again, there could be a psychological reason as to why he has a fascination with Miley Cyrus. Also, at what age (for both) did he gain this fascination? Just thinking that increased just how creepy this is.....     I reformatted the post to make it easier to read and to highlight key points. If anyone has a question/comment, please do not hesitate to post. It would provide insight as to whether 1) people noticed this too, 2) if the reddit community finds this interesting, and 3) if it is even relevant.

My comment was more of a reply to the bolded text.    Well that trip just ended.    It's still interesting to know. Discovering something out of curiosity isn't a bad thing.    I appreciate your posting of this, but the 2nd to last paragraph clearly makes the article pointless to read. It states:  Despite the efforts of the humble earthworm, the vast majority of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - which is responsible for 60% of the total warming from greenhouse gases - is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. ---------------- But earthworms only account for about 16% of greenhouse gases. How's that a concern? Worms have existed for millennia, but we (humans) haven't.  I understand their intention, but it doesn't seem to account for much. Especially when compared to human interventions.    These are known problems when taking birth control and just about every other prescription drug. I stopped taking them due to their constant (and unpleasant) side-effects. Even with an IUD, I still experience problems.  The only downside is the fact some of us take the pill/ use an IUD because we have to for hormonal reasons, not because we're sexually active. In my case, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. May not sound too bad, but I'm only in my mid-20s.    For being 'wrong' a lot of people sure did like the post. Maybe you should accept others opinions and not react by telling me my opinion is false or 'made up".  Given the fact I haven't used Reddit for too long, I clearly need to figure more things out. At least I'm willing to do that before accusing people of providing 'false opinions'.    I know. I posted about it last week (4 days ago) - but trolls took over the post so I stopped. I have a passion for music and couldn't let this one go.  'The Imposter' http://www.reddit.com/r/Critics/comments/17lvgo/the_imposter_hailed_as_one_of_the_standout_films/   And that sir/ma'am is why I am here, sharing the documentary with this forum. It's clearly a compelling documentary but I wanted to highlight what made it just that. Clearly few of you agree with me, which is fine, but as I've stated time and again - I found a different underlying meaning based on my own understandings and experiences.    Of course it is one of the best documentaries of 2012 but it (the documentary) is popular for what it's showing the world - biases towards music (due to racism, mental health, people being @ssholes, etc.) in the 1970s NOT racism today. He's famous today because individuals took the time to understand his story and share it with world.   Without the collaboration of the two individuals, the likelihood of you knowing of Rodriguez would be slim to none. He would still remain a legend - unknown to us - but popular in South Africa. Hell, everyone thought he was dead for decades until someone took the time to check and with that curiosity, came this documentary. Now you are left with this post trying to emphasize certain key aspects of the documentary and how it has/could shape what we know today.   A lot of time was spent focusing on racial discrimination - not just the record label being a complete @ss. The fact you are continuously refuting my opinion holds no value to me whatsoever and I will remain with the same opinion - whether it's right or wrong. Isn't that the basis for such forums? To express your opinion on a given topic/subject no matter how others react?    I prefer this version, too bad it's not a full-length film - Seven PsychoCATS Trailer HD:  http://youtu.be/gS0P3vU5D_A   D@mn you beat me to it! I thought the same thing! Quite a strange assignment.....   I just hope such a documentary could help reshape fame in our society. You might ask, why not do it yourself? It's easier said than done and I'm worried no one would even care. It could forever impact what we know and can learn through music but, as you stated, we're living in too dumb of a society to understand such things.     You are correct. It is something truly worth watching.    Your comment brought to light the idea that we (as a society) need to reshape what we view as good. In today's world, it doesn't matter whether or not you have talent. Your luck of rising to fame has to do with looks, sex appeal, etc.   Rodriguez wrote about the life he lived, but in a manner not accepted by 70s US culture. Shows like American Idol fully emphasize sex appeal and the like, over actual talent. I feel Rodriguez tried to push the boundaries at an earlier stage but we were too ignorant, of a society, to accept this.   I will agree too on the lack of of musical talent for Bob Dylan, but that only further emphasizes my point. Or at least I think it does. I could be wrong.    Then the music industry is to blame? What made Santana any better? They both 'rose to fame' during the same time, but only one received recognition.   He did everything in his power to sell music, but only 6 ALBUMS were sold in the US. The music was out there, but no one knew of it. Highly doubt that's a coincidence.   PLUS: People would scratch out his top hit - 'Sugar Man'. Why on earth would people do that unless they wanted to keep him from becoming famous?   In order to gain attention, you must first attract people. He wasn't put in the proper position to do that and since race became an issue, that only pushed him further back. If you check, Santana and Jose Feliciano, both gained fame around this same time (late-60s and early-70s) Also, neither one was a US born citizen. Both were from other countries that possibly helped promote their fame. Since Rodriguez did not have an acceptable contract nor willingness from others, he was left in the dumps. Rather sad his music held no purpose where it was produced - US - but a bootleg version - in South Africa - brought him the fame he never thought he'd reach.   I disagree on quality. I find his songs to hold a lyrical value and his voice only adds to it. One more thing - Bob Dylan rose to fame during the same time - 1960s-1970s. Rodriguez had the unfortunate circumstance of sounding a lot like Dylan, through the sound of his music. Perhaps this held a negative impact on his career.   I absolutely adore his ability to refrain from accepting the fame - be it for mental, drug or whatever issues - that really doesn't matter. He did not let the fame get to his head and take away what he wanted from life. I would like to see musicians of today refrain from the fame and fortunes of their career - but it's not likely.    ***I have a different way of understanding what happened. Perhaps my approach is different than yours, and others, but I like to gain a clearer understanding as to why he never became famous in the US. I take what I know and go from there.   Bob Dylan of Detroit, Michigan - Elvis Presley of South Africa.   Depends on the location. Either way he never gained popularity in the US (until now) due to his race. Use of the name Rodriguez during the 1970s made listeners refrain from listening b/c they expected him to be 'non-white. Quite an unfortunate story. It's even more remarkable the type of life he maintained (and still maintains) no matter the fame or fortune.   True understanding of life and the pursuit of happiness.   Didn't take it in to consideration when creating the account. Might redo and add hearts or smiley faces to indicate I'm not a guy. Not sure what else to do. I will admit it's quite an amusement since I'm a petite female being referred to as 'sir'.    More like ma'am, but you are welcome!    Thank your for taking that in to consideration. The problem with forums like this, is the fact you're stuck dealing with trolls.    Congrats on understanding the concept of an exaggeration (and/or a foolish statement)! You would be surprised how often it is used to gain appeal from others. Ironically, I had no intentions of this. More so, I stated my overall view of the film. Why, might you ask, did I state (in full-context): 'The story that unfolds is nothing you could have every imagined'?  I have always found the human mind/ human experience (non-religious) to be an amazing thing. When you look right down to it, we still do not understand the true impact of the human mind. Over the next few years I hope to gain a greater understanding of this (through neuropsychology) and I felt The Imposter was an appropriate start   It really depends on what you are looking for in a film. As a documentary I understood there would be limitations as to what could be shared but, overall, they portrayed the situation rather well. At the start of the documentary, did you expect the story to turn out as it did? I highly doubt this.   I know several of you hated the move (1/10, etc.) but something about the film clearly struck other viewers. Why else did it receive such renowned support at the Sundance Film Festive and several other awards and nominations?    Welcome! :-)   Thank You for posting this!!! I have been debating this very thing for quite some time. Even though I do not have moral support from most I know, this is something I have always found fascinating and can't wait to explore! :-)  I have ideas concerning music that I can't wait to understand in greater detail. Going about this won't be easy, but I hope to do my best!    Mastering the Art of French Cooking - By: Julia Child        K can be seen as the function of 2K for each grouping of cheeseballs taken at a time until only 1 remains. I would grab 2 cheeseballs each time to show the following concept: (start) 13-2(1)=11....13-2(2)=9.....13-2(5)=3...13-2(6)= 1 (final).   Does that help?        You could say the same thing about marijuana but it: 1) has never killed anyone; 2) won't cause or hasn't shown to cause as debilitating long term affects, and 3) several products used today or ideas still waiting to be discovered....were thought up while under the influence!

It wouldn't be necessary for them to give legal rights to someone else, but to instead clarify that a percentage of their work(s) went to help the needy.    It's not like she needed another hamburger. How much did she weigh in the 90s? I'm guessing far above what's deemed healthy. If people continually rely on 'celebrities' to make their decisions, we've clearly lost all hope for humanity.    Heart touching, it is, but getting laid clearly wasn't an option. Just saying...   People fail to realize the Harry Potter series was written for -teenagers-. Congrats on understanding the basic concepts of English, now read a REAL book!    In Kansas - they'd likely ban you from doing this. Anything deemed 'offensive' is well, off limits.    The male version of a dollhouse o_O   I have thought the same for a few years now. Only problem would be getting other(s) (i.e. US schools) to adopt the 'new' idea.    Did this follow an announcement of cutting health insurance? Jokes on those who went for one....   By pointing this out, everyone probably lost a point.    Hey now, I thought it was amusing. What more can you expect from a purebred Persian.....?

 Vonnegut is gute.   I love the dance.    Harry Potter. Movies came out well lined up to actual grade levels.   I read the first one... that's as far as my criticism goes.   I liked it because it mirrored some events in my life in a way I had never seen written before. Its long as shit though.   Why?      I read 2/3 of World War Z when I stopped. It was a fun book, but at the time I was not really reading much so I told myself "Good book, glad I read it." and then i acted like i read the whole thing.   Interested in which other of his novels you will read, I myself just finished "Mother Night" and it was the most different of his works. I recommend you read his second best book Cats Cradle (after Sirens of Titan)    Started my first Hemingway novel this morning, "The Sun Also Rises". I find it amazing how similar life in 1920's Europe can be to life in modern America. Good book so far.   It would be great if I never end up getting very sick, but sadly I most likely  will one day. If I somehow end up reaching a very old age and I cam still stand then I guess I'll read the Dark Tower   I don't think anyone considers the PoA film to be bad, its actually one of the better directed ones.    I had read order of the phoenix about two weeks within its release and I loved it. School librarian actually set it aside for me. Then when HBP eventually came out, I got spoiled :/ the big spoiler.  didn't read it until years later about a couple months after the fifth film came out. Completely rekindled my love in the series and I read deathly hallows immediately after. I read it again, and I think its my favorite, either 6,5, or 3.    chamber of secrets was always my least favorite.     I have the first four "Gunslinger" Stephen King novels waiting on my bookstand just in case I ever break my leg or get stuck in bed for a long while, I actually don't plan on reading them on my spare time. They are just those just in case books. So what book or series are you saving for the just in case?   I just finished "The Road" tonight at 1 am after starting at about 9pm and taking a thirty something minute break at the hundred page milestone. So about 3.5 hours for a 287 page novel. Book was amazing btw, I've had my copy for at least five years and I've attempted starting it twice, getting only to the thirtieth page or so, so I challenged myself tonight to just read the fucking book. Really glad I did, book has entered my top ten.    Me too. Libertarianism is an ideology I just don't understand. Civilization is something that time itself has proven to be necessarily governed.    I've read very little Sci fi in my life, barely Sci fi actually, just Kurt Vonnegut's work and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, as you can see I'm more into the light stuff, but I would like branching out. I don't want something too far fetched and I don't want anything military.  any SciFi novels out there that are serious in tone but do not revolve around a military, or a space soldier?   ----" The Stranger" Spoilers-----   I realized that enough time has passed since 10th grade and that I needed to re-read "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Since I've been reading some Vonnegut lately, I was kind of shocked by how cold Meaursault is in The Stranger, I had been getting accustomed to lively characters, and hilarious narraration so the change of pace took some getting used to.    "The Stranger" is a very short book, only 120 pages long, so I read it all in one sitting. Interestingly as I read it I kept jumping back in my mind to when I was still in 10th grade, sitting in that class as we discussed in our own little mini trial whether the murder was premeditated or if Mersault had any possible defense.    I don't reread novels, I feel as if once is good enough, but I'm starting to realize I was wrong. Maybe rereading a book is in a way being in two places of time at once, the first time, and then the now. Or maybe I've just been reading too much Vonnegut and I'm starting to not see time as linear.   They're both dead   This is now a thing I'll do for the rest of my life. You just saved my life.    Lone Survivor is a recent smaller budget film by him that is good.    Wish I read this about 3 years ago.   It was a really large closet, biggest I ever seen.    Not exactly a robbery, more like a breaking and entering. It was a just sold home in my ex girlfriends neighborhood, and it was pretty easy to get in. We go in and look around the house, have sex in the closet, no furniture yet, and then she finds a panini maker inside the kitchen cupboard. We decide to take it. Then I raid the fridge and find four coronas, and we proceed to sit there by ourselves in a strangers new home and drink their beer all sweaty post sex. Months later she breaks up with me. We never told our friends about our little breaking and entering. Sucks that one of my favorite life memories was with someone I never want to see again.   She kept the panini maker.     Are you out there typing up code in multiple languages, or do you seldom even use a computer at the workplace?   Quentin Tarantino  David Fincher  Ben Affleck   Paul Thomas Anderson  Zach Snyder   Movie made me scream. Needs to be higher on the list. It's a Sam Mendes film correct?   You two should become friends   I bought the 20 anniversary edition last week. Haven't stopped listening.    I always accept fliers. It's so fuckin simple. Grab flyer. Walk ten feet. Read flyer. Throw flyer away.    Auditorium is my shit   I'm assuming from the thread title and all the other answers in here, that season 2 will be up on St Patricks day    Why you gotta say spic tho   Cartman. Fuck that fat kid.    And fuck anybody that emulates his mannerisms.    I remember I listened to OBFCL2 first before any other Wu Tang solo project. I immediately got the first one right after this.    This is why Aquemini is my favorite Outkast album   I have a Vapor Shark and I love it. Store is constantly packed too. Any specific criticisms you hear about VS?   oh god   spitting on your onion rings   Its just "Say Goodbye to Hollywood". But, that's my favorite of his.   This movie is just sad. Was trying to watch all the of director's films, Sam Mendes, and I ended up watching this one.   What the fuck.  This isn't entertainment, this is isn't escapism. Only reason to watch this film is to make myself feel a little better of my own life.   I'm sad and I fear marriage now.    Phone wallet keys.    It's the ritual everytime I leave my house.    Is there a name for the phenomena of people forgetting how to drive? Sometimes traffic just stops.    Related: having to troubleshoot computer issues. I have broken a printer Office Space style before out of rage. Fuck computers   They're the worst.    Me, having plans fall through.   If I'm looking forward to something all day, and it gets cancelled my whole day feels like a waste. I could've planned for something else.       Why do y'all douches always look so happy?    Is there a difference? I thought they usually meant the same thing   Hey man, if by douchiest car you mean something better than my year 2000 car...   Some people out there have to be at least mildly aware of their douchiness   Douchebags always seem like they're having a good time, so this is a question to all douchebags willing to admit it: What's awesome shit that happens to you because you're a douchebag?   Toxicity is an amazing album. Have you listened to it?   God that's gonna be a great game isn't it.    Safe House was pretty succesful film. Made $140 million domesticly. One of his largest films.    I love that album. My uncle had gifted me the bootleg when i was like 13.  Motivation is still my pump up song.   Buy something with it. Come on, you can afford it. Do something cool with the cash    I know, I do awesome things and Im broke. But I'm curious to see what a person with lots of funds does for fun.       Great book, first King novel I've ever read.

    Never been able to decide between Vancouver and Toronto. I've visited both from the UK and they seem great.    It's not that bad. I mean it's expensive but if you're sharing you'll find somewhere you can afford. Some things in London are really expensive - mainly rent, transport and drinking - but there's so much to do for free. Most museums are free, all the theatres do cheap tickets, there's loads of cheap excellent restaurants, loads of parks, and the whole city is like a bunch of towns, each area has its own character. It takes a while to get used to but pretty much everyone gets hooked on London.    If I'm having a bad day I just [have a look at this](http://i.imgur.com/rtN6m.gif) and I'm immediately happier.      I'm not sure the focus of the study was particularly useful. Equating scientific literacy with just being able to recite scientific results seems both a little patronising and naive. Someone scientifically 'literate' might not know what role CO2 plays in climate change but might be familiar with the experimental processes that led to knowledge about CO2 and therefore be more willing to trust what scientists say.  tl;dr - How scientifically literate can you be if you know the information about climate change but don't believe it?   There's a whole heap of ways that stem cells can be coaxed into turning (or not turning) into different types of cells. This study found that slight modifications can stop them turning into fat cells which could potentially be used to fight obesity - bit.ly/1EN16lm   (Full disclosure: I work at the university that did this study)  	7
    One morning I woke up and started to get ready for school. Normal routine, wake up, have a shower, put on deodorant, get dressed, grab my keys/phone and wallet and head out. Get to the university, reach in my pocket to check the time. Instead of grabbing my phone, somehow I put a stick of deodorant in my pocket and left.

 Anti-venom is usually made of antibodies, the proteins that adaptive immune systems produce to fight pathogens.  To create anti-venom, small amounts of venom (too small to be lethal) are injected into an animal, such as a horse or goat.  The animal's immune system will recognize the venom as a foreign substance, and produce antibodies that bind to the venom, inactivating it.  A blood sample is then collected from the animal, and the relevant antibodies are purified from it.  Edited to add: I'm not sure what human conditions you have in mind for the first part of your question, but generically, many venoms act by hijacking or disabling a specific signaling system in the body--for example, a certain type of neurochemical signaling in the brain.  In large doses, this is obviously dangerous or fatal.  In smaller doses or applied locally, there are times when you might want to tune a signaling system up or down, to dull pain, slow heart rate, etc.  Source: "Antivenom Therapy in the Americas" http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003495-199958010-00002   On the molecular level, neurons that sense temperature have ion channels in their cell membranes that actually change their shape as the temperature changes.  This conformation change allows ions (which carry charge) to pass across the membrane, causing the neuron to begin sending a signal of that temperature change to other parts of the brain.  We have these temperature-sensing neurons in many parts of our body, as well as in our brain stem; those central detectors are the ones that would usually be in charge of starting a homeostatic response (sweating, flushing, etc.)  One neat thing is that some of these temperature receptors can also be stimulated by certain chemical compounds--the spices that we might describe as tasting "hot" or "cold".

A couple of them are a bit campy or over-the-top, but most of them are very good, and range from wistful to eerie to terrifying.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl%27s_Book_of_Ghost_Stories   A really interesting example, although important to note that even memories of individuals with this trait have limits.  "He had trouble memorizing information whose intended meaning differed from its literal one, as well as trouble recognizing faces, which he saw as "very changeable"." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky)   This is a cool way of looking at the question I wouldn't have thought of!  I also agree that the human brain can't actually get close to that limit. One consideration is all the non-learning-related information that the physical structure of the brain stores: the copy of the genome in every brain cell, for example.   Realistically, there is most likely some limit.  I think your question is getting at not only whether a human brain could learn "everything," but whether it could retain and use infinite information.  We don't actually know what a memory "looks like," so we don't know yet how much "space" it takes up in the brain, what exactly is required to maintain it (continued neural activity?  A certain anatomical structure, in the form of connections between neurons? Both?)  Without that information, it's impossible to meaningfully say how much information any given brain size/type could "store."  We do know that the brain, to perform its functions, has to balance two basic goals, stability (maintaining the useful information that has already been acquired) and plasticity (to acquire new useful information as it is presented.)  Here's an example reference of this idea: http://www.neuro.iastate.edu/Uploads/AbrahamRobins_TrendsNeurosci05.pdf  One idea that comes out of this is that maybe memory retention isn't a static thing--it has to be active.  Memories that you keep using are more robust and last longer, and maybe they have to be continually "re-made" to be retained.  So maybe the ultimate limit for memory storage in the brain will have less to do with physical capacity, and more to do with how much information we can actively review, revisit, use, etc. over a given period of time, so those memories don't decay.  Sorry if this is too speculative--you asked about something that is deeply interesting and pretty unknown!   Thanks--I did actually get this far by Googling.  It's not clear to me from Wikipedia and other sources that this is how someone in the field of astronomy would refer to it, though, or if there is a systematic way of naming planetary systems that our system also fits into.   Here's a cool article about it, linked from the Wikipedia article above! http://www.socialgenes.org/publications/Pub_TREE2.pdf   Maybe this is a bit of a cheating answer, but any "tragedy of the commons" scenario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) kind of fits.  In humans, I'm not sure one could identify a single trait that drives this type of behavior, but selfishness, and the inappropriate bias toward considering short-term vs. long-term outcomes both play a role.  In other species, even the simple drive toward reproduction can do this; if individuals are all exploiting a resource-rich environment and reproducing at a rate optimal for themselves, they can overpopulate the environment and crash.   It sounds like you are using Terro, which is basically sugar syrup with Borax in it, and possibly the ants dealing with are these guys: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapinoma_sessile.  If so, they are actually pretty cool from a biology perspective--in the wild, they have a normal colony structure, but in food and resource-rich urban areas, they go crazy and form massive colonies with multiple queens.  So you may be able to fight them back out of your house with Terro, but they will probably keep coming back every spring.  I am not certain of the answer to your main question.  Ants and other social insects do recognize when nestmates are dead.  Inside the nest, they will move the bodies outside (in some species) or to a special area of the nest designated for dead bodies/waste (other species.)  Outside in the open, I'm not sure.  I don't think you need to worry about disrupting the traps if you touch them, though.  The ants should be very strongly motivated by the sugar syrup, and won't care if you touch it.  I would just move the trap back along the ants' supply trail so they still naturally bump into it on their way there, away from the dead ants.   As AnIntoxicatedRodent says, epigenetic modifications are changes to the chemical structure of DNA (although they do not change the actual sequence of bases, the letters, of a DNA strand) or to the chemical structure of the protein complexes (histones) that DNA is wound around when it is packaged up inside the nucleus.  Researchers have several ways of looking for these modifications.  For example, they can use antibodies that stick to specific DNA or histone modifications, and then sequence the DNA fragments that the antibodies have bound to.  To look at a specific type of epigenetic modification, methylation of DNA, researchers can use a chemical treatment that converts the modified DNA nucleotide to a nucleotide found in RNA, that will show up differently when the DNA is sequenced and show that that location on the DNA strand was modified.  However, we still know too little about epigenetic modifications and how they affect gene regulation to just look at how a stretch of DNA with a gene in it has been modified, and know from that how the gene's expression will be affected.  Researchers do use microarrays to measure the expression of many different genes simultaneously.  However, as DNA sequencing has gotten cheaper, faster, and easier, more researchers are now using "RNAseq", where the mRNA or other types of RNA in a cell are directly sequenced, as a way to measure gene expression.  Quantitative PCR is also used to very accurately measure the expression of one gene at a time.  Looking at gene expression data and epigenetic modification data from the same cells or tissues, and exploring how those two things are related, is how researchers are continuing to learn more about how epigenetics works--how it helps control gene expression.   In theory, and in a very simplistic way, yes; supporting the life of the most important pollinating bees would contribute to more efficient pollination of crops (assuming that one was focusing on the right species in the right geographical regions, close enough to where crops are grown, etc.)  In practice, there are two major points.  One is that none of these bees are honey bees, Apis mellifera, the type of bee that most people imagine raising and maintaining.  For the purpose of the research done in this paper, honey bees were excluded because many of them are not "wild", and the researchers wanted to focus exclusively on wild bees.  Almost all of the species they looked at are not typically reared by humans, and none are "domesticated" to the extent that bees are.  Additionally, the majority of bee species in the world, and many examined in this research, are not "social," that is, they do not live in colonies.  They are solitary.  That doesn't really matter to answer your question, I am just too much of a nerd not to share!  If you are interested in supporting bee populations though, there are lots of ways to do that less directly, including protecting whatever parts of the environment specific types of bees live in, planting bee-friendly plants to ensure that they have season-long access to food (instead of having no food whenever local crops are not in bloom), etc.   So did Harry Potter.   This seems like a really weird thing to be posting here . . . but please consider reading it anyway.  Despite the title and reputation, Anna Karenina is far from being the only main character in the book; to me, she's not even the most sympathetic one.  There are several interrelated, complex plots, and some themes related to human nature, morality, relationships, etc. that are still incredibly relevant.  Of course, this all assumes that literature/Russian literature is to your taste :-)  But don't avoid it forever if knowing that one plot point is the only reason.   I think this is my response too.  Do what Adnan said in his letter to SK: "pretend he's innocent," and then consider his perspective.  Hypothetical innocent Adnan doesn't know why or how Hae was murdered, or who murdered her.  He could be just as confused as all of us.  In that case, he couldn't presume that Hae would still be alive if they had never dated.  Do I think that my personal connection with Adnan's quote proves that's what was running through his head, or that he's innocent?  Of course not.  I just think that because people wish so much that they could find out the truth of the case, they start thinking they can find some kind of murderer shibboleth in Jay's or Adnan's statements.  The reality is that the truth probably won't be found unless DNA testing or some totally unexpected source provides new evidence of some kind.   This is actually one of my favorite segments of the whole show.  It obviously can't be used to prove anything about Adnan's guilt or innocence, but I actually relate to it a great deal.  A few times in my life, I've gotten into trouble (not serious legal trouble, but minor altercations with authority figures or friends) due to what could be described as bad luck.  In each instance, while I hadn't been doing anything actually wrong, I still had made choices that were silly, or selfish, or irresponsible, and that led to me being in "the wrong place at the wrong time."  When you make immature choices that combine with bad luck to lead to an outcome much worse than they deserve, it's not as easy as one might suppose to feel comfortable in the role of the hapless victim.  Years in prison would afford any wrongfully convicted person plenty of time to play the what-if game: "what if I had never been friends with Jay?  What if I had never smoked pot?  What if I hadn't tried to have a relationship my parents didn't want me to have?  If I'd been a better son, this wouldn't have happened.  If I'd taken my faith more seriously, I wouldn't have even been in a position to be accused."  Look how even people who were genuinely victims often blame themselves or have bitter regrets over actions that may not even have contributed to their circumstances at all.  "If only I hadn't run back into the house for a sweater, I would have been two minutes earlier and this car accident never would have happened."  	16
 Must be getting rendered weirdly by my browser. I copied it into Word and there are indeed only two prongs.   This is great, thank you! I am bookmarking this post. Quick question, what the heck is THIS ? A three-prong pair of scissors? Trissors?   A fellow Canadian! Yes, you should definitely avoid answering the door if you see some carolers out there.   XDDD Oh my gosh. I spent the day Christmas shopping and accidentally answered myself instead of the comment left by /u/I_let_the_dog_out down below. Laughing so hard right now.   A fellow Canadian! Yes, you should definitely avoid answering the door if you see some carolers out there.   Guys, the t-shirt is CLEARLY going to be haunted as f*ck.   I live in Eastern Canada, though I have a feeling distance isn't going to stop these guys. I mean, they did manage to leave my house and make it out of the street within minutes.   Funny thing is, I can't read analogue clocks...or roman numerals. The grandfather clock has both on its face. I never know if I'm setting the right time or not.   A group of carolers came to my door this evening, and I'm pretty sure at least one of them was dead. I had just gotten out of the shower and was watching re-runs on TV, when I heard the doorbell ring. My heart jumped out of my chest and my first instinct was to run for cover. Call me anti-social, but the sound of the doorbell is one of those things I just cant stand. Whenever I order pizza, I pace back and forth nervously until it arrives. My mind races and I cant focus on anything but the minutes ticking by. I dread the doorbell, and having to answer it. I absolutely dread it with every fiber of my being. My cat, sharing my disapproval, scurried between my legs and fled to my bedroom. I'm not going to lie, there was a big part of me that wished I could hide under my bed with him just so I could avoid having to deal with another living being. In hindsight, maybe I got exactly what I wished for.   nbsp;  In the past couple of years, there had been a lot of home invasions in my area. To gain access to your house, burglars had taken to dressing up as anything from employees of electric companies, to cops. You wont believe how trusting people are towards those they believe to be in positions of authority. Once inside, the crooks would knock out the homeowner and would steal everything of value. It was a terrible thing: these dicks preyed on the weak and the nave. It wasn't uncommon for them to stoop so low as to attack senior citizens, either. This is why I kept a bat near my door. Now, I confess, it sounds a bit drastic, but its not like I brandished it around and swung it in peoples faces or anything. I kept it out of sight, but within reach. You can never be too careful nowadays. Its not like my cat would be willing to run in and maul an assailant to save me: I needed a bit of protection for my own peace of mind, thats all.   nbsp;  Just as I reached the entrance, the doorbell rang again, giving me the scare of a lifetime. I jumped several feet in the air and released a high-pitch shriek. Looking through the peephole, I spotted a group of Christmas carolers. I thought it was a little strange that I had not heard them singing at my neighbors door first. Usually, I hear these guys coming from all the way down the street, and I quickly turn off all the lights in the hopes that theyll assume I'm gone and skip my house. Not this time, though. Maybe my neighbors were away, and my house was the first inhabited one these carolers had come across on my street. With a hand reaching towards my bat, I opened the door by a few inches. They didn't even wait for me to say anything, and started chanting a monastic chant. It sounded both beautiful and haunting. There were seven singers, but it sounded like a full choir. The ancient song gave me goose bumps, and I slowly opened the door wider to get a better look. Their voices, coming out of their partially cloaked faces, echoed melodiously in the darkness. I was used to the usual Christmas carols, but these beautiful Gregorian chants made me feel completely at ease.   nbsp;  Through their somewhat obscured faces, I could see the carolers mouths moving as they inhaled and exhaled pure music. Their songs seemed to pierce me right through my soul. I looked at the carolers, one by one, and examined the features on their faded red and green cloaks. They appeared as ancient as the songs being sung. The clothes were tattered, torn, and dirty. It was impressive: these singers had gone through a lot of trouble to look the part. As my eyes traveled to another singer in the group, I noticed something weird. Though I could distinctively hear a low tone escaping from his lips, his mouth was not moving, He was the tallest of the group, so when I leaned down, I could see the eyes on his bluish face. They were pale and unmoving; they were locked on me, yet the bearded man did not seem to acknowledge my presence. The voices got louder and louder, the splendor of the chants countering the ever-growing fear I felt while looking at the caroler in the back. I dont know what compelled me to do it, but I looked down and started counting their feet. I counted 12 in total, but I could see 7 heads. Something was off.   nbsp;  The familiar ring of my grandfather clock made me realize Id been standing at the door for over an hour. I gasped and checked my watch to make sure it wasn't a mistake. I had to wind the clock earlier that day, and I know I could have messed it up somehow. There was no mistake: an hour had passed, and I suddenly realized how cold I was. My hands were trembling, my legs were numb, and I could barely move. I looked towards the mirror on my left, and saw that my lips had turned blue. I lifted a hand to tell the carolers to wait for me, shutting the door to prevent more of the winters blistering cold to slide into my house. I started humming their tune, though I've never been much of a singer, so I was rather off-key. From the kitchen pantry, I grabbed canned beans and carrots to donate to whichever charity theyd come from. I could hear the voices fading away one by one. When I opened the door to offer the food, the carolers were gone. There were no traces of them, not even a single footstep in the snow. Still frozen from the inside out, I took a few steps onto the sidewalk and looked down the road: the carolers were nowhere to be seen.   nbsp;  I know I should be terrified, and I'm not saying I'm not afraid. Its just thatevery time I think about the carolers, their beautiful song echoes in my mind, and I start to feel incredibly calm. All I can say to you now is this: beware of a group of cloaked carolers, because I dont think theyre alive, and I think theyre looking to recruit. I know I didn't make the cut. You might be next.   Now that's an ominous-sounding reply, if I ever read one.   I know a thing or two about haunted cars. It doesn't end well.   Son, theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light., my father used to tell me, when he found me screaming in my bed.   nbsp;  Though I am sure his words were meant to comfort me, my young mind understood a more disturbing implication. My dad wanted me to think that I was as safe in the dark as I was in the light, but it sounded as though I was as vulnerable in the light as I was in the dark. I knew there were monsters in my room, and it terrified me to realize that I could not cast them away with the power of my lamp or the flashlight I kept under my pillow. Turning on the light only meant being able to see the creatures that lurked in the darkness, and that seemed far more horrific. Every night, I trembled in my bed, dreading the day when the monsters would finally decide to turn me into a midnight snack.   nbsp;  One night, when I was seven, I was woken up by the sound of the phone ringing. I crawled out of bed to eavesdrop on my dad. There was an emergency at work, and he needed to leave urgently. He called my babysitter, who was used to his late-night requests and already knew where to find the spare key. I walked to my window and peered outside in time to catch dad jumping into his van and driving off. His headlights momentarily blinded me, and stripped away what little night vision I had garnered up until then. As I turned towards my bed, I spotted something standing on the other side. I nearly peed myself. Squinting to get a better look, I found that my vision was hindered by a collection of fading bright spots still pulsating in my retinas.   nbsp;  W-whos there..?, I asked, in a pathetic whimper.   nbsp;  I reached for my lamp, but became paralysed with fear, remembering my fathers words: theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light. It would be pointless to turn on the light. The figure swayed back and forth silently, in an almost hypnotic rhythm. I remember hearing it hissing and making a strange dripping sound. As a row of cars passed in the street, light poured in through my windows. I started to make out the creatures details: its arms were twisted and bony, its hands were a trio of clawed fingers that reminded me of a birds talons, it had three spikes jutting out of each side of its bald head, its eyes glowed like those of a cat in the night, and it wore a loose robe that, as far as I could tell, was made up of light leather with stands of hair attached to it. I had watched enough cowboy and Indian movies to know what a scalp was when I saw one. I wanted to scream and run, but I couldn't move.   nbsp;  Strangely, the creature did not approach me. Instead, it lurked over my empty bed. Pure luck had bunched the blankets up in such a way as to make it seem like I was still under them. Even as the light faded away, I could see one of the monsters talons slowly reaching towards my blanket. It gripped onto the top and pulled it back, revealing the empty bed. The demonic being stretched its abnormally long neck, peering at the spot where I should have been. It made a series of eerie clicking sounds, just like when you smack your tongue against your palate. When it realized that the bed was empty, it emitted a shrill shriek so loud that I had to cover my ears. I remember that sound so vividly, even to this day. It was like a police siren, but ten times louder and somehow more offensive.   nbsp;  Lights once again erupted through my window as my babysitter came up the driveway. Her headlights enabled me to see each and every unsettling detail on the creatures horrific face. I could see its sunken, golden eyes, its nostrils sitting in the middle of its nose-less face, and its eerily tiny mouth. The mouth formed a perfect circle about the size of the cap on a water bottle, and was lined with tiny sharp fangs. Some sort of blackish ooze drizzled out of its lipless maw and landed on the bed, soaking into my Ninja Turtles comforter. For some reason, that mouth terrified me more than anything in my life. Just when I thought I could not feel more frightened, it turned its angry head towards me. Its long neck stretched out in my direction, and I thought I was a goner.   nbsp;  F-Fred Wilkins, 162 Vanier Lane! H-hell be much yummier!, I told it desperately, selling out the jerk that bullied me to save my own skin.   nbsp;  The creature retracted suddenly and melted between the floorboards. I'm not sure whether it accepted my offering, or if the sound of my front door opening spooked it, but it was gone. I ran out of my room, crying my eyes out. I couldn't tell my babysitter what had happened, but she thankfully understood how frightened I was, and let me sleep in the living room while she watched infomercials on TV. Fred was missing from school the next day, and we were told a few days later that his family up and moved overnight. To this day, I do not know whether that was true or whether it was some sort of cover-up to keep our class from freaking out.   nbsp;  The creature returned to visit me about once a season. Each time, I gave it another address. Sometimes, it was the address of someone I knew, sometimes it would be random, and I would hope for the best. The monster would disappear and leave me alone until its hunger grew again. I started noticing more and more missing children posters when dad and I went grocery shopping. I felt guilty, but no amount of guilt could win against my fear. Besides, the other kids deserved it, right? If they were so smart, they would have done like me and told the demonic figure to go eat someone else. I tried to reason my guilt away, but in the back of my mind, I knew the truth: the kids on those posters were never coming back.   nbsp;  The last time I saw the creature, I was eleven years old. The moon was casting an unsettling amount of light into my room. I could feel the beast lingering over me while I hid under the covers. I could hear its shallow breathing and feel my blanket dampening from the black drool coming out of its mouth. It didn't matter how many times I had seen the monster, I never wanted to fully look at it ever again. I closed my eyes tightly, desperately trying to remember an address to give it. I felt its talon gripping my blanket, I heard it make that familiar clicking sound, and I panicked. My mind was a blur and I could not come up with the address Id been rehearsing for weeks, in anticipation of his visit.   nbsp;  I-if you let me live, you canY-you can have my kids when I grow up! I blurted out.   nbsp;  The creature paused, as though contemplating the offer. I heard its footsteps as it distanced itself from me, and I slowly pulled the blankets away from my face. It gave me one last look. Its tiny fangs twitched a couple of times. I could have sworn I saw it nod, as it slowly disappeared into the floor.   nbsp;  ***  Honey, theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light. I told my daughter last night, when her screams woke me up.   nbsp;  My daughter said there were monsters in her room. I assured her that there was no such thing as monsters. There is nothing worse than living in fear: I knew that from experience. I reached for her teddy bear, which was sitting dutifully on the shelf, and handed it to her.   nbsp;  Mr. Scuzzles will protect you., I offered calmly.   nbsp;  She took the bear and hugged it close as she continued to cry and beg for a nightlight. I refused to get her one. I dont want her to see it when it comes for her. God help me, no one should have to see that thing.   Oooh, good job on the story, /u/azaerthes and good job on the narration, /u/LateNightSpooks! I must say, I don't know how you narrators do it. If I tried to narrated anything, my voice would crackle like a teenage boy hitting puberty. It's not pretty.  So to recap: way to go both of you!    He got me, too. I was thinking: "Man, what a jerk.", and then I saw who it was.   Maybe you filtered out series?   Protip: don't try to tell the TSA agents that you were following a clairvoyant's warning. They'll think you're crazy.   A few years ago, I worked as a receptionist at a local business dedicated to renting steam cleaner vacuums and providing cleaning services. The business is still open, so I wont give out its name. I was alone one afternoon when I got the most unsettling call of my short-lived career. Here is what happened:   nbsp;  "Good afternoon. You have reached [BLANK] Steam Cleaning Services and Rentals. Please note that this call may be recorded for training purposes. How may I help you today?", I asked.   nbsp;  We were actually recording calls in case clients tried to break their contracts. People are typically reluctant to let themselves get recorded if they think its going to bite them in the ass later in court.   nbsp;  "   Can you get blood    out of carpet?", whispered a man, through heaving breaths.   nbsp;  Had I not received this inquiry a dozen times before, I would have thought it was highly suspicious. You would be surprised how many people need to get blood out of their carpets. Sure, the callers voice gave me the chills, but I had no reason to be afraid: there were a variety of non-creepy reasons why someone would need blood stains removed. Just a few weeks prior, a young mother stepped on broken glass and accidentally got her crimson juice all over her new rug. These things happen.   nbsp;  "Yes, sir, we can remove minor blood stains. How much is there to clean?", I asked him, as I turned to my computer and pulled up an order form.   nbsp;  "Theres  going to be   so much blood.", he answered, sending chills down my spine.   nbsp;  Unsure of what to make of his response, I decided that I had misheard him. Surely, he just meant it was a large mess. I minimized the order form and looked up our list of affiliates. There are companies specifically designed to clean up things like crime scenes, and we earned a 15% commission on referrals. We couldn't handle a large cleanup job, so I figured I would offer him an alternative.   nbsp;  "I understand, sir. Unfortunately, we can only tackle small to medium stains. If you like, I can transfer you to one of our partners. Theyll be more than happy to take care of that for you.", I told him cheerfully.   nbsp;  For five whole minutes, all I heard was the sound of the mans abnormal, asthmatic breathing. It was company policy never to hang up on a customer, so all I could do was wait and play Solitaire while he contemplated his options. My unease grew with every second that ticked by. Finally, I spoke again.   nbsp;  "Sir? Would you like me to transfer you?", I asked him.   nbsp;  "no.", he answered. I was relieved to finally hear a voice on the other end. "I need you  ", he finished.   nbsp;  "Im sorry, sir. As I said beforeits not in our mandate to clean large me-", I began, but he quickly interrupted.   nbsp;  "Youre going to  lose so much  blood.", he told me, his stoic and hushed tone never faltering.   nbsp;  To hell with company policy: I hung up without another word. While my heart attempted to leave by body through my throat, I went online and performed a reverse lookup on the callers phone number. I sincerely wished it belonged to one of my coworkers, and that hed been playing a trick on me. It wasn't: there were no known matches. Just as I was finally starting to calm down, I saw my phone blinking. The same number appeared on the caller ID. Against my better judgement, my hand reached for the receiver and I brought it to my ear.   nbsp;  "Y-yes?", I asked shakily.   nbsp;  "See   you soon.", he replied.   nbsp;  I slammed the phone back down and got the hell out of the office, locking up behind me. Once I got home, I called my boss and told him Id fallen ill. The next morning, I came in to work and spotted a couple squad cars in the parking lot. My boss was standing outside the front door, a worried expression on his face. I approached him and asked him what had happened. He told me there had been a break-in.   nbsp;  "Holy shit. Is everyone all right?! Was anything taken?", I asked, in shock. My boss scratched his head, giving me a perplexed expression.   nbsp;  "Thats the weird thingthey just smashed your phones recorder, and took one of our old steam vacuums---yknow, the one Marc doodled eyes on?", he told me.    nbsp;  My blood froze.   nbsp;  They never found the criminal. I quit my job a few days later because I didn't feel safe at work. My boss wrote me a pretty good letter of recommendation, and I went on with my life. I probably wouldn't have thought about it again, had I not found the old steam vacuum sitting on my front porch this evening, looking at me with its big cartoonish eyes. I called the cops, but they refused to come. They just told me that leaving junk on someones property wasn't a crime that warranted their attention. But now I know that he knows where I live, and worst of all: judging by the content of the vacuum's tank, he knows how to get blood stains out of carpet now.   Its hard to believe that just a week ago, my Christmas tree stood tall and proud in the corner of my living room, bringing me so much joy. Now, I find myself wishing this damn tree had never been brought into my home. What few pine needles remain on it are brown and its trunk is bent over, like an inflexible person reaching for their toes. My ornaments have scattered across the floor, but I dont have the strength to pick them up. I've been feeling really sick these past few days, and its getting worse.   nbsp;  Last week, I returned from work and found a post-it on my door: Used your shower. Left you a gift. XOXOXO Mom. My parents retired a few years ago and moved to a campground away from the city. It was nice and all, but they didn't have running water in the winter, so they occasionally stopped by to do laundry and to shower. When I opened the door, Rex, my Labrador, greeted me excitedly. I know, I know: its a really stereotypical name. In my defence, I got him when I was 9, and I was all about dinosaurs back then. I still am: I have an awesome T-Rex magnet on my fridge that isn't going anywhere. Rex was surprisingly spry for his old age, and I happily met his demands for attention. Running my hands over his soft black fur, I removed my coat and threw it in the general direction of the nearest hanger. Rex, tail wagging like a metronome on steroids, dragged me to the living room. I smiled as I saw the beautiful Christmas tree my parents had left me. Rex spread out under the tree on a white blanket that had been draped around it, and playfully nibbled at the bottom branches.   nbsp;  The next day, I put on some holiday music and dug through boxes to find my ornaments. Rex thought hed help me by pulling out random objects and hiding them around my house. There was a sweet scent in the air, like nutmeg mixed with candle wax. I had likely failed to close the lid on one of the Christmas candles. The clumped up sugar in my cupboard was proof of my lazy lid-closing ways. Rex was particularly fond of my new garlands, and helped me unravel them all over the living room floor. It took me fifteen minutes to undo all the knots. He loved watching me struggle. After finding a nice array of older ornaments from my childhood and newer ones Id bought myself after moving out, I began decorating the tree. I remembered the year when I got Rex: he was sitting under the tree on Christmas Eve, wearing a big red bow. Wed been friends ever since. As I continued to hang ornaments, I spotted a few yellowing pine needles. I carefully plucked them off and tossed them in the garbage. Their absence did not take away from the trees splendor.   nbsp;  After a while, I noticed Rex wasn't by my side any more. I looked around my house and found him curled up on his doggy bed, which was pretty unusual in and of itself. Id only seen him sleep there twice since Id bought the thing. Rex much preferred the foot of my bed. All tuckered out, huh, boy? I teased, scratching him behind the ear. He whined lowly and closed his eyes. I let him be, took a few moments to send my parents a thank-you email with a photo of the decked-out tree, and then started on supper. Before sitting down at the table, I opened a can of Rexs favorite food and poured it in his bowl. I called for him, but he didn't come. He was probably exhausted from the decora-thon. I ate alone for the first time in years. The silence was deafening, but at least I could enjoy the view as I devoured my meal: my tree looked beautiful. I checked on Rex a few times that evening, but he was fast asleep. Lazy bum. My dad answered my email and told me they were cancelling our plans for supper the next day because theyd come down with the flu. I gave them strict instructions to get some rest, and then followed my own advice. I was starting to feel rather worn out myself.   nbsp;  Over the course of the following days, I saw a steady decline in old Rexs health. I was afraid it was his time. I dreaded it so much that it gave me nightmares. I could barely keep myself from tearing up at work. Wed been through so much together, Rex and I. I wasn't ready to say goodbye. I came home one night to find a collection of yellow and brownish pin needles under the tree. It was starting to thin out, like the top of a middle-aged mans head. I vacuumed the mess, feeling really guilty for being unable to keep the damn tree alive. It was a gift, after all. What would my parents say if they saw it in such a pitiful condition? I stopped in my tracks and realized Id forgotten to greet Rex. I ran to his side and dropped to my knees. I didn't even have to touch him to know he was gone. My lips quivering and my eyes dripping, I gave him a final hug. I'm sorry I wasn't here to say goodbye I murmured. I had to call a friend to take care of him. I couldn't do it myself.   nbsp;  The next few days passed in a blur. I was so distraught that I called in sick from work. It wasn't a complete lie, since I felt like I had caught what was ailing my parents. I emailed my dad to tell him about Rex. He loved that dog almost as much as I did. He liked to kidnap him for week-long camping trips. He claimed we had shared custody of him. Though my parents laptops were typically at arms reach, I didn't get a reply. Dad was probably moping around the campfire and needed his space. I coped by turning into a complete hermit, leaving the house only once to take out the trash and overflowing recycling bin. I cant remember why the recycling bin was so fullI dont recall putting much stuff into it. Meanwhile, my Christmas tree continued to decay. I was too much of a wreck and too worn-down to bother taking it out to the dumpster. I let it rot slowly in my living room.   nbsp;  Since yesterday, I've been getting these awful headaches, and my nose keeps bleeding. I spent most of my time lying in bed or sitting at my computer. I wish Rex was here. I wish my parents would reply to my emails. I'm so lonely. I called the friend who took care of Rex for me, but she couldn't stay on the phone very long: seems like I gave her my flu. I wish I wasn't looking at my pathetic excuse for a Christmas tree. Its slouched over and there is not a single ornament left on it. Ugh, the screens getting all blurry, I'm probably going to go to bed soon.   nbsp;  As I was typing this, I heard a faint hissing sound coming from the tree. I lethargically wheeled my chair over and leaned in to listen. It was like the sound of air escaping a tire, and it was coming from a tiny black tube sticking out of the trunk. Thats when I realized something: the tree had no scent. I should have been able to smell pine or rot or something. Anything. Then, I remembered why the recycling bin had been so full. My mind was distracted when I took it out, but it was coming back to me. There had been a large crumpled-up cardboard box with the picture of a tree on it.   nbsp;  Artificial Christmas trees aren't supposed to die   nbsp;  Oh man, I'm starting to feel really dizzyI'm going to go lie down for a while   Time to get those pesky braces moved. Ask your orthodontist to tune them in to the station of your choice.   I totally agree. As a writer, I get a lot of entertainment from reading the comments and seeing people's theories. Some of the ones they come up with are absolutely awesome. Sometimes, I find myself thinking: "Man, I wish I thought of that." There's no need to over-explain your ending. Just make sure you drop a few hints in your narrative, and then sit back and watch what happens.   I would have to agree with what everyone is saying: good title, captivating story, shocking ending, etc. I also think there's a bit of luck and a bit of strategy that goes into it. Personally, I try to post when I see that a lot of people are online but not a lot of stories have been submitted, in the hopes that mine will start off as close to the main page as possible. Then I just keep hitting refresh while quietly sobbing and rocking myself in the corner, hoping that it'll get some upvotes. Then, of course, there's the goat sacrifice...but everyone knows that.  I've also noticed that longer stories get less love.   Someone PLEASE make this story happen. Then, as a crazy twist-ending, you find out it's actually a site full of people making gourmet food out of those Easter marshmellowy peeps... ... ...FROM HELL.   I wasn't expecting that ending.   Something horrible is going to happen, and I need to stop it before its too late. I'm not sure what I can do, except to warn as many people as I can. Please heed this warning if you signed up for the North American MP3 Flash Mob on December 24th, know someone who has, or intend on going shopping that day.   nbsp;  A week ago, my friend came across a website preparing one of those MP3 flash mobs, just like the ones ImprovEverywhere does. You know, where they give people an mp3 file with pre-recorded instructions, and then let them loose in the community while onlookers gawk in disbelief. I used to watch those videos, but they got old after a while. In any case, the organizers of the flash mob my buddy discovered were trying to break the world record for most participants by spreading the activity across all of North America, and my friend wanted me to join him. I wasn't too keen on doing it, but I owed him one after the bungee jumping fiasco of 09. I went to the address my friend had given me (MP3flashmob.com) to sign up. There were pre-determined meeting spots in malls in every major city. Great. I was going to have to make a fool of myself in a frantic crowd of last-minute Christmas shoppers. After selecting my city from their list, the website brought me to a download page. There were strict instructions NOT to listen to the MP3 until 1:30 p.m. eastern time on December 24th, so that the activity would be as much of a surprise to those witnessing the flash mod, as it would be to those participating.   nbsp;  After coming home form work this afternoon, I got a little curious. I knew I wasn't supposed to listen to the audio file, but its a damn good thing that I did. I slipped headphones into my ears and pressed PLAY. A bit of Christmas music started playing in the background as the hostess began: Welcome to the North American MP3 Flash Mob experiment! Thank you for participating in todays flash mob. Together, well make history! she said, in a cheery tone of voice. I noticed a very faint hum in the background. It was just outside my hearing and didn't bother me too much, but it was constant and unwavering. I figured it was coming from a piece of equipment in the persons recording studio. My brain soon adjusted to the sound and started drowning it out. Please take a seat. We will begin shortly. chimed the hostess. I sat on my couch and waited for three whole minutes while an elevator-music rendition of Jingle Bells played in my ears.   nbsp;  Finally, the hostess began relaying simple instructions: raise a hand, look at a stranger, freeze, unfreeze, walk a few paces northwest, etc. They were all fairly harmless things, and even though Id only intended to listen to the MP3, I played along and did everything she requested. Then, she asked me to do the most horrendous thing I could think of: Turn South and dance the Macarena. she insisted, her tone slightly forceful. I was mortified. I was going to have to do this in PUBLIC! Before I even knew what was happening, I realized I was dancing that evil, disgusting, out-dated dance alone in my living room. It was as though my body had automatically reacted to her command. Mind you, I did the most half-assed version of the dance, but I did it none the less. Fortunately, she soon went back to giving me menial tasks. Little did I know; however, things were going to get worse.   nbsp;  The hostess voice became more and more authoritative with every order, and the constant hum in the background got louder as the MP3 went on. I felt a fog rolling over my mind. I dont know if you've ever passed out before, but if you havent, theres this weird sensation just before it happens. Its like youre walking on clouds, and you cant quite feel your body any more. I've felt that sensation a few times before when my blood pressure dropped so low that I blacked out. Thats exactly how I felt listening to the MP3, minus the part where I wind up face-first on the carpet. I did everything the hostess asked of me: I lifted my hands to the sky, I threw myself onto the floor, and I wiggled around like a worm. I couldn't stop myself even if I wanted to. I was thankful Id closed the curtains in the living room before I started. Had anyone seen me, I think I would have died from embarrassment.   nbsp;  It was then that the instructions took a more unsettling twist. Nowfind or buy a sharp object. said the woman, pausing for a couple of minutes so I could comply. I walked into my kitchen and grabbed a knife from the drawer. Find somebody wearing a red shirt. Approach them slowly from behind. she told me. I looked around, but I was alone. My inability to follow-through with her command made her control over me waver. Plunge the knife into his or her back. she instructed, her voice dry and firm. Reality dawned on me and I completely froze. The veil lifted from my mind. I looked at my phone in disbelief, and at the knife in my hands. I just barely heard the hostess asking me to carve out the persons heart, when I pulled the cord, popping the headphones out of my ears. Panting heavily, I dropped the knife onto the countertop and backed up against the wall in shock. Thank god I snapped out of it when I did, because my girlfriend came home a few minutes later, and she was wearing a bright red top.   nbsp;  In the hours since, I deleted the audio file, for fear of someone accidentally listening to it. I tried going back to the website to see who was running the flash mob, but the site is gone. I know I'm not the only one who downloaded the MP3. There were thousands of people already signed up for the flash mob when I first visited the website. There were message boards full of users trying to create groups in their cities. I have to stop them, but what can I do? If any of you signed up for a flash mob on December 24th, please PLEASE  please delete the audio file without listening to it. For everyone elsespread the word, be careful, and, for your own safety, dont wear red on Christmas Eve.   Aunt Caroline is pretty much the master hide-and-seeker. I mean, she stayed hidden for years after your game!   Oooooh, now that is creepy.  Maybe you should check your previous paintings for clues?   Really? Sweet, I did not know that. Thank you for your help!   I was actually wondering the same thing, so thank you and /u/coraal for answering. On the same token...what if you did not originally mean for the story to be a series, but decided afterwards to add an update?   Most of my stories are self-contained, but there is one in particular that lends itself well to a continuation, and I think I might go for it. It's too late to label the first one as part of a series...so do I just go for it, add (Update) and put the flair on the second one, even though the first doesn't have that?   Damn, what's going to happen to that poor cat? Judy didn't have time to donate to a shelter.   Based on photos I saw of her later, I would say no. She looks like my dad and Uncle Steve...if they were women.   You're exactly right. It's 50% of the 0.5% that holds family markers. Edit: Err, in this case, he had 0.09% of the 0.5% that holds family markers. Siblings should have 50% of that 0.5%.   It's so weird having people call her my 'aunt', since I didn't even know she'd existed up until a few years ago. Yes, I think I'll snoop around. Not sure if I can get the finger, though. Dad's a little protective of his dolls...wow, that sounded better in my head.   It's a given that fourth cousins aren't real people. Otherwise, they'd be first cousins.  But, no. I think I just explained it badly. All humans share 99.5% of their DNA, and the 0.5% left shows family connections. Of the remaining 0.5%, Siblings match 50%, and so on and so forth.   It wasn't my mom's hair color, that's for sure. And, yeah, that's one of the things that bothered me, too. I'm starting to wonder if my grandfather was involved. He's the one who insisted they cremate Jessiewas he trying to hide something?   It could be!   Way to go, you creeped me out! Glad it was just the show.Waitare there typically breathing sounds on TV? Better check the closet   Yes, I will update if I find out anything more. I think it's about time I give old grandma a visit.    If my research leads me to anything, I will definitely keep ya'll posted.   I don't think so. I saw a photo of her a little while ago. There's definitely a family resemblance.   The finger was in the smallest doll.   Does it give you the WET willies?  ...  (Sorry dad, if you ever read this. Humor is my coping mechanism for stressful situations.)   No worries. I should have included her age. Hmm...I'm not sure whether or not I'll tell my dad. I think it brings him a lot of comfort to have her close to him like that. He might not take the truth very well.   Jessie was driving. She was a lot older than my dad. I don't know whose finger it is. I only got the results of the DNA test today, and all it could tell me was whether or not the finger's DNA matched my dad's.   Throughout my childhood, I wondered what was in the box my father kept on the mantel. Hed given my sister and I clear instructions never to touch it, in a tone of voice so authoritative that we dared not give in to our curiosity. Our only clue was a small label on its side that read Russian Nesting Dolls. Since none of the boxes in the house were properly labeled, we werent sure what to make of it. I only discovered the truth one night several years ago, when my father and I were sharing drinks and watching a hockey game. I confess: I was not expecting what he told me and showed me that night. I think that, had it not been for the half-dozen Molsons hed downed that evening, he would never have opened the box in front of me. My dad pushed his recliner back, a bottle in his hand, and watched the Zamboni make its way onto the ice. With a quiet sip, he began telling me the story.   nbsp;  Much to my surprise, he revealed that he had an older sister, Jessie. Up until then, I thought Uncle Steve was his only sibling. When my dad was seven years old, Jessie got into a car accident after a night on the town. Automobile versus tree, and the tree won by a landslide. The damage was so severe that Jessie needed a closed casket funeral. Dads old man insisted they cremate her body. Once dad had gotten a little older, his mother revealed more details about the accident: a branch had taken Jessies head nearly entirely off her shoulders, and her body had been crushed and twisted at unnatural angles. Some of the rescue workers on scene, seasoned professionals used to blood and gore, quit their jobs after that night. As my father spoke, he pushed himself off the couch and walked over to the box on the mantel. I asked if her ashes were inside, but he shook his head. He brought the box over to the sofa, took a seat, and ran his hand delicately against its grainy surface.   nbsp;  After a slight moment of hesitation, my father pushed open the small wooden slab at the front of the box, revealing a Russian Nesting Doll tucked neatly in a bed of straw. He told me the box had come in the mail exactly ten years to the day after his sisters death. There was no postmark or return address. He turned the slab over to expose a sentence written in red ink: I will always be with you. it read. The name Jessie had been signed underneath and the dot on the i" had been replaced with a heart. Dad insisted it was her handwriting, and tears welled up in his eyes as he gently grazed the now faded markings with the tips of his fingers. I had never seen my dad get so emotional before. It was a little uncomfortable. I took a sip of beer and leaned closer, examining the doll in the box. It was painted like any typical Russian Nesting Doll: a beautiful young womans smiling face, a floral shawl around her neck, small arms at her sides, a rose on her stomach, and a red base. My father followed my gaze to the doll and sighed. The game came back on, and he set the conversation aside to watch, his stern face locked on the screen.   nbsp;  Holding my tongue until the break between the 2nd and 3rd periods, I barely paid attention to the television. From the disapproving groans being emitted by my dad, I could tell our team was losing again. As soon as the 2nd period ended, I turned to my father and asked him why he never put the dolls out on display. He said he would show me why; if I was man enough to handle it. I puffed my chest in an exaggerated manner and snarled Nurgh. Guh! ME MAN! in a caveman-esque voice. He clutched the doll and pried it open, pulling out the smaller one inside. She was creepier than the first, but still looked fairly normal. She had all the same features, except for two things: she was frowning and the rose on her stomach was black. Noticing the unimpressed look on my face, he popped the second doll open. The third doll filled me with a sense of unease. Its face seemed more demonic, and small fangs protruded from its painted lips. A thorny vine had replaced the rose on its belly, and her clawed fingers gave her a monstrous appearance. OK, I was beginning to understand why he never showed these off. My father cringed, not wanting to reveal the next doll, so I offered him another beer to soothe his nerves.   nbsp;  A few minutes passed in silence before my father freed the fourth figure. This one really stunned me. It had devilish horns and an angry face. It looked evil. I could feel a weird pressure in my chest. Maybe it was my imagination, but I felt like it was getting harder to breathe. The doll had thick eyebrows, soulless eyes, and a goatee. Instead of a shawl around its neck, it had barbed wire. Its long, bony and clawed fingers were holding the severed head of the first doll in the series. Just looking at it made my skin crawl. God damn, there was something seriously wrong about it. My father downed the beer in his hands and slipped it between his knees. He plucked the doll open and showed me the fifth and final one. It was a little girl with a tormented face. She had blood dripping all around her neck. Her base was painted to look like flames. Of all the dolls, that one scared me the most. I could practically hear anguished screams coming out of her wide-open mouth. Chills ran up and down my spine as I took it in. If I wasnt freaked out enough already, my father said something that ensured I would not sleep that night: Looks just like Jessie.   nbsp;  The array of dolls disturbed me greatly, and I cursed my innate curiosity. It was then that I noticed a crease in the middle of the smallest doll. Against my better judgment, I asked my father if there was another doll inside. He shook his head. His pained lips turned into a light, almost mournful smile. He carefully opened the lid, revealing something wrapped in a yellowish newspaper tied together with twine. He slowly started to undo the knot, and my heart raced faster and faster with each passing second. I wish I could un-see what I saw that night. I knew what it was before my eyes even caught a glimpse of it. It was as though my brain had filled in the blank all on its own. Inside the newspaper was a shriveled human finger. It had been ripped off at its base, and a broken metacarpal bone stuck out of the old-raisin-like flesh dangling at the bottom. I brought a hand to my mouth and bolted towards the washroom, expulsing beer and peanuts into the porcelain throne. Why had he kept it?! What if my sister and I had seen it? What if it had fallen from the mantel and opened somehow? Did mom know? Was it even LEGAL to keep human remains? Between the gurgles and flushes, I heard my dad snapping the dolls shut one by one. He moved the box to his room the next morning. I never confronted him about it.   nbsp;  One little detail kept nagging at me, and though I tried to forget about the whole thing, I couldnt get my mind off of it. How had his sister sent him her finger after she passed away? Maybe my grandmother had found the box in the garage one night and left it out for dad without checking its contents, but then, how had the finger gotten inside? I needed to know. Earlier this year, I was watering my parents plants while they were away on vacation, when I saw the box on dads bedside table. I took it home and ordered a DNA testing kit. Along with a few pieces of my dads hair, taken from his comb, I sent a piece of the finger to the lab. Id forgotten all about it until today. Its not like on TV: it can take months to get results. Just so you know, all humans share about 99.5% of their DNA. The remaining 0.5% contains family markers, so to speak. Though there are exceptions, the DNA between siblings usually matches up at around 50%, as opposed to, say, fourth cousins, who match up at 0.20%. Which is to say, when I received the results in the mail today and they came back at a mere 0.09% match, I knew the finger did not belong to his sister.   Last week, I saw a ghost. I was walking home one evening, admiring the Christmas lights hanging in a residential neighborhood, when I spotted a girl standing in a courtyard, holding a weakly lit match between her trembling fingers. She was barely visible, but I could make out the outline of her body, her flowing white dress, and her long dark hair. Judging by her height, and what little I could make of her, I would say she must have been about 9 years of age. Her features were blurred, like looking through a fog-coated car window, which gave her face the impression of being entirely smooth. She was hunched over, as though trying to warm herself up. Now, you would think that I would have been afraid, that I would have shrieked at the top of my lungs and gone running in the other direction, snot and tears flowing freely from the orifices of my face. The thing is, it was not the first time I had seen a ghostly apparition, and I learned over the years that it was best not to meddle or call attention to oneself. I stood there and watched her, neither moving away nor closer, until the flame on her match died out and she disappeared.    nbsp;  The next day, despite the tight deadline under which I was working, my mind kept wandering back to the girl in the courtyard. She reminded me of The Little Match Girl from the old folk tale, though perhaps that was because the holidays were around the corner. As I inputted a few figures in my spreadsheet, my thoughts drifted to the first time I had seen a spirit. I was 7 years old, alone in the playground near my house. I swayed on the swings, imagining I was Spider-man slinging my way through the city. At some point, I got tired and stopped putting effort into moving the swing, yet I maintained the same speed and velocity for several minutes. I eventually turned my head around and saw an old woman pushing my seat every time it came within reach. I was too young to ask questions and enjoyed the free ride, until a rumbling in my belly reminded me I had to go home for supper. Sorry. I need to get off. I told her, my tone polite and respectful. She neither replied, nor stopped pushing me. Thanks mam, but I have to go home. I tried to explain, but she continued. Try as I might, I could not get her attention. I jumped off the swing with the next push and landed skillfully on my feet, turning around so I could thank her properly, but she was gone.   nbsp;   Having spent most of my shift reliving old memories, I decided to stay late to make up for my uncompleted work. The sun had set by the time I got out of the office, and snow spiralled to the ground, glistening like stardust in the streetlights cone-shaped beams. I zipped my coat and tightened my scarf. My breath moistened the fabric and a small forest of icicles appeared over the blue fleece. Out of curiosity, I made my way to the same residential area I had visited the night before, wanting to see if the little girl would appear again. Sure enough, her ghostly figure stood in the yard. I could see her more clearly this time. Not only was she more opaque, but her features were also better defined: I could make out the curb of a nose, slight indents where eye sockets should have been, and folds in her dress. The Little Match Girl sobbed quietly, the sound was soft yet it had an otherworldly quality to it. Although I knew she was the source of the cries, the sound seemed to emerge from all around. Her tiny hands shivered as they clutched the match, and her bare feet dug into the snowy ground. Keeping a safe distance, I observed her while the flame slowly went out, taking her with it.    nbsp;  Exhausted and freezing cold, I slipped into the shower as soon as I got home. I thought about one of my other experiences with the supernatural. I was in the midst of a full teenage rebellion; I had taken to wearing spiky leather bracelets and listening to shitty punk-rock bands. I was through with authority and made damn sure everyone knew: adults were stupid, the system was corrupt, and anarchy ruled. I did not even know what anarchy meant, but I wore its red logo proudly and scrawled it on the bathroom walls, like an idiot. My grades started slipping, and I was forced to stay after school with a tutor. As an ex-member of the student council, I was accustomed to wandering my schools empty hallways at night. I was on my way upstairs to get something from my locker when I heard my name being called in a low, moaning voice. A word of advice: if you ever hear someone whispering your name when you know you are alone, do NOT turn around. I spun on my heels, and what I saw chilled me to the bone. It was Samantha, a classmate who had drowned that summer at her familys cottage. She was blue and her bloated arms stretched out towards me. I screamed and, in my panic, lost my footing. The janitor found me passed out at the foot of the stairs. I spent the rest of the semester in a cast.   nbsp;   Christmas music blared from my co-workers radio the next morning. I groaned and ducked behind my cubicle wall, desperately hoping the thin separators would drown out the noise. Alas, there was no escape from my overzealous compatriots tunes. I am no Grinch: not a single living mortal can handle eight hours of non-stop Christmas hits for an entire month. With every jingle bell, I felt my holiday cheer slowly being sucked out of me. I was so happy when the music stopped, that I failed to realize how late it was. Once I finally saw the clock, I hurriedly grabbed my things and headed out the door, locking up behind me. I walked quickly towards the Little Match Girls house, hoping I was not too late. I was convinced I would see her again. I could hear her sobs all the way down the street this time. I planted myself on the same spot from which I starred the two previous nights, and watched. The flame on her match seemed brighter than ever, and it illuminated her features perfectly. I could see tears rolling down her soft white cheeks. Her ornate lace dress blew gently in the breeze. Her silky hair was tangled like the worlds worst case of bed head. Her lips were pursed in a permanent frown, while her closed eyes squeezed more and more droplets onto her gown. She looked cold, and my heart broke for her. There was nothing I could do but offer her an audience until the light of her match fizzled away.   nbsp;   I made my way back home, buying a pre-cooked chicken and a loaf of bread from the grocery store around the corner. I ate while idly browsing the web. I thought about another strange occurrence in my past. I was in my early 20s, walking across a bridge when I saw a shadow on the ground to my right. I figured someone was walking behind me. When I checked, I realized I was alone. The shadow matched my pace perfectly, but its form was completely different from my own. The sun was setting, and it was just bright enough for shadows to stretch out for meters, but dark enough for the street lights to be on. Since I was alone, I assumed two beams of light had caught me from different angles. When a second shadow appeared on my left, I got a little nervous. I waved my hand, hoping to see the motion repeated by both strange shadows, but to my horror, they did not react. I walked faster, the shadows following suit. A third shadow crept up in front of me, and I jumped into the street, bolting towards the end of the bridge as fast as my feet could take me. I did not stop running until I was off the bridge. I turned around and saw the trio rise from the ground and form a odd, disproportionate humanoid shape. It extended its arm and set its hand against the railing, squeezing it as though to show its might. The thick metal buckled under the pressure. As soon as I had caught my breath, I started running again. I was afraid it would pursue me, but it stayed on the bridge.   nbsp;  After a nights rest, I crawled out of bed and got ready for work. I could feel a flu coming on, but getting the project done was more important than my health. Forehead burning and nose running, I forced my way to the office and slumped down on the computer chair. I did not have the energy to take the long walk home that took me by the Little Match Girls house, so I chose a faster route. Snow crunched and crackled beneath my worn boots as I walked down the street. I was running out of steam and sat on a bench to regain my strength. I looked up at the dark night sky, hearing the distant sound of a girls giggles. This might sound silly, but I saw a shooting star, and it gave me enough pep in my step to finish the journey home. I went straight to bed and thought about the child that had gone missing from my park all those years ago, and how no one had found any trace of him since. I thought about the freshmen that had fallen down the stairs and broken his neck a week after I had fallen in that same stairwell. High school officials claimed he had tripped on a crack in the stairs. Finally, I thought about the young woman and her baby, which had been hit head-on by a car that had slipped on the icy bridge the day after I had been chased by shadows. They had been crushed against the railing, right where the shadow stood watching me. None of these victims knew what I learned over the years: its best not to meddle or call attention to oneself. It never ends well.   nbsp;   Reporters covered the story the next morning on the news. The house where I had seen the Little Match Girl had caught fire and burned down in the evening. No survivors. Yesterday, I saw the vague outline of the Little Match Girl standing outside another house across town. Maybe I should warn the owners, but, as I said, its best not to meddle: I dont want to be the next victim.   Oh man, that last paragraph was pretty much the epitome of creepy. You definitely shouldn't go back to that mall. EVER.   As I read this, I kept thinking to myself "DON'T LOOK INSIDE!", expecting there to be some hideous creature or mega-pervert looking back at you. This was NOT what I expected, and somehow, it is so much more disturbing. I have chills just thinking about it.   I put a few updates at the bottom of the post. I haven't been able to figure out who Ryan is (or was). No Deacon, either. Just...weird stuff going on in my home. Missing objects, weird shadows. I think I've just gotten hyper-sensitized to the weirdness now.   Congrats you guys, well earned. : )   Oh... *Puts his exacto knife away.*   Maybe you're about to become the brand new Shelly. The old one was getting a little too old.   Maybe you're phasing in and out of a parallel universe? Sometimes, you only know because of little things...like a statue facing the wrong way, or a piece of jewellery being made of a different material...and sometimes, it's bigger things like an entire office full of workers disappearing.   Lily's pushing Daisies.   This made me giggle to the point that my cat looked at me like I was crazy.   I would like to submit [Recently Opened Documents](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2mpxkf/recently_opened_documents/) to the contest. Thank you.   Facial features not recognized. chimed a womans monotone voice. I cursed beneath my breath. This laptop had been lying in my apartment for days now, and I still couldnt get it unlocked. My attempts at reinstalling the operating system were met with complete failure. Now, Im no crook, but when I saw this fancy piece of equipment left unguarded on a patio table in some strangers yard a couple of days ago, I couldnt keep my hands from snatching it and dropping it into my backpack. Anyone rich enough to afford a laptop with such advanced security features, and smug enough to leave it unattended, is rich enough to replace it. It was time to take matters into my own hands. But, if only Id known what a huge mistake I was about to make, I would never have taken the laptop in the first place.  It started off innocently enough. Once evening, I returned to the house where I found the laptop and casually glanced through the window from the sidewalk. A beautiful young brunette with a tight yoga body paraded about in the living room. I needed to know her name: I wanted to look her up online so I could get a photo to unlock the laptop. The next morning, I waited a few houses down for her to leave for work. She never even noticed my car tailing hers all the way to a parking lot outside a government agency building. She parked under a maple tree and smiled a beautiful smile that brought butterflies to my stomach. I ducked behind my dashboard as she exited her car and slammed the door shut with an audible THUD. As she made her way to the building, I began to feel a twinge of regret. This was weird, right? Here I was, stalking a perfect stranger so I could break into her laptop. I felt like the scum of the universe. I turned the car around and went home.  That night, I sat in front of the sealed laptop, drumming my fingertips nervously against its cover. I wondered what kind of stuff she had stored on its hardrive. Naked pictures of herself, perhaps? I pushed the damn thing away, but curiosity boiled within me. What was so important that it required this kind of security measure? I groaned and reached into my trusty candy bowl for a handful of goodies. It was an elegant glass bowl Id inherited from my grandmother. It was thick and nearly unbreakable: Id knocked it down many times during my childhood and it didnt have so much as a scratch on it. I poured myself a drink to clear my thoughts, and watched the night slowly drift away.  By the first rays of light, I had convinced myself to try again. This time, I drove to Mrs. Nicebuns workplace and waited near the entrance. I sat down on a bench with a cup of coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other. When she finally showed up, I accidentally spilled my coffee, which made her slow her pace. My eyes darted towards her ID badge. Bingo! Allison Monroe. She took a little detour, gave me a sympathetic smile, and disappeared into the building. I returned home and looked her up online. Once Id found a hi-res photo of her, I brought it up to the laptops camera and attempted to sign in. Facial features not recognized. it said. Damn. A photo wouldnt do the trick.  Social media is a wonderful and terrible thing. Finding Allison on Facebook was easy, and shed brilliantly provided links to her Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest accounts. It wasnt hard to find out Allys likes and dislikes. She went out every Friday night to get drunk with her friends, she took baking classes on Sundays (with little to no success), and she loved taking photos of motherboards. Like, a TON of them. She fancied herself the artist, zooming in real close and applying a variety of filters. To be honest, her work looked pretty neat. She turned used computers into sci-fi-looking cityscapes. I came up with a fairly simple plan: Id approach her Friday night, charm the pants off of her, buy her a bunch of drinks, and point the laptop to her face once she was sufficiently out of it. Turns out, it was even easier than that. By the time I arrived at her favorite pub, she was already three sheets to the wind. I waited for her friends to take a washroom break, quickly pulled the laptop out of my bag, placed it on the bar, and told the drunken girl that we were taking a selfie. Eyes half shut, she lazily made a peace sign with her hands and grinned at the camera. Facial features not recognized. warned the computer, as I snatched it up and made my way towards the door. Crap, crap, crap. Her eyes must have been closed.  The moon was but a small sliver in the sky, and I watched it slowly make its way from rooftop to rooftop until the wee hours of the night. I waited for my little Ally to stagger out of the bar, and offered her a ride. She gleefully accepted and threw herself into the back seat. She probably thought I was a taxi driver. Oh, Ally. Sweet, nave Ally. I chuckled and drove back to my place. There was only one option left. I dragged her barely-conscious body inside and set her comfortably on the couch. I got tape and attempted to stick her eyelids open, but this made her agitated for some reason. She thrashed and screamed and caused a scene. I panicked: what if the neighbors heard?! I instinctively reached for the candy bowl on the living room table, sending Skittles hurling in all directions. They bounced and cascaded onto the floor like a colorful waterfall. In a swift motion, I knocked the bowl against Allys gentle head, intending only to calm her down. Blood gushed out of her skull like lava from an exploding volcano. I backed away in shock, slipped on the candy and fell to the floor. Everything went black.  By the time I came to, Ally was gone. I checked her pulse: her hands were cold and her skin had taken on an eerie blue sheen. Brownish stains of dried blood adorned the side of her head. My breath felt trapped in my throat and I had to swallow hard to get the air flowing into my lungs once more. My fingers stretched out towards her delicate face. I pried her eyelids open and, much to my surprise, they remained that way after I let go. She has such beautiful green eyes, not unlike the color of her precious motherboards. I lifted the laptop, convinced this time that the facial recognition software would be satisfied. Facial features not recognized. it said. Curses. I owed it to Ally to find out what was in there. What if she had other artsy photos to show the world?! It was my DUTY to open that laptop.  A thought crossed my mind, as I sat there desperately looking at my beautiful Allison: what if the facial recognition apparatus had some sort of heat-detection sensor? Yeah, that made sense. How else would it know the difference between a photo and a real person? I had no choice. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, carved her lovely features off and removed her eyeballs carefully with a spoon. It pained me to do so, and the gushing sound almost made me ill. What was once a vibrant young woman now sat lifeless on my couch, her face in my hands like a stack of ham coated in chunky salsa.  I carefully brought Allys face to mine: it was cold, uncomfortable, and hindered my ability to breathe. I left it on for a few minutes, waiting for my body heat to transfer onto her flesh, while I held her eyeballs in my hands. Once I was convinced the face was warm enough, I skillfully peeled the forehead back and slipped the now warm eyes into its sockets, before pushing the skin back in place. I turned towards the laptop in a hurry. Facial features not recognized. it said. DAMN IT! I tossed the darn thing across the room out of frustration. It landed upside-down, and I spotted a label on its underbelly. I crawled over and looked at it. GOD DAMN IT, I am a MORON. Why hadnt I seen the label sooner?! Why hadnt I thought to check every inch of the laptop for clues!? What a horrible mistake! The label stated, in clear black letters: Steve Monroe. Urgh, I was going to have to start from scratch   One. Two. Three. Four. GOOSEBUMPS.   Theres someone outside my front door. Hes been standing there for hours. He knocked once, and then just stood there waiting. Hes at the door right now. I dont know what he wants. Hes not going away. I peeked through the window, but at my angle, I can barely make out a humanoid form. I think he has his face pressed against the peephole because, when I look through it, all I see is a dark beige mass. Im scared. Im so scared.  I was cooking supper when I heard the knock. It startled me to the point that I knocked a can of tomato juice over myself. Since I wasnt expecting any guests, I figured it was a solicitor of some sort. I started cleaning the mess, hoping hed give up and leave on his own. I cant believe the amount of tomato juice that can fit in a single can. My clothes weighed me down and I dragged the red liquid all the way to the bathroom, where I washed up and changed. Sporting a fresh pair of pajamas, I approached the living room window, convinced the front porch would be empty, and peered outside. The man was still at the door. I tapped the window lightly with my hand. I wasnt going to open the door unless I saw who it was first. The man did not react.  A familiar fizzling sound emerged from the kitchen. Oh, great, Id let the water boil over. I sprinted to the stove, trembling hand carefully navigating around foamy water and steam escaping from my pot, and quickly turned down the heat. The water sighed contently and dropped to the middle of its stainless steal nest. I threw fresh linguine into it and watched as they danced around like worms wriggling through the earth. Once the noodles were cooked, I served myself a plate and headed into the dining room. From the table, I watched my front door. Surely, the man had left by now, I thought. No one would wait outside a door for half an hour just to sell a magazine subscription. He had to know I wasnt interested in whatever stupid thing he had to sell. I ate my pasta, still feeling shaken by the creeper outside. No matter how often my wobbly hands dropped the fork, I managed to wolf down my meal. The spaghetti sauce was to die for.  After cleaning the dishes, I peered out the window again. He was still standing there! I went from thinking he was the worlds most annoyingly persistent door-to-door salesman, to realizing that his plans were of a far more sinister nature. Still, he hadnt made an effort to get inside, and I had locked the deadbolt, so I thought itd be okay to take a shower. My false sense of security did not last long. As soon as I got behind the shower curtain, I began to daydream about the man breaking the window and crawling into the bathroom to commit unspeakable atrocities to me. I felt naked. I mean, obviously I was naked because no one showers with his or her clothes onbut I felt naked INSIDE. I needed something to help me feel safe, so I ran to the kitchen, in the buff, and grabbed my sharpest cleaver. I nearly slipped on the way back, but I managed to steady myself. I placed the knife next to the shampoo, and finished showering with renewed confidence.  Clean as a whistle, I took a seat in the living room to watch some TV. The windows were distracting: they felt like giant magnifying glasses pointed directly at me. If I could see outside, then he could see inside. I rushed to flip the blinds shut, and spotted his form outside my door as I reached for the final pulley. This guy was going to kill me. I just knew it. I frantically shut the curtains and sat on my sofa, pulling a blanket over myself. Who could the man be? Why hadnt he knocked a second time? Why hadnt he rung the doorbell? In how many pieces would they find my body? Why hadnt he called out? The rush of fear made it hard to focus on the television screen. I flipped to the news, picturing the reporters solemn face as he explained how my quiet suburban home had been broken into and how I had been brutally maimed, my remains scattered throughout the house. They would call it a tragedy and would mourn the loss of someone so young and so full of promise. The thought brought tears to my eyes.  After an hour of contemplating my own mortality while watching M*A*S*H reruns, I had to use the restroom. I was afraid of leaving the living room because it meant having to walk by the front door. I ducked under the peepholes oppressive gaze and stealthily made my way to the cabinet, retrieving masking tape. I ripped off two pieces, placing one over the peephole and another over a hole in the middle of my door. Now, my assailant would be as blind as I was. I went to the washroom, took care of business, and walked by the door again. My nose caught whiff of a putrid smell: a wrestlers armpits mixed with half-off burrito night farts, and just a touch of rusted iron. How could I have been so careless?! I remembered Id felt a draft under my door a few days earlier and hadnt gotten around to applying sealant. The stranger outside could see me if he leaned down. I rushed to tape the bottom of the door. It was wet, so I had trouble getting the tape to stick, but after applying indiscriminate amounts of the stuff in zig-zaggy patterns, I finally managed to hide the crack.  I spent the rest of the evening nervously Googling kitten pictures. I wanted to get my mind off the man at the door. Anything to keep my brain from running through the horrific death montage. No amount of fluffy, adorable cuteness could penetrate my furiously beating heart. I could almost feel the strangers presence at my door. I know what I am saying is impossible, but it really felt as though I could see the outline of his body pressed against the surface, like a footprint on the snow. There was someone at my door, but it felt like he was inside. Another dozen minutes of absolute terror passed, and I had had enough. I grabbed the gun off the coffee table, tore the masking tape from the hole in the door, and placed the barrel inside. I examined the burnt wood around its circumference carefully. Id have to be careful not to get splinters when I repaired it. I hate splinters almost as much as I hate being brutally mutilated by a stranger at the door. I braced myself, and fired a shot. Theres someone at the door, and I dont think hes alive anymore. I better get a mop to clean up the tomato juice. I think I missed a spot.   How well do you pay attention to your list of recently opened documents? Last night, when tracking down a file I had worked on, I spotted an unfamiliar filename on the list: ryansjournal.docx. Privacy be dammed, I read it. I wish I hadnt. A whole day has gone by, and I still cannot shake the goose bumps: the content wasdisturbing, to say the least. Take a look:      **Entry 1 - July 2nd, 2014:**  *My name is Ryan and Im 11 years old. Im writing this journal for a time capsule Im burying. Hi, older me! Hope you made it as a firefighter!*  *Me and mom moved this week. Theres a lot of boxes everywhere. I dont like it here. Its really small. I miss my big backyard with the pool and all the oak trees. I used to climb them and pretend I was king of the forest. There are no trees here. Just a fence and a bit of grass. I hate it. I dont know anyone here. The worst is that its REALLY creepy at night. The shadows in my room look like theyre about to reach out and grab me. Im too old for a nightlight so I snuck a flashlight under my pillow so mom wont ask questions.*  My intention in moving was simple: shorten my commute to work and lower my bills. I was wasting so much money heating up an entire house, when a two-bedroom apartment did the job. The apartment is in the basement, so it requires less AC in the summer and less heating in the winter. As an added bonus, the place is pitch black at night. The master bedroom in my old house overlooked a street lamp. Not even the blackest of curtains could keep the light from shining in and, as a result, I had trouble falling asleep. I sleep like a baby in this apartment.  **Entry 2  July 16th, 2014:**  *Mom finished unpacking. She must have forgotten a few boxes, because I dont have any toys to play with. I still dont have any friends because mom wont let me go to the park. She said Ill make new friends when school starts. I think shes just too lazy to show me the way to the park. This sucks! I hate it here! I hate HER! Shes the WORST! I wish I had someone to talk to! I want to go home! Every night, the shadows get closer and closer to my bed and I scare them away with my flashlight. Im afraid the batteries will die.*  **Entry 3  July 30th, 2014:**  *Today, I made a new friend!!! His name is Deacon and he lives in my closet behind a super-secret door Im not supposed to tell mom about. Hes really fun. His favorite color is green, just like me! I hope me and Deacon will be friends forever. He likes all the same food as me and plays all the same games! Hes older and a little scary-looking, but I dont mind. Hes fun! He even told me he could protect me from the shadows at night.*  **Entry 4  August 13th, 2014:**  *I asked mom if Deacon could have supper with us tonight, but she ignored me. She was on her computer again, looking at weird symbols all evening. I grabbed an extra plate of food after supper and took it to my room for Deacon. He loved the ground beef but didnt touch the peas. I cant blame him. Peas are gross!*  I work as a Web Developer at a University, and August is our busiest time of the year. Its not unusual for me to have to do a bit of overtime in the weeks leading up to the start of the Fall semester. I suppose HTML code can look a lot like weird symbols to the untrained eye. I can read HTML like you would read a book. Its like my mind automatically renders the tags into their intended format. I suppose to others, it must be as foreign as sheet music is to me: I do not understand it and all I see are a bunch of dots on a half-dozen lines.  **Entry 5  August 27th, 2014:**  *Mom still wont let me invite Deacon for supper, so I have to sneak food to him every night. She keeps telling me Deacon isnt real. She says Im too old to have an imaginary friend. I told her to go suck a turdsicle. She didnt like that. I was sent to my room. Grrr. I hate her. Deacon is real! Hes my best friend! He even crawls into bed with me at night to protect me from the scary shadows in the room. He holds me so tight that I cant move sometimes. He says as long as were together were safe. I believe him. I see the shadows scurrying away and up the wall whenever he crawls over.*  **Entry 6  September 24th, 2014:**  *Sorry I didnt write for a while. I started school and had SO MUCH homework. Mom wont let me on the computer unless Im done. 5th graders get a LOT of homework. By the time Im done, moms on her stupid websites and wont let me have my turn. Why cant we have two computers like a normal family?!!??!?! At least I have Deacon to talk to. Mom doesnt like it when she hears us talk. She says its not healthy to talk to myself. Shes a triple-stupid dumb-shake with a cherry on top! If shed just let him eat with us, shed see hes real.*  A crudely drawn [MS Paint doodle](http://i57.tinypic.com/2n8vcyx.jpg) was included with this entry. On it, I can make out Ryan with a tall, dark figure looming over him, holding his shoulders. The man has long, claw-like fingers, big dark holes for eyes, and a large gaping smiling mouth with sharp fangs. He seems to be looking at my cat, who is cowering in the corner of the room.  **Entry 7  October 8th, 2014:**      *Deacon isnt happy. Mom found his hiding spot. She got rid of all his stuff!!! Hes hiding in the ceiling now. Theres a little crawl space where the air conditioner goes. Hes in there right now. I can hear him grunting. Hes so upset. Mom needs to apologize if she knows whats good for her.*      I did find a little door in the walk-in closet. I opened it up and got a face full of dust. There were a few boxes of trinkets, which I assumed belonged to the apartments previous owners. I tossed them out. Who needs old rags, magazines, and worn shoes? I found the small storage space after hearing skittering noises in the walls. I wasnt sure if mice had gotten in, or if the apartment was crackling from the cold outside. I never dreamed I would find the perfect place to store winter apparel. I cleaned it up and filled it with coats and boots.        **Entry 8  October 22nd, 2014:**  *Deacon couldnt come and protect me last night because mom left my bedroom door open. He said he doesnt want her to see us together. She might make him go away if she saw him and the shadows. I was so scared. I cried myself to sleep. I needed his big strong arms to protect me. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw shadows crawling towards me. They lifted from the floor and made squishy noises like they were made of slime putty. I screamed for my mom but she didnt come. One of the shadows got on the bed and I felt it crawling towards me. Threw my flashlight at it. It must have landed on the switch, because it lit up and the shadows disappeared under the bed.*  I remember keeping the door open because the room smelled awful and desperately needed to be aired out. I always keep the door shut so at least one room is devoid of cat fur. I would have opened the window instead of the door, but it has been stuck since the move and no amount of force has managed to pry it loose. I had no choice but to leave the door open all day and overnight. I was pleasantly surprised that the cat did not even try to step foot inside.  **Entry 9  November 5th, 2014:**  *Mom has been keeping my door open. Deacon is getting really angry with her. He says hes going to have to deal with her soon. I warned her Deacon was getting mad, but shes still insisting Deacon isnt real. Stupid stupid stupid. Deacon is watching.*  That entry is the last one in the journal. If that wasnt creepy enoughheres the really weird thing: Im single and I live alone with my cat. I do not nor have I ever- had a child. I dont know what to say: maybe its a bad prank, but I checked the file properties and it was created in July and last updated on November 5th. I havent had houseguests since late October. My computer is not synched up to any device, nor does it have the capability to do so.  I noticed the entries are typically written every other Wednesday, so I am curious to see if there will be a new one tomorrow. If there is, I will give you guys an update.  **Update (November 19th, 2014):** I barely slept last night. I decided to check the journal before I went to work. I dont even know what to say. To say that I am horrified is putting it lightly. Here is the entry:  **Entry 10  November 19th, 2014:**  *Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for youunless the shadows get you first.*  I think I am going to stay at a motel tonight.  **Update (November 24th, 2014):** I just wanted to give you guys an update. I think I am freaking myself out over nothing. Ever since I read the journal, I keep seeing things move around in the dead of night. Around 3:00 a.m. this morning, I got up to use the restroom and saw my cat standing in the kitchen. He walked towards his food bowl and I heard a familiar crunching sound. I left him alone and went back to bed. As I slipped under the covers, my foot grazed my cat's head and he gave me an insulted, half-asleep meowl. There's no way he ran past me from the kitchen into my room: the hallway is too narrow. I would have seen or felt him. I was probably just sleep-deprived and imagined seeing him in the kitchen.  People asked to see the drawing I found in Ryan's journal. It has been uploaded: [Ryan's Drawing](http://i57.tinypic.com/2n8vcyx.jpg)   I recommend making asking them to make a deal. Have you ever wanted to be famous? Now's the time to promise your first unborn son (or daughter) for your 15 minutes of fame! : ) Do not try to get your original child back. Allowing themselves to become possessed so easily is a sign of weakness.   You nearly made me spit out my water! XD   Actually, I do. My college buddy used to work at Canadian Tire. Next time he's in town, I'll ask him to check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!   I found the one I was talking about: it belonged to James Dean. If you look it up, the name of the car was 'Little Bastard'. Other people bought parts from that car and, well, it did not end well.  As for my parts, I have absolutely no idea how to check. I'm not a big driver. I just use my car to do groceries. My mechanical knowledge extends to noticing the oil change sticker expiration date and driving the  car to a garage.   At my dentist, there are two other people who share my name, one of which has the same date of birth as me. I always have to give the clerk my full address when booking appointments because of it. You're making me wonder if we all have future selves out there, trying to come into contact with us.   I think I know what you're talking about. The race car that some dude died in, and then its pieces wound up in other cars and it all of those cars ended up in really bad accidents? Maybe my car's not haunted. Maybe it's one of its replacement parts. Haunted muffler?   xD; It's not the most badass and newest of cars, but it gets the job done.  Before you ask, it plays CDs, not cassette tapes.   I'm due for a new car soon anyway. Spent so much cash on repairs this past year. The muffler, the battery, the engine. X_x;   Hey guys. I have an honest-to-goodness question for yall. Can cars become haunted? Ive seen some really weird stuff in my car. This isnt a scary story, for the record: this is 100% for real, and it has been happening for the past couple of years.  I drive a 10-year-old red Toyota Corolla (a bitchin color, if I do say so myself). Im its second owner, the first owners being my parents. I bought it off of them last year when they retired and decided to ditch their house and car in favor of their truck and trailer. Point being: this isnt some used, refurbished car I got off of Craigslist after it killed a bunch of innocent kids in a horrible traffic incident. I mean, it has had a few bumps and bruises along the way. My sister once told us that car insurance companies charge higher rates for red cars because they tend to be involved in traffic accidents more often. For the record, this is not true. The color of your car does not affect insurance rates. Despite the fact that my sisters claim was wrong, I cant deny that the car has gotten in a lot of minor accidents, compared to the other cars my parents drove over the years. Accident/bump/scrape count on all other cars combined over the course of about 20 years: 0. Accident/bump/scrape count on the Corolla: about 5.  Itd be easy to blame the accidents on the fact that the Corolla was driven by two new drivers (my sister and I), as well as my parentsbut my sister never hit anything and I only scratched it once. I felt absolutely awful about it, though. It was one of my first times taking it out and I was backing out of a grocery store parking lot. My bumper scraped another cars bumper. Juuuust enough for a little dirt to transfer from one car to the other. I freaked out and waited for the cars drivers. They just laughed, thanked me for waiting, and left without taking down my information. It was so small and insignificant, but to this day I park at the far end of parking lots and walk the rest of the way. Every other incident occurred while one of my parents was behind the wheel. Mom once backed up into a cement post, my dad got rear-ended by a truck and ended up hitting one of those trailer balls on the car in front of him (theres still a hole-shaped mark in our front bumper, makes it easy to spot my car!), and at some point someone crashed into the side of the vehicle. There are also unexplained scratches on the car. Like, someone TRYING to key it but not using an instrument sharp enough to do the trick. No injuries, no deaths. Definitely nothing that qualifies as a reason for a car to be haunted.  I remember one day my dad, sister, and I were driving to the library. I saw an old man get on the road as we were passing. My eyes widened and my heart came to a halt when I realized my father was not stopping the car. I nearly shouted, fully expecting to hear a THUD at any moment. Nothing happened. I looked back but there was no one on the street. Didnt you see that guy? I asked my father and sister. Neither of them had a clue what I was talking about. Ghost pedestrian? Who the fuck knows.  What really spooks me is what Ive been seeing IN the car since then. Back in our old house, the kitchen overlooked a living room with large bay windows pointed straight at the driveway. Every now and then, Id turn around and see someones figure in the drivers seat. Im not talking about a creepy shadow in the night, either. I meanI was doing the dishes after making lunch and thered be a silhouette in there. It didnt disappear when I blinked. Id usually get distracted for a moment and look again, only to find the car was empty. This happened ALL the time. At least twice a month. One night, I was driving back home and I looked in the rearview mirror. Yknow in those horror movies when you see a figure in the mirror? Holy shit, it happened. I very VERY clearly saw a man sitting in the back seat. I turned my head but of course there was nothing there.  I recently moved and the car cannot be seen from any of my windows. I see the car when I get out of the bus and when I take out the trash. When I do, often times, Ill see a figure in there. Heck, just last week I went to the grocery store and, on my way back to the car, I got this weird feeling. I looked up and there was someone in the drivers seat. It doesnt matter what angle the cars in, either. Ive seen the silhouette straight-on, from the back, and from the side. So what do you think? Can cars become haunted? Is MY car haunted? How the heck does a car even get haunted???  Update (Nov 15th 2014): I spotted a footprint facing my car in a patch of snow outside this morning. I know it's not mine: I only take the car out on weekends to run errands. Haven't been near it since last Saturday. Maybe one of the neighbours got nosy.   Brilliantly written. I love the slow descent into instability!   Do you think its still alive?! shrieked Courtney, mere seconds after impact. She regained control of the car and came to a complete stop. I looked out the window, towards a dark mass spread out on the road. IuhI dont know. I replied, gathering myself. My neck felt stiff from the whiplash caused by her sudden stop. Courtney hid her face against the steering wheel. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god! she groaned. Babe, relax. Its not the first time youve hit something, and it probably wont be the last. Remember when you backed up over my foot? I replied cheerfully, trying to lighten her spirits. OH MY GOD, STEPHEN. When are you going to let that GO!? she shouted at me, jabbing me sharply in the side with her elbow. There were times when Courtney praised my sense of humor. This was not one of those times.  It happened in early November several years ago. It was the first snow of the season and we were caught off guard, having not changed to our winter tires on yet. The road was slippery, but Courtney was doing a good job navigating the winding roads back from our campground, where we had spent our anniversary. It had been a nice, clothing-optional weekend, away from the hustle and bustle of our suburban lives. We were driving through a heavily forested area when we spotted something up ahead. We barely had time to register those big doe eyes, before we were already on top of it. Courtney tried to stop, but the tires slipped on a patch of slush and caught the poor thing with the corner of the car. I guess reindeers arent the only woodland creatures that can fly!   Maaaan, Bambis going to have a pretty shitty family reunion. I chirped playfully. I felt another jab from Courtneys adamantium elbows. STOP FUCKING AROUND AND GO CHECK ON IT! she screamed. I tried to tell her it was best to call the authorities. Approaching a wounded animal is never a good idea. I could picture myself getting kicked by the thing. My ribs had gotten enough abuse for one night, thank you very much. Youd be surprised how hard someone as small as Courtney can ram an elbow into you. She shoved a flashlight in my hand and pointed out the window. It might still be alive! Go help it! she insisted. I sighed and relented.  I stepped out of the car and carefully made my way around, checking for damage. The headlights were still functioning, and the impact had only caused a reasonably small bump. Ive seen pictures of cars nearly totalled after hitting a deer. I figured we got really lucky. Satisfied with my inspection, I turned around to check out the deer, but I slipped on some ice and disappeared from view. Courtney rolled down her window and shouted: ARE YOU OKAY!? Never missing an opportunity to be an insufferable asshole, I started screaming my ass off. ITS GOT ME!! OH GOD ITS GOD ME!! IT HAS FANGS!!! I shouted, smacking my hand against the car door. I started laughing hysterically and pulled myself back to my feet. Courtney had the look on her face. If youve ever had a girlfriend, you know exactly what Im talking about. I threw my hands into the air and backed away from the car. I know, I know: stop being an asshole, check on the deer. I said, before she had the chance to scold me.  I approached the creature cautiously and slowly. I remember being really surprised by how little blood I saw. Having never hit anything more sentient than a trash can, I assumed there would be a fountain of blood gushing out or something. After another few steps, the flashlight died. Its kind of cool how, during the darkest time of the year, the ground gets covered in a substance that reflects even the smallest of light. The moonlit snow provided enough light to forget about the extra batteries I had in the trunk. DO YOU THINK ITS STILL ALIVE!? Courtney shouted from the car. I sighed and rolled my eyes: Jesus Christ, Court. Give me a fuckin minute. I barked back. The cold was getting me grumpy. I rubbed my unprotected hands together and watched my breath escape my lips and dissipate into the air.  The creature wasnt moving. At least, not from what I could tell. From a distance, I could see weird streaks across its body. With every step I took, I got the feeling something wasnt right with it. Its front legs lay completely flat on the ground as though devoid of bones while its hind legs looked bloated. I finally reached it and knelt down. Those werent marks on its flesh: they were stitches. Courtney waited silently, providing me with no sound but that of the engine calmly purring away. I secretly wished she would beckon me back to the car. I hesitantly reached for the does head and turned it lightly. I nearly pissed myself. Its eyes were open and looking straight at me. I was so spooked that I dropped the head. It made a strange clunking sound when it hit the concrete. I realized in that moment that the eyes werent real. They were fucking glass eyes.  I wanted to run the fuck back to the car, but curiosity got the better of me. As though in a trance, I traced my hands along the many stitches. It became clear, judging by the variety of colors on the does body, that I was looking at more than one animal crudely sewn together. I shuffled to the other side of the creature and actually screamed, falling on my ass. It was a man. A FUCKING MAN. He was sticking out of the Frankenbambi, wearing it like some sick ass costume. From what I could see, he appeared to be completely nude. Moonlight reflected off of something near his left hand: it was a sharp-looking hunting knife. The fingers of his right hand were still tightly clutched around a handgun. The mans blood slowly soaked into the suit hed made himself. Stomach twisting, I bolted back towards the car and got into the passengers seat. I knew. He wasnt some weird pervert. He wasnt the worlds weirdest method actor. He wasnt trying to blend in with the deer. He meant to stop us on the road. I just knew. I just fucking knew. He meant to stop us and to kill usor worse.  Courtney shook me, Sowas it still alive? she asked me, apparently ignoring the absolute horror in my eyes. She seemed to have cheered up at least. I shook my head slowly, placing a hand on my chest. no. Drive. Just drive. I told her. She let out a little whimper, and then drove off. I didnt want to tell her what I saw. Some things are better left unsaid. The next day, I called the authorities to let them know we saw a dead deer on the road. I figured theyd think I was just an oblivious Good Samaritan reporting a road hazard. They bought it. Until now, Ive never told anyone the truth about the doe. What really creeps me out is that there were no reports of mysterious deaths in the media. When I think back to that night, Imnot entirely surebutI looked back in the rear-view mirror as we drove offand I think I saw it move. He might still be out there   Eeeeeeeeee, way to send a chill down my spine! Oh, crazy 'ol aunt Ruth.   Y'know what? If I get my hands on a tank, I'll go and let ya'll know how it went.   One had the flu and the other said she didn't have a ride. They bail on me ALL the time, so I'm not surprised.   Most of you would probably agree that high school isnt nearly as awesome as TV shows make it out to be. These are the best years of your life! parents often say. What a load of crock. Its no surprise, then, that when I received an invitation to attend my 10-year high school reunion, my reaction wasnt so much YAY!!!, but rather, Yeaaaah, no. I crumbled up the invitation into a neat little ball, which I promptly threw into my overflowing recycling bin. I had been bullied a lot in high school, and the last thing I wanted was to talk to those people again. It was only after relentless nagging from my friends that I reluctantly agreed to go. I wish I hadnt. The night of my 10-year highschool reunion was the weirdest and scariest of my life.   I sat in the parking lot, waiting for my overzealous friends to show up. They promised me we didnt have to socialize, and that the three of us would just hang out all night and check things out. I looked at my phone. They were late, and had not left me any messages. I shifted about in my seat, tugging at my extremely uncomfortable dress. I had been forced to buy it for the reunion, which just added to my frustration. Ive never been at ease in a dress. Wearing one just feels unnatural to me, like Im galloping around in a clown outfit. I sent my friends a text message, while idly eyeing the banner above the main doors. Welcome Class of 2000!!! it said, in big, bold letters. I could hear music blaring from the agora. It started to get a little chilly, so I headed into the school. My friends had not replied.   Annoyed and wanting to go home, I grabbed my nametag off the table and pinned it to my dress strap. I followed the horrendous sound of techno music and found my way into the cafeteria, which opened up to our schools large agora. On the stage, huge speakers throbbed and vomited the sorry excuse for music into a dancing crowd. There were oceans of balloons and streamers hanging from the ceiling. I glanced towards the table of refreshments. A group of at least thirty people stood in front of it, obscuring my view of the punch bowl. There was something off about the whole scene, but I couldnt quite put my finger on it.   I scanned the room and realized something: I didnt know most of these people. At first, I figured they were my classmates significant others, but upon further inspection, I realized they outnumbered the familiar faces 3 to 1. I checked my phone again. Neither of my friends had contacted me. Figures, they bailed on meAGAIN. I was fumbling, trying to get my phone back into the cheap purse I had bought for the occasion, when someone bumped into me. I recognized her immediately, and my stomach dropped. It was Marie-Claude, my main tormentor. I was sure her dead-beat ass wouldnt show up here. I was wrong. She gave me a weird look and spoke: Hi. Its nice to see you again she began, then paused to look at my name tag, Caroline. she finished. I forced a smile and nodded: Yeah, uh. You too. I answered, feeling nauseous. This skank tortured me for five years, and her cordial attitude didnt sit well with me. I wasnt that surprised that she forgot my name: I couldnt recall the name of most of my classmates. I remembered their faces, though, so theres that. I excused myself and walked off.   In a quick pace, I walked towards the refreshments. People were still swarming around it like fruit flies on a rotten apple. Strange thing is, I could have sworn it was the exact same people as before. One of the many strangers roaming the cafeteria approached me. Hi. Its nice to see you againCaroline. he said, using the exact same tone and inflection that Marie-Claude had used earlier, and checking my name tag just like she had done. I dont think I know you I replied, taking a step away. His vacant stare suggested hed had too much to drink. I turned on my heels and walked right into another stranger. Hi. Its nice to see you againCaroline. she said as well. By then, I was thoroughly crept out. Things were getting too weird for comfort. I scurried off to the side, trying to gather myself, but everyone I came across said the exact same thing. Was this some kind of elaborate prank?   Techno music continued to play non-stop. I stared at my cell phone, pretending I was doing something so I could avoid having to socialize further. It took me a good ten minutes to look up again. It wasnt my imagination: the group around the punch bowl hadnt budged. I slowly shifted my gaze towards the agora to get a better look at the dancers. Upon closer inspection, I realized they werent so much dancing as they were thrashing about, repeating the same motion over and over again, like moths banging themselves against a window to get to the light inside. Have you ever looked at the audience in sport videogames? To give the illusion of a living crowd, the audience is given a set of 2-3 reoccurring moves, which they randomly cycle through. Thats exactly what the dancers looked like to me. My focus then changed to the music. I may be a little bias here, because I dont like techno, but I could have sworn the song hadnt changed since my arrival. It was just looping the same noises with frustrating repetition. It was giving me one hell of a headache.   I walked into the washroom, feeling an immediate sense of relief. The thick concrete wall shielded me from the assaulting music outside. I smiled as I spotted the sink: it protruded from the wall in a large semi-circle, around which you could fit at least five people. A step pedal underneath allowed the user to activate two dozen small streams of water. I always liked this sink. It was user-friendly and reminded me of a fountain. I pushed down on the pedal and splashed water onto my face. So refreshing. It was then that I heard the bathroom door slowly squeaking open. I instinctively retracted into one of the stalls and locked it. I remembered this stall. The crack on the wall, the chip in the floor tile, the profanities carved into the separators. I had spent almost all my breaks hiding in that very stall. Technically, there was no reason to hide now. Someone wanted to use the washroomnothing weird there. For some reason; however, I felt an enormous amount of dread. I could hear the girls footsteps as she entered the room. I knoooow youre heeereeeee. she uttered, in a sing-song voice. My jaw dropped and I nearly screamed. I slapped my hands to my mouth to keep myself silent. The skin of my arms formed a mountain range for the microbes living on them. I held my breath, slowly climbed onto the toilet seat, and crouched. My stupid dress made it hard to stay balanced atop the porcelain throne, so I used an arm to steady myself and hoped that I would go undetected. I didnt want her to find me. I didnt know what would happen if she did. I saw her through the cracks in the stalls door. She was leaning down, trying to find my feet. My heart thumped heard. I hoped she couldnt hear it beating. Shit, shit, shit. After a few moments, she turned around and headed back to the party. I finally exhaled and shakily planted my feet back on the floor.   I waited a couple of minutes and then snuck out through washrooms other door. I was half-expecting her to be standing outside, but was relieved when I walked out to an empty hallway. I headed towards the agora. I was sure now: the music hadnt changed. Same people at the refreshment table. Same weird dancing. Just when I thought things couldnt get any scarier, shit got real. The dancing stopped. Everyones heads twisted slowly and mechanically towards me, in unison. They were wearing eerie, crooked smiles. My stomach dropped and my heart nearly stopped. I turned to the cafeteria, and the punchbowl crowd starred at me with the same unearthly grin and vacant eyes. Shit, Id had enough. I ran out of there like a bat out of hell, my legs spreading out so far that my dress ripped. I didnt stop until I reached my car, and then I sped home, going right through a red light. Honestly, I think I would have been relieved if cops had caught me, because at least then I could tell someone to go check out the high school.   Hands trembling, I opened the door to my apartment and locked it behind me, ripping the dress from my sweaty body. I could barely catch my breath. Again, I wondered if it was some kind of horrible prank. Maybe all my bullies had gotten together for one final hoorah? Nothere were too many people involved. Too many moving parts. NO ONE would go through THAT much trouble to freak out someone they hadnt seen or spoken to in 10 years, right? God damn, it was scary as shit. I still have nightmares about that night. If it was a prank, mission fucking accomplished. Its been almost 5 years and I still get rattled just thinking about it.   Today, in the mail, I received a Save The Date! for the 15-year reunion coming up this spring. Oh hell no. You better believe I ripped that bitch up. I am NOT going, and no amount of nagging from my friends will convince me otherwise.   Thanks, I'm glad you liked it. : )  It was my bad. Suspension of disbelief and all that. Haunted, talking walls are unfortunately not believable.   Oh, goodness. This was absolutely wonderful. Cudos to you!   They found the body. It was real.   Last night, I took my friend Todd out to a midnight showing of Nightmare on Elm Street at the theatre. Todd had been bummed out after spraining his ankle just in time to miss the annual 10k Halloween Zombie marathon. Hed been training for months and had prepared an awesome costume. He even bought finger-shaped gummy candy to shove into his mouth during the run. You know, for realism. He kept joking that hed eat the other marathon runners if he ran out of candy. I argued that his constant limping would actually make his costume more realistic, and that he should go anyways, but he refused, claiming that he wanted to avoid irritating the injury. Todd had always had a competitive streak. When we were younger, he would race me to the swing sets, jump on the couch to distract me while we were playing Mario Kart, and drag me kicking and screaming off of our makeshift wrestling ring made out of sofa pillows. Though Todd wouldnt admit it, I knew he was sitting the marathon out to avoid being the last one to cross the finish line.   Bellies weighed down with two tons of popcorn and Halloween chocolate, we started our slow walk home. Mr. Tough-guy acted like he was fine, but I saw him wincing every time his right foot made contact with the ground. Hey. I said, breaking the silence that had followed us since the theatre, I know a shortcut to your placeif youre not too chicken shit to take it. I proposed. Todd puffed his chest out and chuckled loudly: Youre on, dog-breath. Dont come cryin to me like a little wuss if you get scared. he replied, looking quite proud of his comeback. Adulthood had made us wiser, but certainly not more mature. I turned a corner and lead Todd down the shortcut I had only taken a couple of times before. A cold wind blew through the deserted street. Trick-or-treaters had long since returned home and fallen into diabetic comas from all the sugar. My Halloween coma was going to start the next day, once I bought leftover candy from the store for a fraction of the cost.   I grinned as we passed a parked car. What the heck. I said. Todd quirked a brow and turned his head towards me. What? he replied, confused. The license plate. I answered, motioning to the car. It had the typical three-digit, three-letter format, and its three letters read W-T-H. Its a game. You have to make words or acronyms out of the letters. I explained. Todd seemed intrigued. He glanced at another car. OK. I think I got it. So, like, over thereDBT. To Be Determined, if youre dyslexic! he said. A chuckle escaped my lips. I gave him a thumbs-up, I like that. OK, lets seeover there, weve got SPK: Spooky? I continued. We both started laughing when we spotted one that read SMB. We kept this up for a good ten minutes, listing out words and acronyms for every car we spotted. We got stumped when we came across XLS, until Todd proudly claimed it was Excels file format. Shit, I should have taught him this game sooner.   We turned another corner, only to come face-to-face with a roadblock. Construction crews all over the city were struggling to finish their work before the freeze. Travel had gotten difficult for pedestrians. To get to work that morning, I had to take FIVE freaking detours. Fortunately, I spotted a bike path through a small forest on our left. I had a vague recollection of seeing a path near Todds house, so I figured wed get there eventually if we took it. I didnt have the heart to tell Todd we had to double-back and make him walk on that ankle of his, so I trudged onward, acting like I meant for us to go there. I spotted an unmarked black van just outside the entrance, and nudged Todd to look at it: Check out surveillance van #6. You didnt tell me the FBI was watching your neighborhood! I joked. He stuck his tongue out at me and replied: Theyre here to monitor YOU, bud. After a good laugh, we wandered into the path.   We were surrounded by trees, which were being eaten away slowly by the frigid autumn air. Small clusters of brown and yellow leafs still clutched to the menacing-looking branches above us. In the darkness of the night, they looked like hundreds of bats waiting to descend onto us. Thats when we saw him: a hooded man standing no less than 20 meters in front of us, a shovel in one hand and a bulky pillowcase in the other. He seemed to have come out of nowhere. At first, I mistook him for a lost trick-or-treater, but I soon realized he was far too old and what I thought was a bag full of candy had an eerie shape and dripped an unknown liquid onto the leaf-covered ground beneath it. For a moment, time seemed suspended. Neither Todd, the stranger, nor I made a single move. If not for the thrashing sensation of my heart beating against my chest, I would have thought we were in a movie that someone had paused. My eyes slowly trailed towards a pile of dirt just next to the gravel road, and then to the large hole in its shadow. My mind was racing. Every inch of me wanted to run. There was something so unnatural about the scene. It was as though the air itself had become tangible and heavy. So very heavy. Todd looked as white as a ghost. I think he was coming to the same conclusion as me, though neither one of us dared say it out loud. The hooded figure, covered in dirt, suddenly dropped the pillowcase. It hit the ground with an unnerving THUD. Something rolled out of it. I couldnt make out what it was at first. It was furry and damp. As it continued to roll, I realized what I was looking at: a head. Holy fucking shit. It was a womans head. Her lightless eyes lay open, starring right into my soul. A length of her spine dangled from what was left of her neck. Her hair was soaked in blood and flesh had gotten tangled into her locks. Adrenaline surged through my veins. We had to run. I looked at Todd, hoping to see the face of a man ready to escape. Instead, I saw a scared boy frozen in place. We couldnt stay there. We were going to get killed if we didnt run. A shameful thought crossed my mind, and even now I struggle to admit it: I thought of leaving Todd behind. He was in no condition to run. He would only slow me down. Maybe, just maybe, if I left him there, Id survive. My body trembled violently. The adrenaline was making it hard to decide between fight and flight. The stranger made the decision for me. Shovel in-hand, he bolted towards us.   I grabbed Todd violently by the arm: SHIT, TODD, RUN!! I screamed, hoping to all hope that I could pull him out of his stupor. I didnt care how badly his ankle hurt. I yanked him back and he finally responded. OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT! screamed Todd. We started running back down the way we came. Todd was too slow, and the crazed, decapitating madman gained on us. To make matters worse, he waslaughing? I could picture Todd and I getting brutally cut up into pieces by a chainsaw as this guy laughed and laughed over our mangled remains. ITS A PRANK! howled the man behind us. He dropped the shovel and waved his arms in the air, Its for Youtube! he screamed louder. Todd and I slowed down. My cheeks flushed red as we came to a stop. I cupped my hands to my knees and inhaled deeply. W-what? I mumbled. The stranger laughed louder and pulled down his hood. He was a fairly normal-looking Caucasian male in his thirties. He pointed towards the wooded area. Were filming a Halloween prank. Oh man, you should have seen your faces. he said. My head was spinning, playing catch-up quite inefficiently. Todd began laughing hard: Shit, oh my GOSH! You got us GOOD, man. he replied, heaving a sigh of relief. I was still too rattled to comment. I genuinely thought I was going to dieall for a stupid Youtube video.   It took me a few minutes to compose myself. The prankster introduced himself with his Youtube handle, which I regrettably cannot remember. He asked for permission to use our reactions, and Todd enthusiastically agreed, while I gave a nonchalant, consensual wave. He smiled broadly, Great, were going to need you to sign a consent form. I didnt print enough, so Ill just mail it to you guys. Where do you live? he asked, in a friendly tone. Todd answered immediately. I wasnt quite as eager: Im from out of townIm staying over at his place. I lied. Todd understood. Ive never been big on sharing personal information with strangers. I usually glare and refuse to give out my postal code to cashiers when they ask me. Why the fuck do they need that information, anyways? Im buying something from their stupid store and I just want to go home. Stop asking. In any case, the stranger jotted down Todds address, and we were left to our own devices.   We continued down the bike path and stopped near the hole. Todd playfully prodded the severed head with his fingertips. Hahaha. Cool. It feels so real. he told me. I refused to touch the prop. The rest of the way, Todd chirped and laughed about how we were going to be Youtube stars, teasing me about how frightened I looked earlier. I, on the other hand, couldnt shake the feeling that something was wrong, and added very little to the conversation. The prankster kept saying we, and motioning to the trees, as though someone was filming in there. We spoke with the guy for a good twenty minutes but his buddy never came out. I never actually saw the camera, nor did I feel another persons presence there with us. I shrugged it off as nerves. Todd and I parted ways and I headed home, feeling silly about how freaking scared I was. It took me a while to fall asleep, but eventually exhaustion won out.   This morning, I woke up, turned on the TV, and started making breakfast. Just as I began to butter my toast, the screen turned red and BREAKING NEWS scrolled on the bottom of the frame. Police had unearthed the severed remains of a woman in a shallow grave on the bike path. Her torso and legs were found in an unmarked van not far away, along with an unidentified mans arm. Oh shit. Since then, Ive been ringing Todd up on the phone. Hes not answering. Ive texted him. Ive emailed him. I made a stupid Twitter account so I could tweet him. No answer. Why isnt Todd answering!?   My name is Nathan, and I am being held against my will.  I dont know how long Ive been here, but it feels like months. My prison is dark and I cannot see anything. From time to time, I hear sounds from the outside world. They are distorted and muffled, but I can make out my captors voices just enough to notice an eerily gleeful tone. The distant sounds of music also make their way into my ears. My captors play classical music all the time. Classical motherfucking music. I cant stand to hear it. Im trapped here and theyre forcing me to listen to fucking Mozart. I want to go home to my wife and daughter. Will I ever see them again? I smash my arms and legs against the walls of my cell; they are met with a spongy surface coated in nauseatingly squishy mucus. I guess not being able to see has its advantages. Im terrified of knowing what these walls are made of.  The last thing I remember before waking up is going to a take-out restaurant to pick up a meal for my family. My wife asked me to have it delivered since it was raining so hard, but I insisted on going. The food is warmer when I go get it myself. Delivery boys always seem to stop by our house at the end of their route, and I didnt feel like having another lukewarm meal. I grabbed my keys and ran out the door, jokingly promising Id be back home in time for supper. After picking up our meal, I headed back towards my house. The rain wasnt letting up at all. My wipers could barely handle the load. I knew Id be home soon so I kept going at the same speed. It was a terrible mistake. I watched as a car on the opposing lane flew through a puddle and rammed me straight off the road. Clutching the steering wheel tightly, I tried to regain control of my vehicle. The image of the tree I hit is still burned into my retinas. I cannot recall anything after that.  Ive been in this cell for so long, I barely remember how to talk. Im so lonely. My little Sophia will be turning 7 soon. Orhas she already turned 7? Its hard to tell time anymore. I used to count the days, but after they turned into months, I lost track. I want to go home. I want to hold my wife and kids in my arms and tell them I love them. Im not a perfect man by any means, but what did I ever do to deserve this? What did my FAMILY ever do to deserve this? I want to sit around our old kitchen table, with its crayon stains and chipped corners. As my thoughts continue to drift, I suddenly realize its getting harder to breathe. Theres something around my neck. My emaciated arms reach up to try and pull it off, but I havent the strength to do so. Maybe its better this way. My family must have moved on by now. I welcome the sweet relief of death.   With freedom at my fingertips, I feel a large hand reaching for me and pulling me out of my prison. NO! You son of a bitch! I was ready to die, damn it! Its too bright to see anything, so I keep my eyes closed. I can barely breathe. I cant move at all. I feel the hand slapping me firmly on the back, dislodging a chunk of mucus from my throat. I must have swallowed it when he was pulling me out. I cry out for my family. I scream and scream, begging for them to take me home. They dont listen to me. I hear them laughing. The man holding me speaks out: Its a boy! he says. No shit, Sherlock. What the fuck did you expect?! Did you think my genitals would shrivel off while you kept me locked up!? I continue to scream and thrash about in a desperate attempt to free myself. Nothing works. Fucking shit. I must be in hell.  --------- Ive been out of my spongy cell for a few months now. It was hard for my eyes to adjust to the light. I must have been in captivity for longer than I thought. My captors pretend not to understand when I scream at them. The dark cell has been traded in for a more traditional prison made of metal bars. I tried escaping many times, but Ive always been caught. I think my captors are filming me. Those sick sons of bitches. They laugh and taunt me, jiggling my prisons keys just outside my reach. They make fun of my broken body. They take such pleasure in watching me trying to crawl away whenever they take me out of my cell, only to place me back where I started. Their cruelty knows no bounds. They dont even allow me the dignity of using the bathroom on my own. Its just as wellif they treat me like an animal, then I will act like an animal. I find great pleasure in retaliating against them by urinating on them when ever they try to shame me. I feel no shame anymore. I only feel the burning desire for revenge. When they feed me their poisonous food, I toss it back to them and try my hardest to throw up on them. I make a game out of trying to get it into their mouths. I know now that I will never be free, but I sure as fuck wont go down without a fight. I will spend every damn day of this miserable life trying to inflict onto them the same hell theyve inflicted onto me. I wait at night for them to go to bed, and then I scream at the top of my lungs. I enjoy causing them sleep deprivation. Its just a little solace in my otherwise horrid experience.  Sophia, my darling daughter. If you can hear meplease know that I love you. Cher, my beautiful wife, Im sorry I didnt take your advice. I should have just had the meal delivered. I hope you know how much I miss and adore you both. Please know that I am here against my will. I would do anything to be in your arms again.  I love you.   - Nathan  	77

 Great week for me!  Games I've played for the first time:  **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**: We played case #1 and we all had a good time. Truly an unique experience, highly recommend if you enjoy detective stories.  **Myrmes**: Solid worker placement game. I heard it could be brutal but nobody played aggressively in my game. The slight concern for me is the replayability of the game.  **Istanbul**: Love the efficiency aspect of the game. As a light (around 1 hour) strategy game it is probably one of the best out there. Could easily see expansions coming out.  **Blood bowl: Team Manager the Card Game**: Not really my type of game as it was quite confrontational but everyone did seem to enjoy it.  Games that I've played before: **Machi Koro**, **Caverna**, **Terra Mystica**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Fresco**   This list is probably what you are looking for: Rahdo's top 10 worker placement games.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_THM0sLSfo  These are basically non-standard worker placement games.   For example:   In **Euphoria**, it takes an entire turn to retrieve your workers. However, places are never fully blocked, when you go into a space with someone else's worker, you bump them off and so they retrieve that worker back for free.  In **Keyflower**, workers act as a currency to bid for new buildings.  In **Fresco**, you assign your workers simultaneously and then reveal. Therefore you have to guess or double-guess where other people want to go.  I would recommend **Manhattan Project** as well, where you could put all your workers in buildings you have bought in one go, and also you could access other people's buildings by using the espionage action.   A mediocre week for me.  Games I have played for the first time:  **Biblios**: I liked the card drafting and push your luck elements a lot. Instantly became my favourite filler.  **Battlestar Galactica**: I understood its charm but it did not click with me. Indecisive players and constant rules clarification (it was a seven player game with 3 newbies, and we played with expansions) led to a 5 hour drag. I think once is enough for me.  **Discworld: Ankh-morpork**: Decent fast-playing game. I liked the asymmetric victory conditions.  **Bling bling gemstone**: Ridiculously stupid sounding game which was actually fun after a few drinks.  Games that I've played before:  **Caverna**, **Manhattan project**, **Russian Railroads**,**Lords of waterdeep x2**, **Kakerlaken poker**   Good week for me:  New games played this week (in order of enjoyability):  **Lewis   Clark** - love the efficiency building mechanic where more resource is not necessarily a good thing.  **Glory to Rome** - another efficiency building mechanic where you want to save number of actions and leech on others.  **Guildhall** - sweet short game based on chain reactions.  **Drum Roll** - standard worker placement game. The problem I had was that the cubes were not very thematic and some cards were basically rubbish.  **Packet Row** - good filler with slight deduction element.  **Port Royal** - Good filler where you can purchase cards to hedge the randomness.  **Roborally** - very chaotic, too random for my taste. Probably more fun if played slightly drunk.  **Cheaty mages** - another filler full of randomness.  **Holmes 13** - guess-who style deduction game. Not really much substance to it.  Games that I've played before:  **Agricola**, **Alhambra**, **Ingenious**, **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Splendor**   A good week for me.  New games I tried:  **Suburbia**: loved it. Lots of strategic planning, with a moderate degree of interaction so it's exactly my type of game. I love how we all create some back story for describing each of our cities as we go along.  **Cosmic Encounter**: Was somewhat fun but a bit too confrontational and chaotic for me.  **Arctic Scavenger**: Nice deck builder with some theme and interaction. Would like to play with the role cards next time.  **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**: I normally stay away from party games but this is short enough for me to be able to enjoy it.  **In the Year of the Dragon**: Another Feld that I enjoy. Probably the most unforgiving game of his but I really liked the mechanics.  **La Citta**: Was pleasantly surprised by this city building game. Early actions are hugely important.  Games that I've played before:  **Loot**, **Agricola**, **Tzolkin**, **Alhambra**, **Coloretto**, **Quantum**,**For Sale**,**Tsuro**,**Mascarade**   I like it a lot and would love to see a computer version come out!  I particular like the skill upgrade aspect which is basically efficiency management. I also like the strategic but not too confrontational blocking of routes which also boils down to managing efficiency.  The drawback I think is that the map and scoring conditions are fixed. This means each game feels somewhat similar at the beginning and at the end. Perhaps introducing different vp scoring bonus conditions would allow for more variety between each play.   Not too remarkable week for me:  First time played   **Robinson Crusoe** - probably highlight of the week. 4 of us played scenario 2 and were so close to winning but the snow hit us hard. We lost on the final round.  **Machi Koro** - nice short dice game. I find the red cards a bit overpowered.  **City Council** - the semi-coop element didn't work out, would never play again.  **Ingenious** - neat little abstract game.  **River dragons** - a short programming game that is mildly fun.   Played before  **Trajan**, **Libertalia**, **Hansa Teutonica**, **Alien Frontiers**, **Power Grid**   1st time played:  **Brass**, **Sail to India**, **Incan Gold**, **Ra the dice game**, **Panic on Wall Street!**, **After Pablo**, **Skull   Roses**, **Ascension**  Games I've played before  **Agricola**, **Notre Dame**, **Terra Mystica**, **Russian Railroads**, **Steam**, **Concordia**, **Manhattan Project**  Highlight was definitely learning how to play Brass! Such a well designed game, would love to try again.   In Concordia, you basically draft your own victory point scoring conditions. I think it's quite neat as it   a) enhances your own strategy as cards provide you with both actions and scores;  b) hides everyone's true vp. Someone could appear to be doing really well on the board but score-wise they might not be; and  c) enables you to block others scoring points by buying the card they want    Short games: Splendor, Battle Wizards, King of Tokyo, Fleet, Jungle Ascent  Main games: Trajan, Snowdonia, Hansa Teutonica, Zombicide, Lords of Waterdeep  Only tried 3 new games this week: Snowdonia, Hansa Teutonica and Zombicide. I liked HT a lot but am doubtful whether it gets samey as strategies among players appeared to be quite similar.   Fillers: Coloretto, Bang the Dice Game, A Fistful of Penguins, Gang of Four, 7 Wonders, Archaeology  Main Games (played before): Terra Mystica, Tzolkin, Russian Railroads, Pandemic, Lords of Waterdeep  Main Games (first time): Trajan, Euphoria, A Study in Emerald  Loved Trajan so much that I immediately bought it after playing it the first time! I enjoyed Euphoria but somehow it wasn't enough for me to cross the line from a good to great game.     I'm a new gamer (~2 months)  but already highly addicted to boardgames and I've played 6 days last week to try find games that I like. It was tiring but well worth it:  *Loved it*  **Terra Mystica** My third time playing it. I bought the game and this was my first time teaching newbies. Enjoyed the game playing the dwarves. Hoping to try the mermaids/swarmlings/alchemists next time.  **Lords of Waterdeep with expansion** Played original game once. This was the first time with expansions. With 6 players it was still very good but I think it would be more enjoyable with 5.  **Russian Railroads** Loved it! I diversified too much and ended with 275 points. Will definitely replay, even consider buying it.  **Tzolkin** x2. Played this many times already. Still loving it.  *Liked it*  **Pandemic** I like how easy to learn the game is and how everyone gets tense during the game.   **Nations** Played with 3 players. Went for military strategy and was very tight on resources. Will play again.  **Eclipse** My first long game (lasted 6 hours with 6 players). It does give you a great sense of achievement. Just didn't enjoy it at times when it took too long between turns. Not a big fan of war/dice rolling as well.  **Agricola** Learning game, got 22 points. I like the mechanics of the game but it felt a bit too restrictive to me. I enjoyed Caverna more.  **Ra** I quite like the design of this clever bidding game. Would replay.  *Alright*  **Coup, Quantum, Modern Art the card game, String Railway, Marrakech, Serenissima**  Hopefully I could game 4 days this week. Already looking forward to trying exciting new ones!   Does anyone know where I could find this in London? Their official website doesn't ship to the UK. Thanks.   Thanks! I'm not sure how to get the sizing correct as I've heard many people say it stretches a lot and it needs to be downsized 2-3 inches. So if I go to a retail store the "correct size" wouldn't feel comfortable right? How could I tell if I found the correct pair?   A.P.C. Petite Standard Jeans   When watching a live performance (e.g. concert/play/musical), I often think of what would happen if my mind is suddenly swapped with the performer. I would think of how much I'd panic as I don't know their material, and how the performance would stop as the audience jeers. I have hypothetical stage fright.     	17

The reason multipools are still mining doge is because of the profitability.    Sounds like a plan   Um hmm   I'm a little disappointed. I asked another shibe to post him on his 'roo and he didn't.

 Find a weapon!   What is the meaning of life?   Her tits were enormous   Did you two ever bang on the X-files set?   Heroin   I can't keep secrets and I betray my friend's trust frequently.   Everything   Drive my car in a city with a lot of Asian drivers on the road...   T-shirts   Swagger   Pens   That was confusing   Your tramp of an aunt   Most people are disgusting creatures who don't wash their hands after touching their junk. Sad, but true.   I apologize for all the nice folks in the USA. I've always encouraged my friends to be mean to foreigners. We are still working on it, but hopefully we will have everything in order by the time you visit. Have a lovely day...asshole ;)   Shut up Seahawks fan   Reddit   The Lost pilot is pretty captivating   I showed up to my construction site early one day and found this guy that would hang around the site all the time named Vito blowing a guy. Found out later that he got killed in a terrible way.   That's a crappy situation   Did the Ginger make it?   I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.  It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further.   Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone.   **TL;DR:** A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries.   Cough....bullshit....cough   Can you tell that story again, but in English this time?   That's a really shitty situation   This sounds like the beginning of an Eli Roth movie   Lacrosse   Chewing tobacco, individual coffee packets and Taco Bell hot sauces.   Hill Billy   I'd save Biggie and Tupac. Have you heard any of the garbage that people like Souljah Boy and Lil Wayne have put out lately?   That was a crappy joke   And where could we find this porn?   Drink and drive, constantly   King Joffrey Lannister   Kim Kardashian   Pissed the bed I put him to sleep in and then blamed me in the morning because I didn't order him, in his blacked-out drunk state, to pee the night before.   Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts  Seriously, the best book ever! You all must read it.   Wearing pants   Everything   Having a lemonade sale and thinking $30 was the most money anyone has ever made in the history of the world   Zero responsibility   I beat someone 15-1 on NHL 13'  I was pretty jacked up about it   You can be whatever you want to be when you grow up   You gotta pay the troll toll, to get into the boy's hole    On August 7th, 2007 I happened to be lucky enough to be offered to throw out the first pitch of a San Francisco Giants game, as part of Italian Heritage Night. My family booked the biggest block of group tickets and so the Giants ticket office gave us the opportunity to throw out the first pitch and my family chose me. Barry Bonds ended up breaking Hank Aaron's home run record that night when he hit his 756th home run. I ended up getting him to sign the baseball after the game. The ball has my name, the date and the Giants logo monogrammed on it.    What a dingleberry move on your part!   Phil....Phil Connors?   Zero fucks were given that day   My cheeks get flushed and sweaty when I eat green apples. I never really noticed that this was unusual until I was wiping some perspiration off my cheeks and my girlfriend asked me why my face was so red. I told her about it and said that I thought this happened to everyone when they ate tart things. She laughed at me, called me weird and assured me that this was not normal. Am I dying? Is this a actual medical affliction?     	50
 I'm the same. Mainly, though, for me, it's that both hands look pretty bad because I'm a n00b to this stuff.  My suggestion is to stabilize your non-dominant hand with your dominant one. Put your dominant pinkie on your non-dominant palm for painting the thumb, then do the same with your thumb for the others. Works for me on both sides, since I have really shaky hands.   What is that glitter? I love it!   So Long, Astoria.    Franais! and Chers amis, bouvons! with friend who speak French.  Otherwise, Fuck *whatever is troubling us*!   Upvote to OP for being a (rare as fuck) female on reddit.   As a poor college kid who can barely afford Kamchatka, yours is high-quality.   There is a method to the madness. I'm planning on putting candles in all these and strewing them about the house I live in next year.      Liquor before wine, gonna be fine. Wine before liquor, never been sicker.   I'd heard how good that was. Only reason we did this instead is because I had a really bad time involving schnapps, and I can't stand the stuff anymore.   I actually tried to minimize the tits in that photo. Didn't want to seem like a karma whore.   We shook it ever once in a while and let it sit for about 45 minutes, or until the candy canes dissolved.   If you want to take shots of it, use better quality vodka than we could afford. It may taste a bit like mouthwash, but spending a little more might minimize that.   We're poor college students, ok! I know it's retched. It was solely for mixing.      I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you. Edit: double post is doubled. Fuck my phone.   I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you.   Be careful. Depending on how drunk they were,  they may very well have given you the wrong number. Or,  I suppose,  depending on how attractive you are. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt    As a hot young lady who has recently been played like a card by a hot young man, I can understand.  Fuck boys, then only men I need in my life are Jack, Johnnie, and Jerry.   I've been frequenting this subreddit, jealous of all of you in your ability to still get drunk. Next year, I shall be able to go to the liquor store and will be doing so for the family (I'm the one who always gets the stuff for food anyway, they told me they can't wait till I can buy the booze, too). Scotch and ginger ale. Seems bad, considering teh cost of the Scotch, but fuck it, I gotta pilfer anyways.   If you're like me, you'll be wasting a lot of green if you try to hand roll. My fingers are just not nimble enough for it, and since I mainly smoke rolled things, using a roller is ideal, for time's sake.   I'm an American, and my best friend and I are the only people I know who smoke spliffs often. It might have something to do with our pack-a-day habits, but we love our spliffs.   I usually don't upvote manis with crazy stuff glued everywhere (personal preference, do whatever makes you happy), but the Trekkie in me demanded it.   Why would it even matter if it was from a her or not? Unless you're guessing Craigslist for meeting another person (sketchy as hell), you can just have it mailed to you. If you're that nervous that a creeper will come, set up a P.O. box.   My ex boyfriend's sister was autistic, and I've never seen more beautiful art outside a museum, and even some of that was worse. I'm "gifted" (politically correct for smarter than most) and I can't draw a straight line with a ruler. I have another autistic friend who is on par with me, sort wise. It all depends.   Canadian Mist and Canada Dry. I call it extra Canadian drink, eh.   Thank you so much for the CoverGirl suggestion! I'd love to be able to spend $24 on one product, but I'm a poor college students, and clearly smokes are slightly more important to me    Thanks! I'll look into a lip primer while I'm searching for Christmas presents.   Might sound silly, but I'm guessing the blush should match the lipstick? Which means, for pale me, that wouldn't work for red lips. Also, I just use a light powder foundation on my face, so I don't really have a need to get translucent powder just for this....   This is true, but it's becoming a bit of a pain, what with the fact that I have to touch up upwards of ten times a day, for cigarettes alone. I usually give up and wipe it all off before my first class of the day    As a smoker, I always have trouble keeping my lipstick from rubbing off in the center of my lips. Is there anything I can do to help this? I really want to wear lipstick more often, but I usually have to go to stain, which dries my lips out, or just balm.  Please, no responses about how bad smoking is for you, trust me, I know.  EDIT: I am a poor college student, so, while I'm sure things that are $24 per are great, they aren't really an option for me.   I was afraid I'd recognize it from the pictures. Thankfully, I didn't    That is much better than what the poor college kid must resort to.   In case you were wondering, Extra Canadian Drink is a staple for me. Canadian Mist+Canada Dry.   Also if you aren't in one of the ten states with no exceptions. Because fuck Indiana.   Yes, she is. And condone is a great word.   Good, since I crossed it out for a reason.   Bah, I don't know how to delete my double post on mobile!   I'll give you a hint: I break rule 37; there are, in fact, girls on the internet.   They call me Jay/Cory/Gary, that's not my name!   Only do this if your roomie is cool. I don't condone starting roomie wars    Not midget. Midge. Like short for Margaret. Don't ask me why.      In the post regarding cold weather wear (not sure how to link on mobile), there seems to be indecision about how fashionable the tights, knee high socks, and skirt combination is. Personally, I think it's absolutely adorable. I do it often, with all different types of skirts. This http://www.imgur.com/AYb3O.jpeg is one example. Here http://www.imgur.com/w6VVy.jpeg is another. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think both work.  Thoughts?   There are herbal, legal, nicotine free smokes. The brand Extacy is coming to mind. These are usually damiana based, which is the herb on which most synthetic legal high chemicals are sprayed. Extra bonus: damiana tends to make you horny.   I live in Bumfuck, Indiana, and I have only not received texts if the other person didn't have my number right.  Edit: I a word.   Oh my goodness, yes. This one guy, I still talk to him a lot, but can't really have sex with him anymore (he's got herpes, I don't and want to keep it that way). I've had to step back multiple times because I started to want more than he did and I didn't want to torture myself.... yet I still would go to his bed almost at the drop of a hat.   Greater safety, yes. For a lot of women, however, spermicide causes pain, itching, and dryness. Allergies are also not uncommon (I've got one).   For serious safety, wear a condom, but still dint finish inside her. I had a really paranoid ex who always did this.   Personally, even if the person is good at it, I hate having a tongue in my mouth that isn't my own. My ex was the first person to always do this, and I never knew what to do in return.   I guess, try things like what she did to you. Take it slow, gauge her response. Don't just start by sticking your tongue down her throat.   Hmm, I always heard that as "shes ugly everywhere but her (butter) face." I like yours, too.   House music competition. Do you mean a music competition in-house, or a competition of different house music artists?   I used to not like them because I was bad at them and they seemed tedious. I got better with practice, because I wanted to please my partner. I had an ex to whom I gave at least one blowjob a day for six months. I got pretty damn good at it from that, if I may be so immodest. Now I just love knowing that those sounds and faces he's making are directly caused by me. It's a great feeling.   I think we may have the same ex, haha. I always had to start and end every session with head, and hardly ever was it reciprocated. At least I got better at it.   Valentine's Day babies, represent!   This particular guy would have been bad either way, he was a chauvinist. But yes, he got way too attached and I had to deal with him for a good while after it happened and I said I didn't want more.  I'm sure not all virgins would be like that, but I know I was and this guy was, so I just don't want to deal with it. Besides, it is a decent amount of responsibility, being someone's deflowerer.   Because of shitty legal reasons not related to alcohol, I have to go to AA meetings (ok, I could go to NA meetings, but a pothead fits better with alcoholics than meth heads) and I agree that it isn't a joke. A lot of people have to go for legal reasons, some people would get their children taken away if they didn't go, etc.  I understand the joke, and yeah, it's pretty funny. But actual AA meetings are some of the most depressing places ever. Not butthurt, just sayin.   As a female who has been called attractive who chugs her fair share of beers, I hope this is at least decently common.   From experience, I can only think of two: I don't sleep with virgins or Nazis. I've deflowered a guy and it was very unpleasant for a while afterwards. The other? I was in this guy's bed, we were making out and his shirt came off. I saw a giant swastika tattoo. I pushed him away, asked if he was a Nazi. "Does it make it better that it was a prison thing?" That was the day I learned that Nazis turn me off.    I personally can't tell a difference between any type of condom, or between sex with a condom and bareback.  The one thing I *can* tell, is the difference between a condom with spermicide and any other type of sex. I know it's probably just me, because I am violently allergic to the stuff (like, lips swell shut and out, sitting down is really painful for a few days), but I've heard from other non-allergic people that it is drying and irritating.   I'd say go for normal lubrication on your rubbers, in case she is allergic. Because if allergic reactions in your nose or eyes are bad, allergic reactions on your ladybits are awful.   Partially because my GP is an ass, partly because I'm in college, but I just never bothered to renew my script after it ran out last September. I hadn't even thought of the waiting list.   20-year-old female. Lost my virginity about 18 months ago.   Have had  piv sex with 15 people, only oral with 2.   One six-month relationship, four month-or-two-long flings, five less-than-one-month flings, seven one-night-stands.   What is the context of this house party? Is it a small group of friends hanging out? Or is it a large group of people getting drunk and grinding all up on each other?  While assuming anything is bad always, getting it in at the end of the night would be more likely at the latter type of party. Just don't be that guy who invites her, goes separately, and tries to dance with her after she's seen you make out with four other girls (that didn't happen to me this weekend or anything).   Dodgeball: an excuse for good athletic children to beat the living shit out of the weaker ones in the name of "fun."   Pourquoi pas 'moi, en cuisinant du lait?' Trop difficile?  (Also, don't quote me on that verb tense, I've always been bad at present perfect) Edit: grammar   I already had these views on love. We've got multiple soul mates, and yeah, attraction at first sight is a thing, but love is a completely different matter. Love involves personalities that work together, matching sex drives, equal levels of emotional attachment, and all sorts of other things.   I have to move out Friday. It'll be clean then.   The mobile phone is a beautiful thing. Auto correct is the best.   You gotta learn how to pour that shit, man. You gotta tilt both the glass and the bottle/can.

See, this particular paper is just a long rant in French about how "one true love" and "love at first sight" is a load of bullshit. I have to reference a couple works of 19th century French literature (can you tell yet that I'm a French major?) which, from my knowledge of the texts, all have to do with either "love makes life miserable" or "everything in my life sucks and I hate it all." I get to write two short papers for the class, so one is dealing with love, the other will be dealing with how literature from before modern psychology effected the idea that mental health is something that one should be at least reasonably knowledgeable about.  I'm not in serious paper writing mode or anything.    Yes. Yes it is. And my roommate and I both have fridges. Not bragging or anything.

I hate it that much.   Hello trees. I recently got arrested and had to give up the herb for a few months. I want to tell you all the story of how I learned that this plant is the best medication I could every ask for.  I'm a young female ent. I'm in college. I have a family history of depression, anxiety, OCD, and alcoholism. The first three have plagued me my whole life.  I did ballet for nine years growing up, which is not a healthy environment for a kid. It forces you, from a very young age, to try for perfection in every aspect of your life, which is simply unattainable and unhealthy. At age 12 I started cutting myself to cope with the feelings of inadequacy. By age 15 I was doing it every day. At 16 I was put on anti-anxiety medication by a doctor, which made me feel like an empty shell of a person. Instead of anxious and all the other emotions, I just felt no emotions. I was a bitch, and more people than I can count called me crazy on a daily basis. I didn't have any real friends, I never saw anyone outside of school.  Right before I graduated high school, I found an old childhood friend on Facebook. The same day he added me, he messaged me telling me we should hang out. Two hours later, I was in his car with some of his friends on the way to a beautiful lake in the country. We swim for a while, then get back up on the dock. He whips out a joint and lights it up. When he passed it to me, I said I had never smoked before, and his face instantly lit up. "Try it," he said, "you'll like it."  I had never felt so uplifted and happy in my life. It was like all the unnecessary, stupid worries that had always plagued me were dissolved from my brain. I just started laughing uncontrollably, almost crying because I had never been as relaxed as I was then.  I smoked every day for a year and a half. I got arrested, and as part of the treatment program the man put me in, I have to pass two piss tests. It has been two weeks today. I feel like I did for the six years leading up to that day. I have either gotten drunk or cut myself every day. I hate it. It is unhealthy, makes me feel like shit the next day, and isn't a good thing, considering the strong history of alcoholism in my family.  I am not applying to any graduate schools in states that don't allow medical marijuana. And I hope, if any of you other ents get to feeling low, anxious, and miserable like I've been and will be for the next few months, you will read this and remember: trees can help. I'm sure, for some of you, it won't, but for me, it is the best thing out there.  Toke one up for those who haven't yet discovered this magical plant. Not even for me, for that would be selfish. I hope that, one day, no one will have to cover up their bodies to hide from the embarrassment of self-inflicted injuries. No one will turn to the blade because they will have the herb instead.    Truth.... Still not something you want to put on Facebook.   A visible bulge is nothing compared to what (it seems like) lazy college students wear. I know precisely the shape of most of my male friends' penises, because they really enjoy the basketball-shorts-with-no-underwear look. If you can't see the shape of the head of your member, it's fine with me.   I was about to ask the same thing. Might have something to do with the fact that it's all I got in my last relationship, so I had to figure out what worked. Only time I've ever orgasmed from just PIV sex was in Cowgirl.   4/20 always lands in the middle of Little 500 weekend (bike race/best party weekend in the country). Which means my humble abode welcomes police from five neighboring counties, as well as some out of state ones. This year it's on the day of the men's race, also known as the day with the most arrests in the state, if I'm not wrong.  IU ent problems.   Being 14 is not an excuse for not understanding this. This is taught in basic health class from when you were young  Unless you went to a school with abstinence only sex education or (like me) none at all. Enough girls in my high school got pregnant that you'd think they'd put two and two together.       Me too, although I've also heard those called pops or poppers.   The Blue Moon pumpkin ale is one of my new favorite things.   Uptoke for cowboy killers (my cigarette of choice).   I also see it as "wow, you're cool. No one can connect your face with all that illegal substance. And no one who doesn't approve can see." Be responsible with your trees, kids. Getting arrested really sucks.   I used to be like that. I hated being on top because I didn't know what I was doing. I either sat on the guy's dick or was folded over on top of him; either way, he was still doing most of the work.  Now being on top is second only to doggy. I do a lot of moving my hips by moving my body (former swimmer, it's a lot like the dolphin kick without the legs) and what are actually very similar to a man's thrusts, but with more emphasis on the back swing (if we're facing each other). I recently had some amazing sex on top doing this, I was able to be fucked as hard as I wanted without having to ask him to go harder.  As mentioned before, though, you are still a good lay if you keep doing what you're doing. If you want to do more, try adjusting the angle of your hips in missionary. To build up strength, try dancing around when you're alone. Focus on moving your hips in a circle while keeping your top half relatively still. It's a good ab workout, which never hurts anyway.   I've shaved every day for three years. Sometimes I get little bumps and it can get a little itchy at the end of the day, but I usually don't have any problems.   Because what else are those sad excuses for novels good for?   I do believe you go to the same school as me. Or I'm just high. Hoosier?   So, I've been seeing this guy for a couple weeks now, but we haven't gone on any real dates. We met and hit it off really well, but didn't really hang out. Then, three Fridays ago, he happens to be part of the crew I'm leading to a party (we're in college in my hometown, so everyone relies on me to know where places are) and I just sort of decide to make moves on him. We leave the party to get smokes and he decides to bum to me for the night. We leave with his roommate to go to another party, then we end up very drunkenly wandering around campus. I end up going back to his dorm and we have sex. Next day he comes over to my dorm, we cuddle under a blanket for hours and then he spends the night. We hung out nearly every day, sometimes spending the night. A week after that first night, he invites me over to his friend from home's house and he has his arm around me for most of the night as a lot of other people from his hometown come over. I went over there again last night with his roommate and got way too drunk and the guy ended up having to take care of me, which I hate. I apologize and he says it isn't a big deal and happens to everyone.  What's bothering me is that we haven't had the 'are we dating' conversation because I don't want to rush it, nor do I really even know what I want. However, multiple people have either asked me if we're dating, or congratulated me on my new 'relationship.' I'm very confused, because I don't think what we've been doing is dating, but other people seem to think so. Are we dating? We haven't gone out anywhere together, there's just an obvious mutual interest.  Tl; dr, I've been hanging out and having sex with this guy I'm into, but I don't think we're dating, despite what other people say. Are we?   It may not be great. It may hurt a bit. My first time was great, didn't hurt at all, and generally awesome, but that seems to be unusual. I fell into the 'we had sex, now I'm in love with you' trap, although that may be because I had known the guy since childhood.   As for getting handsy, follow his lead. Start off with a hand in his hair and one on his neck. Slide one down his chest or his back. I like to lightly massage his shoulders. Then grab his hips, pull him in closer. If he touches any part of you, it's fair game to touch the same parts of him. I really like to rub all around his cock, but not touch him until he starts rubbing in between my legs. If he's not hard enough for you to feel it through his pants by then, don't worry. He'll get there.      This week I fucked a guy I've had my eye on for a while now. We went to a party with a bunch of friends, then decided to leave for another one. We were pretty drunk by the time we left the second party, and then had to make the trek across campus. We held hands and stopped on several benches just to cuddle and look at the stars. We got back to his dorm and sat listening to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (one of my all-time favorite albums) while making out. Things got hot and heavy and I ended up spending the night. Next day he and his roommate come to my dorm just because and we ended up sitting cuddled under a blanket outside for hours and hours. Then he came to my room, we laid in bed and watched tv for a while before fucking. He spent the night and most of the day.   Seems less like a sexual achievement, but I have been afraid to let myself just be intimate without having sex since I got out of my first LTR. I've had hook ups, and a short fling (I had to break it off because I started to have feelings that we both knew would never be reciprocated), but I feel so comfortable with this kid. I'm just going to let it keep happening and see where it goes, but I really think I could let myself get feelings for him without it being unrequited.   Also, he helped me with my insecurities about my oral skills -- he had to stop me multiple times because I was "just too good at it."      This is one of my favorite things to do to a man. I LOVE doing it and looking up into his eyes as he gasps and moans. But maybe I'm just weird.   We can't help you Doug, we're too high.   I also am diagnosed with GAD, and I have tripped a few times. I dropped acid the first time three days after a massive panic attack, and it went fine. It may help you to write on yourself. I have seen people put "don't panic," "it's just the drug," or "enjoy yourself" on their arms. That can really help, because, if you get lost in your own head, you can look down and see the words.   As has been said already, don't let yourself be alone. It is good to have a sober person with you, so that you have someone who knows to watch out for you. I think LSD and other psychedelics have helped me figure things out, including the sources of my anxiety.  I hope it turns out well for you.   This!  And boys, if you didn't know why they put that warning on the stuff, its because, when you have a boner, the blood is trapped in there until you soften up. While the blood is trapped, it can't bring fresh oxygen to the cells in the penis. After four hours, a lot of those cells will have died. After long enough, the entire penis will die and, ultimately, fall off.  http://www.everydayhealth.com/erectile-dysfunction/whats-wrong-with-long-lasting-erections.aspx      Even better, just poke holes in the bottom of the bottle. Also, spray some febreeze into the sploof.  	109

 Nice shot!   A zealot hero would be my first choice as a starcraft warrior, but I think there are numerous other possibilities. Ultralisks, roaches, and immortals come immediately to mind. A marauder might also be interesting as a hybrid warrior/assassin. Kind of like Sonya, but instead of getting right into the fray, it'd be more focused on zoning enemies out.  The firebat idea is a cool one, I wouldn't have thought of that.   My suggestion is to friend the good/friendly people you play with after the matches. You can build up a really good group very quickly that way.   Why does he use such a long knife? Seems like it would be awkward to wield, though he certainly isn't having any difficulties with it.   I had no idea you could do this. I hope they bring it back, because I always split Olaf off and control Baelof and Erik together, and frequently wished I could bind the latter two together.   His D is rather tenacious.   I've experienced this a few times since the patch. It happens infrequently, but it definitely happens, and exactly as you say, as soon as I engage in combat for the first time, the game lags for about 3 seconds.    It's basically proven that raving toxic lunatics lose more games, and I'd bet my bottom dollar that the kind of person who would use a mute-all button and that toxic jerk are a lot alike, and I want neither on my team.  You've used the phrase "toxic lunatics". Read your comment history, and tell me, honestly, that you wouldn't call somebody who behaves as you do "toxic". Your last 10 comments are extremely hostile and negative. I stopped counting after that, but I'm guessing that this is pretty much your MO.  I mean this seriously, I really think you should do a self evaluation, because your behavior suggests that you've got some serious anger problems that need to be addressed.   I think you meant to respond to the parent of my comment.   Patch day is normally the second Tuesday.  According to whom? Just because that's when they usually do it, doesn't mean that it's late if they don't. They never said the patch would be two weeks ago. They said it would be early this week, and it was. You need to adjust your expectations, not to mention your sense of entitlement.  If what you meant is that, then you are thanking them for completing their scheduled B.Net maintenance at the time they promised.  I am thanking them for completing the patch at the time that they promised, because that's something that I want to encourage.  Imagine you're Blizzard, and if, like you, everyone were to complain whether you complete the work late or on time, you've got little motivation to be on time.  Truth be told, my post probably doesn't have any meaningful impact on whether they're late or on time in the future, but they were on time yesterday, I appreciated it, and it only took 30 seconds to say so. So I said so. I wouldn't really call that "hero worship", but if you'd like to, by all means.   The only thing worse is accidentally dismounting by hitting the mount key, and it's only worse because there is absolutely no good reason for the dismount key/command. Right clicking the mini-map at least serves a purpose.  But yeah, I agree, accidental mini-map clicking is something they absolutely need to fix. It's definitely gotten me killed more than a few times.   You mean almost two weeks late with undocumented changes?  What are you talking about? How are they two weeks late?  They said the patch would be yesterday from 3am to 11am PST. The game was back up no later than 10:55am PST.   Am I right that if you're not going to kill the towers that it's best to leave them at 1 or 2 bullets, so they don't recharge after you leave?   Gorgeous   Actually that was meant as a nerf. Ghost Uther was way to powerful before.   But they are similar, so yeah, hopefully a change is coming for Tyrael, too.    Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I totally didn't make the connection.   I so wish this would have included a total rework for Tyrael's practically non-existent trait. Alas.  Tons of great changes, though. Can't wait to try them out! I really hope the performance optimizations are significant.   What is this referencing?   Worthy cause.   Yeah. It's just terrible. It almost never does anything of value. I'd much rather have something that helps me *avoid* dying.   Agreed on Tyrael (never played Anub'arak). If they just gave Tyrael a worthwhile trait, preferably something that made him a bit more tanky, he'd be okay.   I hate Thrall's. It might be thematic, but he goes from intimidating to... not intimidating.   Please this. I so want a true solo queue where all 10 players queued solo.   Ah, couldn't find the VODs before. I see them now. Thanks!   More taxes on the poor.  If this makes you mad, and it should, consider the impact that all of this hopeless desperation has on crime (spoiler alert: it's not going to go down).  Then take a moment and connect the dots: increasing financial burden on the poor, lowering taxes for the rich, and privatizing everything. Where does that lead you?  In other news, Ted Cruz announced that he's running for president today.  Hmmm....   That sounds great. Do you know if his videos are available somewhere? He's only got one up on YouTube.   People using abilities just to use them drive me crazy. I'm looking at you, Gorge Stitches.   Seems like it. My game DC'd.   Same. Yet to see it.   The plants would basically provide better insulation. You'd still save money, but I'm with you. I'd rather be generating electricity.   He's a lot of fun, but he needs a different trait. The current one is practically non-existent. He's a tank, so he doesn't die a lot (more often than not I'll end a game with zero deaths), it's super easy to avoid the explosion, and even if it hits, the chances of it having a meaningful impact are pretty low.  I'd much rather him have a trait that will help me avoid dying. Given the fact that he's not the tankiest tank, and doesn't put out very much damage, I think giving him a useful trait would put him closer to balanced.   That looks amazing. If I didn't have a strong preference for characters that I really like looking like themselves (such as Tassadar), I would definitely buy this skin.   [Here's your solution.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w)   What if I told you I wanted to have the right to NOT vote? What if I thought voting legitimatize this violent entity?  Submit a blank ballot.  What if I don't want to endorse either democrats or republicans for executive office?  Vote for somebody else, write somebody in, or leave the ballot blank.  Would I be forced to endorse in candidates I strongly disagree with?  No.   I certainly hope so. The Protoss are awesome. I'd be happy with anyone out of the Starcraft or Diablo universes, though.   That was what I was most looking forward to, too. Very disappointing.

Because a Q that flips, massive health regeneration, and a lightning-based ult weren't Volibear enough ;).    Legalization won't stop over-age people giving pot to younger people.  What's your point?  "Drug dealers don't ID," and they won't when it's legal (they will still sell pot to youngsters).  Sure, but there will be a lot less illegal pot, especially as more and more states and countries legalize. You don't see kids buying bathtub gin or black market cigarettes.   We ended up using JsonFx, because we needed something that worked with iOS. We found it to be somewhat limited and had to hack our way around a few issues, but it got the job done.  We ended up dropping JSON due to size considerations in the end, though, and went with Protobuf instead.   I know, it was a joke.   Both pretty lackluster. Are we sure these aren't warrior cards?   If you're being vastly outnumbered and I run towards you to heal you so you can escape do not run back into the fight, I cannot keep you up.  I hate this so much, and it transcends support. Countless times I've put myself at risk or pop a valuable CD to buy a doomed teammate a small window of escape, but they read it as "reinforcements have arrived, let's do this thing!" and turn around to re-engage the 3+ enemies chasing them.  The end result is always the same: they die immediately and now I'm in the hopeless situation that they were in.  Thanks guy. Thanks.   Yet relatively left, figuratively.

If people receive money for no reason, then they will just sit around doing nothing.  If you started getting $1,000 checks each month, guaranteed for life, would you quit your job and do nothing?   Basically, you give everyone (without exception) free money (without conditions) every month because:  1. We live in a time where resources are abundant enough that we can easily provide the basic necessities of life (food, shelter, healthcare, etc.) for everyone. 2.

And deadly poison :(   I meant it's not worth your time to try and take advantage of the system.   This results in Mars somehow having even less electricity than it currently does.    Little did they understand that they can play the game of using cash when it favours you, and using other payments when it doesn't.  I would argue that you couldn't possibly do this to an effect greater than $1 a month, and your time is worth more than that. Thus, it never favors you.   Thanks.

Ideally I'd like to see:  * An in-depth preview of and release date for Tomb of the Spider Queen * 3-4 new heroes announced, hopefully not all Warcraft heroes * New features, such as spectator mode * More info on the Diablo map * Pipe dream: announcement of ranked solo and/or random queue   If it was as tight and polished as Hearthstone and had something akin to the arena to hold my interest (and let me build up my collection without financial investment), I'd consider it.  Honestly, I'd probably still be playing Solforge if it was as well done as Hearthstone. I thought that game was super compelling, but the actual user experience was very lacking.  I'd play those other games in addition to, not in place of, Hearthstone, though. Hearthstone is awesome.   Lime flies when you're halving fun.   Scorpio.   Your frustrations are certainly understandable. Our electoral system does not promote good candidates. Fortunately, there are a number of easy reforms that could correct (or at least improve) the situation.

Experience is extremely important, don't leave a lane empty unless there's a very good reason. 3. If your team is down a person, avoid a fight. If their team is down a person, pick a fight (or try for an objective/mercs).  Good luck and have fun!   Same.   this stuff takes time  No, it takes competition. The US pays more for slower and lower quality internet access than most of the developed world, and it's entirely because ISPs have a monopolistic hold on their industry. They have no incentive to do better, because we have no choice.  We're lucky to have even two options in Cincinnati (though that only gets us so far), most people only have one, but Google coming to town would not only give us the option of working with a good provider, and also force the bad (Cincinnati Bell) and terrible (Time Warner) providers to do better.   I do agree, we are lucky to have a choice (most people don't), and it's nice that some people in the area can get gigabit speed (though sadly I'm not one of them).  That said, Cincinnati Bell's not that much better than Time Warner in terms of customer service/relations, so it would be nice to have a good company like Google come in and raise the bar for customer experience, service, pricing, etc..   Three things to consider:  1. Cincinnati Bell's gigabit service isn't available everywhere. It's certainly not available to me, or I'd be using it. I'm not sure that they offer fiber everywhere yet, either. 2. Competition will force Bell and Time Warner to do better. There's a reason Time Warner and Comcast are among the worst companies in America, and that's the monopoly that they have on their industry. We're lucky to have a second option, though Cincinnati Bell doesn't raise the bar very much. Google most definitely will. 3. Cincinnati Bell's customer service sucks. It's not as bad as Time Warner's, but it's pretty bad. I can't speak to Google's customer service, but they have a reputation for doing things right and for not trying to do everything as cheaply as possible.  3 is the biggest factor as far as I'm concerned. It would be nice to have a faster connection, but the thing I hate the most about our situation is having to choose between Cincinnati Bell (bad) or Time Warner (incredibly bad, and only going to get worse when they've merged with Comcast) and dreading every interaction that I have with them.   Did your parents not notice this pattern and perhaps stop taking your brother's (only) word for everything?   [There were a number of them in 2014](https://mayday.us/), and will almost definitely be more in 2016. Mostly democrats, but a few republicans and independents as well.

If you want to stare at the car ahead of you, like you would be if you were driving the car, then go for it. But I'm guessing most people would/could find ways to put that time to better use if they didn't have to concentrate on the road.  You'll basically have more options (and a safer journey) than you do now.   Sorry, I just had futurgasm  Someone replicate the man a holotissue.   STV is a little different, in that it's a form of proportional representation. It's basically RCV with multiple seats, which pretty much eliminates the problem of gerrymandering, as well as provides better (proportional, if you will) representation. STV is definitely better, but not every seat can be made into multiple seats (mayors, governors, treasurers, the president, etc.), and where we can't, RCV is the way to go.  Here are videos describing each system:  [RCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w)  [STV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI list=PLqs5ohhass_QZtSkX06DmWOaEaadwmw_D)   OP?

Colleges and director boards love it (because it's way superior), and even a few cities (e.g. Oakland, San Francisco, and Minneapolis) are already using it.  I totally take your point, though, a whole state adopting it for all elections would be a fantastic example with significant visibility.   It's rather unfathomable that marijuana could be legal recreationally but not medically.   Well, on behalf of everyone who thinks that women should be able to feed their children wherever without fear of judgement, harassment, stares, etc., thank you all for doing this. As you can see, there's quite a bit of support behind your message, and while there are certainly some regrettable opinions on the matter, I think it will definitely help to (to at least a tiny degree) further the discussion and affect positive societal change.   Cool! So how did it come about?    but the fact that women can have their breast out in public but I can't have my penis out in public.  You think that women being able to be topless in public, just as men can (as of the 1930's, I might add), would create an inequality?   Proof?    but pulling out your breasts for all the world to see is overkill and honestly quite rude.  Do you wear a t-shirt at the beach? 'Cause you've got 'em, too.    witty  Doubtful.   It's for people like you that I post these things. That's not healthy, and it's not your fault. It's society's.  Well, it's more for the nursing mothers who still have the fear, and the experience, of harassment. But for you, too!   Fantastic! I'd love to see more of your work.   Probably. This just relates to federal law. Individual state laws would still apply.  I'm not a lawyer, though.    Same.    This is one of the strongest arguments in favor of legalization. Not only is prohibition completely ineffective (and counter productive), but in leaving everything to the black market and cartels (including revenue), marijuana isn't regulated at all.   Here's hoping (against all prior evidence).   change it when faced with a good enough reason to do so  Sadly, she only changed her mind when faced with a *personal* reason (her son's medicinal needs for marijuana). The good reasons for legalization have always been there.  I agree with your message, and I certainly applaud this woman for recognizing her mistake and trying to right it, but I don't think she's exactly a role model for open-mindedness. I'm fairly certain she would still be opposing it if she hadn't had that personal experience, like the many conservatives that oppose gay marriage until a member of their family comes out.    Just because some senile old woman wants medical marijuana doesn't make it any more stupid.  Did you maybe mean to say "less stupid"?    Just not sure why people want to put another poison in their body  You say "another", but the thing is, marijuana is already ubiquitous. Kids often choose weed because it's easier to get than beer. If prohibition worked that would be one thing, but all it does is funnel money to drug dealers, gangs, and ultra violent cartels, instead of into the economy and into the hands of tax payers. It's entirely counterproductive.  And not only is there a ton of weed out there, it's all entirely unregulated. I know a guy that unknowingly smoked some laced with formaldehyde and it really messed him up.  Furthermore, it's rather senseless to prohibit marijuana and not alcohol and tobacco, when the first is far less dangerous (if dangerous at all) than the other two.  I should point out that I've never tried marijuana, and have no plans to even once it's legal, but I push hard for legalization because it would be a really beneficial thing for the country. I agree there are higher priority issues, but prohibition causes some very significant problems (and really doesn't prevent any), so it shouldn't be on the bottom of the list either. The political will is there, and it's something most people agree upon, so let's do it.  **TL;DR** - Keeping marijuana illegal causes some major problems, serves almost no purpose, and is easily corrected, so let's solve the issues we can while we work on the others.   What are identify politics?   Identity politics?  Also, while the republicans are certainly starting to come on board, it's the democratic party that has been leading the way on legalization.   I assumed when it fell that you had just shut off the current. It just did that on its own?   Chris Rock?   I agree, but this really bothers me. If I tell you something in confidence, and you tell someone else, you've violated the trust that I've placed in you. Who you told isn't a factor.   How does this video have 4k upvotes, but only 579 views?   Explain?   Exactly how I feel. I hope the more open bill passes, but I'll take both over nothing.   The first Eastern state to legalize is going to make a ton of money.   Edit: You may vote for as many as you want, so you don't have to choose this one over others if you support it.

Guys already wear bikini tops on go topless day out of solidarity for women who are still forced to cover up and to protest the double standard. Sends a pretty cool message, I think.   The caribou you know are too busy being indicted for tax fraud.   That's where I'm at. You can sexualize pretty much any part of the body (legs, abs, etc.). Seems pretty silly to me to arbitrarily hide certain parts. Not only silly, but also counterproductive, as you greatly increase the allure of something by keeping it constantly hidden.   Wow. Didn't even think about that.   He's probably against people wearing feathers, too, so...   Yeah... :(   Think we'd be able to tell the difference?   This is that.   I'd be willing to bet the black market brought in even more the year before, especially since it's still in operation and wasn't heavily taxed and regulated.   ?   Believe it or not, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public, too, as recently as the 1930's. I think you wore something akin to a wrestling uniform.   As I, and many, many others believe that prohibition is ineffective and counterproductive, yes I do.  Indulge me. Why do you think it should be illegal?

Sadly it's 20republicans for the next 2 years.   Actually, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public as recently as the 1930's, if you can believe that.   Thank you. It may take us some time to really forgive you, but it's a start.   That's where I'm at. I've never used marijuana, and don't intend to even after legalization, but legalization is very important, and if we can get this passed in 2016, it gets us most of what a good legalization bill would, and we can correct it from there.  I know people hate this proposal, and I'd rather see something better passed, too, but I'll take "mostly legal" over "pointlessly  and counter-productively illegal" if that's what we can get.   Sure, as long as said settings were appropriate, which is to say anywhere where it would be appropriate for a man to be topless.   About 5 years ago I saw my neighbors having sex in the shower with the window wide open. Watched for a couple seconds, thinking if they cared they wouldn't be having sex next to an open window, but then thought "nah, that's not cool", and went to bed.   It's a ridiculous double standard that makes absolutely no sense.   If the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being, its capital sentencing system must be infallible."  I agree, and it should only be instated once the system is indeed infallible. Which is to say, never.   I bet many do. I'm sure they don't love spending 75% of their time in office raising money for the next term. The democrats will definitely be on board, possibly even a few republicans.   Probably because it invariably does.   Contact the white house and your federal representatives and express your support. There are also a number organizations, WolfPAC, Mayday.us, and NH Rebellion, to name a few, that are actively working toward this goal (in different ways). Check them out and if you like what you see (WolfPAC's organization is amazing), lend your support to one of them.  Finally, keep an eye on [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik1AK56FtVc).

About once a month or so, I have a recurring dream. Though all the details aren't exactly the same, the main plot is. The dream: I'll be minding my business going along dream world doing whatever when all of a sudden I'm a couple feet off the floor just floating there. I can control where I float to pretty easily. I'll usually float around for a few minutes enjoying myself. After a while a sudden blanket of fear over comes me. The only sound I can make is a wailing banshee or ghost like sound. I hear it in my dream and out loud. My wife wakes me up because it freaks her out. By the way, I can not mimic the sound while I'm awake, it's a way higher pitched sound than I can consciously make. My question to you Reddit is can anyone help me understand what could possibly be going on? Also, has anyone of you experienced anything similar?   Anna Gunn. Why not?    "White's only pies!"+ runs and eats scalding hot pie.   I had one of those blow up pillow fight things or whatever. You put your fist in and beat each other senseless. I immediately felt regretful.      I believe I have something like that in both my ears   All I can say about most of this is, yes some customers are dicks. The thing is most of you are complaining about customers doing regular customer stuff. Customers have every right to pay with whatever method the store promises to accept. Customers shouldn't put money in their mouths out bras or whatever it's gross. If a customer wants to use a coupon that isn't expired and they have the product the coupon promises to cover, then you can't be mad at a customer for holding up the line. It's not the customer's fault if some stores punish cashiers for slow time. A lot of the comments on here are ridiculous. Maybe you should find a different job. I worked retail and ran into the same stuff. What was different for me? I actually know how to work in retail. Stop complaining about customers being customers. That's like saying babies shouldn't cry or dogs shouldn't bark. If a price rings up wrong and a customer complains about it there is a great chance they aren't accusing you off fixing the wrong price they are being human and just blaming the nearest person. Not everyone that comes through your line thinks like you. Some of your customers have never worked retail, they only know what it's like to be a customer. You find certain things to be "simple" or "common sense" but that's because you're around it all the time. I bet some of your cruddy customers find other things to be "simple" or "common sense" that you might not immediately do the same wary they do. Customers are the reason your job exists.   People are stupid. That's what self check out is for. ;-)   Not everyone can see well enough to see the menu board until they reach the front. Though I do understand the frustration.

He doesn't want his son to think it's okay to do that.   Thanks   Little Johnny likes playing hooky quite often and he hides in his mom's closet until she takes a nap. One day he plays hooky as usual but today a strange guy comes over and he and Johnny's mom have sex. Right as they're finishing up johnny's dad comes home early so the man hides in the closet. The following conversation occurs: "It's dark in here, huh?" Shut up kid, I'm hiding. "Wanna buy my baseball?" No, shut up! "I'm gonna tell my daddy on you for what you were doing to my mom" Fine! I'll buy the damn ball if you shut up. How much? " 300 dollars" No way I'm paying that much! " I'm gonna tell" Fine, ya rip off! Here.  They swap the money and the ball.  A few days later the strange guy is back at it and Johnny's dad comes home early again and the guy hides in the closet again. The following conversation occurs: "It's dark in here huh?" Yeah. Shut up. " wanna buy a baseball glove?" No. Not this time. "I'll tell daddy" Fine. How much? " 700 dollars" No way! "Yes or I'm gonna scream"  Needless to say, they swap cash for glove.  The next day Johnny's dad asks him if he wants to play catch. Johnny says "that'll be hard to do without my ball and glove." And his dad asks what happened to it. Johnny explains he sold them for $1000. Infuriated, his dad brings him to church to confess. He puts Johnny in the booth and the following conversation occurs: " it's dark in here huh?" Don't start that shit again you little rip off!   Lol. I thought I was the only one. I also put my sack of fast food on there to keep it warm.      Yes. Mine is active anywhere there are a mass of people that I don't know. Like if I go to taco bell and the lobby is  full of people particularly in line. I just leave. So yes, a church or a library would trigger it.   Oh and I understand "tit for tat" quite well. I grew up with petty siblings, lol.   Well I'm glad you've done your research. I'm also glad you've found peace. I just don't see it happening for me. I panic in crowds and that panic makes me frustrated. I will probably live the rest of my life this way. Thanks for the concern. Oh and I am aware that my response isn't much but if I yawn one more time I won't be capable of seeing through my watery eyes.   Thanks for the kind words but I never mentioned hating anyone. I hate eating around big groups of people or being around big groups of people. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety.   I get the same way. It's like I'd rather die of utter starvation than to be around a bunch of people. I don't care what it is, I wont eat it if there are people (especially ones I don't know or rarely see). I'll be thinking "Ooh there's cake.... *goes to get cake* wait, there's people.. lots and lots of people... fuck it, there's a slight chance there'll be some left" to myself "RETREAT!"                    	54
 As well, once you get a bit of gunpowder, you can duplicate it via Alchemic Chemistry with blood, or hand in the repeatable quest "Covered in Ash"   Yup. ME^3 's gonna win. GG, m8.   Running Red is about being dead.   And really, m8? Parcel gets a flair, and I don't?  I see how it is .  :P   I'm in Party Mode  \o\ /o/ \o\ /o/ \o\ /o/ \o/   And yes, these are HQM maps.   What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?   Says the person who loved it prior to being banned.   Why is your name VikeStep?   It's all good! \o/   m8, not trying to be rude or anything. Your explanation was very good, I was just pointing out some stuff you missed. No need to yell at me   I also think the story deserves some focus, as much of it revolves around it. The player is dead, and has to cope with being dead. It takes place between life and whatever happens after. Very light and cheery, right?         :O There's a mods section on the MC wiki? :OOOOOOOOO   /r/PCMasterRace   \o/ Amazing! Suggestion: I don't know if you've done this, but you are able to disable Mystcraft Instability per-age. There's an in-game command to do it.   First, put a Fluid Transition Plane next to the lava to soak up the liquids, like Cypher said. Then, if you want, you can have the AE network output a certain signal when it's grabbed enough Lava. Have it output to the Master Ritual Stone, and bam! It will only consume a certain amount of lava before turning the ritual off.      You're amazing at everything, it appears :P   Yes, I'll get that out in a few updates. It has the compass texture because I can't texture :P I've gotten permission to use other textures in an upcoming update, so don't worry! :D   Yeah I waited until I had a Igneus Extruder going to make Compressed Cobblestone for my farm   I'm doing Blood Magic/Botania, probs Mekanism/Thermal Expansion. Also the big "everything centered around Blood Magic" one, AKA Running Red.      Personally, I prefer to play Demoman.   http://youtu.be/CmNuQf_L-3A  This video shows off the new gamemode I created. All it is is a simple config file that the server downloads, and executes, allowing for anyone connected to play in a Zombie Apocalypse, without any download required by the client.  From "About.txt": "The game is a four player co-op match where you attempt to complete the original objective of the map. In Upward, you push the cart, in Process, you capture the 3 control points, in King, you try to capture the control point and survive for 3 minutes. Unfortunately, in Apocalypse Rising, the players are hindered by zombies. These zombies spawn in groups of 6, every 20 seconds. Not only that, but each player only has one life per match, adding to the overall difficulty. [There are 3 maps that have support included in this, Upward, Kong King, and Process, all of which represent a different difficulty. Included in the readme file are instructions for adding compatibility to new maps.]  Apocalypse Rising was created in order to give clients a fun, easy way to play TF2 as a zombie game. The policy I had when making this was that I wanted there to be absolutely no download on the client's end, and that policy has held up until the end.  I'll take a moment here to say that Apocalypse Rising is completely open source, just read the configs to see what's happening, and feel free to change or add stuff to it.. Maybe I'll even make a video on that."  Download: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrapzh7yfaywytq/Apocalypse%20Rising.zip  Thank you for looking at this. -Gideon Seymour  	26

What I dont like is juice in the mouth.. and well as tanks empty we tend to tip up. i sometimes put a piece of q-tip in the end.. but that only works for a minute or two before it is saturated and started to make it hard to draw.  anyways all i see are drip tips.. any non drip tips out there?     	199
 During my broke days in college, I tried duplicating this, buying Eggo Waffles and KFC.  It satisfied the craving, but I doubt I'd ever do it again.    Damn I miss Josh Morgan   Depends on your tone and your approach.  I read your sentence in 2 voices.  Creepy gay stalker voice, and regular voice.  That being said, it's a compliment, but the creepy voice can easily jar anyone.     Came here to add the same thought.  Japanese love KFC, but they make it sound like it's the norm for Xmas.  A few weeks there was a similar website where they listed breakfast from all over the world.  They put tofu as a breakfast item for Japanese.  Not even clos   I can't say with confidence that Alex is good enough to take us all the way.  Same can be said that if we find ourselves in a shootout where we have to air it out, I'm not confident of resting the game on Alex's arm.  Of course the O-line needs to improve as well, but if there is a free agent QB that's available I'd like to see us pick him up.  The playbook is only 1/2 open, let's go full playbook and see what happens.     Congratulations, enjoy!     The power of Reddit, helping hemophiliacs one day at a time.  Update:  I since have spoken to our fellow bleeder, and am trying to get him hooked up with Baxter.  Baxter was actually in our office the other day and this story was brought to their attention.  They're trying to take action immediately.  Btw, were you at Chicago for the Annual Meeting back in Nov?     Grades might not be the best motivator for learning, but as a whole we've taken out the concept of competition + challenge.  Now this might be due to the fact I grew up in a Asian house hold where grades were the end all be all.  But I notice these days, we coddle our children too much where there are no losers.  Watch this piece on 60 min about "Millenials"  and you'll see the result happening.  (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/08/60minutes/main3475200.shtml)  The motivation has to come from parents, but grades can be a motivational booster.  Who doesn't want to score the least amongst your friends in class?  It's competition, something we've abandoned and have now let kids feel entitled.     I got something to Poutine in your mouth   I swear it's not mine!   If he maces him first, then it's OK   He's a football coach.  Just teaching "man on man defense"...too early?     Here's my St. Patty's Day tradition.  Pick up a 4 pack of Guinness.  Pour 2 cans, (1 is not enough) along with the other herbs, and such.  Add only a bit of water, you want the Guinness to reduce.  Simmer for 3-4 hours till tender.    As for the cabbage part, I like doing with a modern twist.  Slice cabbage and saute in olive oil, S+P.  Meanwhile reduce some balsamic vinegar til reduces and becomes a syrup.  Drizzle balsamic over cabbage, drink the other 2 Guinness and begin bar hopping.

Go Teblow yourself   and special teams an aspect of football often forgotten/neglected   And Seattle beat the Ravens also   You're question is 2 part.  #1, 49ers are contenders.  Week in and week out we play competitively, enough to make the game close.    Which leads to #2.  Alex Smith IS not the 49ers.  He's not greatest, we put him in situations that'll help us win.  Call it what you want, he manages the games and he makes enough plays.  But our Defense is legit, enough to be considered a contender.  Our special teams is elite, and our Run Offense is one of the best.  All those make the 49ers contenders.  If you don't agree then you're watching another type of football.    Stop trolling.     "Japan is a few steps further away than most cultures"  What the fuck does that even mean?

That's how us Asians pronounce it as well    McDonald's Worker holding a metal rod   I was at The Venitian in Las Vegas for a bachelor party.  A bunch of us were partying in the room with strippers, booze, drugs.   The strippers weren't the hottest, and their attitude really sucked.  They were demanding $$$ for bullshit, for instance 50.00 per dance, 100.00 for their clothes off.  We got sick of them quick and kicked them out.  That pissed them off because a few minutes later, security knocked on the door.  They forced their way in, and raided the place.  5 ginourmous guards stormed in shouting at us demanding to show us where to drugs were.  Luckily we flushed the coke, but couldn't hide the weed.   They found the OZ of weed, took all our pics with us holding our drivers license, and that's why I can never step foot in the Venitian again.    I actually got a massage there, totally legit and prices are solid.  It's the neon lighting that gives it that "shady" look   Jim Morrison was a resident   On a different note, anyone else get a little chilly after they smoke?     Thanks?  =)   Untrue.  Most of those pics are on Bedford Ave, the epicenter of hipsterness.

Or your a bboy   I'm Japanese, it'll be a challenge in Italia   Mind Blown   Throughout my years of smoking, I've always kept the same philosophy, which is, "It always evens out at the end"    To this day, I still swear by it.  People have hooked me up, I've hooked them up.  This guy sounds like he's keeping tabs on everything.  If he's keeping tabs on silly things such as trees, imagine if you're in a situation where he's really got you.  No need for people such as him in your life.   You already know the answer.     Anything that involves being creative, for me it's  breaking, playing music and cooking.  I don't get to do it all the time, but when I do it brings me to a happy place.     I bet they had some "intense debriefings"        Yeah not recommended for people who can't deal with crowds or stuffy areas, which it becomes around 2 am   Never offensive.  I'm thinking of picking up a McDonald's T shirt, and a fake metal rod?  Too soon?     I've read there's a suicide 1x a week?  Is that true?

Just a few weeks ago, the whole city commemorated 9/11, by remembering the brave fireman, cops, citizens etc.  There was a feeling of peace, respect, and more importantly UNITY.  The whole world watched as we mourned and came together as a city.    Fast forward to Occupy Wall Street, and it's like we took a 180 degree turn.  Now don't get me wrong, I am in full support of the protests, and hope their voice is heard globally.  And yes, the COPS fucked up on this.      Having lived in NYC for 2 years now, I've concluded NYPD is a bunch of assholes, and there is almost a sort of pedestal these guys expect to be on after 9/11.  Now after this last incident, they're rep is back to being shit, and there's a feeling of "Us vs Them"   As a society, when 9/11 comes around again next year do we all have pity and bow our heads to pay respects to Cops?  This ass backwards behavior US has is least surprising IMO.  And once again the whole world watches as we collide and crash against each other, making us look juvenile and incapable of handling crisis.       Older bro and I argued over a stupid cartoon.

So what's some of your f'd up stories?           I've actually posted once about her before, she came into work for 2 weeks coughing and sneezing, refusing to take time off (which is BS)  By no means am I a germaphobe, but she's just down right gross to me.

Usually my approach has been direct, sometimes too much. The way I see it, if the girl bites then game one. There are times it gives off the relationship vibe too early, which has come back to bite me in the ass. How do I change this up so I can still appear interested without giving away too much? The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship. I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring. And I knew she was into me.  She's turning 28 next month, I'm 33. I'm pretty blunt usually, sometimes too straight forward. It kinda got awkward with the last girl, but at least it cuts the BS. I also wear my emotions on my sleeve, good or bad.   Usually my approach has been direct, sometimes too much.  The way I see it, if the girl bites then game one.  There are times it gives off the relationship vibe too early, which has come back to bite me in the ass.  How do I change this up so I can still appear interested without giving away too much? The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship.  I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring.  And I knew she was into me.     **Backstory**I met a awesome girl recently at a friends house. The only kicker was that her and her bf just broke up recently. I was getting the vibe the whole time we hung out, so I thought. A few weeks ago I got enough brave juice in me to ask her out, she said yes and the following weekend we hung out the whole time.  Knowing she's still fresh out, I acted my best and did not push at all. Ironically, this back fired as she made the move on me. We hooked up, things were great. I thought it was a amazing weekend, shared stories, similar upbringings, partied, laughed..everything.  So then a few weeks pass by, we talk on the phone briefly, was kinda awkward but didnt' think much. Then 2 days ago she asked me out, only to bail on me later. Today I get email saying she only wants to be friends. So with the info at hand, was I the "getting over my ex" booty call?  The only thing I can think of is that I might've given off more a relationship vibe than anything else. I did make her a mix cd, and a short story I wrote. I figured it was a worthy gamble. Also all this happened in NYC, a city unlike any other, where dating can be absolutely amazing or fucked. Often times in 1 week! TL;DR Met a amazing girl that just broke up with her bf, I hook up with her although I didn't make the first move. Developed feelings, now she wants to be friends.              A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.   We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him"  So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.   My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?       The backstory:  I recently met someone pretty amazing, we've hung out a few times so far, and my gut is telling me she likes me.  We went out last night, got pretty buzzed, danced alot.  I went home and ended up drunk texting her.  Nothing insane was written, but I did say I want to hear her story over dinner sometime.  I woke up today realizing what I did, immediately regretting it.  Sorta chickened out I feel like.  I feel like I might've killed any momentum, and she hasn't texted back a reply.         Designer Kunio Okawara sends his wishes and support to the people affected by the earthquake.    http://twitpic.com/49br0g            The backstory:  A good friend of mine passed away in Dec due to cardiac arrest, he had pulmonary hypertension.  (33 y.o)  Three years ago, he met the love of his life, until the dumb whore went to Costa Rica and cheated on him.  The bitch got pregnant as well.  When she came back, she moved out of his apt and out of his life.  Fast forward today:  My friend's facebook page is still up and running, (his parents decided to keep it) people like to leave messages, posts, pics etc.    Out of nowhere, this girl comes out of the woodworks and starts posting.  Everyday it's something, "I miss your touch, smile..."  Yada yada yada...Attention starving whore  Bottom line it's pissing me off now.  Only a few of us knew she cheated on him, everyone else thinks she's some sweet gal.  Out of respect for his FB page, I'm not going to bust her out.  But I can send her a message.  I need input on this.  Call me out if I'm accused of being a troll.    TL;DR:  A girl who cheated on my friend who passed away is leaving annoying Facebook posts on his page.  I can see thru her B.S.  What should I do?     Last nite I began to feel the onset of a cold.  Nothing serious.  Went out for drinks which consisted of Jameson shots, 2 Stellas, and Henneseey with Ginger Ale.  Fast forward today, I feel fine.  I've done this a few times and it works.  My theory is, either I piss out everything, or the internal body temperature kills whatever strain it was.     A friend of mine forwarded this article, it's shocking just how backwards some countries are.    http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2011/01/japanese_medical_marijuana_patient_desperate_to_st.php   http://imgur.com/xFnnW  I'm hoping seeing a sketch will inspire me to get back in the game.  Shot taken in downtown SF 2007.        He was the best running mate and awesome dog.   http://imgur.com/cRoQz.jpg   I work in a typical office, cubicle style.  The last 2 days the girl next to me has been hackin 24-7, to the point where it's annoying to hear, and it's kinda nasty.  By no means am I a germaphobe, I'm just trying not to get sick.  Is it wrong to go up and ask/tell her to go home?  What's your stance on this?  BTW, the excuse of I don't want to use PTO/or Sick days is BS.              We've been living in Brooklyn for the past year and have seen/done most of the city.  As exciting as it is, everything kinda looks and feels familiar after awhile.   Where are some original places in Manhattan to take her?  Japanese Restaurants, bars, speakeasy's etc.  Please no east village, SOHO, greenwich.  Thanks   My friend has a 2 y.o son with severe hemophilia that has had numerous bleeding episodes resulting in painful rehab and psuedo tumors.  I'm trying to help her find a low impact studio that can help him learn motor control, stretching, balance, coordination.  Please help!  Edit:  Clayton MO, St Louis area     	113
    Easily my favorite song by Tool   Heard a rumor that they are in the studio and a new record will be out sometime towards the middlenof next summer   You can never be too prepared   House of Pies in Houston, Tx?   After accidentally pissing on my Xbox and Nes while sleep/drunk/blacked out, a package arrived on my doorstep. It was a brand new Xbox slim 250gb. A few days later another box arrived. It was a Nes still in the original box!!   Easily one of the most frustrating things about a relationship   I got a lot of weird looks when I busted out laughing in the middle of the laundromat. .   I work in at a dueling piano bar and I usually miss everything that happens there. But on this night I got to see two sets of tits. One from a girl who wanted free drinks from me (she didn't get it this isn't r/gonewild ) and the other because some dude convinced her that it was a good idea to show the bartenders her boobs before they take a shot as some sort of "good luck" act. Either both were nice and made my night!   Try again   Customer's tits, two sets actually      That is fantastic!  You did a badass cover!  	13
 Wow... That was uncalled for.   How do we escape?   Lock your door like everyone says and hope he isn't in there with you. Definitely call the police AND let someone close to you know what's going on, a friend or a parent, etc. The likelihood is that this is someone you know what messing with you, hence the Lulu. But it would be stupid to take any chances.  tl;dr hide and call the fucking police asap   Am I missing something? Yes, relatives can be strange but what are you trying to convey.   Straight up man you need to call a priest or an exorcist or a ghidt hunter something along those lines. If your parents don't believe you there are two options: 1) Explain the whole ordeal to your parents WITH your siblings and say all you want is to call a priest etc to ease the nervousness. 2) do olit behind their backs when they aren't home or something.  Either way you have to do it. Good luck OP.   Definitely anything by Christopher. Nympho is especially good.  Also, can someone make this playlist on a different service like 8tracks as Spotify isn't available in every country? :)   Sorry, everybody I no longer have anymore Aviate invites. However, I will keep this post up in hopes that some others will have a spares. I'm really sorry to anyone who I didn't get to! x   shoot me a pm with your email, or comment on my post about invites and i'd love to!   I just got Aviate and I have 5 invites for anyone who wants them. Just shoot me a PM or comment your email! All I ask is you return the favor for any other redditors who need it. Maybe we could start a bit of a chain?   P.S. Aviate is great, I highly recommend it! If you're sort of on the fence about getting it or not, I suggest trying it out for a few days, it really helps to have everything laid out as simply as it is. Good luck new Aviators!  	9
                            There will be no collapse.  AT least not in the way you imagine it.  It's not going to be like "Dawn of the Dead" where suddenly chaos erupts everywhere, and the preppers grab their bugout bags and go in the woods.  The ongoing zeitgeist that one day lightning will strike and the proles will rise up is another method of control.  It's far more insidious than that.  Read "The Hollow Men" by TS Eliot and you'll understand.  You'll just notice that every day things will become a little more expensive.  Prices will go up and down, but this constant will always remain: you will need to work longer for less and less.  Young people finishing college will be told at their graduation that "The only way to the top is to start at the bottom," only to see the bottom get lower and lower every year.  Job security will cease to exist as a concept.  YOu'll notice the size of houses and apartments will begin to shrink whilst the price of housing rises.  More and more it will become challenging to find food that doesn't taste rather bland.  You'll see your friends and family less, and one day find that doesn't bother you much.  Marriage will become rare, as will children.  People will begin to indulge themselves in digital fantasies, never actually experiencing the real world.  The modern human will have no religion.  No dreams.  No desires or wants beyond the immediate sating of his bodily desires.  No beliefs beyond the arithmetic (and even that will become a grey area).  One day, still many generations from now, your descendant will walk into a voting booth, and there will be a single choice for him to checK: "Yes."  And every day he will be told from the moment he wakes up to the moment he sleeps, "You are stupid, you are ugly, you are weak.  But together we are free, prosperous, and strong."  That is the true nature of the collapse: the reduction of the modern American man to a feudal serf, incapable of feeling love or hate, and unable to recognize his own self-worth.

Just recently there has been a huge political push to overthrow the United States government by its own members, and high ranking members of other nations. Obama has "failed" the military industrial complex by recalling troops from the Middle East and by not sending in troops during the "Syria chemical weapons" debacle, and Obama has "failed" Israel by not being more firm with Iran. Saudi Arabia is at risk of being exposed as a direct financial supporter of the 9/11 attacks, and Rand Paul had a speech about how Saudi Arabia is no longer an ally of the United States.  Netanyahu has been working directly with members of the US congress in an effort to overthrow Obama.  http://nypost.com/2015/02/18/bibi-why-im-speaking-to-congress/  "Why am I going to Washington? Because, as prime minister of Israel, its my obligation to do everything in my power to prevent the conclusion of a bad deal that could threaten the survival of the State of Israel. "  This means that Netanyahu doesn't believe Obama is working in the best interest of Israel, so he's working directly with members of congress to ensure that something happens to change that fact.  Rudy Giuliani, who was in on the 9/11 attacks, has directly attacked Obama http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/rudy-giuliani-obama-america-love/  Rudy Giuliani: Obama doesn't love America  Giuliani, a lapdog, has been making a big scene about Obama. Conservatives love Giuliani and believe everything he says.   Giuliani states that Obama was influenced by Communists http://nypost.com/2015/02/21/giuliani-obama-influenced-by-communists-since-youth/  Rudy Giuliani doubled down on his claims that President Obama doesnt love America in an interview with The Post Friday  claiming the commander-in-chief has been influenced by communists since his youth.  DHS intelligence report warns of domestic right-wing terror threat  http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/  They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority.  The DHS was given unlimited power after the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been linked with al-Qaida and the American public wants the "missing" 28 pages of the 9/11 commission reports to be declassified. Netanyahu has stated that 9/11 was very beneficial to Israel. These entities are trying to overthrow Obama and take control of America. Expect a false flag attack in the coming weeks, if not sooner. Afterwards the DHS will launch their plan to incarcerate any that oppose the coup.

I was raised with very limited cooking and food health knowledge and I think this might be a good forum for myself and others. Examples of food facts can be anything food related that you think people might not know, such as: spinach has more protein per pound than steak, or to keep your egg yolk from overcooking when making over-easy eggs poke a small hole in the egg yolk once you have the egg off the pan and on your plate.                                                      besides the obvious (healthcare, dental, etc..) what kinds of free stuff are we getting from work?                  Because it's humerus.      So I am bipolar and just recently started up on my meds while at the same time quitting smoking cigarettes and pot.

At the end of ME3 you have a chance to meld with Liara's mind in this sexy galaxy scene where she hugs your arm. I am now replaying a new career, and when speaking with Liara I find out that their species mates with any other species of any sex by exploring their mate's minds and their genetic material. Could Shepard's genetic material live on in Liara? Does anyone remember if Liara survives in the end?       Mine is the M-11 Wraith shotgun. Small clip size, but very powerful, accurate, lightweight, and very quick to reload.       Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera.   [EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.

Who would best uphold the ideals of the hive-mind?      at least where I'm at. Anyone else?            My roommate felt robbed after beating the game on the Wii. When I was a kid, I always thought the best part was when you made him bleed red blood , blooooody red blood at the end. Why is the Wii version green blood? Green blood stupid.      Nobody gives a fuck how many old cartridges you own.             Three things concerning Halo and it's sequels (anyone else feel this way?)   1. When I'm over at a friends house and the only multiplayer game they own is Halo, I instantly lose some respect for that friend.  2. When I am forced in a situation where I must play one or two minutes of Halo, it feels as if I am defying one of my base morals, and I lose a little respect for myself.  3. WTF? Another Halo? Doesn't anyone realize how much Halo sucks, and how awful it is compared to this generation's FPS (single and multiplayer) greats?   In conclusion, HALO SUCKS BALLSAKS.      	130

Thank you for doing this AMA. You might like this little Christmas story.  About 10 years ago about this time of year, I was visiting my mother in New York City. In December, tree vendors drive to the city from New England and other places, each with a truck full of trees, and set up shop at curbsides all over the city, selling their trees till they run out.   My mother has a small apartment and doesn't normally get a tree. One day I was walking past a tree seller and saw that he had taken some little branches about a foot or so long that had fallen from the larger trees, stuck each one into a piece of wood for a base, and put them next to a sign that said "Charlie Brown trees, $3." Naturally I couldn't resist, so I bought one and took it home, and my mother loved it. It stayed healthy-looking through the holidays.   So thanks to you and your husband for this and other additions to our culture.   We say there's nothing between Canada and Texas except a barbed-wire fence somewhere around Kansas. North Texas (where Fort Worth is) and, especially, the Panhandle get winter weather. Not as much as PA, but some.   a.k.a. canola oil. It's OK for massages.   The main difference is cost and the feeling you got a task-specific tool. Coconut oil is as good as anything with "massage" on the label.   Other good massage oils, besides coconut, are sweet almond oil and (my favorite) grapeseed oil. The expensive massage oils at the store are just something mundane like almond oil with some blend of scents; it's easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the cost.

    Access to the paper can be seen here:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264984751_The_effect_of_serum_origin_on_tissue_engineered_skeletal_muscle_function  Cow serum (FBS or FCS) is used to grow cells in a dish and is known to be highly variable which can effect cell growth and proliferation. This paper takes serum from different continents and finds that they alter muscle phenotype which is pretty surprising as that is hard to modify.   They don't identify what might cause this but speculate that differences in how cows are treated (e.g. growth hormone administration to cows is not permitted in the EU) and resulting hormone changes may be responsible.  It's unclear how drinking milk or eating meat might effect people and it was an in vitro study but I thought it was interesting.      People are going to have a spectrum of adverse reactions (from minimal/few to severe) which is shown in the paper and at the moment can't be predicted. The only way to know how you'd react is to take the drug.   It should be noted that the extra year survival is compared to those who only take one antibody (i.e. trastuzumab and docetaxol). and is not compared to a no treatment control. The treatment that caused this extra year (i.e. pertuzumab,  trastuzumab and docetaxol) costs $120K/yr, A 2006 study showed that trastuzumab alone cost 70K/yr (see end for source), not sure what it is now but I assume a little less given the costs in this study. The antibodies are the expensive part of the treatment due to how they are manufactured and the associated research costs. If you have no treatment with this aggressive form of breast cancer you;re looking at 6-12 months, old school chemo gives you 18 months, trastuzumab gives you 36 months and this one 48 months - so in a way it's $120K/yr for 3yrs survival.   "Am I suffering in that last year of life?" - Yes in that last year as the adverse effects of cancer get stronger you will suffer but that is the same as if you didn't have treatment. There is some anecdotal evidence (based on discussions with oncologists and personal experience) that some of these targeted cancer therapies (i.e. the antibody) can result in a more rapid last stage of death which would decrease the time suffering at the end stage of cancer (that is based on renal carcinomas treated with sunitinib a VEGFR and PDGFR inhibitor). If that is true (it's anecdotal/based on doctors observations not saying it's fact) then you would expect to spend less time in a hospital or hospice in your last year compared to no treatment.  "Does the last year bankrupt my family or financially burden them?" - Possibly but you're not forced to have the treatment and is something you'd have to discuss with your family prior to starting treatment. The cost of these treatments are amazingly high, particularly in the US due to the healthcare system (i.e. direct hospital/physician costs) and the cost of the drugs themselves (due to research costs of the drug and to cover the costs of other drugs which don't make the grade). In the UK (where I'm from), there is debate about providing these treatments on the NHS (i.e. for free) and a "postcode lottery" sometimes exists where a treatment is available in some areas but not others. The cost effectiveness of trastuzumab treatment in France can be seen here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19487912  The cost-benefit of this remains to be seen and unfortunately it won't be available for all due to the cost. Really, it's another treatment tool that can be used and in time as the costs decrease will be more widely available -  just like any other treatment.  2006 cost study: http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0 type=summary url=/journals/hastings_center_report/v036/36.3fleck.pdf   They used 2 antibodies (pertuzumab and trastuzumab also known as herceptin) which both block HER-2. HER-2 is found at higher levels in more aggresive breast cancer tumours (it's thought to increase/cause tumour cell proliferation) and it's level is associated with poor survival. The 2 antibodies bind to different areas of HER-2 and have been shown to act synergistically to decrease tumour growth.   Docetaxel stabilises microtubules which are important for a range of cellular processes including cell proliferation.   Basically the antibodies inhibit growth factor signaling pathways that promote cell growth, proliferation and survival. Docetaxel stops part of the machinery that is required for cellular function. By targeting different mechanisms you're in theory going to increase cancer death which is what they saw.   I think by "genetically predisposed" theathlete46 was referring to type I diabetics, who cannot produce insulin which is required to increase glucose uptake in muscle and brain. This treatment may help lower the dose of insulin they need to inject themselves with by increasing insulin sensitivity but they will still need to inject insulin to see the benefits of this potential treatment.  In terms of being predisposed and developing a disease being different things then I totally agree with you, I just interpreted the previous commentators differently :)   Like many drugs or compounds that effect metabolism there is potential for huge side effects, particularly with prolonged use. A preview to the paper states 2 possible side effects from the data in the paper: 1. May promote cancer cell growth - via the Warbug Effect/hypothesis. 2. May increases risk of CVD and stroke as the drug leads to intracellular accumulation of homocysteine - a known risk factor for CVD and stroke.  The link for the preview: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115000650   As far as I'm aware there's no info regarding how MOTS-c is controlled naturally. Given its role in this paper it is likely that exercise increases its levels and release (exercise can increase transcription of the mitochondrial genome which is where this protein is coded for).  The use of high-fat diets was to induce an obese and type-2 diabetic state as is often done in these studies and induces mitochondrial dysfunction - which likely decreases the levels of MOTS-c but wasn't tested for. In the paper they showed that fasting decreases MOtS-c levels but that was the only "natural level" they measured - everything was injecting the peptide into animals and drug treatments in vitro. The high fat diet was likely 60% fat, 20% protein and 20% carbs and the same calorie intake as controls, control diets are 10% fat typically and 70% carbs - this is based on the typical HFD model which was probably used.  In terms of diet for strength training, protein content and quality is more important for protein synthesis. The peptide in the paper activates AMPK which inhibits protein synthesis so you wouldn't want to inject it before you work out!  This is a good article linking the molecular level changes to diet but it does only focus on protein.   http://www.gssiweb.org/en/Article/sse-123-nutrition-and-the-molecular-response-to-strength-training   It's most likely the best way to engineer a muscle but the force measurements were from single-fibres and not the whole muscle. Tissue engineered muscle has poor transfer of force to the extracellular matrix and is less dense than native muscle and this way of testing force doesn't allow you to test those properties. Still a good study but findings a little over-hyped  	9
 I would also prefer to give my billions to Elon Musk than charity.  Give a man a spaceship, he'll sell it for fish. Teach a man to go build a spaceship, and he'll travel to a fish planet.      Think dogs cocking their legs  by a tree.         But why ?  They seem to have some capacity being used for whatever they can until they lose it.    nice                           /r/thathappened         C can be a name but it feels like an initial   this is what the mysterybox scam shops do   That user tried to give a technical argument.  He argued that the military like reddit AND the military internet traffic is routed through Eglin.   This does not spoil a theory of the military manipulating reddit.  It just means that there is no proof.    Is it not completely logical that they would do something like this?  Do you really think that the military would allow users to browse the internet using IP addresses traceable to geolocations ?  It could be used by an enemy to give away the position of their troops and other useful intelligence.  There are countless other security reasons that they would route military internet traffic through central hubs on a VPN and not just allow everyone to connect direct using the local ISP.    I'm not precluding anything dodgy going on but the explanation given is a reasonable basis on which to start theories.      This is one way I see them of handling the crisis.  Not seen many develop the theory.  However, ideas and rumours are making it to the news  * [Russia Plotting To start war on Israel - Plan includes shipping missiles to terrorist groups](http://www.wnd.com/2014/12/official-russia-plotting-to-start-war-on-israel)  If not war in the middle east, then some other world event to knock oil prices up.   N Korea?  Anyone else seeing such coverage or ideas?  Some dismiss it as anti-putin propaganda but I think it makes sense for some kind of covert provocation to rattle markets  and increase oil futures.   It is just how i see military logic panning out.  They got got some dangerous people there but they do not have the political will to keep them there.  So you got to wonder what options they consider.  Discussion of "criminals" implies a justice system.  Gitmo is outside of that.        I don't see how it affects peoples view of SOPA.     In fact people are going to be more in favor of piracy if corporations or goverments  are going to restrict what gets broadcast.      Strange thing that happened in the heart of the U.S., the ill-famed cesspool of injustice, is now afloat in the world as shocking news.  The Sony Pictures Entertainment, the biggest movie producer in the U.S., which produced the undesirable reactionary film "The Interview" daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and agitating even terrorism and had a plan to distribute it, was exposed to surprisingly sophisticated, destructive and threatening cyber warfare and has been thrown into a bottomless quagmire after suffering property losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  The public in the U.S. is now describing this case as "disgrace suffered by Sony Pictures Entertainment," "very sorry thing caused by the U.S.," "Sony Pictures Entertainment showing a white flag before hackers" and the "unprecedented disaster suffered by the U.S."  Those who meted out a stern punishment of justice were reported to be cyber experts styling themselves "guardians of peace".  Seized with terrible horror and threat in face of their merciless hacking attack in retaliation against unjust actions, many movie and drama distributors in North America including 41 states of the U.S. and Canada immediately canceled the screening of the reactionary movie. And it was reported that the Sony Pictures Entertainment which directly sponsored its production and distribution hastily issued a statement on Dec. 25 that it would suspend the screening of the undesirable movie which had been planned in 63 countries.  The NDC of the DPRK highly estimates the righteous action taken by the "guardians of peace," though it is not aware of their residence.  It, at the same time, considers as fortunate the step taken by the Sony Pictures Entertainment to give up the overall distribution of the above-said movie due to the decision and strong pressure of the movie and drama distributors for stopping the screening of the reactionary movie, though belatedly.  This is an official stand of the army and the people of the DPRK on what happened in the heart of the U.S.  This stand is taken by the DPRK because the movie "The Interview" is an undesirable and reactionary one justifying and inciting terrorism which should not be allowed in any country and any region.  Another reason is that the movie is run through with a story agitating a vicious and dastardly method of assassinating a head of a legitimate sovereign state.  No wonder, even political and social circles of the U.S. commented that it is quite wrong to defame the head of the state for the mere reason that his politics is different from that of the U.S. and it is in the hostile relationship with the latter and, therefore, the Sony Pictures Entertainment got into a serious trouble and paid a due price.  For these reasons, the DPRK is more highly praising the "guardians of peace" for their righteous deed which prevented in advance the evil cycle of retaliation-- terrorism sparks terrorism.  It is quite natural that the movie and drama producers should refrain from undesirable deeds contrary to the noble mission to lead morality and civilization.  But what matters is that the U.S. and its followers are groundlessly trumpeting that the recent cyber attack was made by the DPRK.  The FBI issued the results of the investigation into the hack at the Sony Pictures Entertainment on December 19.  According to them, it suffered tremendous losses.  One may say this is the due price incurred by wrong deed, the evil act of hurting others.  The U.S. released a statement asserting that this loss was caused by the DPRK.  No matter how big and disgraceful the loss may be, the U.S. should not pull up others for no reason.  The FBI presented a report on the results of technical analysis of hacking program used by the "guardians of peace" for this attack, citing it as the ground that the serious hacking was caused by the DPRK.  The report says the malignant code had access to north Korea's IP already known several times and the hacking methods applied in the "March 20 hacking case" and during cyber warfare against media and various other computer networks in south Korea in recent years are similar to that applied against the Sony Pictures Entertainment this time, being another ground that "this was done by the north".  The report, in particular, adds that the malignant code and algorithm applied during the attack are similar to what was used during the hacking attack on south Korea, citing it as a proof.  Not satisfied with those groundless "evidence", the FBI is letting loose ambiguous remarks that it is hard to fully prove due to the "protection of sensitive information sources."  This means self-acknowledgement that the "assertion about the north's deed" came from an intentional allegation rather than scientific evidence.  It is a common sense that the method of cyber warfare is almost similar worldwide. Different sorts of hacking programs and codes are used in cyberspace.  If somebody used U.S.-made hacking programs and codes and applied their instruction or encoding method, perhaps, the "wise" FBI, too, could not but admit that it would be hard to decisively assert that the attack was done by the U.S.  Moreover, the DPRK has never attempted nor made a "cyber-attack" on south Korea. The rumor about "cyber-attack" by the DPRK was a concoction made by the south Korean puppet regime and its plot.  After all, the grounds cited by the FBI in its announcement were all based on obscure sci-tech data and false story and, accordingly, the announcement itself is another fabrication. This is the DPRK's stand on the U.S. gangster-like behavior against it.  What is grave is that U.S. President Obama is recklessly making the rumor about "DPRK's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures" a fait accompli while crying out for symmetric counteraction, strict calculation and additionally retaliatory sanctions.  This is like beating air after being hit hard. A saying goes every sin brings its punishment with it. It is best for the guilty to repent of its evil doings and draw a lesson when forced to pay dearly for them.  The DPRK has clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie.  It is said that the movie was conceived and produced according to the "guidelines" of the U.S. authorities who contended that such movies hurting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and inciting terrorism against it would be used in an effective way as "propaganda against north Korea".  The U.S. Department of State's special human rights envoy went the lengths of urging the movie makers to keep all scenes insulting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership in the movie, saying it is needed to "vex the north Korean government".  The facts glaringly show that the U.S. is the chief culprit of terrorism as it has loudly called for combating terrorism everywhere in the world but schemed behind the scene to produce and distribute movies inciting it in various countries of the world.  It is not exaggeration to say in the light of the prevailing situation that the U.S. administration and President Obama looking after the overall state affairs of the U.S. have been behind the case.  Can he really cover up the crimes he has committed by trying so hard to falsify the truth and turn white to black.  So we watched with unusual attention what had been done by the "guardians of peace" to avert terrorism and defend justice.  Yet, we do not know who or where they are but we can surely say that they are supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK.  The army and people of the DPRK who aspire after justice and truth and value conscience have hundreds of millions of supporters and sympathizers, known or unknown, who have turned out in the sacred war against terrorism and the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, to accomplish the just cause.  Obama personally declared in public the "symmetric counteraction", a disgraceful behavior.  There is no need to guess what kind of thing the "symmetric counteraction" is like but the army and people of the DPRK will never be browbeaten by such a thing.  The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target is all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans.  The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the U.S. in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.  Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism, by far surpassing the "symmetric counteraction" declared by Obama.  This is the invariable toughest stand of the army and people of the DPRK.  Fighters for justice including "guardians of peace" who turned out in the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S. to defend human justice and conscience and to dismember the U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all sorts of evils and kingpin of injustice, are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world.  The just struggle to be waged by them across the world will bring achievements thousands of times greater than the hacking attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.  It is the truth and inevitability of the historical development that justice prevails over injustice.  Whoever challenges justice by toeing the line of the biggest criminal U.S. will never be able to escape merciless punishment as it is the target of the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S.  The U.S. should reflect on its evil doings that put itself in such a trouble, apologize to the Koreans and other people of the world and should not dare pull up others.

Just another day on reddit      In the category of stunning, heartening, woefully underreported good news: In 2000, an estimated 9.9million children around the world died before age 5. In 2013, the figure was 6.3million. That is 3.6 million fewer deaths, even as the worlds population increased by about 1 billion.   There are a variety of reasons for increased child survival, including improved prevention of malaria and HIV. But according to a recent report in the Lancet, about half of these gains came from reductions in pneumonia, diarrhea and measles  diseases addressed by vaccination.    What is exceptional about this particular public good is how much of it has been generated by a single source.  - Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance  supports vaccination for nearly 60 percent of the worlds children. It is a global conspiracy of health.  Gavi provides heavy but eventually diminishing subsidies for immunizations in poor countries. It also acts as a sort of purchasing co-op, helping nations get better prices on vaccines. And it amounts to a guaranteed market for vaccines that would not otherwise be profitable to research and produce.

Apply what you say to the media in general, then you got a point .   fair enough they want to overthrow Assad and you are right that it is a wider point.  I agree it is supporting one side more than another but I don't think it is a level of interference that should be polticised.  I expect that there are real and unsavory ways that they do support effort against Assad.     These militants in Syria are responsible for targeting civilians, were they doing that to Israel's people the medical care would precede imprisonment.  Indeed they would. I hope they would arrest those suspected of war crimes.  However, for them it is  syrian rebels fighting in a syrian civil war.  They probably don't ask too many questions.    I don't see it as ridiculous to characterise humanitarian assistance as a humanitarian act .  Do you want them not to treat fighters or not to be there at all?   Not sure of the equivalence of Hamas.  Maybe you can explain that?        in a way I admire it.  I had little appreciation of the power of economic sanctions but looking at this and looking back to what happened in soviet times help me see the power.  Of course a country struggling economically can react in a few undesirable ways.   For that level of functionality, I would use a javascript api   quick google would be  something like this.  https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/markercluster-with-mapbox-data/  It would be pretty cheap to grab a freelancer to get it done given that it is just adding your data using a programmer's tool.   I don't think people have a realistic understanding of what torture is.  If we substituted the word  "torture" for "rape" people might react a bit different and feel horrified.   It is just a word but it triggers people to the reality of what it is rather than viewing it as an enhanced interrogation technique.  I expect Shoving hummus up rectums is considered sexual assault/rape in some contexts and so this is how it should be described.    A programmer would give you advice about programming.  I can explain how to do it in HTML but it sounds like you are looking for a piece of software or an online wizard.  Maybe try /r/techsupport if no good answer here   I expect military hospitals are a hotbed of intelligence activity.     I think everyone tries to leverage events to their advantage.   You are looking for software advice rather than a programmer.      I think it is real. (a real hack but unsure of who is responsible)  However, I think Sony are trying to make the most of it now and will make big money out of the movie.  It is easy to slip into thinking that they planned it from the start.   However, I believe that there is real damage being done in the leaks.         Is there a broader point here that I am missing?  This is just combat footage/ hospital footage.  Treating the injured whether friends or enemies is a pretty basic and human thing.  I hope that people are not going to try and politicise it.  There are so many other things to notice about this region.   Vladimir Putin has blamed the west for the current crisis, and hes not alone. While locals have likened it to an economic war, some western commentators agree. Earlier this year, back when oil was still at around $88 a barrel, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman pointed the finger squarely at the US for the collapse. Widely accepted in Russia, is that the US and Saudi Arabia are colluding to keep production artificially high in a bid to drive the price down. The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran, at a time when Saudi Arabia and America are confronting both of them in a proxy war in Syria, he wrote. This is business, but it also has the feel of war by other means: oil.  **Just as they did to the last leaders of the Soviet Union, the Americans and Saudis are trying to pump them to  death**  http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/pump-them-to-death-the-secret-war-on-russia/story-e6frflo9-1227160860899      So the government is justified to use of anti-terrorism laws in local law enforcement ?   I've heard the funding terrorism argument enough when fighting small crime.            The constant distrust in the system is what has historically given rise to fascism  Check what happened in the 1930's with distrust of public officials etc.  So the current sentiment of how terrible the government is and how impossible everything seems to be a repeat of what empowered facists.     I will write more on it some time.  I know people here think their constant outrage at the system is a good thing.  Maybe it is healthy.  However, I see it as a danger.  It just depends on what predators are lurking.     ---------------  Some stuff from   http://thebeatlesneverexisted.com/  http://thebeatlesneverexisted.com/vh1article1a.jpg  http://www.thebeatlesneverexisted.com/Heights/63-height-comp-2b.jpg  eyebrows http://www.thebeatlesneverexisted.com/Eyebrows/mmfv1b.jpg   Background :    An off-shoot of the PID (Paul is Dead) phenomenon / legend.  I find the whole PID thing interesting, simply with regard to how many weird splinter theories have popped up:  * Paul died, and was replaced  * Paul did NOT die, but was replaced (often called "PWR" instead of "PID")  * Paul did not die, and was not replaced, but the "clues" point to a **SPIRITUAL** death and rebirth, as seen in Christianity, the ancient mystery schools, the occult, etc.  (The symbolic death and rebirth theory is a favorite of mine, and IMO one of the more plausible theories)  * ALL of The Beatles were replaced (Personally, I find this one extra silly. Replacing one guy would be hard enough. Replacing four of the most known guys on the planet? Good luck with that. Some people also insist that *many* celebrities were  replaced. Bob Dylan, Davy Jones, etc...)  * The Beatles were part of a conspiracy by The Tavistock Institute (and/or other groups) to change social attitudes, and/or destroy Christianity (be a  les(s), and/or brainwash youth.   I believe thebeatlesneverexisted.com falls somewhere between the last two categories. The general theory being that for some reason, The Powers That Be wanted to force social change in the 1960s, which they accomplished using "tools" like The Beatles. This is usually considered in a sinister light. I find some versions of this theory to be more plausible than others.   A researcher named Dave McGowan theorizes that the **entire** hippy movement / psychedelic rock scene in the 1960's was started by the government, as a social engineering project. Some aspects of this story are strange, and seem unbelievable, but he's collected a bit of information, some of which does seem... odd...  For example, some of the big psychedelic rock pioneers and legends come from military / intelligence families. For example, Jim Morrison's dad was one of these. Famously, when asked about his parents by reporters, Morrison claimed his parents were dead. (If memory serves, this can even be seen in Oliver Stone's biopic)  In reality, of course, this was not true. Now, this could be because he (or "they" if you want to be all spooky and conspiracy theory about it) wanted to distance himself from his military parents. And that *could* be to throw people off the trail of the conspiracy. But it could just as easily be due to the fact that rebel rocker Jim didn't want it known that he was a military brat.   One of the things that makes this story somewhat plausible to me, however... there is some minor evidence that the government / intelligence community may have been "behind" some of the proliferation of psychedelic use, and psychedelic culture. The CIA experimented with LSD for many years before it hit the streets. They even tested it on unwitting civilians, in one or two now-declassified programs. And some of the early major LSD "cooks" and gurus have ties to government and intelligence. Owsley. Leary. If you know much abut the history of Tim Leary, you may know he wrote a personality test the government supposedly uses to this day. And you may also know that the man got into quite a bit of hot water, and almost seemed to miraculously "weasel" out of it, unscathed. The Life article that popularized Magic Mushrooms? By R Gordon Wasson. A banker who supposedly had intelligence ties. The mushroom article that so fascinated the public, published in Life magazine, owned by Henry Luce. Another man with intelligence ties.   It's a bit complex and convoluted, but really fascinating stuff, if you're willing to read with an open mind.    You can read quite a bit more about Dave McGowan's theories about the ties between Hippies, Psychedelics, and the Intelligence community, in his work "Inside the LC" (Laurel Canyon, in California) on his website:  http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/   You can read more about the CIA's experiments with LSD (and much more) in the book "Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD: the CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond"  By Martin A Lee, and Bruce Shlain. Really excellent book. I can't recommend it enough.  And you can read (or listen) to more about intelligence ties to psychedelic culture (and lots of other related, and unrelated topics) over at Jan Irvin's website, "Gnostic Media."  http://www.gnosticmedia.com/  [Gnostic Media: The Secret History of Magic Mushrooms](http://www.gnosticmedia.com/SecretHistoryMagicMushroomsProject)  [Jan Irvin Interview:  Creation of the Drug Culture](http://www.gnosticmedia.com/the-corbett-report-interview-672-jan-irvin-on-the-cia-mk-ultra-and-the-creation-of-the-drug-culture/)   Tying all this back to The Beatles?  Well, let's just pretend for a moment that the government, or some other group *did* want people to take psychedelic drugs for some reason...  What better way to make it look more attractive, than to get Paul McCartney ("the cute one") on TV talking, quite unapologetically, about how *he* had taken it?   Or maybe that's not what happened at all. It's fun/interesting to think about, though.  Hopefully someone finds this interesting.                    ELI5 is not a platform for conspiracies.  It is about simple explanations.      /r/UpvotedBecauseGirl    Plus the synagogue tower in the background.  The scroll handing down the building also looks significant.  The font is reminiscent of hebrew text.  There may be more but I'm not exposed to this stuff to recognise it      Look closer.It is racist propaganda.  the imagery is blaming the jews as both the authority and power.  I pointed out the original in the thread and got downvoted.           Thanks.     Gamers... haven't lost a single fight in the history of the internet. Every single time they have ever fought in an issue dealing with censorship, insane ass people, and even against very idiotic journalists. They have won time and time again in the past in almost a unstoppable manner. We survived the 80/90's of parental fears and censorship by creating our own version of the ratings scale which is far more accurate and far better than even the movie industry. Instead of Teen rated games dragging down M rated games, each and every rating is independent and has remained so even in the wake of insanity that is Jack Thompson and California's insane bills. Jack Thompson is dis-barred and I am pretty sure he is officially looning it out somewhere in Florida. I could be wrong but I think that is the last place he was at. (Actually. This would actually be a pretty fascinating interview for some post career thing.) Anyone involved with the California bill has pretty much been a laughing stock since then. Then there are authors who have went on Fox news to talk about the evil's of video games and video gamers responded by trashing their books. In a way that is very petty but it does have the effect of getting the message clear... one which the anti-gamer gate really needs to listen to. Gamers are done being harassed. I have said this before in previous topics but I will restate it once more. Gamers are done being bullied. They want to peacefully be able to play video games, occasional read about video games and be able to feel like they aren't being judged for the games they play anymore. This is really simply it. And do you know something, Gamergate has lasted over TWO FUCKING MONTHS NOW! Two months of it under constant attack for simply asking questions. In all honesty, this kind of retention rate for something on the internet if fucking astounding in and of itself. Most people thought this would be done in a week, nope. Not even ME3's ending pissed people off this damn much. And judging by how tweets are going. This movement is only getting bigger and being talked about more and after the bully storm that is the mainsteam press is done when it usually does in terms of insulting gamers constantly. The dust will list and Gamergate is still going to be here. Wanna know why I know Gamergate is literally not going to be negatively effected by this? Because Gamergate is full of gamers. Gamers... are the most terrifying force on the entirety of the internet in existence. I say this as a gamer but in terms of forces you sincerely do not want to fuck with. It's gamers. Gamers by all definitions do not have a 'give up' thought in their brains. They believe otherwise. No matter how impossible of a challenge it is. They will seek to overcome it no matter the obstacle. No matter how much abuse they take and no matter how long it takes. Gamers are unstoppable due to the fact that they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve victory, they will do things thought impossible even by the games own rules or even exploit the rules to their own gain. They will wait and grind their power up until they can fully unleashed almost godlike characters within their games. Even then, they are some of the kindest people in history, the fact is. Most people never actually willingly ever do evil playthroughs in their video games. Talk to developers about it, it's the truth, hell, most people never even touched renegade options in ME series. Then there is the fact that they even have helped supported countless charities. Hell, even now people on twitch are playing games so some kids with cancer can hopefully become cured one day! Then there are moments where there are some poor people who really haven't played a video game in their life and people actually donate game systems and video games to them so they can play. The truth is that video gamers are willing to accept anyone into the hobby no matter the background. This has had some bad effects due to... well... assholes playing video games. But even then the truly despicable people are usually ostracized anyways. Gamers are merciless, they are patient, They are kind, they are giving, they are absolutely terrifying. Then there is the biggest fact of all that I think you all have noticed throughout this topic. Gamers do not actually care what gender you are. At all. The only reason you think they do is because people are pushing that gamers 'believe' in this or that without any real explaination or even proof. The truth is, yes, there are some assholes on xbox live and such, but are gamers as a whole assholes. Hell no. The fact is that we are not severely self policing ourselves just to prove without a shadow of a doubt that we don't take kindly to this shit should say that, even though there are assholes, we ourselves will help take care of them. But most of this is ignored. Either due to the fact that mainstream media has always fucking despised us or the fact that game journalists have finally shown their true colors and decided that their audience is made up of assholes. Gamers are not standing for it and this is the result. Gamergate, a movement which has been building for several years now. This is only going to become more and more well known until they cannot actually ignore gamergates side anymore. Then the house of cards will tumble and those that once thought of bullying us gamers will know that gamers wrath is fucking terrifying. Game journalists. We don't need you anymore and Gamergate has sufficient proof of that, we can communicate on our own, recommend games on our own. We gamers don't need your bias anymore. Good luck when the final blow is struck because I can personally assure every journalist out there about this one fact. Gamers are not just merciless, but vengeful, any job you will try and get in the future will immediately be intercepted and warned about your past behavior in public. This is what will happen and no place of integrity will ever touch you. Hell, even more fast food joints wouldn't even touch you if you have the kind of mouth people like Bob Chipman have about being pro censorship and even subjugating gamers who disagree with him to even the dude who helps run Gawker who wants to bully gamers. You will never have jobs after this industry. Gamers remember and never forget and if you want proof. Look at Phil Fish for a moment and tell yourselves this. Will that man ever have a job after the shit he pulled? No, no he won't. This is not a threat, but what will happen in the future just as I had known that Gamergate would have eventually happened one way or the other. Honestly. If you are anti-GG you need to know these things. Gamers just want peace and ethics. But since it is obvious that it isn't going to happen. Expect this entire debate to continue onwards for years and it is going to become more and more serious. Big edit. I should also mention that the word, 'impossible' is literally non-existent within gamers minds. This word and it's meaning holds no sway for gamers. These are people who, under 3 differing guilds within Everquest brought together 300 people to fight an ultimate dragon and actually managed to out heal it and out damage something people honestly thought was impossible to the point where developers shut down the fight and pissed everyone off for nearly winning something thought impossible. Then there are people who actively accomplish impossible feats against even the largest forces possible in video games. Hell, just look at Dark Souls. That entire game series is built upon accomplishing fighting fallen Gods and actually fighting them with respect and end up becoming a bigger badass than all of them. Hell, just look at a game like the entirety of the Shin Megami Tensei series. A series literally built upon even the most common enemies being strong enough to absolutely murder your sorry ass and instead you have to prove you are a badass by kicking the hell out of everything ass. Gamers don't understand what the word impossible even is. To them, it is a goal line to cross.     Is the depiction of the police playing to a stereotype of the jews?    I can't find the source of this.  Looks like an album cover judging by the format  Edit: a few downvotes without comments.  I noticed what I think is a synagogue in the background and so I can see the artist's intent .  The tapestry on the building looks significant too.   Ukraine will be building nuclear weapons.

I agree that it would be a great stunt but as a marketing stunt it would be limited to a vandalised facebook page or something.  It appears that real damage is being done beyond what a film can generate.

Sweden as a country that likes to pretend it champions net freedom, but itself does the exact opposite: did you know that Sweden has given the copyright industry powers of net surveillance that even the Police dont have?  Sweden likes to portray itself as a country that champions the importance of the net and its freedom, and is never late to criticize other countries, but is one of the worst offenders in the West when it comes to respecting this fantastic tool that upsets the old guard and the status quo. Today, we look at the curious IPRED law in Sweden. It was introduced in silence and shadow in the summer of 2007 by the Justice Departments Stefan Johansson, who has also been Swedens and the EUs negotiator at the ACTA table, and who has frequently been seen at Swedens Association For Copyright. The really insidious thing about the IPRED law is its name: it copies the name from a European directive (IPRED), but legislates things that the European directive explicitly doesnt contain or force Sweden to do. Therefore, politicians of all colors have defended themselves saying that Sweden must implement European Union directives, whereas in reality, they are pursuing their own agenda and trying to wash their hands of responsibility.  The law concerns the copyright industrys right to violate privacy  specifically, demanding subscriber identities of IP addresses, on allegations of violation of the copyright monopoly (typically, file sharing), and sue them in court where presumption of innocence does not apply. In Sweden, the Police may only break the privacy of identities behind IP addresses when the crime being investigated is severe enough to result in a jail sentence. But most file sharing cases have stayed at fines, and therefore, the Police does not have this power.  So Sweden has granted private corporate interests  the copyright industry  more extensive powers than the Police, in terms of cracking down on the Net and making dissent and civil disobedience dangerous.

It's also in these times I find it fantastic to live in Ireland where there are at least 5 different competing companies begging for a subscription. Which really shows how good regulations can increase competition and remove monopolies.   Did someone say Solar Freaking Roadway?   Original journalism on Reddit. Wow!      God bless the SAS. They're one of the biggest reasons not to screw with Britain.    originally it was "the people" but they wanted "my people" and so it took some chopping and trickery but you saw through it   This is awesome.  I will mix it into a little educational montage.  Meanwhile, enjoy the gold!   Britain should recruit british citizens to become fighters.  There would be plenty of volunteers especially if it was a government endorsed program to support the moderate syrian opposition and not terrorists.  Somehow they won't allow that but will fuel those already there including foreign fighters.   They aren't destroying online freedom.  They are monitoring it and eroding privacy.  The law of the country applies online and offline.  So question the fundamental laws.  "Freedom" should not only exist online and I think it is annoying that people try and reserve online as a place to be free.  People should be free everywhere especially scotland.   maybe the fact that big industry types are not getting involved tells you something.

 I thought that possibly too, but if OP's baby was screaming because of the entity, then I don't think I'd rule it a nice one.   It's always interesting to meet a fellow empath. I've been sensitive to pretty much all energies. I know it can get overwhelming too, so let me be the first to say I believe you! I've dealt with several supernatural entities over the years, and I really do think they mess with us just because we can notice them easier than other people. It's scary to know something's in your house that can move things and touch you, especially when you may be the only one who notices. I hope the entities you've encountered haven't been too oppressive over the years, they can really drain you.  	2

 Holy Mother of God! They are sooo beautiful    I like Australis among the flaws that several have reported.    One thing that totally breaks up the user experience is the sliding tab movement.    What I've noticed it that is as long as the mouse pointer stays in the tab's area, then movement is smooth and perfect as usual; but the moment i go a bit down and over the Awesome bar or anything in vicinity, the drag movement abruptly stops.   Honestly, its a total ruin because nobody can be so precise in maintaining the drag movement in such a small area.    Please borrow idea from the competition and extend the drag-able area to the Awesome Bar also.   Only then during fast browsing session can people feel the speed, mainly due to lack of disruption.

And it include the normal browsing phase, HD connecting and internet inactive phase, and the back to normal phase once i disconnect the HD   1) 09:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)   2) where do i find the logs to copy paste?   Wifi works on windows 7 after connecting the external HD.   It seemed fine in ubuntu(long back)   ive got a seagate external usb hard disk and for some reason my Wifi stops working once i connect it. I browse through my android phone and the internet work super smooth at these times. The current fix is only to disconnect the hard disk and continue browsing.    Its a Dell N5110 15R system with Fedora 20 completely updated. Any way to fix this issue?     just try uninstalling/reinstalling the font support package via fedy itself. Fedy installs infinality http://www.infinality.net/ package for better font rendering.   i guess ill have to buy a new good phone without a physical menu button :D XD    Yeah that's true, its just that it would be great if important buttons are laid out like the desktop version....hey! wait, is it possible to have a disappearing menu/button bar area, just like the new facebook app which has "status | photos | activity" that disappears while scrolling down and re-appears while upward scroll?    If the phone has a physical menu button, no menu should be displayed, unless the app has an outdated Manifest (might be the case for Twitter for all I know).    Yeah that's it, the tradeoff between physical/virtual menu button. i feel it'll be best left to the user if he/she wants to enable the 3 dot menu button on phones with a physical menu button.   i feel the most important buttons such as back, forward, refresh should be in a much more easily accessible location on the screen, instead of going through a menu.     And thank you for the mention of gestures- will get an add on right away :D       on large screen phones, while holding it one hand, reaching the menu key to refresh or reload the page is painfully annoying.    People need to shift the phone position just to do a simple refresh.   And on large screen size phone's the 3 dot menu is not provided(due to design guidelines by google), but the Twitter app has still provided it. Some sort of fix or user choice enable/disable menu/custom button should be provided near the tab count icon.   The earth also, but we don't share it very well like the internet    Found that the twitter app on my phone has the menu option enabled - https://imgur.com/UfPwUUN  Guess sometimes user-experience comes first.   but at-least leaving an option in something like about:config would have helped lots of users out, instead of just disabling this menu button completely. :(   Its a Micromax A110 Canvas 2. Yes it is has capacitive buttons on the bottom of the screen.  But the lack of a Soft-Menu button is a deal-breaker :(   Since this is a phablet type(5-inches) device moving the finger from the screen to the bottom just to access menu button is quite frustrating.   The FF team should have provided this option to the users to enable/disable the virtual menu button :( :(  Edit - runs on stock android jelly bean 4.1.1   I love it!   I Use the latest version Firefox Beta 29 (android) on a Micromax A110 Canvas 2 Device which runs on Jelly bean.   I've noticed a three dotted menu button in various screen shots and other devices, but i do not have one :/    Screenshot - https://imgur.com/cWb8yKn    It kinda ruins the browsing experience because it is such a big phone and reaching down to access the capacitive buttons is totally a mess.    Anyone know of a fix?     It is in the works, a project called Electrolysis    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YkWWAAglJ8   :)   happy to help! :)   well, if you have a no-history state, then you can pin in all the sites you enter the first few times. You can Drag and re-order them too.    You can also pin the bookmarks by dragging and dropping them on any of the thumbnail.

Take a look at Syria, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, China etc.   Forget the internet in places like North Korea.    This is the why Mozilla has taken a stand to support a free and open web among other things.    Over the past few year, so many policies and controlling measures have come in to the world on controlling internet usage.    We have seen SOPA, PIPA, NSA, NETRA(india), CMS(India) etc. that have been proposed to control the flow of content and hamper sources over the internet.   This Clearly breaks the foundation of free speech, privacy among various other issues.    Please take a stand and Join the effort - http://mzl.la/QQRcMM  YOU are the change and YOU are in charge!    Our voice maybe tiny but it definitely leaves an impact in the world community, which the internet truly is, a global one.    NOTE - Though you may or may not be a user of the Firefox browser. Please consider sharing this piece of info of your fav. social networks!   It is no way a campaign to download the latest Re-designed version of the Firefox Web Browser(but if you do download/use, thank you for keeping the community strong)     Beautiful   Felt the same way too :D  Good move Mozilla by launching Firefox and this on the same day         I've made a newbie linux guide. Hopefully you should find it useful! :)   https://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/linux-a-newbie-desktop-users-guide/  Share it with your friends, family if you would like to. Peace! :)   oh, thats bad :/  But if someone could figure out something like the new linear loading bar, it would be awesome! ;)   Thanks a lot for help and time! :)   ah yes it is indeed an external mouse. i've used it before without problems, but probably some update package has caused this :/   THIS IS SO GOOD :D    I've noticed when I access the Options to tap-click things likes sync, customize, Mozilla etc. there this certain animation of one screen closing and the tap-clicked option opening up.   Thing is on low powered(512MB) devices, there is a noticeable lag while this switch takes place.   Is there anyway to disable this animation?   Me too!    Im having an issue while using the scroll wheel on my mouse. If im scrolling down a page, sometimes out of nowhere, it bounces lightly and scrolls upward a bit. This is mighty frustrating on long webpages when, i have to go through this effect every few lines that get scrolled. The mouse works perfect and I've tested it in windows too without any problems.   Anybody have a solution?      i use the nightly and the beta, the rounded back button still doesn't seem to pushed into beta yet.   Hope it comes soon, makes the interface equal and standard over different platforms.   like the new website idea a lot! :)   i initially thought it was a gnome desktop with lots of beautification.      http://imgur.com/sXoizoK  Mag lines travel in a particular direction, if im not wrong, so wont this cause and upward force, considering the force lines flow from bottom to top?   this is what i meant, just wanted to know if its possible.     Well if that's the case, then keeping one magnet fixed and the other in a container above the stationary one, the magnet should float or hover right?   I'd like to know if magnets on their own or using some combo can produce repulsive force of order like 1000N or so?  What factors hamper such things, like area, material etc?   Personal BeliefCompany PolicyWhat i want to do with my money!  Edit-I don't care about the down votes and all, but I wouldn't hate America or Americans because Obama or George W. Bush was the President.    Twitter follows the emoji pack - https://twitter.com/Support/status/451399393850052610   i'm not seeing the Anti-Firefox page now. But the damage has been done. A big one i believe.   Time to boycott OkCupid. There are thousands of people who may or may not support the LGBT groups, but seriously WTF is it got to do with a non-profit that makes a pro-privacy browser?  Edit : They(OkCupid) have to publicly apologize and make up for all the lost Firefox users.   They should get sued!       You'll have the Segoe UI Symbol Fonts i guess   well, technology evolves.   But yeah i agree, there isn't much consistency over these symbols on different platforms      Just found that these two packages are available for Emoji support for Fedora Linux - gdouros-symbola-fonts   google-android-emoji-fonts  Made a blog post to help stranded users - http://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/emoji-on-fedora-linux/  Also color emoji support might come soon if Noto Color Emoji comes upstream   thanks a lot, i hope something similar exists on fedora :)   The logo instead of the 'O' in fox - awesome! :D   I get these  - boxes with number's when i see an Emoji. Is is because im on Linux or is it the browser issue?   Some of them are rendered pretty though.   Good Going! I Just hope more people are aware about this project! :D         ah yes, just saved the the top result on google ^ _ ^ '      yeah thats also nice! :D   create a new profile   i just made a rendition of mine http://imgur.com/FDM2nkz   its the flat-look effect.   can we have a Firefox logo somewhere?   http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration/  This link is all you need at first. Install the repo's there and if you like terminal do a - "yum install vlc"    Bang-on! Prefect hit all those points. Though i love the whole shift to Australis, the issues above are worth pondering and acting upon   www.nsa.gov   The Direction looks stunning in the trailer   oh okay :) Ive been trying to solve an issue involving these option, so just wanted to know if there was a manual page.   Thanks! :)   This is the newer version that works for me(Some inconsistencies are present):      @namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);          #urlbar {-moz-appearance: none !important; background-color: #FFFFFF; border-radius: 20px !important;}         #search-container textbox {-moz-appearance: none !important; border-radius: 20px !important;}  Edit - The code lines posted by @shortkey work perfectly on Firefox for Windows.   The above lines are for Linux versions of Firefox   hey can i know from where you find out parameters like #urlbar and its associated options?   Nothing is. NSA clearly has an upper hand now.   All we as common people do is enforce encryption in the services we use.   It only increases computation time to break codes then.         they have to be manually changed I guess.    Yes this would be most serious roadblock. Also I am not sure if different drivers would be available for these totally different kind of old hardware presen  Installing Linux takes 10 Minutes. Legacy Hardware support is quite good.   If its new Machine orders, manufacturers take care of preloaded OS.   If its in use they have to be manually changed I guess. Once the switch is made OTA updates are possible to upgrade Linux Distro's.  Survival of Fittest.    Distro Dev's are contributors to Kernel Codes.   The post was about Linux not Unix. Out of the blue a Unix Kernel talk came and its reached so far. I'm done talking.  Have a Good Day.    Error Reports dont just go out in the name of UNIX. It goes back to the developers(Here apple and FreeBSD). If its somebody else who developed the UNIX variant, it goes back to them.   Please go use a new good Linux Platform, you'll understand the way in which bugzilla works these days by auto uploading your bug-reports, even without you providing any details of the bug. All you need to provide is your email and password during the initial setup of the bug reporting tool.    SER as you says only collects and gives to Micro - true, but whats the use if you pay for an OS that doesn't fix your problem??? Why are people wasting $ on a company that chooses if it has to fix your problem or not?    This whole topic was on Linux and Windows.   I did mention a bit above that Linux and Unix are two different things.    This whole forum was on Linux.    And as for Unix, FreeBSD a variant of it does the above. Also does Mac OS X which is a derivative of Unix, they do it well too.   It does, it does!  My error was on my end, not the mechanism   Damn you've got to be kidding me.    Linux has Bug report systems like ABRT, Bugzilla. And they do a Better job than Send Error Report(which i haven't seen fix any errors).    I dont know if you mean Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya, CATIA  as poorly designed apps. But ive got a heck load of problems when i used to work with them.   And as for so called "unix distros don't have any central company to supply updates"   Maybe you should use Ubuntu or Fedora and see how wonderful they handle updates.(That includes core kernel updates without breaking the system). Also you're able to Upgrade the entire OS to the latest version from these central repositories.   I use windows for my gaming, i love it for that. Its the only place it shines.  For work its Linux, because its reliable and stays solid        Since Fedora is a community based Distro, i feel it'll be great to have some feedback from them itself for the Fedora Project to be leaders again in the Free Linux OS field.  I've been using Linux dating long back to Redhat Linux 7 and onwards. There have been amazing changes. Since ive used Linux so long, its real hard for me to go back to my Windows OS.  Here are few areas i feel Fedora Project need to pay more attention to:  1. Looks:   We have all the icons and everything is symbolic. Its perfect. But where it lacks is that its not aesthetically pleasing. People always tend to judge a product by its finish and looks. One amazing example here is Apple - Im sure most mac buyers don't go into the details of the OS or its usage and purpose, but just give into the looks of the product. The color palette needs a refresh i feel.  Currently its functional not pleasing (from the eyes of a normal user)  2. Tutorials:   We need to provide the common user an OFFICIAL source of Text and Video based tutorial regarding things like installation, Music, Movies, App Installation etc. It should be clean and no Gimmicks. And the best way to host them would be TORRENTS!   3. Default Packages:   This is one part im a bit sad about. Previous version of Fedora came with the big guns of open source like GIMP, games etc. but most of it is removed these days.  Normal people wont want all the other packages(they consider it junk) just like all the those preloaded android phone apps from manufacturer's.  4. Do NOT scare the new user    New users Judge a product within 30 seconds i feel. If they feel its complex, they leave, if its too simple, they question and wonder. Just provide what is needed. FAQ are the best way to address.  5. Bug Reports   This is daunting for a new user. They go through this unknown thing called ABRT, then Bugzilla, (GOD WHAT's Happening :O) They have been scared to death already now. We need to simplify this process. And make them understand how things work on the open source end.  6. Customization   This was what Linux is all about.   Fedora needs to point users to where they can find new content like themes, icons (that's what a normal user cares to find)    7. Proprietary Package   I know this is the No! NO! but normal user eventually need them for their Graphic Cards etc. The community should make people understand that its OK for them to install but the packages are responsibility of the company providing them. A video might help clear the air.   8. Media, Formats etc   Another important area where we should educate users that they can watch their favorite movies, or listen to songs in Open Source Formats, BUT, since half the world moves on mp3, avi etc, options are always available to install player like VLC etc.  9. Social Media   Maybe the open world doesn't agree with Facebook but that's where users are and that's where users share their content. We need to make a definite presence.  10. Presentation   Easy to understand, clean and visually beautiful. Hit them right and i guess the world will start following.  We have YouTube/Torrents to share all this Tit-bits of knowledge for free!  Do share in  your views! :)        I would like the make the Awesome bar rounded on the ends, also the Search bar. How can this be done? I've looked into add-ons, sadly didn't find any.     Thanks for the update to the nightly channel.  The white outline surrounding the icons, like the bookmarks, home etc. really help visibility! :D. Hope it comes to the actual release!  If you guys could just make the close button rounded like the new "back" navigation icon, it'll just be an epic win!  Go Australis!      Does anyone know what's the difference between drivers provided by Intel graphics installer and the original ones that come with the distribution?   I used a fully updated Fedora 20 Distro on a laptop with an Nvidia 525M Card. Its Optimus technology based. I've read that kernel 3.13 comes with inbuilt power management features, so do i need bumblebee here after? I've tried uninstall and reinstall the packages and drives using "yum reinstall bumblebee bbswitch bumblebee-nvidia" to no avail. Anybody else here in the same boat? *the bbswitch package was updated to ver. 8   I've noticed that firefox always needs to download the persona to display after launching the browser, this might be (just) okay on the desktop but on mobile its quite a resource hog and slows the start up performance of the browser. There is a severe lag, when the connection is slow.  Why cant it be stored in the SD-Card or the Hard disk and be loaded straight from there?     i would like to know about your favourite clients on xmms2, do you still use the old or the new version and much more, Considering these were(or maybe still is) the best music player Linux will ever have! To the Devs of xmms2 - please a standard out-of-the-box GUI _/\_   Here's the link to the trailer - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U  Its not on the Soundtrack of the film :( It comes from some other source.  From a post on last.fm i found a few words of the lyrics  The lyrics appear to be -- "don't you worry ... about the flight yeah ..." ... "careful and true... we've flown..." ..."sing for the way we've grown... we grow..." last.fm post -  http://www.last.fm/forum/5/_/527438  It might be an Australian band too, the film comes from Australia.             how do i know what chords can be played with what notes? I mean to ask if there is any rule that states that so and so notes and only be played using these chords? And also how do i develop my chord knowledge. Thanks!     	113

I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro.   C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.    Your sister is a certified qt3.14   Iguana meet this girl.

I know quite a few people who have more than a hundred dollars left though :)   This design was submitted. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29374/Sample.png Who could possibly say that the design that was chosen is better than this one? The quality of the submissions was not the problem here.   Not very good, the teacher is pretty bad and doesn't teach econ very well. Fortunately, I took AP Micro in high school, so I was able to do well.  It's not a particularly hard class, so if you're able to get through her B.S. teaching you'll be able to get an A.    I can't believe CMU ended up with this design. With our amazing design and arts school, I never expected this would happen.  The petition that was created the first day of voting did nothing, and the creator of the petition was told to take it down because it might offend the creators of the design. I highly doubt anything we do at this point would be able to change anything.    it's bytes, like I said CMU's internet is INSANE.  and Donner looks super ugly from the outside but it's pretty nice inside.    I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine.   The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine).

 I am noting the plural, and I wish you noted the singular and capitalization of what I had written.  I said that a cynic might take the position that the Court, singular, capitalized, and in context, clearly the Supreme Court, seems to use standing to hear cases it wants to and not hear cases that it doesn't.  I went on to elaborate about how standing jurisprudence is incongruous. (And it is.)  Which relates to my original point-a cynic might well find that the Court (singular, capitalized) has made these incongruous decisions on standing based on politics.   Not sure what the bolding is for.  Lujan creates a new standard for standing. Lujan requires an injury in fact to a legally protectable interest, that has to be concrete, particularized, has to be within a concrete particularized injury within the statute, imminent, actual, and not conjectural. Redressability is another big hurdle for standing that Lujan delves into-in order to have standing, it must be likely that a favorable court decision can redress the harm at issue.  One major element of Simon is that it was a case about redressability. Yes, the complaint described instances in which the individual respondents were refused treatment. This part could not be said to be speculative. But still no standing because the S.Ct. found that a favorable decision would not necessarily mean that the harm would be redressed.  This brings us back to Duke. Many of the harms listed in Duke were not imminent or actual, were not concrete, and were conjectural. The Court in Duke did not run through the full eleven criteria the Court created in Lujan. Why the different standards of standing? Politics. The types of injuries in fact alleged in Duke were not different in their redressability from those of Simon. Ruling in the plaintiffs' favor would not have necessarily meant the harm would be averted or redressed. The Court decided this did not matter and they could still get to the merits. Why the different standards of standing? Politics.  The case law on standing is contradictory and incongruous. Period.   Sure. Compare Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, Simon v. Eatern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, and Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.  All three are standing cases.  In Lujan, the Court finds that there is no relationship between the harm sustained, traceable to the government, and that the harm is too speculative.  In Simon, the harm was, again, too speculative to be considered the concrete injury required by Article III.  In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., the claims at stake were no more speculative than in Lujan and Simon. Nevertheless, a majority wanted to decide on the merits so they could bring certainty and stability to the nuclear power industry. Sure, the claims at issue were, if judging by previous decisions, speculative, but by finding there was standing, the Court could (and did) then go on to uphold the constitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act that puts a cap on damages from catastrophic nuclear accidents. This cap is required, for practical purposes, for nuclear plants to get insurance and so by taking the case and ruling the way they did, the Court was able to help the nuclear industry. Pure politics.  (And to illustrate the speculative nature of the claims in that case, note that one of the rationals for upholding the damage cap was the argument that in the event of a catastrophe, surely Congress would devote extra resources to relief efforts. A: Is there anything more speculative than guessing what Congress would do in response to something; and B: must have been a sign of the times because today, it would be very much in question if Congress would devote any further resources to relief!)   But in practice, it's not so simple. The cynic's view of standing is that it is a doctrine used to decide cases when the Court wants to decide a case and duck cases when it doesn't.   Arbitrator: "His actions were not reckless to the point that he was knowingly risking injury to others."  He lit a co-worker's vest on fire. With co-worker still in the vest. How could he not have known he was risking injuries to others?   Perhaps the caller confused authorized dealers with authorized service centers? http://www.sennheiserusa.com/serviceandsupport_warranty   That looks wonderful and it has inspired to make this tomorrow-thank you!   Sorry to hear that happened to youthat's awful. :(   It might make them more suspicious of you than impressed by you.   *sigh* I guess I underestimated the stupidity of people. Yeesh.   If the bill turned out to be counterfeit, not only could you reinstate the fine on the computer, you also had his name, address, and other contact information.  If he walked out of the door with something of value, ok, dropping a $50 or above and running can seem sketchy. But for a library fine? Respectfully, I don't see the problem.   That's actually a rather clever idea!   Casablanca. Just thinking of the opening scene (with the map), I can hear the narrator's voiceover in my head. "....But the others wait in Casablanca. And wait. And wait. And wait." The map itself is visually gorgeous and it the scene sets the tone for what follows.   There are plenty of sanctions against the DPRK already, and there isn't much we can do. There was little ability to do much even before North Korea became a nuclear power, and now that they are, there's REALLY not much we can do.   Boston?   Sounds suspicious to me. I'd suspect them to be either stolen or a brick in a box.   My condolences on your loss, monolithburger. He looks like a very nice, funny person. You and your family are in my thoughts.   I like appointed judges over elected judges. The work of courts is supposed to be apolitical and cases are too nuanced and individualized for campaigning.   I have never forgotten my freshman government class where we watched campaign videos from judicial elections. There was an attack ad against an incumbent judge blasting him for never once sending a criminal to prison. Well, that was true-the judge did never send a person to prison. The judge was a district court judge, and so only heard misdemeanor cases, where the maximum penalty was 2 and a half years in jail, not prison.  After that, I definitely prefer appointments to elections.   The keynote speaker, Dartmouth College Professor Donald Pease, is reputed to be excellent. Friends of mine took classes with him and have universally had nothing but good things to say.      Kevin Coughlin's suggestion to require very noticeable green license plates for sex offenders would not protect children, it would lead to executions and assaults of sex offenders. And even for those who believe that's acceptable (and unfortunately, many believe protections of law don't apply to all), the collateral damage of shooting a sex offender driving 55 miles an hour on a highway or the falsely accused offender etc. would be awful.  Not to mention that definitions of sex offender vary considerably. Masturbating in a porn theater, public urination, public sex (which could be getting laid, at night, in the back seat of a car, in a lover's lane or deserted parking lot) flashing, a 17 year old making porn of themselves, high school students sexting, or a high school senior sleeping with a sophomore, can be enough to make the sex offense registry in some states. The sex offense registry has morphed beyond it's purported aims of protecting kidsthere's no evidence that someone busted for some of these offenses make one any more likely to target kids.   From what I've gathered, Markey wasn't comparing the substance or equating the two as equally wrong, just that there was an equal need to overturn a S.Ct. precedent. It was a procedural comparison, which Republicans are falsely portraying as a substantive comparison.   Replace Geoffrey Rush with Jim Carrey as Lionel Logue in the King's Speech. Just imagine what Logue would teach King George VI to sound like!   Study, but don't overstudy. It's a pass-fail exam and every point you get over passing was time you could have spent doing something fun or meaningful.   Honestly evaluate your skills. How did you do on big closed-book exams in law school? How long did you study and what result did you get? Extrapolate your individual needs and talents to figure out a realistic amount of time you'll need to study.  Beyond that, if you're halfway decent at multiple choice exams, the multistate section is not so bad. And for the essays, treat them like any other issue spotter exam, don't panic, use clear reasoning, and you should do fine.   Classic mythology was created by people who were trying to explain the world around them and didn't have the scientific knowledge to give an accurate account. They knew that thunder and lightning occurred, didn't know why, and so they believed that there was some dude on Mount Olympus throwing lightning bolts. And hey, peacocks kind of look like eyes, so, peacocks must be related to eyes! Etc., etc.  People who read news accounts of the legal system don't know the law, don't understand the basics of the system and certainty not the complexities, and so instead, they come up with their own mythology about how the legal system works. The more bits and pieces they come across, the more confirmation bias is at work and convinces them that they are right about how things work. And hey, any little piece that gets rebutted doesn't matter because they aren't experts and it's okay to get a few minor details wrong.  This is how we end up with people claiming that calling something Sprawlmart instead of Wal-Mart or calling it the fast food joint with golden arches saves it from being libel. It's not much different than people running around claiming to be sovereign citizens, claiming the income tax is unconstitutional, or claiming that writing a status message on your Facebook message can exempt you from changes to Facebook's privacy policies. It's the psychology of conspiracy theories, just not applied to conspiracies.   The Wave   Ronald Kessler's books are pretty decent... And James Bamford's books on the NSA (The Puzzle Palace/The Shadow Factory/Body of Secrets) were good too.   Back in the Fall, on several Friday afternoons, IIRC.   I'm glad you're okay. The pics and video I've seen looked scary.   There's 2 violinists from a PG County youth orchestra that sometimes played at the top of the Friendship Heights station 3 or 4 months ago. They were really good, the acoustics worked pretty nicely bouncing around the circular stonework (minus the screeching of the escalators), and I tossed a few bucks their way every time and stopped for 5 minutes or so.  Then again, I saw them on my way home. Had I been off to work at the time, I'd probably have just kept going.  Getting in trouble with bosses isn't worth listening to a street musician, even if it's Joshua Bell in disguise. I'd rather get paid and have the money to see him in concert!   Dahl also specifically stated, "Theres a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didnt just pick on them for no reason."  Dahl claimed to draw a distinction between being an anti-Semite and being anti-Israel, but it's safe to say he was both.   There's a neat museum you may have missed: the Kreeger Museum, in NW near American University. It's a private museum, in the former home of a Geico President, with works from impressionists, American artists, an African art collection, etc. all things that the Kreegers acquired.  It's open to the public Friday and Saturdays without reservations, otherwise, you can call to make a reservation during the week. (They're closed Sundays and Mondays.) The cost of admittance is $10.  http://www.kreegermuseum.org/plan-your-visit/hours-and-directions   This case should not have gone to the merits.  I join with Columbus School of Law Professor Victor William's difficulty in reconciling Canning v. NLRB with Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993). Nixon involved the political question doctrine with the Supreme Court deciding that the separation of powers prohibited judicial meddling into/judicial review of the nature of a Senate impeachment trial process that used a committee of 12 senators to actually try the case, and then all 100 senators voting. Professor Williams describes the ruling in Nixon as, "[T]he Court explicitly ruled 'the word try in the Impeachment Trial Clause does not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to the Senate' The nations highest court would not conjure a definition of the word 'try.'" (from http://dccircuitreview.com/2012/12/14/reply-political-question-answer-to-recess-appointment-test/, internal citations omitted.)  Williams then goes on to make that argument that if the Supreme Court wouldn't create or settle on a definition of the word try, courts should not define the word recess either. Quoting the language of Nixon, Williams writes, "Just like the word 'try' in the Impeachment Trial Clause, the word recess in the Recess Appointment Clause 'does not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to the [president].'" (Id., again, omitting internal citation).   And she got away with killing Vince Foster, too, right?   (And note that I don't give a damn about her political future. I care about protecting the independent judgment of prosecutors, even when I disagree with them.) I am in no way affiliated with Carmen Ortiz, the DOJ, or any government-related organization.)   Downvote me all you want, but what precisely is the lesson that you want to teach?   MIT didn't call the Secret Service. JSTOR didn't either. MIT called Cambridge Police, Cambridge Police brought Secret Service into it through a member of the Electronic Crimes Task Force.  The Patriot Act established the ECTFs. ECTFs can get involved in crimes with significant community impact. This is a term of art that allows the Secret Service to intervene much more broadly than you suggested, imustbreakyou.  Did the Secret Service have to get involved? No. Is their involvement a sign of a broader, politician-driven conspiracy? Also no.   It's not a grand conspiracy. One of the Secret Service's primary areas of responsibility is cybercrimes. It's their area.  I don't see any evidence Swartz's activities were significant enough to rise to the attention of any politicians.   I'm not suggesting that they should not both be punishedI'm saying that the punishment for a hacking breaking into a bank's computer to steal money and an 18-y-o high school senior breaking into a school computer to change a failing grade shouldn't be given the same punishment.   Unlike some who are (figuratively) seeking US Attorney Carmen Ortiz's head for her office's prosecution of Aaron Swartz [1], the EFF's Marcia Hoffman lays out a practical solutionreform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The CFAA is incredibly overbroad. If my technologically-impaired mother, who still once in a while needs a gentle reminder on how copy-and-paste works, is capable of committing a hacking offense under the CFAA, the statute is too damn broad.  A senior lawyer with the DOJ's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section has informally taken the position that merely using an open wifi network that does not, in its name or otherwise, explicitly make it clear that it is open to public use, could be prosecuted under the CFAA. The same for use of a coffee shop's wifi network if not in the coffee shop. Use of a neighbor's unsecured wifi should NOT be a federal crime.  As Hoffman points out, the CFAA does not define what authorization means or requires in the context of the state prohibiting gaining access to someone else's computer "without authorization" or in a manner "exceeding authorized access." The obvious fix is to define what authorization is. This shouldn't be a term of art that can be stretched to fit behavior computer owners or the government does not like. (I'd go so far as to question whether the statute should be deemed void for vagueness, but I'll concede that is impractical-I wouldn't expect a court to actually rule that way.)  The potential punishment for violations of the CFAA are not proportionate to the potential offenses. It's one thing to throw the book at someone who hacks a bank or ATM network to steal money or someone engaging in corporate espionage, and another to throw the book at Swartz, or a college student trying to change grades, or a teen banned from a videogame server trying to find a way around said ban.  I have said elsewhere on Reddit, and I'll repeat here, that I don't believe folks should be making an example of Carmen Ortiz by trying to get her removed, anymore than it was appropriate for Ortiz's office to try to make an example out of Swartz. The problem is not that Oritz and her office violated prosecutorial discretion or exceeded the bounds of the lawthe problem is that her actions and that of her office were entirely within her discretion and that her reading of the CFAA statute was entirely reasonable.

Yes-there was a short-lived midseason replacement run on CBS called First Monday, starring Joe Mantegna, about the Supreme Court. It was enjoyable, but didn't catch a big audience.... (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Monday)   There's nothing nefarious or unusual about this. Cases are dropped when defendants die. It's routine.   For some other views on the subject, take a look at Ron Coleman's Likelihood of Confusion blog. http://www.likelihoodofconfusion.com/the-making-martyr/ Coleman argues that the potential penalties are too big, but also, "He did steal that stuff.  Information doesnt want to be free  its stuff, and it wasnt his to free.  I think he should have gotten in trouble."  Professor Ann Althouse argues, "He knew what he was doing was criminal, and he was a very intelligent man who chose to do it anyway and conceived of what he was doing as actively virtuous." http://althouse.blogspot.com/2013/01/aggressive-prosecution-2-internet.html Althouse succinctly summarizes the issue in her second to last paragraph: "But he knowingly and willingly committed numerous felonies, did he not? I'm not hearing the lawyer say that Swartz didn't do what the prosecutors said he did. The argument was that the law ought to be different. If you break the laws as a way to make that argument, how is the prosecutor supposed to respond? Your argument is to the public and to the legislators."   I don't think the prosecution of Swartz was necessary, not do I think it was a horrendous abuse of prosecutorial discretion. There's arguments for and against prosecution, and neither option would have fallen outside the bounds of reasonableness or proprietary.  Swartz may have been a real criminal committing real crimes. That he thought he was doing the right thing does not negate the resources that JSTOR put in to stopping his activity. From press reports (and yes, making these judgments from press reports is always dangerous), it appears that Swartz knew MIT and JSTOR didn't want him doing what he was doing.  Your argument that we should never prosecute cases like those against Aaron Swartz, with a link calling for firing Carmen Ortiz, is an absurd one in the absence of a fleshed out argument. Swartz's conduct, at best, fell into a gray area of the law (and I'm not so sure it wasn't clearly a criminal violation under the CFAA). Ortiz's conduct was well within ethical constraints-she did nothing wrong. If people don't like the system, change the system. Calling for the head of one prosecutor for doing her job is a bizarre reaction.  As for my characterizations of your argument, that's what happens when someone makes an assertion but not a real argument. Guessing at what your argument is is all you left us with.   A: I didn't argue against you posting a link. I questioned what your argument actually is. B: You still haven't actually made a cohesive argument. What should prosecutors be aware of? C: If you disagree with some of my arguments, fine, but it's a wimpy copout to say my arguments, or lawyers' arguments in general, are what's wrong with the justice system without so much as identifying what you are finding objectionable.   The maximum potential penalties were outrageous, but the maximum potential penalties for just about any federal prosecution are outrageous. That's why over 90% of federal prosecutions end in a plea bargain.  Is it outrageous to believe that Aaron Swartz violated the Computer Frauds and Abuse Act? No. The statute is incredibly broad. Did Swartz have fair warning that his conduct was not welcome by JSTOR? There's a strong argument that blocking his IP addresses, and later his MAC address, were signs that he was engaging in behavior outside what JSTOR permitted.  His actions impacted MIT's relationship with JSTOR, for a time, JSTOR was unavailable to MIT students and faculty, and while JSTOR may have reached a civil settlement with Swartz, MIT had an interest in his prosecution as well. Moreover, the wishes of a victim are not always followed in criminal casesprosecutions are subject to the decisions of the State and not victims or their families.  None of which is to say that I agree with prosecuting Swartz or even with the scope of the CFAA. Arguing that Carmen Ortiz should be removed from office, or that as lawyers we should never prosecute cases like these, however, are sloppy arguments not based on facts. Swartz's behavior reasonably fit conduct that the CFAA proscribed. It is absurd to blame prosecutors for faithfully prosecuting conduct Congress made illegal.  What exactly are you referring to when you refer to "cases like those against Aaron Swartz"? Cases under the CFAA? Are computer crimes no longer illegal? Or did you mean cases where victims are not interested in prosecuting? In which case, leaving aside MIT's involvement or not in the decision to go after Swartz, I take it you are opposed to prosecuting cases of domestic violence once battered spouses are not interested, or able to express an interest, in further proceedings? This is far more nuanced than is being reported.   NESL is well-regarded in the area, but there's no justification for paying their dean higher than Harvard, Yale, etc., or higher than Suffolk University's dean.   Free speech does not mean getting to say whatever you want to say without any consequences. It means that (for the most part) government cannot sanction you for speech, but private actors can certainly do so.  Time Warner is a private company. Getting to choose what they do and not put out over their cable networks is an act of free speech in and of itself.   As others have pointed out, a thief can't gain title to stolen property. As for the issue of statute of limitations, if committed by a US citizen, stealing a trillion dollars could reasonably be called treason. Treason has no statute of limitations and is a capital offense.   It doesn't really matter how bad they look to a general electoratethanks to gerrymandering, the risk to most House Republicans these days isn't a general election, it's the primary. Those who are not ideologically pure are getting well-funded primary opponents. Impeaching a democratic President would be wildly popular with their base, regardless of the merits of such an action.   Well, yes, I should rephrase slightly-anything that would otherwise be admissible would be admissible...   This. The government did not induce anon's actions in any way, therefore, anything they found can be used against the teens involved.   There's an argument to be made, it is by no means a slam dunk, nor is it automatically a loser. If decided on the merits, I suspect the current Court would likely strike down the argument as unconstitutional, but there'd be a reasonable chance the Court would punt and not intervene based on the political question doctrine.  Politically, this would almost certainly lead to an impeachment attempt.  Probably not worth it.   Isn't there always mass law student drama? :P Grades, whose dating who, fighting (or threatening to sue) over student bar association elections,....?   It's certainly legal to restrict public access to a public building. (Can't just wander into a prison, afterall.) Perhaps it would be better to reframe the issue in terms of the school's obligation to leave students out in the extreme temperatures for unsafe periods of time. That's a far stronger argument (if you can substantiate it).   Were there any consequences when that happened? IIRC, there's no private right to sue under FERPA, and I don't think the feds sue over inadvertent disclosures unless there is a history of repeated issues.   Offending others is not illegal. Flipping off a cop is constitutionally protected speech. I'm sure folks were offended by a guy in a LA courthouse wearing a jacket saying Fuck the Draft in the midst of Vietnam War. It was, nevertheless, found to be protected speech by the Supreme Court in Cohen v. California. A few years after Cohen was decided, the Supreme Court found it was unconstitutional for a New Orleans ordinance to prohibit cursing at New Orleans police officers. If it's not constitutional to prohibit saying "fuck you" to a police officer, the symbolic equivalent in the form of the middle finger can't be punished either.   Yes, refusing police orders can be resisting/obstruction/other types of charges, but if you believe a passenger tried to summon your aid, do you keep him in the car with the driver? That sounds a bit off.   Seems like an obvious First Amendment violation. The officer's claim that he took the middle finger to be a potential call for help is incongruous with ordering the person calling for help back into the car while making a traffic stop. It may be an unwise decision to flash the bird at cops, and unsurprising for cops to respond by detaining those who do it, but it is a constitutionally protected expression of free speech. It's no more egregious than the actions of Paul Cohen's wearing a jacket saying "Fuck the draft" in a Los Angeles courthouse, an act of expression the Supreme Court said was constitutionally protected in 1971's Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15. Obscene gestures are similarly speech, not conduct.   There are certainly specialists in Supreme Court practiceTom Goldstein, David Frederick, Ted Olson, and others. The NYT wrote an article on the practice in 2010: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/1 /us/10lawyers.html?pagewanted=all    I'm not familiar with Texas, but my impression is that in most jurisdictions, criminal defense attorneys are disciplined regularly. Even criminal defense attorneys deal with trust funds, commingling funds issues, etc.   Awww. Adorable! What monster could throw out someone as cute as that?   Adorable! He looks like a plush Gund stuffed animal!   An obvious Brady violation... Unfortunately, prosecutors are all too rarely disciplined for unethical conduct.   (And here's a Youtube link with some scenes from Where the Air is Cool and Dark): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xoL-WoMqxY   Did it involve marijuana at all? (In the film, I meanI'm casting no aspersions on you!) From my internet searching, I'm wondering if it was "Where the Air is Cool and Dark." http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244301/plotsummary   As if Christians throughout the centuries didn't persecute and kill Jews?   I am sad to have discovered Lawyer2Lawyer the week after their final episode, but their past podcasts are worth looking at. Very informative and their guests give their contact info if you want to ask questions, make connections, etc.   First Amendment rights have been drastically curtailed in school, certainly, but students do have some level of First Amendment rights in school. See Tinker v. Des Moines.   Absolutely! No internet would help me not notice what I'm missing! ;-) (In the interest of honesty, though, I should note I'm already a pescatarian...)   We would have been better returning to the days of the Clinton tax rates by going over the cliff. It's not as though the '90s were marked by human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, and mass hysteria-it was a prosperous time. Now, the House Republicans feel they lost on a big issue, and will be even more motivated to be obstructionist in two months when it comes to the debt ceiling and sequestration. I fear that by not allowing us to go over the cliff and return to Clinton tax rates, something that wouldn't have been catastrophic, it sets us up for failing to raise the debt ceiling and defaulting on our debt.   When your party pushes to cut food stamps and welfare, when your party opposes providing healthy school lunches, when your party opposes providing health care to those in need, your party's key platform is turning one's back on people who are starving, freezing, and in need of help.   Ah! OK, sorry, I missed that!   Um, no. Hedley Lamarr is a character from Blazing Saddles. The actress/inventor was Hedy Lammar (her full name was Hedwig Eva Maria Lamarr).   Hollywood actress Heddy Lamarr was the co-inventor of frequency hopping. The original patent involved  using a piano roll to change between frequencies in the hopes of making torpedoes more difficult to jam. Frequency hopping would later be the basis of spread-spectrum communication technology, including wi-fi-, Bluetooth, CDMA, etc.   University of Connecticut offers an LL.M. in Insurance Law that may well be worthwhile, given that so many insurance companies are headquartered in Hartford. AFAIK, that program has a strong reputation. I'm not familiar with any other school's LL.M. program, so, it may depend on individual circumstances, the market at the time you're thinking of going (and when you'd graduate), etc.   Historically, the law treats pets as mere property-value of replacing a dog or cat or what have you, nothing more. There is a push to change this, but I'd be surprised if it was judicially imposed, especially in Texas, instead of changed via statute.   Heh. No ideaI'll have to ask!  I expected a floppy hat at JD graduation. They showed us floppy hats as samples when signing up to rent our regalia. But nooo.... I pick up my regalia to find that JDs get mortarboards, just like undergrads. Bah! Bah I say! :P   This isn't so much a legal question so much as one of philosophy, and is a question with answers that vary depending on where you ask it.  Some US states have abolished the death penalty, but on the other hand, in 2012, nine states executed 43 people. Many believe the death penalty to be cruel, or capricious, at risk of executing the innocent, wrong for the state to kill, or what not, while others believe that the death penalty provides deterrence, promotes public safety, and gives victims' families closure. The clamor for extreme punishment in India is not surprising in light of the conditions there-activists are arguing that violence against women has gone unpunished for a long time, and they are working hard to change this.  It is too big a generalization to take conditions in India as a sign that society overall is moving towards more barbaric punishments. It may be true that some in India are pushing towards more barbaric punishments, but there are also places that are moving away from capital punishment.  Uganda continues to flirt with a bill that would criminalize homosexuality and provide life imprisonment or the death penalty for engaging in same-sex acts, same-sex marriage, and the like. In Europe, the constitutions of Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montengero, Poland, Serbia, and Ukraine define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. On the other hand, in the United States, nine states (CT, IA, ME, MD, MA, NH, NY, VT, and WA), DC and the Coquille and Suquamish tribes have legalized same sex marriage. Nine other states (CA, CO, DE, HI, IL, NV, OR, RI, and WI) have domestic partnership options for same-sex couples. In Europe, eight countries allow for same-sex marriage and 13 others allow other forms of partnerships.  Why am I bringing up same-sex marriage/partnerships? Because it demonstrates that you can't draw global conclusions from the acts of an individual nation. Sure, Uganda's continued attempts at passing a "kill-the-gays" bill is very alarming and horrible. But it doesn't mean that society at large is moving towards recriminalizing homosexuality.   Up until a few years ago, the value of LL.M. programs was primarily for foreign attorneys looking to practice in the US and American attorneys looking for tax-related jobs. Other than the tax LL.M., LL.M.s in other areas were generally not seen as worthwhile until very recently.  In the current legal market, however, that calculus may have shifted. Gaining a focus in a very specific area, getting to work more one on one with professor advisors, and, for the grads who hit the market in the midst of the '08/'09 collapse who need to reduce or eliminate the effects of resume gaps, resetting that gap, are all things that may make LL.M.s in other subjects make sense now.  I'm about to enter an LL.M. program for specializations in health law and policy and administrative law. Health law and policy is a hot area, expertise is required, and an LL.M. may help me land a job. Moreover, I've seen government job postings where a LL.M. would allow me to start at a higher grade/step or make me eligible period.  Is this a gamble? Absolutely. Going for the LL.M. will either be a brilliant move or incredibly stupid of me. But at least I'll finally get to wear that tam hat I coveted at law school graduation when I saw all I got was a dinky mortarboard while the LL.M. students got the nice hats.  *rueful grin*   Your high school grades don't matter once you're in college, so, it's only a concern as far as getting into a good college and how well you think you might do in college.  It's too early to worry about the job market because the job market is in such flux. Yes, the legal market is awful right now. But by the time you'd be looking at applying to law school, all sorts of things will be different. Don't let that discourage you.  A lot of very well-meaning people will tell you that it is too far away to think about careers, that you will likely change what you want to major in and what you want to do. This may be true for some, but not for all. When I was your age, I decided I wanted to major in government in college and go on to law school, and everyone told me I'd change my mind. When I met my college advisor freshman fall and told her I wanted to major in government and go to law school, she told me I'd likely change my mind. I majored in government. I went to law school. (I'm now going back for my LL.M.) I regret graduating in the midst of the law market collapsing-that was an unpleasant surprise-but I still wouldn't change my decisions, and I did exactly what I had been saying I'd do since 9th grade. It can be done.   Thanks for the suggestionI was thinking about getting a hand creme since they put hand sanitizer on their hands every time they walk in or out of the room.   Ooh-that's a great idea! I hadn't thought of a Starbucks gift card. Thanks!   Thanks! Would I be better contacting the Nurse Manager, or the CEO, or....?   Thanks-I'll definitely be sending in a thank you note, and I think my Mom will be doing the same.   Thanks for the suggestions and for the well-wishes!   Thanks! :)   *nods* That might be a bit tough to surprise them with...    Ooh-good ideas! Thanks!      The average person commits several crimes every day. We can't lockup everyone. (For example, Harvey Silverglate wrote an excellent book on the subject: http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1356098597 sr=8-1 keywords=silverglate )    No reason to hang on to casebooks. Books that have actual explanatory texts (there are a FEW decent casebooks out there) and some supplements like E Es may be worthwhile holding on to for more advanced classes within the subject, but casebooks that are purely edited cases? Useless after the class is done.   Adorable! What is your sheltie's name?   Claiming that statistics gives probable cause? Good grief. A 1L could get any and all evidence stemming from these illegal stops suppressed.   I'm thrilled to read that NBC's Chief Foreign Correspondent and his crew are safe after several days being held captive by an unknown group. I'm a big fan of his.  I am, however, a trifle disturbed that NBC seems to have asked for a media blackout during the days they were missing despite no specific evidence that reporting would endanger them. There seems to be a bit of a double-standard for reporters in harms way versus everyone else.  "According to NBC, there "was no claim of responsibility, no contact with the captors and no request for ransom during the time the crew was missing." Whether or not one agrees with Gawker's decision to run with the story, their determination that there were no specific or even general threats to Engel's safety if the story was publicized seems accurate according to NBC News's own article (in the link).  Would news organizations not report on this sort of thing, in the absence of an articulable, specific concern safety, were it not one of their own?   Holocaust denier sues professor who calls him holocaust denier, court declares he's a holocaust denier, orders holocaust denier to pay professor for her legal fees.   Possibly not. On the other hand, do you think the word cracker has the same history or carries the same weight as the N-word?   Mazel tov to you and Ben!   Inherit the Wind is not jut my favorite law-related movie, but in a 3-way-tie with Casablanca and Rio Bravo for my favorite moves overall. A wonderful script and even better acting. Spencer Tracy and Frederic March were both amazing, and Gene Kelly's cynical newspaperman, E.K. Hornbeck, might be his finest performance.  My Cousin Vinny is a great movie so long as you are not required to watch it over and over and over again. I loved it, before I had to watch it (or substantive parts of it) in 3-4 law school classes and the bar-mandated professionalism class. Then it got a little old hat. :P   Cheryl Ann's challah tastes more like brioche than bread but still is dairy free. It is indeed magnificent.   If. Counting noses, I'm rather concerned.... This isn't necessarily a good thing for those in favor of same-sex marriage. It can easily, easily be 5-4 the wrong way.   andrewthestudent's outline provides a great constitutional framework. As for how the death penalty is defended, common arguments are deterrence, closure for victims' families, a need for finality for the system itself, and the need for especially strong punishment for the worst of the worst. Common arguments against the death penalty are that it is wrong for the state to kill, that mistakes can be/have been made and are unavoidable in the future (the work of the Innocence Project has been especially powerful), that the death penalty is more expensive, that the death penalty is arbitrary and capricious, and that the death penalty is both racist and classist (rich people don't get executed).  If you are looking for resources, take a look at the Innocence Project's website, take a look at Amnesty International's website, take a look at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org , and take a look at http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/articles.htm .   Absolutely no reason to use anything extra other than bar prep course materials. The most important thing is to not panic during the exam. Read the question carefully, and respond the way a lawyer would. It is less important to remember case names or even case law than it is to respond in a clear, logical fashion.  Beyond that, I'll pass along the sage advise one of the barbri lecturers told us: every point you get above passing is wasted effort. You don't need to get 100%. You're not looking for an A. You're looking to pass. Don't lock yourself in a law library exclusively for three months. See friends. Read fiction. Go to the movies or the theater. Hell, go to a strip club. Just make sure you are balancing your time so you don't burnout studying.  Study the prep materials, practice the multiple choice questions, get a good night sleep the night before the exam, and don't panic during the exam, and you should do fine.   Even if Arafat tests positive for polonium, that would still be insufficient to conclude that Israel was responsible. Turkish sources are reporting that polonium was one of four poisons found in the remains of former Turkish President Turgut Ozal, who died in office in 1993.(Other three poisons being DDT, cadmium, and americium.) Israel had no reason to poison Ozal-Israel/Turkey relations were strong under his rule. If Ozal was actually poisoned with polonium, it demonstrates that there are other actors in the region with access to polonium and a willingness to kill with it.  Has Al Jazeera looked in to the allegations of Ozal being poisoned? Are there any suspects, and did these suspects have reasons to kill Arafat or have ties to those who would have such reasons?   Strange-LOTS of people wore pajama pants to class at my college, (especially for early morning foreign language drill sessions but also just generally).   Respectfully, Congressman Issa, a law can't constrain Congress from exercising its Constitutional authority to pass legislation. If your bill passes and is signed into law, it will constrain agencies and departments, but Congress can still turn around at any point and pass whatever it darn well pleases. It is advisory at best.  Moreover, preventing the FTC, the FCC, and other agencies from regulating or burdening the internet for two years is a very broad prohibition. Prognosticating the future is hard. We don''t know what devices will be created, what services will be created, how they will be used, how they will be abused, how we may want to impose limits on interacting with children, etc.  If in a year, Google announces that it is selling driverless cars (or licensing the technology to car companies so they sell driverless cars) that use the internet for downloading and uploading navigation, traffic conditions, etc., that could be amazing. It could reduce the scourge of drunk driving. It could empower the disabled. It could be turned into a hybrid of car pooling/mass transit. BUT-it also poses questions and concerns and a strong need for regulations from the Department of Transportation to ensure that the technology is safe for users and for everyone else on the road. Burdening or regulating internet-based driverless technology is prohibited by your bill. That's not good.  It's too easy to say that if something comes along that requires regulation, Congress can pass legislation that modifies or overturns this bill. Given the current partisan gridlock and no signs of relations between the sides thawing, it is dangerous to rely on the ability to pass future legislation to fix problems. As much as is possible, potential problems need to be predicted and dealt with in what passes now.   Kathy Greenwood.  	110
 Either works well. An accounting and finance degree is more immediately practical for that specific job. An econ degree, especially from a good school is more respected even beyond banking since its a harder degree. Either way for banking, you need to follow the templatized recruitment process and network hard.   Yes. Its possible. You need to network hard and be in NY a lot. The other responses are spot on that the best place to start is your alumni network. Join your college finance club and do things like training the street to get up to speed on valuation / modeling, etc.         fine :) I take it back. It does get expensive and its a continuum of costs as you look to get further certifications and rack up flight hours.  My new answer is get Microsoft VBA certified. Nothing says "popular with the ladies" like Microsoft VBA certified   I agree. it can range. It was a long time ago and prices have gone up since then. The point being that its in that range, is relatively non-cumbersome to get a VFR and is a very fun hobby that people like to learn more about. Also I think its likely cheaper  to get in SoCal than Canada (but maybe not $5k any more)   You are absolutely right. Salary depends on a lot of things.   If you are asked a salary requirement in a form at the start of an interview process - just leave it blank. There is almost no upside to giving them a number until you are close to getting the job.  When you are close to getting the job, they will typically call and ask you for a range or number. There are a range of negotiating techniques but the most effective one (proven by studies) has been found to be a range, where the salary you are willing to accept is the low end of that range, and your top end of that range is  10-20%  over that. Typically your current salary should be below that range because presumably your switching costs involve you not wanting to move for the same pay.  Quote the salary as all-in. i.e., basic salary + bonus. Benefits are important but somewhat secondary. If their benefits package is weak, you should tactically let them know that during the negotiation process if thats important to you.  Read more about this here. http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/02/25/are-you-negotiating-your-salary-effectively  I run a career site - Tapwage.com   Feel free to ask more questions on that site     Yeah I just meant VFR. I think all great hobbies cost time and money to really pursue but the question was just for a skill that was cool, cheap and quick. A VFR fits those requirements.       If you live in places like Southern California, its not that hard or expensive to become a private pilot. It costs ~$5,000 and takes 40 hours of lessons to get the basic pilot certification.   I know thats relatively expensive compared to the other things people mention below, but its not much for a really cool hobby. People always want to chat with you if you are a private pilot.  EDIT: This post previously said 40 years / I meant 40 hours. Typo. But candidly, y'all are an impatient bunch.    I run a career website http://tapwage.com  We have curated collections of jobs and career articles completely free. I'll readily admit that there are many free job sites out there and media sites out there. But we are trying really hard to provide a quality job finding and career advice experience.   For our early users, If you ask us a career question or ask for a specific type of job you are interested in, we'll help you find those jobs or answers.    Your resume looks fine but its really useful to make it a little more action oriented so it shows that you care about the results of what you achieve.   Simple things: e.g., are there certain subjects where you consistently scored As? Can you elaborate on the achievements at your volunteer efforts. How many students did you tutor?  Fix the formatting on your resume. Right now the line spaces are inconsistent and that looks sloppy.  I have a lot more tips that may be relevant here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/02/27/7-rules-for-writing-a-killer-resume       On its own "ethical investing" doesn't outperform other forms of investing, and sometimes underperforms - for good reasons. Its hard enough finding alpha (outsized returns) in a  relatively efficient market place, its really hard to do that with constraints. Moreover, the best portfolio managers are not incentivized to do ethical investing.  I like how the industry has evolved beyond that to "impact investing". This is more than ethical investing. This is looking at specific areas where you know resource allocation has been awry (for political, social and / or cultural reasons) and using investing to correct that imbalance.   A great example is funds that invest in women and / or minority founders. Its well known and well documented that women and minorities struggle to raise money from traditional VCs. But mathematically, there is no reason for this segment of founders to under-perform for any reason. So impact investing in this segment has an arbitrage benefit where you can fund underrepresented founders and avail of overlooked opportunities. As the systemic biases normalize though, the alpha opportunities will reduce. But others might come up. These types of investing have shown the ability to perform and outperform the market. That said, it still depends a lot on the quality of investment manager talent that these funds are able to get.  We wrote a guide to impact investing here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/06/guide-to-impact-investing  Also here is a collection of interesting junior jobs in impact investing. These can give you a better sense of what the job is like and what the typical requirements are: http://tapwage.com/channel/initiation-to-impact-investing    Impact investing is a really interesting way to look at the world. I don't think CSR fully reflects that wide range of things impact investing is. Impact investing is also evolving so its not just "sustainable investing" or "non profit" investing but like any investing its about finding alpha (outsized returns). There happen to be meaningful outsized returns in areas like renewable energy, sustainable emerging market business models, and investing with women and minority founders who have traditionally found it harder to raise money within the existing VC ecosystem.  We wrote a guide to impact investing here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/06/guide-to-impact-investing  Also here is a collection of interesting junior jobs in impact investing. These can give you a better sense of what the job is like and what the typical requirements are:  http://tapwage.com/channel/initiation-to-impact-investing   very well put!   Supply chain jobs? No. These are resource allocation / analytics jobs that are fairly high end. These jobs can easily pay upwards of $100k / year at many big firms. The tools and data and analytics continue to get more advanced - there is a real focus on big data and using insight driven forecasting tools. Some of the more manual elements of this job will get automated like low-end procurement type roles but that can be said if almost any job (even programming jobs get automated as tools get more advanced). What is likely to happen to these jobs is that they continue to get more sophisticated, require more training and become higher paying.  The other important thing to remember is that supply chain is really the integration and coordination of many different functions that used to be separate like sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, distribution. Massive companies like Coca Cola, Nike, etc. have realized that by centrally managing, forecasting, planning and negotiating, they can save massive amounts of money, and ensure that new products can be distributed instantly where there is demand. The supply chain is actually the central nervous systems of these companies connecting the various silos. Many companies are only just beginning this integration and coordination, which is why supply chain jobs are in such demand. As this supply chain revolution continues - these jobs will continue to remain in demand for a while    no. I just remembered to remind you since sometimes people search for continents and our search isn't fully built yet (focus is on curated collections of jobs). We'll have real time smart searching capabilities soon. We get our jobs from thousands of companies directly   Thats really interesting. Btw: my site is in its early stages. Best way is to search for Singapore or Hong Kong (or Kuala Lumpur) on it as opposed to searching for "Asia". We will enable a smarter search soon.   Let me know if you have questions on moving to Singapore. Its a great place to work and live.    Being a product manager is a really interesting job at many companies, especially technology companies because you get to experience the life cycle of a product across various division - finance, strategy, technology, supply chain, marketing, etc.  So these roles can be great stepping stone to broader management careers. I think of product management at a tech company to supply chain type jobs at big consumer companies. These are breeding grounds for future leadership.  The best way to understand what these roles are and what these roles require int terms of experience and skill set is by looking at a range of these job postings and getting a sense from how they are framed. Typically these are for former techies who have some management experience or potentially an MBA and show strategic thinking capabilities and good interpersonal capabilities. These roles liaise with nearly every functional group in the company so great interpersonal skills is key.  Here is a collection of some product management roles: http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager  I run a career site - tapwage.com If any of you have questions on these roles and how to get them, feel free to contact me   yes, we do. We are adding a lot more jobs in that area soon, but right now, we do have thousands of jobs in Asia across industries / fields. I love Asia. I used to be an expat in Singapore ages ago. Nice choice of continent to go to.    We have jobs and career advice for all industries globally. Either way - I hope you find a job you love. Good luck!   This is actually a wide range of jobs including supply chain, procurement and sourcing. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple was a long -time executive in Supply Chain at Compaq and then Apple before rising to the roles that led to becoming CEO of Apple.  So what is Supply Chain? It is the planning and management of the supply of a companies products to the market place. Right from sourcing the raw materials, getting them manufactured, handling shipping and logistics to getting them to the right distributors and retailers.   As companies become more global, products become more advanced and complicated to make (an iPhone involves thousands of components sourced from all over the world), this job becomes really important.  You don't need to study supply chain to do it. Study finance or business, or accounting, or engineering. Focus on numbers and quantitative analysis, join a large organization as a supply chain analyst or procurement analyst and learn on the job. These jobs can pay very well and can give you a unique chance to learn the company and industry end to end and one day rise to a C-level position.  I run a career site - Tapwage.com and have a ton of great supply chain jobs at the biggest brands around the world here: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=supply+chain location=  If you have questions about this, contact me here or on Tapwage and will be happy to give you more guidance   I would avoid this. I run a career site (tapwage.com) and we have seen and heard of a lot of instances of this going badly. You potentially get sued or have your reputation tarnished over something that at best makes you slightly more efficient. Not to mention, the recent situation where the Goldman programmer went to jail as a result.   In general, what you do at work is the employers property, even if it doesn't contain non-public information, so on the whole, I would avoid taking templates or any similar work products with you. Have faith in yourself that you will build better templates at your new work environment   Posting to multiple sub-reddits is not an automatic sign of spam. Unclear of the guideline here.    I agree with this but sometimes companies frown upon people sending emails home. On my work email and home email, I keep a folder called "Contact Information" and move those emails to that folder as soon as I get them. Then if / when I leave the job, I print those emails out and take with me.            There are actually quite a lot of interesting data science and quantitative roles that you can search for across industries but sometimes its not easy to find them since they are called a lot of different things. We started a site - tapwage.com to curate job collections to address this sort of thing. A few such channels you can look at are:  http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence (this has quant jobs in banks for engineers) http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-internships  There is also an article that discusses this in greater detail: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/08/big-data-means-big-employment  PM / or message us on the site if you have questions and happy to answer further questions or create a custom collection for you.   I disagree with the below comments that say that there are only data science jobs in NY or the bay area There are actually data science jobs all over, especially since corporate employers are really focused on this capability.  Check out Data science job collections on tapwage.com to get a curated list of such jobs: http://tapwage.com/?tag=%5B145%5D  Or search the database. Hundreds of jobs all over: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=data+science location=  Note - not all data science jobs are explicitly called data science jobs. Depending on your qualifications, there may be many different places to look for such jobs.    Hilarious story of the guy who asked Quora what job he should choose  http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/how-to-lose-a-job-offer-in-10-days   Quitting a job is hard. If you have been with a company a long time, it's often like leaving family. I am convinced that a lot of people are so terrified about the thought of resigning that they just put off finding a new job, even if they aren't satisfied with their current one. This post is to help you through the logistics of resigning. Assuming you have made the decision to accept another offer, or pursue something else, follow these steps to make sure you transition from your current role in a graceful and organized way.   Go to this link to see the checklist and read the article: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/7-things-to-do-before-you-resign      There are quite a lot of roles you can look at: 1. Marketing or business roles at biotech companies and pharma cos like J J often look for biotech undergraduates  2. Go to a startup. There are many great startup life sciences firms looking for someone with scientific experience but for non-scientific roles and at a startup, you can grow with the organization into other positions. Check out this collection of jobs here:  http://tapwage.com/channel/startup-biologist  You could even go to a bank or investment firm and do biotech research, many of which require biotech / scientific experience and undergraduate degrees: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=biotech location=    That is a conundrum. You should never tell an employer that you are looking to leave until you actually will leave.  I would actually be honest with your boss. Tell him or her that the reason you had confessed to wanting to leave is because you felt alienated and not socially integrated, but that you enjoy the work and his / her mentorship. Tell them that you have had a chance to think about it and if they are open to it, you would like to stay and build a career. And ask for their advice on how you could do better to socially integrate at work.   If that doesn't go well, check out http://tapwage.com and see if you can find a better job. Designers are in huge demand and there are great jobs out there. Good luck!   AI and Machine learning developers are in huge demand. This is an interesting collection of jobs at banks and hedge funds looking for developers in investment roles: http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence   Thats not an uncommon route path at all. Most common route to Private equity is via an investment bank. Join as an analyst and after the 2-year program, its very easy to recruit into PE. You can try and do that right after undergrad but its harder.  For Portfolio Management, a CFA helps a lot. Again, these roles are easier after 2 years in the investment banking or sales and trading analyst program. IBs tend to have structured recruiting and big classes and then the PE and hedge funds tend to recruit from there.

 I get 6.98 MBPS here in Talbot :(   The union one has this system where if you work for an hour for them, they'll give you $10 worth of posters. And the work is simple -- hand out fliers or put posters back into their covers etc.    Yeah that's what I'm saying. Sometimes things will be fucked up. But that's not a reason to not try.   I just made the move, and things got fucked up royally...But while I'm hoping that things get better, I still don't regret doing it...   Sounds awesome...But $20 :(  Oh the concerts I'm not going to because of my "Penny wise Pound foolish" policy...   I just heard from someone, that it's better to be an asshole with integrity than a nice coward. That's of course, assuming the situation has given you only those choices.   Otherwise, I completely agree with what you say.   Came here to say this -- Chinese Eggplant with Basil Sauce!   Maybe I missed something, but how did he know the "teenager" was texting?   I think BBC America releases it online the same day as the broadcast now. Not sure because I will be watching it on the 27th anyway.   Thank you...that makes sense!   Thanks!   While I don't agree with you, the fact that the photo doesn't convince you otherwise made me look at the photo critically.

Oh believe me I tried. And it seems I do have a lack of balls, otherwise why wouldn't I have said anything for a year :) But we'll have to talk about it now...so hopefully the rejection won't be too cruel!   Yeah thats the impression I'm getting .. Oh well, my first time!   Oh no...I'm hoping we can continue to be friends...or it can't work like that? :O Shit..maybe I should have asked here before the email   Oh no, it was a reasonably long email explaining why I took so long and it ended with me saying that we should talk about it ...   Well I did say we should talk about it...So I get consolation prize at least ..   Yeah true. I did the former...and now it seems like a bad idea!   Shit...yeah...but it's been a year...Oh well ..   Well it was awkward for me for a long time...so I guess now it will go both ways :)   Some showers are good, some not so much I guess...   Thanks!

But let me tell you   What really happens     The water comes   Hits you   And then it goes       Well, its water,   What did you expect?     Your feelings   They stay where they are   After the water is cold   And you turn off the shower     Youre the same as before   Slightly cleaner maybe   But the same.

Thanks :)    Smile -------- Her hand was   Covering her mouth   As she turned up   From her book    And looked at me   The edges of her lips   Showed themselves   From behind her knuckles   And curled up   Into a smile  I think the cafe was bright   And one of the lights   Was shining in her eyes    The world stopped   And then started again   Really nice!   My friends and I used to use such riddles to play a game. One guy would present a situation and everyone else would ask him question that he could answer only with "Yes", "No" or "Not relevant".  It sounds random, but we almost always got to the right answer within 30 questions.   Oh come on, that's just the shadow of the spaceship from Independence day   It supposedly works by taking many pics at once with varying degrees of focus, kind of like a compound eye. I wonder if it can zoom.   Since there are so many mini-lenses, resolution is supposedly a problem. Hopefully they can work that out.   Awesome concept, really!   Oh the Bengal ones sacrifice lots of animals. In the nepal animal sacrifice (which was recently banned, thankfully), thousands of animals are sacrificed at once.  Some of our customs have us cutting a pumpkin and putting red powder in them. This is nothing but a euphemized (okay that's not a word supposedly, but please let it pass) version of animal sacrifice.   Yeah, you're right of course :)   However, it's also important that we don't really have a religious text. Some say the vedas are it (Sanathana Dharma), some say the Bhagavad gita is it (ISKCON), some say there's no text and we're awesome because of it (the moderate ones)....EDIT: To add, there are even some that say that we are not even a religion, only a way of life.    Because the facilities suck at all levels. I was in my undergrad team and we had a coach who didn't really care (he wasn't paid much at all, to be fair). Even then, when we once played against a "professional" (equivalent of the third division in other countries) club, we had better uniforms than them. They came to the field by public transport.  There's no money going into soccer. Two of the top clubs in the Indian subcontinent -- Mahindra United and JCT, disbanded recently because of a lack of money. LINK: http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110621/jsp/sports/story_14140274.jsp  And course there's the famous story of the Indian soccer team not going to the world cup because no one sponsored shoes for them. They qualified by default though.        Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules  And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :)   Ninja EDIT : I mean, I WAS vegetarian :P   Yet there are Brahmins that eat fish (like I mentioned in a different comment). For every "rule" in Hinduism, you will probably find that the opposite is just as true.   No. It's religious. There's a lot of pain infliction in our religion. There's even animal sacrifice, though in general cows are left alone and considered sacred for some reason.   Umm...actually a lot of Hindus eat meat. Even among those that "do not", some eat fish and classify it as vegetarian.   Indian here. Sporting in India deserves a whole other discussion. The national level meets in our country have about as much support and facilities as high school meets here in the US.   The pleasures of a pope are none.   Depends on what makes you scream.

An AMA with an astronaut: [Astronaut AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gm8rh/iaman_astronaut_who_has_been_to_space_twice_and/)  So the two most important things in life for me were in the same place at the same time...Couldn't ask for much more in a day!    P.S : I'm still new to the whole reddi   Actually, the poem was written in three paragraphs with the same lines as above. When I pasted it onto reddit, the formatting disappeared, and I couldn't get the paragraphs to work.

 Yeah I was about to say, there's no way you've gotten to college yet.   Ah, I was indeed loosely misinterpreting the thread.   Um, what were you thinking? Every username I typed in was already taken so my friend said "Just stop, man" So...what exactly were you thinking?   Really? Can't that fuck up your teeth?   Where is 'snog' used as a word for that? Unless it means something else and I'm wildly misinterpreting this whole thread.   Wait...   My wife knows none of this.    both he and I  ???

[Kickstart My Heart!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmXWkMlKFkI) You can't drive slow to this song!   No, probably not.   There was a joke in 'The Interview' that says somthing along the lines of "Don't shake his hands, hes a Jew" I saw the joke coming and realized that the three other people me and my friend were watching it with were very Jewish. Not just a little Jewish. Anyways the joke comes along and my friend lets lose the loudest laugh of the entire movie. He claims it wouldn't have been awkward if anyone else laughed, but no one did. It was awkward as fuck.   I just saw you answered today, but reading this shit really isn't worth my time. To be honest I can't believe your still going down swinging about all this, you were wrong a long time ago. Are you incredibly stubborn, or do you really have nothing better to do than keep arguing online in this sad lonely life of yours? Probably both I suppose. Anyhow, its getting too tiring correcting you countless mistakes and inaccuracies, so log off and go away. You gave it a good shot, but you lost. By a lot. By the way, the log off button is on the upper right side of the screen. I know how fragile your mind is and wouldn't want you to have a brain aneurysm trying to find it.   The  Best  Fucking  Show  Ever  Created   Not an 'official' word? Sorry Dr. Seuss, but there's no such thing as an 'official' word, there are words and there are letters put together in groups. You yourself provided an excellent example of this, 'commenter' I believe you called it. I suppose though, if you really want to use your 'unofficial' language, I can direct you to what I like to call ['The Dictionary of High School Dropouts'] (http://www.waywordradio.org/Official_Dictionary_of_Unofficial_English-Grant-Barrett-0071458042.pdf), even in there though I don't think you'll find 'commenter'.  Also, it's a good barometer to see when someone is losing an argument when they stoop to nitpicking word usage.  A barometer is a meteorology device, not an standard by which to measure debates. See what I did there? Probably not. Anyhow do you know what nitpick means? It means to be excessively concerned with or critical of inconsequential details. So are you saying that your looking up the definition of your fake word wasn't nitpicking? Are you saying the defining an already meaningless word and proving its nonexistence wasn't nitpicking? Because either you just used the word nitpicking wildly incorrectly, or you yourself nitpicked, which-by your own admission-is the sign of someone (in this case you) losing an argument. So which is it? Are you wrong *again* or are you losing the argument? Now that I think about it, I suppose it could easily be both.  As for irony, I said it because you have repeatedly said I lack intelligence, when it is clear to even the untrained eye that it is in fact you who is the real unintelligent fool.  The only thing I can say about this sentence is that it is the most grammatically fucked up thing I've seen in a long while.  It was getting embarrassing, I'm glad you saw that. I still can't believe you thought a defensive player was one of the Patriots top recivers! Truly pathetic. The good news is, you've admitted you embarrassing blunder and can move forward with a new lesson learned.  If you really want to pick back up your retarded football talk I'm more than willing, you just seemed to be falling behind. A debate is no fun when I need to keep going back to explain things to you. In fact, I didn't even read your last comment on football. I can only assume it was filled with factual and grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Not that I expected any more from you. Tell me, do people always have to dumb it down for you, or only when your talking about football and other subjects you've barely even heard of? Grammar for example.   So my comment is gone, not sure why, maybe it was deleted. I needed to used some truly harsh language to capture your personality and intelligence quotient, I can't help but think the mods didn't appreciate that. Or maybe they could see you were losing you battle by a landslide and decided to put you out of your misery. Either way, here's no way in hell your worth typing that out a second time (or even a first time for that matter, I guess I was just feeling nice :), your welcome). So I guess your just not getting an answer unless the mods give it back. Sorry to disappoint, I know how much you love getting proven wrong. Why else would you say such stupid things?? A tout a l'heure.  EDIT: Nah, I need to put you out of your misery myself. Its the least I can do for such an unfortunate child such as yourself-tell me, how was it to grow up without an education? I'll respond later, but I'm sure you won't like it. If you're asking for it though, fine by me.      Your the best!   Amendola was brought in to replace Welker, who had 1000 yard seasons with over 100 catches. Amendola wasn't even close to those numbers.  If you think that Bill Belichick tried to replace Wes Welker with Danny Amendola your a bigger idiot than I thought. He brought in a new receiver, period. Why wouldn't you call Donald Jones Wes Welker's replacement? Or Aaron Dobson? Or Josh Boyce? Or Michael Jenkins? Or Jake Ballard? Because they all came in when Welker left, so why is the burden supposed to lie on Danny Amendola? That's some retarded logic your're trying to argue with. Just because they came in at the same time, they must be trading off rolls? If anything, Juilian Edleman is Wes Welkers 'replacement'. Not sure why you thought Amendola was.  He has 3 good games in 2 years. I think your definition of great is a little off.  If you think he's only had three good games in two years, well your already a bigger idiot than I thought. Your a bigger idiot than the bigger idiot I thought you were before? Eh, its redundant, I'm sure you and your general lack of intelligence will prove me wrong again. As for Amendola, he hasen't played much more than three games. Obviously not three whole games, that's not the way Bill Belichick plays his players. He takes them for a reason, for example Blount's power running on third downs or Gonkowski's inside routs in the red zone. He plays them for specific plays, not all of them. The way you keep talking seems like you think every player plays every snap. If you ran an NFL team, dear god they'd be in trouble. This isn't something I should have to explain to you, literally team does this, it's a very easily comprehended part of football. Try to keep up.  That is one of the worst comparisons I have ever seen. I appreciate the try, but goddamn dude, you need to learn how to make an argument.  See, this is why your worse at making an argument than I am. You don't respond to what I said, you respond to the way I said it. Who gives a shit how I said it? My underlying thesis doesn't change, but unfortunately you missed that because you didn't like 'my comparison'. Was my point weather or not a comparison was good? No. Then why do you feel the need to waste time going off on a pointless tangent? Maybe it's because you don't have an answer, so you're changing the subject. Hope not, that would just be depressing. I hope your keeping notes, it might be good for you to know how to carry on a debate some day.  Nope, not even close. It was a counterpoint to you? saying that Brady makes all his receivers great. Rookies or not, they under performed.  Since when is 466 yards and 4 touchdowns in your first season in the NFL 'under-preforming'? And Dobson did even better, 519 yards and 4 touchdowns. Obviously its not something you'd want to see out of a third or fourth year player, but first?? That's not under-preforming, hell he could have been sitting on the bench as a back up and he wouldn't have been under-preforming as a rookie. Get your head out of your ass, these are some very solid rookie years. Go ahead, disagree with that. I didn't think your stupidity was expanding but you've surprised me before.  Are you seriously basing your entire argument that Tom Brady can make anyone look like a star, on one comment from Christain Fauria?  Ha! You made me actually laugh out loud, that's rich! Every time you say something it seems I think 'Wow, I didn't think he could prove himself any more of an idiot, but I'll be damned, I was wrong'. Of course I'm not basing an argument off of Christain fucking Fauria-do you even know who that is?? I did however use his quote as a source to support my argument. Debate 101, maybe you should take it. Jesus Christ this is exhausting trying to get through to people like you. Going back and explaining every sentence is like talking to a six year-old. Literally.   By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays DEFENCE. Didn't catch that.  Did I need to?  YES, YOU SHOULD FUCKING KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFENCE AND DEFENSE. How can you even try to carry on a debate about football when you don't know the two?? Its not a mind game at all, but rather a very simple and transparent test to see of you have any idea what your taking about or not. Turns out, your full of shit. I still can't believe that you argued against me by saying a defensive player has bad reviving yards. That's more than pathetic.  You think you are some witty commenter with all the right comments, but you haven't even come close to anything right this entire time.  Nice. No seriously good one, give yourself a pat on the back for that zinger. And it would even make sense too if 'commenter' was a word and if it was the least bit true. *You're* the one I have to keep correcting, and you don't even seem to understand half the shit your saying. It's come to the point where I've considered leaving you to your blissful yet idiotic ignorance, but I'm a charitable person, I keep returning to educate you. Push you luck though and your going to end up one very moronic 'football expert'. Even saying that sarcastically insults the real moronic football experts of the world, your much worse than that. You were right about one thing though, Matthew Slater is not a very good receiver.   Okay so I guess you officially give up on what this entire debate was about in the first place, I'll put one in the win column and move on to what ever asinine point you want to debate next.  Your whole argument is flawed, because its based on the point that I'm somehow defending the Patriots in this whole ball-deflation thing. I'm not. At all.  What I am defending however this the just system of due process. So until there is an official statement from the NFL announcing 'the Patriots cheated' no, I do not call that cheating. Why you ask? First of all the sources that supply this information are rarely sound. The guy that announced this whole deflation issue in the first place said that the Patriots used illegal balls and equipment. Clearly this was a very distorted image of the truth, and if is these people were relying upon, we can't take anything they say for anywhere close to certian.  Second, well...do you even know how game process works with regards to the game balls? They are delivered to the stadium where they are opened by a sealed container *by the referees* where they are marked *by the referees* to prevent someone from replacing them. Then they are filled with air *by the referees* and measured *by the referees* who's responsibility it is to take care of them until game time. The only time the footballs are under the control of one of the teams is on the field during the game. You might say 'Well ha! Got you! The Patriots probably deflated the balls just before or during the game!' but you'd be wrong. Inflating and deflating the game balls requires equipment that is simply not available on the field. Anyone seen taking 12 footballs to a machine pushed off to the side would clearly be seen, if not in person than on video. The only other way to deflate them would be to take a knife to the footballs. Probably not what happened. My point is that there is almost no chance for the teams to get a hold of the balls to somehow alter them before the game. There is a very good chance that there was an error made by someone employed by the NFL (probably a referee) that brought the footballs down two pressurized pounds.  My point was never that messing with the game balls wasn't cheating, my point was that there is a lot left unsaid and that even if the Patriots were found to be 100% guilty, it would still be a non-issue.   LaFell was already a good receiver? Does that make Danny Amendola a good receiver? Because last year when LaFell was 'already good' he got 627 yards. Danny Amendola, who 'isn't even doing decent' got 633 yards last year. So which is it? Was he 'already good' or was Amendola not only on par with him but arguably better? Get your facts straight and stop contradicting yourself, it's exhausting cleaning up someone your messes.  And Danny Amendola hasn't under preformed at all, in fact when he's on the field he's been doing great. Unfortunately for him though, he's gone almost completely unused. How can you say he's under-preforming when he doesn't play? That's like saying jimmy Garoppolo (Brady's backup) sucks because he only got 100 yards. The person expecting him to get more yards is the idiot in this scenario, not the other way around.  As far as the rookies go, care to name them just to be sure were all on the same page? I think we are for the most part but I wouldn't want us to be addressing completely separate people. Who says their best isn't minimal numbers though? Is your point that rookies can't suck? Just because they're drafted doesn't mean they're good by any means. Unless they're a first or early second round pick, it only means that they could potentially have potential, there is no where close to a guarantee that they are good.  But hey! Guess what! You got something right! Michael Hoomanawanui (for future reference, that's how you spell it) doesn't have good numbers. You know why I chose him? I chose him very deliberately. I chose him because my point was that Brady can turn anyone into a star. Christian Fauria said, and I quote, "These people don't know his name yet, but Tom Brady's making him look like a star out there tonight". My point was never that Hoomanawanui had thousand yard seasons, to be honest I don't even know where you got that from. Keep your eye on the ball 'corby'.  By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays *DEFENCE*. Didn't catch that? He has one recorded reception *EVER*. And you think I'm the one that failed, ha! You have the entire internet at your disposal, but even that wasn't enough to get your head out of your ass. But hey, nice job 'shutting me down'. Don't worry corby, you'll get em' next time.    EDIT: Sorry, I couldn't bear giving you that false hope at the end. Sorry corby, but you actually probably won't get em' next time. Maybe if you lose the suborn ignorance and your debate is against an idiotic five year-old you'll win one, but even then I'm not 100% sure.   I'll take your slight redirction as a full surrender. As I was saying, non-issue. But if you don't have any response to what I said before, I understand. Now you can either admit defeat, come up with a reasonable counterpoint (good luck) or try to desperately change the subject. *Again*.   Can you make this but with Revis in black and white? That would look dramatic as fuck, please!   You can creep on me if you want. Curious of what my internet preception is.   You meaning me? No, I didn't break any rules. Not sure why your addressing me personally.  If you mean 'the Patriots didn't break the rules' no, that's not what I'm saying at all-did you even read what I said? What I'm saying is that the entire ball deflation thing is a non-issue. Clearly regardless of what happened didn't change the outcome of the game, hell they could have been playing with Nerf footballs and it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, but there are many more 'issues' in the NFL that are getting ten times less attention just because the teams involved aren't headline attention grabbers.  In summary, there are many issues and non-issues in the NFL, this falls under the non-issue category.   Really? Again? Matthew Slater, Brandon LaFell and Michael Hoomanawanui to name a few.  To be honest I can't tell if your making my point about Danny Amendola or not. My point is Ameldola has been doing decent considering how much time hes spent actually on the field, but all in all he's not a very good receiver (which anyone who knows anything about Danny Amendola is aware of), and that Tom Brady doesn't have much to work with with regards to a receiving core...which you confirmed for me as if you were some how proving me wrong by supporting my point... Whatever.  And my point about the rookies is we can't tell if they're better under Tom Brady or not because we haven't seen them under any other circumstances. How the hell would we know if Tom Brady brings out their best if we haven't seen them with any other quarterbacks? For all we know, that *is* their best.  Do *you* know what your talking about? Because it certainly doesn't seem like it when I have to spell everything out for you.   Okay, you want to talk about really cheating? 'Flat out cheating'? Blow-deflated-footballs-out-of-the-water cheating?  http://slumz.boxden.com/f16/truth-about-videotaping-in-the-nfl-1088981/  http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2008/2/23/122122/210  http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/09/20/ref-was-powerless-on-giants-fake-injuries-but-nfl-is-not/  http://mike.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/13/480621-miami-dolphins-steal-tom-bradys-calls-via-game-tape?lite  http://phins.com/chris/column_050908.html  Is that not enough? I'll dig out more if you have another 'counter point' but the fact is that people simply don't care if the teams involved aren't winning. Period. If not, explain to me why the Patriots were the only team that got any attention for taping other teams when others were caught doing the same exact things and then some? And why are people still talking about it despite more recent scandals with even more definitive proof involving other teams? Because they aren't winning, so it must not be news.   Amendola is doing decent, and the two rookies are rookies. My point is he brings out the absolute best potential in his players and has the ability to make even a bad receiver look like a star. I'm not saying they're all bad receivers by any means, but he makes them look a hell of a lot better.   Wow, last year but same people! I would love to have that job every season...   The Jets got caught recording opponent's signals a year before SpyGate, did anyone care? No. The Raiders were known for over inflating footballs beyond their legal limit (as are the Packers apparently), does anyone care now? Nope. The Lions ran multiple deceptive plays where they threw to a lineman as an eligible receiver *this year*, did anyone bat an eye?? No one.  Apparently there are many "non-issues" going on, just involving poor franchises. They've all been caught but did you hear about it? Nope. Did you hear about it before there was even an ounce of proof that the Patriots did it? Absolutely.  If the NFL is willing to catch and release like that its clearly a non-issue. Just because a big team supposedly does what the little teams are doing shouldn't make it any more or less of an issue. They've all been caught, but no one cares until a winning team might be involved. If it's an issue, than the little teams should be addressed just as harshly by the NFL and the media as the big teams. If not, then it's simply a not an issue.   I don't know, I really like [NFL on CBS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNhIdw2Bpo).  EDIT: [NBC's Olympic season song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9gL33ze4RE) is majestic as fuck too.  EDIT #2: How did I forget [March Madness] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhC5-uIJJWQ)?!!   Even though Tom Brady didn't have the records the past few years, I still think hes the best. I mean most great quarterbacks have an arsenal of receivers to chose from to make their stat sheet look good, not Brady. Who does he have this year? The list starts and ends with Rob Gronkowski. Everyone else is decent to average. Despite this, Tom Brady makes them look good. Brandon LaFell? Matthew Slater? Even Julian Edelman? These guys aren't stars by any means, but under Tom Brady everyone is turned into a dangerous weapon. Even when he doesn't have a team, Tom Brady takes them to the playoffs every year. Literally, every. Singe. Year. That's why hes the best. Well, one of the reasons.   Thats a big *IF*. Where do these allegations come from anyways? Did a Colts fan decide Sunday night "45-7? Must be trickery! Get Roger on the phone!" The media's reception of sports scandals always reminds me of the Salem witch trials. Someone is accused of something and then with out a trial or so much as proof suddenly they're guilty. Maybe I should accuse Russel Wilson of greasing Barndon Bostick's gloves (hes the guy who dropped that onside kick), just to even the playing field.   You still want New England?? 47-7... If I were you I would want a win, not a risk.   He has two weeks, he'll be playing.   Revis Island.

You don't see Homer's twin brother in too many episodes nowadays.   Your more of a Back to the Future guy, aren't you?   "You're retarded" it makes me angry but it's not irrational. It's just mean to use someone's uncontrollable and incurable condition as a derogatory term.   Red Hot Chili Peppers. [Quixoticelixer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCQeE2L3ISI) is a pretty good example of both. Starts out very chill and then turns up the tempo on a dime and it still works perfectly.  Also Sum 41. Compare [In Too Deep] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emGri7i8Y2Y) to [Crash] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meKU_wjXb6U).  Green Day obviously has a few.  And Led Zeppelin. [Stairway to Heaven's] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPvNqOb6RA) progression is awesome, but it's not the only one.  Halestrom also has some really slow songs, but you can't really apreciate that unless you listen to enough of their crazy stuff.   I love how the camera man saw it coming and thought "I gotta get out of here!"   I read the books, but you should be considerate to those that didn't or still are. I never said you shouldn't post it, I said you shouldn't unless the title makes it clear its a spoiler, because the tags clearly aren't enough. And like busmans said, /r/asoiaf already runs that way, its a better system.   Many people enjoy the TV show and are just reading the books now. Why is that wrong of them?   Why downvote the poor guy? I mean its not like hes wrong.   Even with the tags, I don't think you should post stuff like this unless you specify how gigantic a spoiler it is in the title or until it at least happens in the show. Thats just too huge of a spoiler. If your seriously as sorry as you say you are for all those comments from people who didnt get there yet, please reupload this under a new title.   Dear lord...its like they're each trying to smuggle in a meatball sub. Some with more meatballs than others.   I've lived in the states all my life, but I've literally *never* heard of any of those. I think one of my friends might have mentioned fried butter as a joke once, but I'm not even sure if I'm remembering that correctly.   I'm 18. $14, 5 gallons of gas and a Twix bar.  EDIT: Just $14 and 5 gallons of gas. Does karma count?   The quote isn't "what almost killed you but didn't makes you stronger". It means that *everything* you do short of killing yourself adds its own level of experience and learning to your life. Every experience in your life molds and shapes you into the person you are today. I don't necessarily agree with the quote but your totally missing the deeper message.   myspace. Obviously.   Its not a delay, most history class curriculums don't even go past the 90's. Its just a little too recent to call history. Give it ten years.   Its in that grey area between history and recent events. Its not in any of the history books yet, but ten years down the road it will be. Its not like the topic dosn't come up, its talked about, just not taught yet.   Maybe you just didn't do anything physically or challengingly significant in your life worth reflecting upon. I climbed Mt. Sinai too, not a significant event in my life at all. Basically a tourist stop.   Oh jesus...this reminds me of a TIFU where a guy sneezed while on the shitter. It ended as horribly as possibly imaginable.   [...no] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ)   I wish, never got gold. Or had sex with Megan Fox for that matter.

I think its because they use one tiny little kid and another very pedophile sounding motherfucker...no me gusta.   For some reason the contractor that designed my house put the door bell in the bathroom. I've had many an electrician try to fix it, but apparently the single wire going from my front door to the bathroom is absolutely vital to the structural integrity of the entire house. I wouldn't mind the door bell, its usually not that bad when your not in the bathroom. When you are though...you know how you jump out of your seat when theres a BANG! in a scary movie? Similar concept, very different end result. Its come to the point where Im scared to shit in my own home. This house has taken the most basic of human rights from me... There are also the times I forget to inform guests of my house's unique feature. It usually goes a bit like *ding dong* scream!* "test_subject3655, you son of a bitch!!"   Thats awesome, Out of Our Heads? I don't remember the order their albums were released in but I think that was their fifth.   I wont home for a few days, but I had [this picture] (http://m.imgur.com/TE8Kulba) on my phone. The Splattercaster picture was taken a few years before I got it but its the same guitar.  EDIT: Imgur deleted the picture for some reason? It was two posters... Upload again maybe   And also the tree-arrowhead thing? That sounds cool too.   Thanks for specifying.   My collection of Rage Against the Machine, The Black Keys, The Rolling Stones, Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day and Guns N' Roses posters each signed by *every* member of the band (every member at the time it was signed, not all of  the replacement members or the replaced members). Ive been collecting it for a few years now, very proud of what I have so far. I have a few more Im working on finishing that are missing a few autographs. Anyone know Kirk Hammett? Ive been trying to track him down since 2008...  EDIT: After seeing all the guitar comments, I can't chose between those and a special edition Fender Splattercaster I got a few years back. No thats not a typo, its called a Splattercaster. And its beautiful! Looks like it was made by Jimi Hendrix himself.   *"FLIGHT MH370 FOUND IN THE NORTH POLE"*  The plot thickens...   Those pills online that promise *"four inches of extra growth!"*. Man, I'd love to be four inches taller.   An at home herb gardener. My neighbor is a planter, he seems to make a butt load. There are always people dropping by to pick up spices and what not. He loves to cook with them too, every time I walk by the house smells like fresh spices, and his eyes are always red from chopping onions. What a good guy.   Man, I cant stop reading and go to sleep till I get to the back_page.   Im bored so I looked it up. Auckland is about 23 miles (37 kilometers) wide. I would assume the suburban area extends another 15-20 miles (25-30 kilometers).   For future reference, Los Angeles and all surrounding towns (Hollywood, Venice, Burbank etc.) extend at the absolute furthest 40 miles. You probably moved 25-30 miles, definitely not 50.   Were not that close.   Fuck you, compliment rescinded.      Or TV show I guess.            Someone else posted this request on IamA, and its a great idea. Can we please this happen??!   Singers make songs all the time that claim they've done drugs, stolen, assaulted, etc. yet no one ever gets arrested for that. And in Anthony Keidis' (Red Hot Chili Peppers singer) autobiography he talks about a life full of illagal drug and substance abuse, yet he's probably never even been questioned by the police (well...). Hell theres videos on Youtube of Wiz Khalifa smoking weed! I'm pretty sure though that if I was caught with a recording or self-written note admiting to any type of crime that I would be arrested on the spot, so why aren't they?  EDIT: I don't necessarily want to see any of these people prosecuted, I'm just curious why they arn't.                        	102
 Such a great and creative video!      great video                              So its that time of year again.. Soon it will be over, THANX GOD! Im more of a summer guy! But merry xmas everybody..and a merry new year..                             	22
 yet in the episode where they go to Bob's Funland, there's a flashback where all three are making fun of Bob in highschool!   AHH I came here to say the bacon stretcher one. I guess that's been around for a while.  But my favorite of all time is to send the new dishwashers downstairs to grab a gallon of "striped paint."   god damn, I never want to read another thing by a middle schooler.   there is no evidence.   Wow... This just makes me feel old.   uhh... it was a hyped up new technology?   aha, well I did some research... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_giant_hornet   Is that a cicada killer?   huh? Oh, I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over your smugness.  http://factcheck.org/2012/10/dubious-denver-debate-declarations/  here you are.  Granted, Romney takes the liar cake. But Obama had a few slices himself.   is it true you gave yourself brain damage from holding your breath so frequently?   whatever happened to letting the haters hate?   oh, and while I don't advocate for racism: excuse to use the word freely.  There is no "excuse" to use words freely. There is simply the freedom to use **any** word.    Oh I'm sorry mate. I just meant that it's really horrible to have to include shitty old things like hit counters. No disrespect intended.   You should just use google analytics instead.   are you looking to just display this as a full page embedded vid? Or, are you trying to make a background image into a video?   ugh. That's really horrible.   waitwait, sexual harassment? There is a very clear line between being forward and harassing someone. Legally speaking, I suppose. I mean, she could go around telling people that you're a pig... but, honestly wtf cares?   This is the problem with nice/shy guys. They use that as an excuse for being a pussy.   god damn. poor poor bastard   "is that what a real man looks like?"   Life will make you into a cynical asshole yet.   False. I am talking about that word being used as a general pejorative.  Your argument is based on the idea that this word is no longer a homophobic slur. That is patently false.  you contradict yourself to make a point, and then you mention honesty about the meaning of the word. I don't know what this honesty is meant to refer to, a literal definition of the word or its connotations?  The use of faggot as a pejorative is an augmentation of its once literal definition anyway. And emotional reactions to the word have everything to do it. If the word Faggot didn't inspire negative emotions in people then we wouldn't be having this conversation to begin with.   and a correction: I know the word still can be used as a homophobic slur, that's not my argument. I'm saying that it is also taking on a new meaning, one that denotes -- as you said -- a general pejorative. Not a specific homophobic slur.   EDIT: and for these reasons, you're argument is tautological.   The use of homophobic slurs is homophobic.  The argument: that this use of the word in a certain context is in fact not homophobic.  Your argument assumes the correctness of "faggot" always being used as a homophobic slur. It even goes so far as to imply that if **both** user and target have reached an agreement previously to not treat "faggot" as homophobic, but instead as part of their vocabulary of playful denigration, it still is a homophobic slur.   If this were the case, all words would remain static. This is clearly not so. Also, I think it's pretty clear that a community such as reddit is by nature very opposed to homophobia. This establishes a sort of redefinition of what it means to use words previously defined as homophobic slurs.   AND, one more thing. Words are words and only people give them power to hurt. If you treat "faggot" with such seriousness, it only deems the word necessary when spouting vitriol. Much like the word nigger has been used. The best thing to do is use the word with utter farce, lampoon it's own hateful meaning.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IFloXOuLgA  simply put.  and plus, your arguments are full of tautologies, because they're full of tautologies. That, and some obligatory reference to civil rights.    I would give a body part to get a sequel to the original FFT on the ps3.   I mean, not like shaved clean. Like, babybottom kind of shaved.  But bro, you got to trim that shit up.   Ok, I'm sorry.   But the people on here telling you to confront your mother and threaten to tell your father can go fuck themselves. Well, perhaps not that. But I think it is the wrong way to approach the situation. This is based off of the principle that this is none of your business. Just be an adult and talk to her. Keep it between you and her. Get her perspective. It is most likely the case that there is some dynamic between your father and mother that is completely unknown to you. Affairs happen, this is just part of real life. Don't go bulldozing through your family just because you're too offended that your mother wants a proper dicking from some other guy.  I understand this comes across as harsh. Hopefully it isn't taken as malicious.   Russian. I love the way russian sounds. It also makes you better at tricking people.   lee scoresby from his dark materials   reading that was like getting sand in my eyes.   so instead they just hang themselves... nbd   Well, this was a big waste of time.   nobody panic, jawathehutt is doing research on it.   Honestly, I hate to be that guy... but I hate it when people start packing until the prof says "see yah later" or the equivalent of such.   I don't get anything. But this kid I used to work with in the kitchen was named Craig. And somehow, it became a thing that everybody would say "C'mon craig, how you gonna get fired on your day off?"  This was unappreciated   do you feed him lasagna?   Idontbelieve   your professors don't care about you.   hum... Surprised I am that this is on front page and not controversial. +1 for you sir, even if this is a repost ;)   Any toy for my kids is a huge waste of money  are you Louis CK?   Again, wrong.  Modern philosophy is *not* applied psychology. What you may be referring to is Naturalized Philosophy, which is a specific branch of philosophy. And even then, it's not so much applied psychology as it is applied "let's accept some empirical facts about the world"  Modern science is by definition a conglomeration of facts based off of a philosophical framework. Much like Aristotelian physics and the geocentric model, the standard model and quantum physics.   Not all philosophy is speculative, in the same way that some fields of scientific research *are* speculative.   I'm not here to make value judgements. There is no "better than the other." But I'm also going to give philosophy it's credit where credit is due. A lot of people forget the history that Philosophy and Science have together. They used to be in love, you know.   thank you.   I encourage this discussion. Especially when alcohol is involved.   There is so much awesome in this.   This is really untrue. There is fathoms more to Philosophy than  the subjectivity of the human condition.  Not too long ago, Science was a proper branch of philosophy.  Also, logic and analytic philosophy. These are found at the foundations of the scientific method and formally part of the philosophical tradition.  In other words, philosophy embodies almost all fields of study. Even mathematics.    ya man, I second this. I mean, it sucks that you threw away all of your old work, but it all has to do with perspective. You could look at it in a liberating kind of way... In the sense that you're no longer bound to what you've created in the past.  This might sound like a load of bullshit. But it's either that, or live in the turmoil of knowing you don't have some stuff you made in highschool. Im not into the visual arts myself, but I have two really really good friends (one painter, one illustrator) that are both out of college. And they are both terribly embarrassed of what they did in highschool. Not in an ashamed way, just a "oh wow, I've improved so much" kind of thing.   ...So yeah, keep at it bro.   ya. And then get downvoted into oblivion for pointing it out on a popular one.    http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maoqyejduH1qdlqpi.gif   mmm good old bagged milk?   This is not so much a problem if said girl had a nice ass* and you were staring at it.   really puts a plot hole in the whole episode...   this is true.   nono, it was.   You are a giant faggot. I don't even know why I read the comments any more. The fact that the author got downvoted for explaining why they did something blows my fucking mind.    bravo, kind sir.   yup   this is a poorly worded question.   cowboy bebop, samurai champloo, full metal alchemist: brotherhood. watch these, and you won't be able to stop.   oh my god. I can here to say exactly this!   OH!   perhaps plot is the wrong word.    meh. Not so hot, not so cold.   Dude, if you want to use leaves to wipe your ass, then more power to you.   I, personally, enjoy the better things that the economic society has produced, not just luxury. For example, modern culture.    You can go live in the woods, grow you're own food and make houses out of sticks and stones. I'll be busy reading books.   yes, yes there was.   meh. In my opinion, anybody who isn't interested in the plot of Cowboy Bebop or FLCL is plain toast in my book.  Now, if you're going to go and start talking to people about Inuyasha or Naruto, then that's a different story entirely.   this picture is so old, why is this on the front page of reddit? blahblahblah, and other complaints.   Im gonna bet my money on Java.   stay away from adderall.    oh ya?   This is a stupid question.  If it was done forcefully, absolutely not. If your girlfriend didn't mind, then who gives a shit?  Homosexuality has nothing to do with invading the space of other human beings.   can we get some sources in this motherfucking thread?   This is a typical 16 year old response.   they're probably just predetermined at the start of a battle. In which case, who cares. Still semi-random, just not in the "in the moment" kind of way.   I can't belive this got downvoted so much   let me tell you why this is bullshit: There's no way the farmer can completely sustain himself.  Let's assume he's using simple tools (hoe, axe, rake etc..) He either needs to greatly increase his work time, or greatly increase his manpower for maintenance on the farm. If he is doing this by himself, he very little time to do anything else (harvest the crops, store them, sleep, eat, be human).  If he has extra workers, what compensation do they receive? Let's assume there is no money, and that they are paid in the crops that are grown. Then that means more food has to be grown for each new worker we introduce. Even if none of these people had family members that didn't work on the farm this would be a challenging task.  On top of that, and I know it sounds silly, but where did he get his house, his hat, his clothes, and (in the picture) his little grill? Let's ignore the grill. How did he build his house? He doesn't have time for that he's too busy using hand tools to grow enough food for the year. Did he pay for it with crops? Ah, so now we have some people that build houses and some people that grow vegetables. When one wants to eat, they *trade* skills for food, and vice-versa when the other needs shelter. This extends outward, and gets increasingly complex. Which is why we have money in the first place, because in order to maintain any basic standard of living (even the most conservative) it is next to impossible to do anything without trade. And if we're trading crops for houses, we might as well have this universal medium so we can get things from people that don't want houses or crops without going through a long list of trading to get something else; say, honey, toilet paper, cars, pencils, straw hats or little tiny grills.    true. and that 0.01% stays there because being a nice guy is the equivalent to being a single-mom.   super nintendo gets my vote   shut up, faggot.   You shouldn't be riding your bike on the sidewalk sir.   take that global warming nuts!   hey hey, I sympathize... Sometimes you gotta stand like a total d-bag to get a drink these days.    they're trying to build a prison, for you and me to live in...  srry, oblig system of a down quote   Doug Funny, clearly.   A+   the big dipper   This is actually a type of ghost. To find a pet peeve, you'll need to get your hands on a very scientific device. My guess is that most people who claim to have one are lying, as most cannot actually "see" a peeve, but must experience one.   Yeah, I feel that. If I am in to her, I usually just assume flirting.

Blocks calls fine, but messages gets through.   What, in your opinion, is the best way to completely block unwanted calls / SMS of unknown / unwanted callers?  I'm using Call Filter. The problem is that it doesn't block the call, it just rejects it (like pressing No/red button). So, if i'm near my phone, i can see the screen going on. Also, my provider sends me a text message of a missed call (cause, you know, that what he thinks this is, after Call Filter rejection). So, i get notified no matter what.  As for the SMS messages, i"m yet to find a way to block them. Call Filter doesn't block, they get through. The only way is by mutting the conversation on Hangouts. But i get to see the message eventually, so that's not a solution.  Any solution is more than welcomed.  Thanks in advance.

After initially studying for the priesthood, Skouras, with the help of his older brother, [error], joined his younger brother, George P. Skouras, and traveled to America. While working as a bus boy in St. Louis, Skouras would spend his nights studying English, business practices, accounting and law. In 1912 the three brothers pooled their money and purchased a rundown nickelodeon in a poor neighborhood in St. Louis. After turning the theater around the brothers were able to build on their success and borrow $150,000 to buy and refurbish the old Grand Central Theater in St. Louis. Eventually the Skouras brothers would go on to control 650 theaters spanning coast to coast.  Skouras, along with his brother George joined the Army Signal Corps during the First World War. After the war they returned to St. Louis and their theater interests.  The Skouras brothers sold their theater franchise in 1928 to Warner Brothers where Skouras and his younger brother George were made officers in the company. Charles Skouras went on to become president of National Theaters Inc. In 1931 Skouras left Warner's to work for Paramount and the following year was lured away to take over Fox Metropolitan Theaters in New York, which was loosing a million dollars a year. He was able save the franchise from bankruptcy and by 1942 was in a position to take over the presidency of 20th Century-Fox. During his tenure as president Skouras is credited with embracing cinemascope technology in an attempt to save the movie industry from the growing competition from television. By early 1960s, mounting losses compounded by the 30 million over-budget production of Cleopatra (1963), led to Skouras being forced out. He remained on as chairman of the board though, retiring in 1969 to devote more time to his shipping line business, Prudential -Grace Lines.  Skouras died of a heart at his home in Mamaroneck, NY on 16 August, 1971. He was survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Saroula Bruiglia, two daughters and two sons.  - IMDb Mini Biography By: John F.

 The Ricky Gervais Show   *Hello,* Nedry   I sorta felt that Rise was both Escape and Conquest, while Dawn was more Conquest/Battle - either this will just be Battle, or Battle/Apes   I hope they change it to War *on* the Planet of the Apes, I think that sounds better      Too bad for you man   Seriously, that stuff is incredible   Well, thankfully it wasn't Hank Azaria or one of the main family members - I don't think they'd be able to go on without them   Huh    uses his God powers to send these legitimate practical effects to his son and our savior, Jorge Millir   Disney knows what they're doing   I Love Lucy   It's like poetry, it rhymes.  FTFY   Scrambled   They're kinda cute, actually.   If you could give birth to an animal, what would it be?   Okaya I wonta   Well, it didn't take me that long to make - I'll try to clean it up a little - add music, make the cuts a little less rough - what else?   Empire Strikes Back, Godfather Part II, LotR: Return of the King, The Dark Knight   What, the 5 minutes it took me to make?   So it's okay to put a written version of this plot leak, but not a visual?   Oh shoot! 57 seconds of your precious life down the drain!  Oh, and no one forced you to watch it.   Soylent Green...

Yeah, I can't believe they gave him those 3 Oscars! Ugh, how stupid of those "academy members" to reward good filmmaking!   Throw up your hands and raise your voice!   The ring came off my pudding can!   Well, sorta Jar Jar for giving Palpatine his power    Ricky Gervais' stand up is pretty hilarious    Yeah, but the question wasn't "which fact do you not believe is true?"   That's not only not socially acceptable, but insane. I hope you were joking.   That's where, we found...

So May 1994?   http://imgur.com/P9UBSJm   Really? I've never heard of this vastly underrated film!   Right, but they are 2 completely different mediums. Paintings can use visual storytelling, doesn't mean it's something you discuss in a movie-focused setting.   I can't wait till they release a new LEGO Star Wars game with TFA included   Why is this being asked in /r/movies?   Really? And all the other fake plot rumors and trailer "leaks" aren't? At least I'm reporting on a piece of news that's actually true...   Who was making that point?   Ugh, I guess I have to:  Le *Interstellar*   You can't try a food for the first time and not like it, and then have someone explain why they like it and it changes your opinion.  I totally agree.   C'mon, it's not *that* expensive    No, it's just the article with the same pics   Yuuuuppp   Well, everything about this looks more promising than the prequels...   No - I just meant I have it digitally - i don't have early access or anything. Besides, im sure it'll be online Monday.   In the Apple newsstand store   I meant out digitally - it's not like I have exclusive access to it or something...   Yeah, it was sorta obvious.  Just tryin' to be a good person.   Actually, Empire Strikes Back is the Pig in the City of Star Wars movies      Alright, but you're the one who couldn't understand a simple joke. I really couldn't care less.   Seriously, I'm confused now. I'd love to help you explain it, but now I'm not even sure what you're referring to.   Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan   Less than 5 years ago, this was just a dream. And now it's actually happening. I can't believe it.  I hope it doesn't suck! (It won't)   I'm glad they're taking the starting-over route, and the ending leaves a lot of possibilities as well.  Thoughts?      I was having this debate with a friend the other day, and he said that a movie doesn't need to have a central lesson or message to take away from it to be good.  I disagreed, and I still think it's one of the most important parts of film.  What do you think? What (well-liked) movies don't have this, but are still good?   Lord Nolan also appreciates the Kevin James directed psychosomatic-thriller.          ayy lmao   Now don't get me wrong. The Dark Knight is not, by any means, a bad movie. It is well acted, well directed, and very well put together. But as a superhero movie, and as a movie in general, it falls down in a few places.  1 We don't get emotionally involved with our characters. In movies like Superman or Spider-Man, our characters show that they are humans, and they have struggles. Superman literally moves the world back in time to save the person he loves. Spider-Man never knows whether he should reveal his true self to his friends and enemies. Batman just says he's the good guy. He doesn't show it, and you probably wouldn't care if he died.  2 Why so much violence? Seriously, why does every car or building need to get shot at or blown up? It should be a battle between the hero and the villain, not the hero and the villain and the rest of the world. It doesn't need to happen, and it shouldn't. Maybe a few times, but it shouldn't detract from the story itself.  TL,DR: - this is NOT a bad movie, but there are much better superhero films  EDIT: or a 94% on RT, the ideas still apply   Sometime before or after the release of The Godfather Part III, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola came up with a potential sequel idea. It would have been a similar style to Part II, switching back and forth from Vito's early days as Don in the 1930s (as well as the early years of his children's lives), and Vincent as the new Don in the 1980s. Vincent takes a turn from his predecessors, and gets the Corleone family involved with narcotics again. It would have ended with his death.   More info can be found [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Corleone), under "abandoned sequel"  Do you think this could've worked?      I have a friend who literally cannot watch movies made before the year 2000.   Some examples:  Thought that Star Wars was "too slow," Back to the Future is "cheesy" and Hitchcock is boring.  I need a 20th century movie that quickly gets into the plot, looks good, has a good pace, and good acting. His favorite movies are The Social Network and Nightcrawler.  I hope someone can help!   My reaction after seeing it again:  Good stuff: - Thoroughly enjoyable - Not lazily made or incompetently made - Basically a dino horror movie  Bad stuff: - Sort of a stereotypical plot - Kind of the same movie as 1 and 2               I feel like Stanley Kubrick and George Orwell's novels were perfect for each other. Animal Farm and 1984 have similar concepts and themes as A Clockwork Orange, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove.  What do you guys think?            Either unprotected or with a space suit -  How would it be different than on Earth?   Best letter ayy lmao amirite???     It's called 2001: A Space Odyssey   Mine are:  5) Dr. No  4) Casino Royale  tied with  3) Goldeneye  2) Skyfall  1) Goldfinger   If one were to make a re edited version of Return of the Jedi, what would the basic plot look like? What would needed to be changed/taken out?   An idea I had for the highest grossing movie of all time:  Director: Christopher Nolan   Producer: James Cameron  Writers: Joss Whedon +                                     Quentin Tarantino  Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Christian                 Bale, Jennifer Lawrence,                 Scarlett Johansson  Music: Hans Zimmer  Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki  Visual Effects: Weta Digital   What would you pick? Anything to add or change?   EDIT: Spielberg as co director, also with Chris Pratt  EDIT 2: The plot is a cross between Interstellar, Inception, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Obviously.   I also thought John Wick and CHAPPiE were amaze  Cinnamontography A+++   Mine are:  Star Wars Jaws Jurassic Park Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Planet of the Apes Back to the Future Rope Singin in the Rain All the President's Men 12 Angry Men      Ex:  Half Life 3 speed run record, set on May 27th 3476      IMO they're all great.      I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but which movie was the one where Rocky said "every champion was once a contender who refused to give up?"   Like, he wanted to prove to everyone that he could make a movie on his own and it was really just a foreshadowing of what the prequels would bring...               Super Smash Brothers Drift (Kart Racing/Fighting game)  You would be able to play as all the characters from the most recent SSB game, with their own customizable racing karts.  The style of the game would be somewhat different than other racers like Mario Kart - you can choose to compete with 4 - 12 players on a variety of tracks.   But here's the twist - there's no finish line - you are continually moving around the chosen track. The position of the players is determined by a damage meter/percentage, like that of the real SSB games. You can use a multitude of attacks on other players, including bumping into other karts, and launching projectiles. Items and power ups would be scattered around the track, and whomever has the least damage when the time limit is up wins the game.  This is just an idea I had and I would love to here your opinions. I'm working on some concept art for the game, which I'll post later.      On the Club Nintendo website it says that new rewards are coming January 19th.   2 things:  When today will we be getting new rewards?  What rewards do you think they'll be?  Personally, I have a lot of points to spend, so I'm hoping for some good 3DS downloads...   Only 11 months from today!  When do you think we'll see a poster?      This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:  As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U.   See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...   TL;DR - theory about console naming            	109
 Yep.  I'm loving how easy the BB onebro run is so far in comparison, though I know some parts end game are gonna be much togher :D   Is the auto record always set on by default?  Because it seems like it is, as I notice that when I go to the share menu, there always seems to be a video recording, and it gives me the option of "save this video clip."  I never realized it was on from the jump I guess, it just seems kinda obtuse, and I thought the menu was just wonky.   Right now it's Heynryk, cuz that bastard killed the crow lady on my level 4 BeastBro runthrough, and I was really counting on getting that Hunter Oath rune from her to help the waste of skin build not suck ass.  The other Oath runes fuckin suck, and this guy is a dick.  My viscerals only do like, 100 damage with a +4 hunter's axe, he has a couple thousand HP, and he one or two shots me with either his pistol or cleaver.  Ahem.  Did I mention what a dick he is?   So, doing it the way you mention doing it (double tapping to start, and letting it just go on its own) you have to be careful then to make sure you save the footage you want, if say, you reach the end of a 15 minute loop, because then it will start recording over that original loop?  Thanks.   When people refer to monsters, yes, one-shot is the instagib, but when a lot of players say it in regards to boss fights, they mean they beat it the first time around.  Speaking of which, I just one-shotted the cleric beast and papa G on my current 4bro (lowest level you can be) run-through.  I think I forgot papa G, who sucked, but I did record the cleric beast fight (if I worked it properly).  Will try and figure out this PS share crap and upload it soon.  Edit:  goddammit.  Looks like I recorded 15 minutes before the cleric beast, but not the actual cleric beast fight.  Still have yet to figure out these annoying share features on PS4   So is it double tap "share" button to start recording?  And double tap it again to stop recording?   That is way too much work.  I also one-shot killed Gherman in like, 60 seconds on NG+.  He is so easy to parry, and with +30% and +20% clawmark ruins, he died in like, 4 viscerals  :D   Really?  That's kind of shitty.  Can I expect the same solid performance once they fix it?  Or from the next one?   Ok - so I've had this PS4 for a few months, hardly used it before BB was released, I've never shut it down improperly, never dropped or damaged it in any way, and I think it's only gone into rest mode once or twice, and out of the blue it initiated in a weird loop when I started it up today.  I am currently googling potential fixes and what not, but any suggestions or known fixes in the mean time?  Thanks in advance for your replies.  This is pretty damn disappointing for an expensive piece of hardware :/   Edit:  I tried starting the PS4 in safe mode, but it won't even do that.  I'm stumped...   Edit:  It's seemingly now on, with the PS4 noises/music playing in the background, but my input screen on the TV (HDMI2) is blinking repeatedly on and off, but it isn't staying on enough to display an image or menu.  I know both inputs on the TV work fine, as I have already tested them.  Not sure what to do or where to go from here.   Edit edit:  Found a fix that worked!  The problem lay somewhere in between the TV itself, the input channel, and it's communication with the PS4.  I followed the instructions below, and it seemingly cleared up the issues, and now the input channel is staying on, and BB is loaded up and ready to play.  Thanks for your input  :)  1- Power off TV  2- Unplug TV from outlet  3- Press and hold in the power button on the TV for 30 seconds (while it is unplugged from the wall)  4- Release the power button  5- Plug in the TV into a different outlet  6- Power the TV back on   Eh. With how OP you could easily make your gear in DaS 2, the difficulty spike wasnt as noticeable. BB seems more akin to the leap in DaS, but the jump is less and less noiceable, especially as you learn the game and get better at it. I definately felt the pain a bit through NG+, but I'm In NG++ right now and have one-shot every boss so far, and am currently on my way to go kill darkbeast Paarl and then the shadows. Even in chalice dungeons at depth 5, I'm finding hot dogs and undead giants and ebriaites ridiculously easy to one shot.  Now I'm sad, because I'm worried I'll bore of this game quicker than the other titles...  Will probably wind up doing a level 4 run sooner rather than later.    Eh, even then, I was more enraptured by Halo, in both story and gameplay, and that was a long time ago. Even Defiance had a better story and comparable yet more original mehanics, and that was years ago too. Destiny is the epitome of "meh."  One big over-hyped, well-polished turd :/   Depends.  If you are going to mostly solo on your toon (as i do on my main), you can do whatever you like, but if you wanted to keep it more co-op viable, for ease and quick matches, I'd stick to somewhere around 100-120, and just make different toons for more focused arcane or BT builds.   What level are you?  If you wanted to stay within majority pvp/co-op range, you're looking at pumping your two weakest stats (BT and arcane), and that could likely put you over range depending on what you wanted to do with this character.  I'd say this toon is already geared towards STR and dex, and stick to those weapon types with the quality build, and just make an alt character if you wanted to focus dex and arcane or BT.   For most grab attacks, you can mash your L+R buttons (supposedly any buttons) to get out of the attacks quicker, take less damage, and in the case of the brain suckers, only lose 1 or 2 insight.  Knowledge is power!   Wow. That's pretty good. My girlfriend would totally fap to this :)   Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you.  I bought a new PS4 for this game, and as great as it is, the frame rates and stutters are particularly obnoxious, and quite frankly, dissapointing.   The caves, old yharnam, chalice dungeons (or anywhere the witches summon the dreadlocked slender women) and quite a lot of places in general experience frame loss, and originally when I went into Old Yharnam, I was getting some terrible frame stutters where the sound track/game would make machine gun noises and almost seem like it was gonna crash or crap out.  Woohoo next gen?  As for solutions, well, I'm not sure.  I'd suggest installing some new RAM and maybe getting another video card or two to put in there, but, ahem, it's a console :D   Dude...you're totally right!   Nice write up, but one thing:  do you really think Destiny was even "mildly amusing?"  I never understood how people could play that game for more than, maybe an hour?  Between the lack of remotely interesting story and characters, the uninspired gameplay and unoriginal mechanics, and the fact they were already recycling levels/maps by mission number 3 or 4, I just don't understand how anyone could stomach that game for more than a few days at most.  Seriously.  How did more people not take a shit on that game and mail it back to the devs and demand their money back?  No offence to the people who liked it, but that was the most hyped turd to ever turd on a turd and then ask for even more turds!  Sure, I get game-play compulsion, but even then, that game was terrible!    Yeah.  Now I'm one-shotting ebriatises and hot dogs and amygdalas and undead giants and ghermans in NG++ and in chalice dungeons level 5... makes me kind of sad actually :(    Shut up and take my money!   But who was the mummified hot-dog you got the gesture from in the first place?  In keeping with the lore and the story, I think it was Elvis Presley or Michael Jackson.  Vaati is confirming this right now.   All for the PC if you can (with a controller), as there are solid mods to increase the frame rates and graphics, which are pretty mediocre on a console. BB had some terrible frame rate issues too unfortunately.    That being said, yes, you got better (as from games demand), and you learned from your mistakes. Just be warned that the pace of DaS is quite different from BB. Don't expect to use the same methodology and style as you did in BB. Just be patient, and apply the same ability to learn or try new angles to fight and exploration, and you'll no doubt enjoy the experience.    Well - I like how beasthood and insight are inverse to each other, as it fits the story and lore so perfectly, but I wish it had been used more, or if it was relevant or useful at all. That being said, people got way too hyped and spread too many rumors about theoretical besst-mode before the game was ever released, so the fail of that hype is on them :D   All the other hunters and humanoids (logarius, gherman, and shadows included) are a joke compared to Eileen's hunter.  He just heals so much :D   Yep.  So far, the Cathedral Hunter was the only (non) boss I truly cheesed after dying to him repeatedly for an hour, and I've been in the habit of one-shotting undead giants and Ebriatises and hotdogs and amygdalas in depth 5 Chalice dungeons.  Killed Father G on NG++ in 1 minute, killed Gherman in NG+ in like, 30 seconds (3 or 4 parries), one-shotted The One Reborn in NG and NG+, and still, I have nightmares of the Cathedral Hunter on NG...   Play blind your first go through:  no spoilers, hints, help, or anything your first run through, as you only get that experience once, because once you're well-practiced and learn the maps and methods well enough, the game becomes super easy and is actually quite linear, though the great level design helps hide how straight-forward the game truly is.   Edit:  But it is definitely a great game, and the main game is challenging at first, as the way you fight in the previous Souls series just can't and won't translate to success in Bloodborne.  Relearning to fight in BB is fantastic.  Also worth noting, the higher depth chalice dungeons can definitely be challenging, and they keep the game challenging, but I don't know how it will translate for longevity. Also, the multiplayer system kinda sucks, and PvP connectivity sucks as well - can take a long time to find a match.  Hopefully they fix it soon. Have fun!   Haha.  My favorite so far was two bell maidens on a higher tier right next to the lamp where you entered the later at, so as soon as I spawned, red spiders were landing on me, then I ran into the room next door with the spiders still and continually following me, and the room was filled with undead tomb prospectors and dogs and the cannon-armed undead giant making a cameo as a regular enemy... yeah, lots of lube indeed!   Hotdog Asshole in cursed Lorain dungeon, Chester the Mollester and his Bag of Dead Hookers, Crows that Think They Are Dogs, and That One Fucking Asshole Hunter in the Grand Cathedral.   Eh. I felt the same way as I chored my way through the easier dungeons, but I enjoyed the... Challenge of some of the lower ones, and by the time I could make a lot of the community posted chalices by collecting all the chalices, I had an excess of all the highest tier crafting mats (except sage's hair).  And the coolest thing is, once you make a root dungeon of any type, you can create any of the community dungeons that were made with the exact same materials (ie, cursed or defiled) for free.  Worth noting, some of the dungeons are ridiculous with enemy placement and difficulty. Nothing like fighting a cannon-armed undead boss giant in a room fille with dogs and undead tomb prospectors :D   Edit:  it's worth it. And if you do them in progression order, you should wind up with more than enough crafting materials so there should be no extra grind at all. So far I have collected 3 blood rocks from different dungeons of different types, and I b-lined it for all the runes I use the most (like tier 3 claw mark).     Yeah. Some bosses you have to work out their timing and you can actually use the jump to your advantage, but most of the time it's a liability. To work around it, I just walk instead of run, and depending on how bad the camera angles are, I lock on and strafe, or just walk and roll to a favorable position, like being at the bosses side or back.    Don't worry, the deeper chalices are often harder than the main game :P   Even though it took forever, FROM (well, B team) eventually implemented what started as a player idea of having a ring (or item or w/e) to absorb souls to keep soul memory locked and not increase.   Hopefully that lesson remained with them (or was absorbed by A team), and they are implementing some arenas or summon signs and other technical improvements to fix these issues.  I don't understand why they used the wonky-ass bell system.  They could have just had your messengers hold up a bell for you that could have thematically and aesthetically matched the game, yet function in the exact same way that the summon signs did in previous games.  And also, that shit shouldn't use up your insight unless you actually connect.  Here's hoping they fix it :(   Don't we all miss soul memory now :/   Sure, it was an annoying system at first, but at least you could find quick matches    Not to mention, they are often PvP built and equipped, and often are experienced trollers, er, invaders when it comes to the souls series :P   I wanted to like the wheel for some smashie smashie, but honestly, the range sucks ass and it's just way too slow and uses a lot of STA.  I like Kirkhammer, because again smashie smashie, but the moveset on hunter's axe for both untransformed and transformed is just too fun, too universal, and too badass to pass up.  Between the 1h and 2h moveset, I have found a solid compromise between slash and smash.   I remember a few people posting about how it bugged out their game - and I can't remember if it was progression, or optional areas, but in all cases, to do what they wanted, they had to restore their saved files.   EDIT:  It might have been some of the other skips/bugs in game, but either way, players should know the risks of possibly bugging out their games.   In all seriousness though, don't let other people and reviews and all the hype of the 'hardness' fool you.  The one deciding factor worth considering is you:  will you learn how to play the game, learn from your mistakes, and in general become a better player in the way that FROM demands that you become a better player?  If so, yes, go for it.  If not, then don't purchase it.   While other games play more like movies (quick time events, and simple, easy narratives) that are almost impossible to lose even if you try, Bloodborne (and FROM in general) utilizes the gaming experience in a way that seldom developers do, not just in their mysterious narratives, but they force you to learn from your mistakes, as when the rubber hits the road in these games, there really is no just derping and dragging your way through these game.  Again, the game is hard but fair, and if you can learn from your mistakes, learn the mechanics, learn the attacks and methods of the enemies you are fighting, and in general, become better (as the game will demand that you become a better player) than yes, I would advise you to get it.  If you're not looking something to really challenge you in the video game medium, than no, don't get it.  Good hunting to you o/   Whoa.  Thank you.  I have no idea how gold works or what I can do with it, but I assure you I will put it to good use.... does it by chance un-ban me from the subreddits that have given me the boot?  :P   Yeah.  I've seen a bunch of posts from people who messed up their games using jump skips and things like that, asking about the problems it has caused for the games, which seem to be irriversable.  It's still a short run, even without the skip.  Good luck to you!   But they clearly bark in both the 'waking world' and the nightmare.   Be warned - FROM will ruin gaming for you, and other games will feel like Hello Kitty's Island Adventure, where you run around slapping little girls with wet noodles that have no impact, and there is no risk and little reward.   Careful though, and be sure to back up your save files.  These skips aren't intentional, and they have been known to bug out the game or make you miss out on certain opportunities due to the nature of the bug.   This game follows same format as Dark Souls.  Dark Souls 2 was B-Team's ideas and methods.  That being said, the game is actually super linear and you can get back to the end game content within an hour or two if you memorized the game fairly well, as so many areas are either optional, or easy to run past.   To get to the first part of the nightmare, you only need to kill Cleric Beast, Papa G, and then Vicar.   Then just head to forbidden woods (or the other houses with lanterns) and get the tonsil stone.  To get to the second half of the nightmare (game progression, not the first optional part of the nightmare), Just add Shadows, Rom, and The One Reborn to the list, and boom, you're there.   Yeah. It's fun when they show up as normal enemies in the chalice dungeons... Surrounded by dogs and those weird undead fuckers...   No. It's a short cut to midway point in that elevator. If I remember correctly, you walk across a tile type roof top, and if you look at the elevator shaft, there are tiers like steps and you can hop back down to the bottom. Sorry to spoil it for you, but it's nothing too exciting :)   PSA - depending on your play style, The -HP ones aren't worth it. They cancel out your rally potential every time you take a tick of damage.    Also, i feel like cursed gems are kind of unnecessary, because there are plenty of solid non-cursed ones. I use a regular hunters axe at around 490 on the stat screen, and the only downside is one of the gems has +2.9% Stamina usage on its +22% physical damage. No other curses on that thing though.    Yeah. Levels don't make that much of a difference once you have a specialized build at around 100-120. That being said, I wish there were more things to spend blood echoes on :/   Ha.  We have the exact same build - except I rounded up to a nice even level 175 with 28 arcane instead of 25.  Now I'm running around in NG++ with a million+ echoes at most times, so I'm debating on raising up to level 198 to 50 arcane...     LOL casuls   Title says it all.  But yes, I have googled it, yes, I have read multiple posts that say the same thing, but it doesn't seem clear, since I get nothing but error messages from dungeons I try here on the reddit list and elsewhere.  Also, yes, I read the chalice dungeon reddit wiki, and it said something like, "you must have created the exact same chalice," but I tried that, and even then when I try to use a glyph, I still receive the message "you do not meet the requirements" or whatever it is.  And if that is true, that you must have already made one of the same exact dungeons to use a glyph, isn't that a bit obtuse and redundant?  Does that mean you need double the crafting materials for every glyph you want to use?  And does that mean you must leave both tombstones occupied with those chalices if you want to create similar glyphs?   For example, I mainly wanted to create this dungeon:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/805577-bloodborne/71574146  It is a Lower Loran with fetid + rotting offerings   Yet, if I try to even make a lower loran chalice dungeon, I don't even have the options to use the offerings of fetid and rotting - so how can I even create a chalice to use that glyph in the first place?  Point is, I am thoroughly confused and frustrated.  Thanks in advance for your replies -_-   I sort of agree with him on a lot of it.  Insight isn't relevant enough, the game needs more invasions, it would have been cool if the game wasn't so linear, and I am mixed on the blood vial thing.  On one hand, some boss battles are challenging, and can be drawn out if you play carefully and patiently, so less blood vials would suck there.  Also, enemies can still kill you super quickly in some combos and fast or hard hitting attacks, so the numbers aren't so much of a problem there, but on the other hand, 20 is a lot of vials to carry, and yes, sometimes it makes the game way too easy....   Is this the memory leak type deal everyone talks about?   If you stick a bit to his right, not too far from his foot, he will mostly just stomp at you, leaving one of his left hands hanging in the air that you can whack on (don't lock on at all for the whole fight).  You gotta be ready to dodge though, because he will flail and go crazy and slam his fists around here and there.  Anyway, you can totally take him down quickly using this strategy, and once he gets to his final phase, just cheese him by chasing his tail, because he will only jump forward, not backwards.  Just stay behind him, and mind his foot stomps, chase him when he jumps, and whack his tail again.  Rinse and repeat till dead.   Edit:  no memory leak or anything like that.  It just baits him into certain attacks and moves and turns this fight into cheese mode.   And to think, I fought Amagdala for the first time in NG+ the good old-fashioned suck-ass way - got my ass handed to me and took a lot of patience    That being said, it's kinda lame that if you barely stick to his right, you can just whack at his hand and he mostly just stomps his feet :/   Ha.  Just beat him.  This did the trick:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dsd9S_Crp0  No memory leak or anything.  It was hard to get past the first phase or 2 for me, as I got hit a lot, though I dodged even more, as I couldn't bait as expertly as this dude did, but cheesing him in the last was easy.   Yup.  Just got to this asshole, and after a quick test go to see what it's like, I've decided that the "defiled dungeon" is the stupidest shit mechanic ever    Edit:  I don't know if I'm gonna have the patience for this fight. Gimmie a challenging, punishing boss fight, sure, but don't inflate the difficulty by giving me half HP for a boss that would likely 1hKO me anyhow.   That might help.  I'm too high level to help you though, not that the levels make much of a difference in this game, but i wind up rolling in 1 million echoes at a time in NG+, so what else am I gonna do with em other than level up?   What level?  I'm close to this boss in my game. Just soloed the hot dog last night.    Edit: but honestly, these bosses take patience, an more people seems like more of a liability than not.    There is no proof that Rom is human.  That, and every other human in game gets a lot of screen time in item descriptions, dialogue, or interaction, yet there is none of that in regards to Rom, which would seem like a huge oversight.  What we do get are several references to the Bygenwyrth spider (Rom), who keeps the master (the great ones) away from it's seekers/pupils (the cultists).  A lot of people interpret that note to mean Rom keeps wilhem from his peeps, but I don't think that is the case.  Rom somehow cock-blocks or mutes the rituals the cultists are trying to create, hence, once you kill Rom, the blood moon or paleblood moon or whatever lights up the sky and the crazy people in Yahr Guhl finish their ritual to bring forth the one reborn and turn people to stone and other crazy shit.  This is further supported by the notes that say, "the spider keeps rituals from us," and other crazy shit like that.   The point is, people keep interpreting Micolash's vague madman speech to mean that Rom was granted a gift of many eyes by the great ones, but that is just one interpretation, never-mind the contradiction of, 'why would the great-ones help Rom in any way? specifically since he is obviously somehow blocking their rituals and blocking the cultists from contacting or bringing forth the other great ones?'  It's just as likely that Micolash just means, "make me as you made rom," like someone might say, "I wish I could fly, like the birds in the sky."  Worth noting, Micolash says the lake has turned to mud or whatever, which again, is reference to Rom somehow interfering with the other great ones and the cultists' rituals.  I've posted about Rom and Micolash and other relations in many related posts - might be worth looking at the other lore theories people have posted for sure. Either way, we still don't know the how's or the where's or the why's of Rom....and it all only brings up more questions.   I LOL'd way harder than I should have.  Also,I like it how you have zero bloodtinge :D   Yep.  I only fought the dude in NG+, so I can't speak of the NG cycle, but even in NG+, I could kill the sword in the ground with either one hit from my weapon, or even 1 shot from my +9 hunter's pistol (I only have like, 6 bloodtinge), so you don't even need a strong shot on it.   Well, it's not like rocks are all that common either, but there is a lot less gear to upgrade :D   I can confirm similar results.  With 250+ (slightly higher) discovery (2 eye runes+25 arcane stat) I found about 8-9 chunks in using exactly 15 BHM's (started with 45, but ended with 30), HOWEVER, I only killed the first 4 easy and quick to get to werewolves.  I never bothered with the 5th since he was up the stairs, down the hall, and out of the way :D   Haha.  I like how you over-simplified everything.  Shit gets crazy in-depth complex.  Just look up "lore" in this subreddit, or go youtube "davecontrollive" or "vaatividya" bloodborne youtube videos (they are some of the go to's when it comes to making money off youtube souls content, I mean, lore)  :)   Dead hookers.  First time I saw that fucker, I said to myself, *"I know the type."*  Those are with out a doubt, sacks of dead hookers.  Vaati already confirmed it bro.   Question is in the title. Thanks on advance for your replies.    By life-swallowing, I just mean those organizations that heavily indoctrinate you from an early age, from all angles, and that essentially try to run your life and be the central, most important facet of your existence.   And a follow up:  How did you come to find that it wasn't for you?  And how did you come to find your own identity in the world?   As the non-spoiler title doesn't say, What's through the locked door at the bottom (or middle) of the pit trough the door/lift in chapel ward that unlocks after you kill BSB?   I'm not talking about the door to the abandoned workshop. But IIRC there is a locked golden-ornate looking door (guarded by a werewolf iirc) either at the bottom of that pit, or maybe the middle section. Can anyone please tell me where that leads to? I accidentally beat the game and never got around to opening it up. Thanks.      Hey all.  I already accidentally beat the game in a no-spoiler/help run, so I am going through NG+ trying out all the optional stuff I missed or was barred from completing upon being booted to NG+, and with the tonsil stone/Amygdala, are there any immediate consequences for defeating that boss?  Will it change the progression in anyway, or bar me from completing other quest lines or cut off any other optional areas?  Also, since getting to the Amygdala puts you in Nightmare Frontier early, can you progress through that at all?  Or is it just a portion of it, and you have to follow the normal progression? Thanks in advance for your replies.   The chest right after father G in the study on the way to the Oedon Chapel had a kin cold blood in it. I swear it had a regular cold blood in it the first time round, because I think I would remember an item that gave me 20k souls at level 15, and the first time i saw a kin coldblood in my first play-trough was when i killed Ron the Grumpy Caterpillar. Can anyone else confirm or deny?  Or did you find anything to make you think otherwise?  Thanks in advance for your response.    U r all HIV bluud fagetz cuz u killt ravid siff!  wreckt   Mainly, what the fuck?  I somewhat fancy myself a pro when it comes to piecing together FROM lore, but even with playing part-time detective through Bloodborne, what the fuck just happened?   Also, super annoyed that it automatically kicked me to NG+. I didn't even get a chance to +10 a weapon    Loving how the game keeps getting weirder and weirder!  As odd as the fight seemed at first, I really loved the Ron the Angry Caterpillar encounter!  I kinda felt bad killing it though, since it started off just sitting there, minding it's own business like some kinda funky, own-business-minding, giant outer-space slug :/   And then the stuff that's coming after that... whoa!  I am thoroughly confused and confounded, though I have my conspiracy theories as to what species had sex with which to make all these vicious magic monsters!  All critiques aside, this is a fantastic game!   Be honest please.  I don't want to hear disclaimers, fluffy plattitudes, PC nonsense, or rationalizations and justification.  Just be honest, and feel free to be extra mean about it :)  edit:  derp ta terp      You know, that one guy, who is in the tower with the gatling gun who mows you down if you stop to lace up your corset?  Does he drop anything of consequence?  I ask, because, after dying to him stupidly a bunch, I accidentally killed him by kicking him out of the tower, and he fell to and died on the walkway below, but the item(s) he dropped were just floating in mid-air above the ground, impossible to pick up.  I tried reloading and dying, but the items just dissapeared.   Loving the game so far, but some of the little bugs like this, among the stuttering and frame loss has been a bummer.  Anyway, thanks in advance for your replies.   LOL Fagz amirite?  My beby alreadyy staurved to deth cuz I to buzy playin Bleedbourne Soulz to feed teh littul faget.  Stupid casul babee faget got WRECKT!1  I tuld it to git guud an now I use it as a doorsttop!        This subreddit is awesome, I can't wait to participate, and I have a serious question here:  To go more in-depth than just the title, what if easy going, non-greedy Joe-Bloe has one reddit account, and posts once to get in on the drawing, and donates his part, while Joe-Bitch and Joe-Biznitch are friends, and together have 100 different reddit accounts each, and they can and will join the same drawing with 200 entries.  Is there anyway to weed this out?  I mean, never mind one person with multiple accounts, there could be multiple people pooling in, or any number of Joe-Biznitches out there.     While I understand the necessity of paying as a donation rather than buying in, it's sort of a bummer to know that it can be so easily abused.  Never mind the possibility of someone using a bunch of accounts to enter the drawing, but there is a chance that they wouldn't even be donating their part to the actual winner anyway.  Not trying to be a bummer or anything, and I still plan on participating, but I was curious as to what everyone thought about it, or if there are any security measures in place to try to help weed out things like this?  Is it just one of those things that 'goes with the territory' of this premise and subreddit?  Thanks in advance for your replies.         Dank Suls is guud   I cri evrytime   why o why   Sif hafto dye?   Hi all.  As the title said, I haven't really played much since the month of the last DLC (Ivory King), and I was wondering with all the news of the Sin of The First Flame and patches, if anything has really changed in game?  I don't mean the basics, like, katanas were buffed and lightning spears were nerfed again, but I'm just curious if they added any new areas or NPC's or more experience-changing elements like that.  Thanks in advance for your replies :)   And found it near completely lackluster, flat, and...boring?   nbsp;  I mean, once upon a time it was great fun to me (haven't played it seriously/competitively since wrath) - and I was dissapointed to find it as seemingly dull as I have as of late.  I suppose my expectations and I have changed a bit over the years, but the fundamentals of WoW haven't.  That being said,  I remember it once seemed like a high point in PvP play for MMO's, but I'm thinking that I might be comparing it too much to all the games I've played since then.     I mean, GW2 does large scale/siege combat much better, and is a little bit more action oriented, Rift did class trees/systems and basic combat better, Tera has more interactive and fun comat, EvE carries actual risks and rewards that will get your heart pumping, but WoW combat just feels so flat and dated.  I'm sure a lot of people still enjoy it, but I was just wondering what other's thought of it nowadays?  I was hoping to pick up WoW PvP like I used to in between hardcore raiding (now I play casuls lulz), but I jut couldn't do it, though I did appreciate the quick que times.      At heart I still love WoW, and it will stay where it is for me: my de facto PvE game, as I still think WoW is the most consistent and best general PvE experience for MMO's.  At the least, it's the most polished and well-funded experience :)  Would love to hear other's thoughts.   nbsp;  Thanks in advance for your responses.    Hi all - as the title says, I just bought Witcher 2, and I have very little familiary with the plot and characters, and I was wondering if there are any must knows when it comes to the story or lore so that I won't miss too much of the 2nd game's plot?  Any recomended reading or videos before I start playing the second game?  Normally I'd be quick to play the first title in a series like this, but when the reviews say the combat/mechanics/etc are so much better and smoother in the second, it makes me want to skip the first, especially since the third is coming out right around the corner, and my gaming time is limited.  Furthermore, I ask because I don't want to risk stumbling across too many spoilers by accident, so I appreciate any directions you wticher fans may give.   Without reading too much on plot and setting, so far, the games and ideas in it sound awesome, and I was especially craving low-fantasy, dark-souls esque game play, and other than a few odd or similar titles, this seemed to fit the bill close enough.  The rest of the factions, political intrigue and backstabbery spookiness is just icing on the cake :)  Thanks in advance for your replies.   Hi all,   As the title says, is this game still live?  While I've never played DAOC, I've heard mostly good things over the years, and I ask because I was interested on joining to scratch my PvP itch.   That being said, how are the populations on live?  Does it require a sub?  I mean, I have no problems with a sub, but I was wondering what the differences were between live, and the emu servers?  How are the population on the emu servers?  Also, how are the populations on the emu servers?   A few more questions:  what are the different types of realms/shards on live?  Ie, PvP?  PvE?  Free for all?  That sort of thing?  How are they organized?  I've read that DAOC was 3 v 3 realm factions, but I was wondering how they further organized it.  Lastly, how does this game hold up compared to more modern games?  Is the UI/organization/etc. fairly smooth and intuitive?  I have no problem with old or aging graphics, but a clunky UI and lack of features will always be a big draw back.  Thanks in advance for your replies :)   Hi all.  I was watching game-play footage and reading up on Albion Online, and seeing the game made me crave some similar sort of play - that is, some sort of pvp/crafting focused exploration open world fun.  The closest game recommendation I could find in searches for similar, yet already released titles was UO.  I've known about UO a long time, I've just never played it, as back in the day I wound up on EQ, and never tried UO.   That being said, for all you UO fans out there, care to give me a brief run-down of the game?  Some must-know tips for newbs maybe?  Any in-game recommendations or hints?  In the mean-time I've been reading up on wikis and websites, but I always enjoy talking to established fans and players.   Thanks in advance for your replies :)     For those of you who have been following the game and/or playing in the alpha, can anyone deny or confirm if this statement is accurate or not?  Of course I don't mean that I expect it to be exactly the same as EVE, but what about a fairly close approximation?  I mean - from equipment slots being filled with abilities just like mod slots give you abilities in Eve, to the devs trying to control RMT, to the 'you are your equipment' (in eve, your ship=you), to the security statuses of green, yellow, and red, to controlling territory, to losing your gear on death, it all seems pretty similar.  So far from what I've read and looked up, it seems like an awesome idea, and I'm sort of excited, but at the same time, it is also sort of horrifying.  If let's say, resource collecting is as boring as it is in EVE with mining (target rocks, turn on lasers, move, ship, store, compress, bring haulers, etc) or needing to multi/cheat box 16 accounts to truly get anywhere, then it loses a lot of its appeal.  Or let's say with grouping and fleets, if combat is as simple as being an F1 monkey like it is in EVE medium to large fleets (ie, you target who you're supposed to, turn on damage, and that's the fight), or any other number of quirks like that, it just seems like it would be boring, redundant, and, uh... not fun?   I mean, I've been playing EVE for a long time, but I mostly play to spend time with my brothers.  We only do PVP in a large null-sec alliance.  But even with the focus being combat, honestly, I don't feel like I'm playing a game with EVE - I feel like I'm tooling around and manipulating old, simple mechanics that resemble a game.  Ie, I feel like I'm just playing with the bones of a game, not the actual flesh and blood of it.  I enjoy it, to a point, but also, even with blowing up big spaceships and ruining many people's days, it's still kinda boring.   Anyway, those are my ruminations.  Just wondering what people think so far.  Thanks in advance for your time and responses.   Hi all - As the title says says, do you get the resources you used building buildings back in any way shape or form when you remove or replace them in your garrison?  I googled it in various ways but never found a straight answer.  Thanks in advance for your response.   Hi all.  As the title of the post says, I have questions on armor. Specifically, I know equipping an armor set is based on secondary stats, but is there a quick way to tell how much of your stats an armor piece uses?   I was taking armor pieces on and off while looking at the stat sheet and I noticed the stats going up and down, but is there an easier way to keep track of it?  Or a way to hell how many stats total a piece of armor or full set uses?   Also, aside doctor buffs, are there other ways to increase those secondary stats?  What about the reallocation (or whatever its called) option?  How does that work?   As far as HAM goes, I noticed things die when one of the 3 bars runs out, so does that essentially mean you're only as good as your weakest ham bar?  And with the different consumption levels of HAM from abilities, and enemies doing damage to different bars, is there an easy way to track this?  I noticed my abilities seem to drain different HAM numbers on enemie - does that occur based on the weapon I use or from the abilities themselves?  (Ie., basic attack or overshot with a rifle, or regular attack and 2h lunge attack with a heavy axe)   right now a lot of this stuff seems pretty arbitrary and nonsensical to me, so any clarity would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your replies :)   Hi all.  Whether or not you played the original Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning (which closed down in 2013), I'm curious if anyone here has played or plays on the private server?   http://www.returnofreckoning.com/about.php  I never had a chance to play the original game, but I plan on registering/setting it up the emu soon, and I was just wondering if anyone had some opinions or tips or ideas to offer up on the private server.  Specifically, how is balance between the two factions?  How is the game play in general?  That sort of thing.  As it stands, I know they are still ironing it out quite a bit and working on bugs and stuff, but so it goes for private servers.  Thanks in advance for your replies   Hello all,  I've just reinstalled MW4 Mercs on my newer Win 8.1 machine, and just like my old machine on windows 7, it's been working great.    The only problem is in the title of this post - any changes I make in the MW4 config ap don't seem to save.  Does anyone have any suggestions or know a fix for this?  Thanks in advance for your replies.   Seriously.  I don't know what it is about this game that sees that a good portion of the time your retarded pickup group loses terribly back to back, but I can't take much more of this (some things have not changed since beta).  In short I'm looking for people who are at least as competent as a pickle or a jar of mayonnaise, who are looking for other players to group with.  I'm on Pacific Standard time (CA, USA).   Drop me a line here on Reddit or in game.  My IGN is Balcombe.   Ok - not to repeat what anyone else has said because I've searched it many times over, but is this UI really what were left with?  I mean, it seems so piss-poor that it's hard to believe, so please understand tht I make this thread just to make sure I'm not missing anything:  So I log in last night for the first time in a year, and I didn't even get a chance to play because I spent about 2-3 stupid OCD hours after a years worth of patching sorting trough mechs, trying to find parts, figuring the terrible UI out until I stripped all my mechs, called it a night, and went to bed.    Now. I've tried a buncha searches to see if there was a fix or if I broke something, but it seems this new UI was put out nearly a year ago, and almost immediately the MWO forum blew up with players talking about how terrible it was to use and how it made te gaming experience a shit-show. Anyway. That was a lot of complaints from a lot of people almost a year ago, and it's still there?  So that means some dip-shit at PGI saw all that, experienced what a piece of crap the UI was, and somehow said, "it's acceptable. Working as intended."   I mean, I ask because, WTF?  I checked the patch notes today, stupidly thinking it would say the UI is fixed, but I guess to them there is nothing to fix?  Thanks in advance for your replies.    Anyone know of good current or in-development games that are what MWO should have been?  I play Hawken here and there as a sort of filler for FPS meeting mech action, but that is more FPS/twitch based, and it lacks the ideal of a mech game:   the mechlab/strategybrawling and twitch combat (though the brawling should fill its niche in there somewhere).  I looked into perpetum, both good and bad reviews, and it is too reminiscent of Eve, which I already play, and I refuse to try to get into another game like that.  Eve can be brutal and time consuming enough.  Essentially, I want to play MWO, just not the MWO that has been derped and rederped.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Anything with a solid mech/lab, decent options for builds and chassis, etc, that doesn't gate so much of the piddly amount of new content for absurd real money prices?  I mean, cash-shops are fine, but not how MWO has done it:  how many hundreds of dollars do they want to keep asking for a sub-par game before the diehard battletech fans kick in their monitors and quit the game?   I don't say these things to continue what I see as a fairly justified bitch-fest about the state of MWO, but from the bigger picture, that MWO is that crack-baby that was dropped on its head too many times and wound up in foster care and the only people willing to adopt it also abuse it.  Us long-time fans want to love it, but it's lacking in so many ways, and in the mean time PGI is golding the IP hostage, never mind the fact that us founders got screwed, the dev process has been clunky and slow, and PGI has more than bled the community dry in constant, shameless, bull-shit cash-grabs, and continues to do so.   Anyway - I say all this to give you an idea of the game I'm looking to play.  I don't mind in game cash-shops, so long as it doesn't gate content, specifically when that content is minimal.  A little bit of pay to sparkle or even p2w is fine.  I'd prefer a nice mix of strategy and twitch, and I'd prefer there be giant, powerful, robots smashing each other into oblivion.  Bonus points if the robots actually take skill, patience, and attention to drive.  Cheers, and thanks in advance for your responses.   As the title says, for crystal use purposes, what are BAMs considered?  Boss monsters or regular monsters?   That being said, does anyone have a good, up-to-date guide for leveling up via mob grinding?  I google searched it, but a lot of the information I'm finding seems out of date or changed.  If anyone could provide a link or put up a quick list of optimum mobs/locations to grind, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks in advance for your replies.   Hi all.  I just started playing the game and I am thoroughly enjoying my first few hours.  I'm writing this post to see if there is anyone available to join me.  I started a warrior (named Heavy.Meddles) and a sorcerer (Balcombe), and I'm having a hell of a time trying to decide which one to main because they are both fun to play so far.  Drop me a line here or in game if you'd like to level/group with me.  Thanks.   Hi Everybody,  As the title says, I haven't played since 2011 or so, and I was just wondering what some of the major changes were, as I have been looking at playing the game some more.  When I left the game, my main was a level 50ish (I don't remember exactly) magician (or whatever they are called), as well as a mid level assassin and warrior (or whatever they were called).  And yes, while I have been looking/googling this stuff a little bit at a time, I also figured why not ask the friendly reddit people for a more concise answer, especially to a few specific questions:  1.  I left a little while after they released the kromede/judge and lower level solo missions.  What are the major game/class/etc changes since then?  2.  PvP was fun - the abyss being one of the primary hunting grounds - are the PvP battles still hearty and large scale and super laggy?  Also, being that it is a korean MMO - while the PvP gear was good, it was also an insane grind (just like the PvE gear) to get any of it.  Is this still the case?  I mean, I don't need or want gear to be handed to me, but korean farm-style playing is madness!  Has this changed for the better?  3.  Is the game still PvP centric in general?  What are the primary servers, and how is the balance on them?  4.  Offhand, I can't remember if you paid straight kinah to reskin items, or if you just bought a consumable.  How is reskinning/wardrobe handled nowadays?  5.  How about the Classes/Professions or whatever they are called?  Any one care to give me a quick run down?  Ie, "PvP is dominated by so-and-so, so-and-so massive DPS OP, so-and-so massive under powered, so-and-so is a joke, etc"  6.  How is the economy?  As usual, I remember this MMO being dominated by gold-sellers and bots, everything was super pricey, and kinah was slow to grind, making everything a PITA.  Has this changed for the better?  Is it more stable?  Still bot dominated?  Etc?  Thanks in advance for your replies.     Hiya.  Been on a haitus for many months and I was wondering if anyone had a general idea of what palladiums go for nowadays?  The one I have is 2*, +8 Gallant if I remember correctly.

Will be around for a few hours tonight, and maybe tomorrow night.  Drop me a line if you're interested.  Thank you.  P.S. - I tired posting this in r/wheelanddeal but I kept getting error messages   This conversation came up within a post of this subreddit, so I wanted to ask the DS community at large what their suggestions are when it comes to finding other games that are challenging and intriguing enough to play through, ie., games that raise the bar like the Souls series, or at least, games that don't feel too easy or stale, especially when compared to the Souls franchise.  While I know this isn't directly DaS2 per se, I feel it is in good taste, and could help other people find new and fun games to play as well.  I'm a PC gamer, but I do plan on getting a PS4 in the months to come for Bloodborne, but any system suggestions are welcome, as other people can benefit.   Point is, while there are many fun games out there, few have the risk and reward factors, immersion, compelling and mysterious stories, lore, and fun gameplay wrapped together as well as the Souls series does.  I'm not necessarily looking for Souls clones, or games that are even in the same fantasy genre or share similar combat systems, but just other well balanced, challenging games.  Worth noting, other than saying DaS2 is a better RPG game, but DaS is a better Souls game, I'm leaving out critique on DaS and DaS2 for this post, mainly focusing on what makes them fun and challenging games.   While I'm open to any game, regardless of reviews and opinions, to help narrow it down, I can add a few critiques or reviews of other noteworthy games and series:   Morrowwind, Oblivion, Skyrim, that series:  Fun, to a point, often redundant, repetitive, weaker combat/magic systems, worth their dollar value in entertainment, but the stories and characters were never compelling enough that I ever finished a single game, even after logging 60-100+ hours on some.   MMO's:  Honestly, most of them have terrible writing, bad stories, stale gameplay, and very few innovations.  They often lack any weight, and feel like button mashing with little to no immersion.  Thus they wind up repetitive grinds, even if some of the character, boss, and level design is well rendered.  The treadmill just gets old, and this comes from an old Ultima/EQ/WoW (played WC since WC1, had to know what happened in the story, etc.   Legend of Grimrock:  Right up my alley.  I love old-school dungeon crawlers - for the challenges in puzzles and combat, the change of pace, as well as nostalgia.  Graphics aint everything.  I have been members of Dungeon Master/Chaos Strikes Back/related games and clones communities, and have many user-made dungeons and other emulators and remakes for these types of games.   Dead Space:  Overall, this is my favorite shooter/survivor horror game in recent years.  Great story, great characters, lots of twists and turns, well-written, scary and immersive, and somewhat innovative, or at least, had some noteworthy differences.  Loved that your character was a crafty engineer rather than a soldier.  You used mining tools for weapons!  Was great!   Dragon Age Origins:  Was a great game at the time.  Was definitely immersive, as the characters were cheeky and well-written, the voice acting was good, and the world had some great lore, even if the tropes are old as writing itself.  Looking back, the combat was kinda meh, if somewhat strategic at times, and the levels seem pretty small and thus the game limited, but still a memorable game.  I never bothered with the second, as I was bored within a minute of the demo.   Mass Effect:  While I enjoyed the first and second, by the time I got to the third just this last month or two (yeah, I was late to the party), I dunno, the game just felt stale and limited and so easy, even on the highest difficulties.  The levels and areas to explore just seemed so simple and rehearsed, and at times it just feels like the AI/system is playing the game for me.  While the series was intriguing enough for the first two games, after being ruined by the souls series, now it just seems boring and redundant.    Anyway, all that being said, I'm up for all and any suggestions, preferably with the elements of good writing, fun/challenging gameplay, immersion, and better risk/reward systems.  Saving and reloading constantly definitely diminishes this, but I look forward to what you guys have to say.  Thanks in advance.   Hello everyone.  While I know there have already been speculative posts on this reddit about the title question, can anyone confirm or deny if any of the higher-ups at Sony/From/Miyazaki/etc. have either confirmed, denied or even given a maybe on whether or not there will be a Bloodborne bundle?  I've searched the web, but no dice so far.    I ask because, if so, I would like to wait for the bundle, rather than pre-ordering the deluxe edition Bloodborne early, as well as a PS4 separately.  Thanks in advance for your replies.   Well, if I had to title this story, it would be, "Guess how many times I died during the tutorial?"  Psshaw, none at all.  That would be pathetic, amirite, or amirite!?  So what started out as a perfect no death chievo run for the first three minutes ended abruptly in Things Betwixt when I derped off the edge of a cliff.  I said, "you know what death, not today."  I then died 2 minutes later when I missed a plunging attack and took an arrow in the ass.  After being defeated by the tutorial, I headed on my to Majula, to ya know, kick rocks and mope around with the rest of the bipolar twits.  After losing my left testicle to one of the piglets, I went forth to brave the forest of the fallen giants.  At this point, my girlfriend started talking at me.  I love her to death, but man she can talk.  I nodded, and I said "uh huh, uh huh, yeah" and then I died.  She kept talking.  And then I died again.  Then I realized I love her, but I don't love her to death, and I got mad at her, and I told her, "not now, you can fill my ear holes with words later!," and that's when she got mad at me, so I took a break from the game to grovel and kiss her ass and apologize.  I told her to stay away from me for the next week or two as I would be very angry.  Very, very angry.  Lots of cursing to ensue....   Ahem, so, anyway, I resume braving the forest of fallen giants with a crossbow in my left hand, a mace in my right hand, and an imported sack over my head to hide my hollowed shame.  I die a few more times  whilst slapping around various zombies and meth addicts, and finally I make it to the last giant.  Speaking of which, did you ever think what a liar he is?  There are quite a few more giants in Black Gulch, and they exist in memories at the least, so fuck you Last Giant, you lying liar.  What else are you lying about?!  Ehrm, anyway, I take him down on the first go, and he died like a punk with no integrity what so ever.  Having a surplus of souls I buy a zillion wooden bolts to slay hookers and vampires from a distance, and with my spirits renewed, I zip over to Heide's tower to go toe to toe with the dragon rider.  I run past all the enemies and bum rush the fog gate.  I was going to duke it with him like a man, cuz I'm a man like that - always working on cars and bench-pressing saber-tooth tigers like a man, but somehow, mysteriously, by no plan of my own, the dragon rider took exactly six steps forward and raised his mighty halberd at me.  I'm no fool, so I dodge right as he lunges forward, and whaddayaknow, the clumsy bastard fell off the edge of the arena and died like a derp!  I was going to raise the edges of the platform so we could spar, but I, uh, just forgot.  Anyway, that is where I paused my adventure so far.  Tonight I plan on going back for fake Ornstein, because ya know, I hate liars.  One more baddie to die in poverty and shame!  I got your number fake Ornstein!   Anyway, after working on various DaS level 1 runs, I gotta say, while easier so far in some ways than DaS 1Broing, the worst of it has been learning the sweet spot on the pitiful dodge roll.  Even at well under 50%, there are like what, negative two i-frames?  I swear, compared to the fast roll of DaS, or the ninja-WTF-flipping, I feel like an obese shut-in with no cartridge in his knees.  Learning to dodge as such has a much steeper curve - especially since my onebro seems to purposefully roll into every arrow that is shot at him.   That being said, stay tuned for more adventures of a DS2 OneBro!     After taking a break from Dark Souls 2 I returned to Dark Souls and created a Paladin character.   I found myself in Anor Londo, stuck at the infamous silver knight archer gauntlet, and while I've had melee characters have little trouble with that part before, for some reason, I just couldn't get past it.  I prolly lost 50k souls total and lots of humanity at this point,  and after dying countless times (like 12 times, but I can't count that high), I die another 5 times, and finally, on like, the 20th try, I dash up that small span one final time, and there in the middle of it is a black vagabond!  I panic because I've never seen one, and I wanna know what's inside it, but I also know I'm in the worst position ever.  He shoots a homing soul mass type projectile right over me, and by the time I realize, "hey, it's the most rare enemy in the game, i wanna kill it for lootz!" and try to swing my sword, he swings his pincer and one shots me, and a second later the dragon arrows start  raining down on my body.  That was the first and only time I've seen a black vagabond to date.  I think I remember seeing a red one, but that was a year or two ago.  Anyway.  At that point, after dying 1,745 times at that spot, and finally to the black vagabond, my hatred turned to laughter, and after briefly contemplating suicide, I finally got past the silver knights.  Sadly, I have yet to see that little black bastard since then.  With that story out of the way, what is your most memorable death?  Also, has anyone killed a black vagabond?  If so, what did it drop?  With how bad-ass they are, it's gotta be the cure for cancer, or an autographed picture of Jesus!  What say you?  	105
       I know an older guy who took things personally after losing to a young "showboater" and decided to start a real fight to which the instructors stopped before it could happen and banned him from the school. I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen or been in this type of situation and what the outcome was.  Edit: Why is this getting downvoted?   I know Wing Chun was prominently highlighted, but there were also other various styles of Kung Fu as well. Can anyone distinguish the various styles of Kung-Fu demonstrated in the movie?  Japanese Karate was a big aspect of the movie, but does anyone know what particular style of Karate it was?  I thought the movie was very well choreographed and I love how they displayed various styles of martial arts in it :)   Like, how likely would it be viable. What're the chances that your wrist is going to be grabbed at some point so that you can put your attacker into a wrist lock?  At my old Taekwondo school, we practiced more than 20 different variations of wrist locks that all involved your opponent grabbing your wrist and you using a type of arm/wrist/shoulder lock to defend yourself.  At my current Taekwondo school, when I asked about my current Master about why we don't practice wrist locks, he said that the only person that's going to grab your wrist is a Cop and that it'd be more beneficial to be spending time on actual fight training rather than "One-Step or Self Defense Techniques."   Is it bad that my Taekwondo dojang doesn't teach wrist-grab defense or is that skill just not very useful as say knowing how to kick properly?      ...while wearing the RF costume?                           Say someone started a physical altercation with me and I defended myself by putting him in a submission   told him to stop. Say, the attacker continued to be aggressive so I finished the armbar and broke his arm and he wanted to sue me. Would I be in trouble or would I be able to walk away from any legal trouble on the basis of self-defense?   Clearly, in many Karate   Taekwondo schools among all others, we see a large amount of children earning their black belts. If the student has sufficiently demonstrated knowledge and skill that a black belt is required and expected to have, what is the problem with promoting them? A Black Belt doesn't mean that you're able to defend yourself in any situation possible, but it does mean you're able to perform the appropriate techniques and forms that you should've mastered by that level.   Hell, this [7 year old girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65QCHZDXKmA spfreload=10), who is also a Black Belt, performs forms with precision, spirit, and technique way better than many adults I've seen (even adults with Black Belts). Maybe even better than people on this subreddit.  Just because they are children does not mean that they are incapable of having good technique and the skill that a Black Belt is expected to have.  In my own opinion, I believe "Junior" Black Belts would be more appropriate for children and that they should be required to reach a reasonable age before testing for an Adult Black Belt. But, I still don't understand the ridiculous amounts of criticism against Kids with Black Belts.   The most ridiculous thing I've heard is how "a school with kids running around with black belts is *most definitely* a McDojo." So you're saying that the girl in the video above was trained at a McDojo? Unlikely.  In my opinion, the amount of young students who have Black Belts at any given school should not give alarm that the school, itself, is a McDojo. Critique them on their technique and skill, not on their age.  Again, that young girl in the video above has demonstrated Kata/Form much better than a lot of grown men I've seen.  Children are clearly capable of having such skill that is expected of a Black Belt.  Thoughts, opinions?      https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=84838260 x-yt-ts=1422327029 v=Ka6kSxTCeVU#t=11981  Just as an example, somewhere at 4:04:25, he scores with a punch and scores with another later in the fight as well.  Many other fighters in the video are scoring with punches as well.   Kind of a scary thought. Would make things more confusing/slightly more difficult, imo.   Mine would be "Ahh-tayy!," Baaah-Chaa!," or "Ushhh!"   Papermate pencils have had the worst erasers on them in my experience. Those erasers just smudge everything and do the exact opposite of what they are intended to do.       Felicity: Then how do we know it's Oliver's blood?  Merlyn: ...Because after I leave, you'll test it and after you confirm that it *is* his blood, you'll exhaust yourself with conspiracy theories as to how I planted it or how it's all a lie. And after enough time passes, you'll be left with one inescapable truth - that Oliver Queen is dead.  Thanks to Merlyn we just saved a few episodes where Felicity could've potentially went through a bunch of time trying to confirm that it is Oliver's blood then exhausting herself with conspiracy theories as to how Merlyn planted it or how it's just a lie. And after maybe 2-3 episodes she'd finally start coming to terms with Oliver Queen's death.  Damn, Merlyn must've watched a lot of Asian dramas to point out all these clichs.  John Barrowman is such a great actor.    Also, what do you guys think about the new Canary costume?  Old: http://cdn1-www.superherohype.com/assets/uploads/gallery/arrow-birds-of-prey/71676.jpg  New: http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/i/2014/11/25/Katie-Cassidy_612x380.jpg  Is it possible that the new Canary costume is more conservative because Laurel doesn't have the ample boobage to pull off the more revealing look?   Like for example, in Japan, would Karate or Judo be a regular as part of a student's formal physical education in school?      For example, does the average Judo Dojo address how to defend against a striker or does it just solely teach sport Judo with throws?  I've tried out a Judo/Jiu-Jitsu school once that claimed to teach "Self-Defense" (as many martial arts schools do nowadays) but only taught throws while completely neglecting how to get in position for a throw in no-gi and how to set-up a throw when an opponent is coming in with kicks and punches. Basically, they just slapped on the "Self-Defense" logo on their Sport Judo training.  I've had the same scenario with Taekwondo. The dojang I go to claims to teach "Self-Defense" but all I learned was how to spar under "Olympic Taekwondo rules" which is does not accurately simulate real fighting scenarios.  Do the training in schools that primarily focus on training for tournaments (like Taekwondo, Judo, maybe even BJJ) naturally translate into real life self-defense even if you aren't given instruction on how to do so?  For example, I don't think someone who solely practices Olympic Taekwondo sparring would be very adept in defending themselves against punches or chokeholds.  Another example would be Kyokushin. Kyokushin Karate is a great martial art, but it does not cover Face Punches at all in it's sparring, so how can Kyokushin practitioners be conditioned/expected to take/defend against punches if all they train in is Kyokushin sparring? Unless they're naturally gifted, talented, or have training in doing so, they can't be expected to do so.   Would someone that only trains under "sport/tournament" rulesets be able to effectively defend themselves in a hostile situation?  EDIT: I'm actually considering taking Kung-Fu San Soo which primarily focuses on "No Rules, Street Self-Defense" on the side to supplement my Martial Arts training as all the training I've ever had has only been practiced under rulesets. On the street, there are no rules.   MMA Training is very vigorous, especially to high level athletes, however many manage to go through all that Cardio and manage to still have a significant amount of bodyfat on them. I've always wondered if that had more to do with genetics because obviously, leading up to a fight, a fighter will be on a healthy, clean diet along with an intense training regimen to prepare them for what's to come.  However, I noticed people like BJ Penn or Daniel Cormier (no Fried Chicken jokes please) always seem to carry stubborn bodyfat on them despite the weight cut. Is it just very difficult for some people to reach a low percentage of bodyfat (ripped physique, six pack) than other people? Like are there other factors to it?  It's just hard for me to wrap my mind around how people like Roy Nelson can go through an intense training regime and still manage to be fat.  Excuse the stupid question, it's just something I've always wondered.               Basically preempts where one guy jabs with a knife, you block then grab, go for some sort of lock, trip, or throw and then disarm or where you attempt to hit the knife out there hand, etc.  Obviously in real life, things would not go so smoothly and one cannot predict which direction the knife will come at them nor can they think that fast before they inevitably get struck at in a hostile situation where the attacker is motivated to strike.  However, I believe training and experience is better than no training and experience but I can't possibly imagine someone being able to react fast enough in a real life hostile scenario to defend themselves against a knife attack even with obtained muscle memory.  Hostile situations with a knife are unpredictable and a lot of schools teach pre-set movements, one steps, if you will.  I'd love to hear your guys' opinions on the teachings of pre-set knife defense maneuvers and what purpose/benefit they have, if there is any.  In real life, those one-steps more than likely won't go down as smoothly as how you practice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsLkqwQrCS8  EDIT: In my opinion, with practicing with a "live" training partner on knife defense would be the best way to go about it when going about it at all.  There's no guaranteed way to protect yourself in a hostile situation and it's usually best to try and escape rather than fight back.  However, if it's a life or death scenario and you know you could possibly die whether you're being compliant with the attacker or not, you want to have a good fighting chance and I think "live" training with knife defense would benefit someone more than pre-set movements.   Surely they go half-speed or non full-contact when regarding knees and elbows or another safer way to apply them?  They just seem like very deadly strikes in the Octagon and it's hard to imagine fighters being able to keep going to practice all the time if they're throwing and landing hard knees and elbows during sparring.      Went surfing the web for solutions but couldn't find anything.   My airplane mode is on, my Find My iPhone and iCloud is off, I have backed up my iPhone on iTunes, my Auto-Lock is set to Never, I have erased all content and settings, set my date to June 2nd, 2014, and my current iPhone is completely clean-wiped, yet Pangu still isn't working for me.  I believe I have tried everything.  I keep getting this screen whenever I try to jailbreak: http://i.imgur.com/kKFuTOa.png  "unable to get jailbreak resources,please check your network"  My Wi-Fi is working just fine. Please help, I don't know what to do.   EDIT: Also, I am using a Mac.   of Korra and Asami leaping into the spirit portal, before "The End" characters appeared, we hear 3 notes of "Safe Return," a song from Avatar: The Last Airbender? (For Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vQuF8a9jU)      And no one else seems to acknowledge it. I can't tell if this is an inside joke, if people are playing along, or if other people are totally oblivious that it was a repost.  [Here's an example I noticed just today:  http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2rx19n/no_spoilers_my_friends_all_agree_i_have_the/   http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2oll18/no_spoilers_my_bff_bought_me_a_laptop_decal_for/   http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2nwqsf/no_spoilers_figured_you_guys_would_like_my_new/ ]                     I would first like to point off that I am not a Wing Chun practitioner.  I noticed in a lot of Wing Chun drills, they tend to practice what is known as a "Sticky Hand" drill where they start off with one hand touching the other partner's hand and they keep trapping and blocking until one person manages to get off the chain punches.  Eventually, one gets very good at doing this but is this a practical method of training for someone that might not end up fighting another Wing Chun practitioner? Obviously, in a fight against another style, the fight doesn't start with the hands touching and one might not be able to pull off all the intricate traps and blocks that they practice.   The entire story of Avatar: The Last Airbender [All 3 Books] happen within one year.  So much character development in one year, so many things happen, so many things change.   I realized that the majority of the shipping done throughout the show were by the male demographic.   Not trying to be intentionally sexist or anything, but I always thought that it was the female demographic that were pro-shipping.   Also, whenever she talked, her mouth would move weird or unnatural.                              I've been focusing hard on stretching for quite a long time and I have yet been able to do a high side kick, yet I see young children be able to do seemingly effortlessly without having to work much on their flexibility. It's as if they are naturally more flexible. Is their a reason behind this?  And also, is it possible for an adult to achieve the high level of flexibility that a child can obtain?   This is my goal: http://www.changstaekwondo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Changs-Taekwondo-Flexibility.jpg  It just seems extremely difficult to achieve. I can go as high as above the body, and to the face in real-time. But to hold a side kick that high is difficult for me. Any tips?         Aang could demolish an entire fleet, Roku demolished an entire palace, Yangchen could move an entire forest with just the Avatar-State Enhanced Airbending, Kyoshi could move fucking Islands.  Korra just shot a long stream of air and lifted a big rock. Was the Avatar State REALLY necessary to do that? It should be able to do **MUCH** much more than just blast a strong burst of air and lift a big rock. Aang could do that at 12 without the Avatar State and he never managed to fully master the elements during the war.  Every scene in which Korra accesses the Avatar State aside from finale Boss Battles has been ridiculously lackluster. Remember Aang in the desert, or against the Earth General who tried to force him into the Avatar State? Korra just doesn't compare. She turns on the Avatar State and gets wiped aside by Dark Spirits or some shit.  Also, in a battle against Combustion Man, Aang straight blasted through a Mountain (and this was after almost getting killed by Azula AND losing access to the Avatar State) whereas Korra gets slammed aside by a rock by Kuvira.  EDIT: Obviously, this is an unpopular opinion but I'm not going to delete this thread. I'm tired of caring about getting downvoted a million times before getting a single upvote. I don't know nor longer care about why people seem to downvote for little to no reason. I just wanted to put this up for friendly discussion.      I kick significantly higher when I'm kicking at real-time/fast.   But, when I'm doing it slower to focus and practice technique, I can't kick nearly as high.  For EX: I can do a High Sidekick to the face if I'm doing it in real-time, but if I'm just trying to focus on form and doing it slow-I can only go as high as the body.  There has to be a logical explanation to this.         Clicking on the South Park sign takes me to the front page of Reddit and everything else that's clickable takes me either /r/trees or YouTube.  Nothing fucking redirects to South Park so I have to do it manually.   Okay, so, today is sparring day.  But, I had just finished up some late night classes (I have class from 9-6 PM on Wednesdays) so I was too worn to fight after taking five consecutive exams.  I figured I could just go to practice and watch just to see if I could pick-up something, so I headed off to my Taekwondo dojang right after I left campus.  I ended up showing to class pretty early so I just chilled and waited on the benches after the kids class was over.  The adult class began 30 min. after so I had time to just relax.    A White Belt, whom I haven't met before, was also on the bench so I decided to make conversation with him.  I asked him if he was planning on competing in the upcoming tournament and he told me he's been having some issues lately and that he isn't where he wants to be (sparring-wise) to enter a tournament.  So, since we had time to kill before class, I decided to try and help the guy out with his sparring by teaching him some combinations he can throw. (EX: Roundhouse Kick set-up followed up with a Back Kick/Spinning Heel Kick) The Master took a seat and watched us for a bit before he started class when a couple other people showed up.  We ended up working for a good 20 minutes before two more guys showed up and class began.  (Tournament is on Friday so a lot of our competitors are taking it easy these last few days before their fights, that's why not many people showed up) Though I was planning on just sitting this practice out, I figured I should join in (didn't bring a uniform so I was just in T-Shirt and Jeans lol) to give the White Belt, we'll call him Jackie, a good practice and so that the two Black Belts could spend time training with each other to prepare for the tournament.  We did some warm-ups, then some basic kicking drills on the hogus, and then finally we started some sparring.  I decided that I would do some light-contact with Jackie just so he could get the opportunity to apply the techniques we discussed and practiced before practice.  So, when it was our turn to spar, I just played defense and baited Jackie to lure out those combinations he practiced earlier.  He ended up landing a lot of the combinations, and I was very impressed.  However, my Master started commenting on my technique and how I wasn't striking back when I had the opportunity to and etc. etc..  (I thought it was obvious why since I was a Blue Belt and he's a White Belt, I wanted to match him at his own level but I wanted to also give him time to get comfortable with using attacks in combination)  I ended up getting lectured a bit on how I was doing and the Master referred to us as "around the same level of skill." I was a bit disappointed because I thought the Master knew I was going easy on the guy, since I was a higher belt and I originally had intention of practicing today like I told him before class started.  It seemed as if he believes that how I was sparring was actually how I sparred Made me feel kind of upset, I guess.  So after class, I told the Master that I was going slower than usual because I wanted to give Jackie the opportunity to practice what we talked about before practice and the Master commented that he was surprised to see Jackie land a couple of those moves.  He thanked me for helping Jackie out and said I could make a good coach someday.  That said, I'm still not entirely certain whether or not he knew/believed that I was quite easier than usual.  Makes me feel eh. /:  What do you guys think? It's been bothering me a bit since the car ride home.  **tl;dr: Went easy on a beginner and got critiqued for it.  I feel like my Master thinks that I was actually giving it my all because he criticized how I wasn't hitting at every open opportunity I had. (When I was really going easy on purpose so the beginner could have a chance at scoring on me)  So, basically, I think he thinks I suck despite me having trained for quite awhile compared to the beginner.**  **Update: Thank you very much everyone for your comments.**         I know some schools tend to "lie" about their competitors' age and belt level so that they would have an edge over competition.  But that got me thinking, since in a lot of schools grading/testing is up to the student what if someone decided to remain a white belt/lower belt for a very long time?  That would give them a ridiculous edge amongst lower belts that have just gotten their rank/haven't been training as long after they've received their belt in competition.  Is there any way to judge where someone should be at in competition? My Master offered to change my birthdate and suggest that I compete at a lower belt level than where I'm at so that I could have a better chance at winning my next competition.  The whole thing seems very shady.  I recall my Master telling me about a tournament in which a White Belt was using Spinning Heel Kicks, Back Kicks, and other various advanced kicks at a high degree of flexibility.  Either that was a Martial Arts prodigy, or they weren't actually a white belt.  (My Master believes the latter.)  Any thoughts and opinions on this topic?         Hey /r/martialartists. I have a big question regarding weight training and cutting for tournaments. Right now I'm a pretty skinny individual and I've been trying to bulk up and gain some muscle. I've bulked up ~15 lbs since I first started weight training and a trainer recommended I at least get up to 165 lbs (I'm 142-5 lbs rn) before I even think about cutting just because I don't have enough muscle mass on me yet to make an efficient cut.  However, for an upcoming tournament I would have to cut down to 125-135 lbs if I want to have an even fight.  The time frame from here till the upcoming tournament (Jan) isn't enough for me to bulk efficiently to put on more muscle, which is my goal.  Doing martial arts already makes it difficult enough to put on weight but it's recommended that I don't try to put on weight because I'll be slower and outclassed in sparring.  I've been told by /r/fitness that if I cut right now, since I don't have much muscle mass, I'll look like an anorexic twig. I'll likely be much weaker as well.  I'm conflicted over if I should continue to bulk and if I should cut for tournaments.  Pros of Bulking and weight training is that I'll be able to put on more muscle and gain strength.  Downside is that I'll likely be somewhat slower and if I do manage to get to 165 and decide to spar at that weight division, at my 5'8'' height, I'll likely be sparring with guys 6'' and over.   Pros of Cutting is that I'll be lighter and more agile and quicker. I'll also likely get an even match-up at a tournament as well. Someone closer to my height and reach.  Downside is that I'll be terribly skinny and weak if I drop to 125 with the amount of muscle I currently have right now.   I definitely don't think I'll look like Bruce Lee or even come close to the strength he had if I drop from 145 to 125. (Since Bruce was 5'7.5''   125 lbs by the end of Enter the Dragon) He had a ripped physique, one I hope to obtain but I was told that just cutting won't give me that physique. That I have to bulk and gain muscle first before cutting fat.  I'm so conflicted. Anyone think they can offer me some advice?   When we do kicking drills with the shields/pads or with just wearing a chest protector, I still get knocked the air out of me sometimes when someone lands a good back kick and it still hurts when someone is just pounding on my ribs with those alternating roundhouses while I just stand there with my chest gear on. Is this something you get used to over time?  At the school I originally started out at, the students didn't kick very hard at all. But after trying out a few other Taekwondo and Muay Thai schools, I notice the majority of students training with intensity. Of course we don't intentionally try to kill each other, or at least I don't, but it really sucks when you're just standing there holding a shield/pad or with your arms out to the side, fully vulnerable with chest gear exposed and having to just tank those kicks. Damn, they can hurt.   I noticed trying to breathe out when getting kicked seems to help when I'm wearing the chest gear and acting as a human dummy or applying a bit of counter-force at the same time my opponent kicks the shield/pad I'm holding.  Any advice on how to minimize the pain? Or am I just being kind of a bitch.   I know Tenzin sent his three children on a mission to find her, but I really thought they were going to have a full-scale investigation ASAP. I realize they were busy with the bullshit Coronation and etc. but still.   In their minds, Korra's still somewhat fragile/in-recovery. So...   We've heard Meelo and Ikki talk but Jinora has been very quiet.  EDIT: I think I might be mistaken and we've only seen her in 2/3 of the episodes so far. But still.         I've been training at my Taekwondo Dojang for a year and recently switched to a different one. At this new Dojang we practice using a full range of motion and carrying through all the way when we do Head Kicks. At my old Dojang we were taught to have control and not make contact with Head Kicks, so I have this extremely bad habit of stopping RIGHT BEFORE I make contact. I can't get over it. It shows up during kicking drills and it shows up during sparring.   Please give me advice.  EDIT: This only applies to Head Kicks, btw. I throw body kicks just fine.   I read somewhere that they're trying to add punches back into Taekwondo. I think the way Olympic Sparring is ruled is a little ridiculous. It discourages punches by making them nearly impossible to score with so you'll always see Olympic TKD Practitioners sparring with their hands down. Try catching a punch in Olympic Taekwondo matches.  The whole thing is like foot fencing.      As much as I'd love to see him fight his way to the top again, I believe his age will be against him.      I can't find one. Clicking on Stan, Kyle, Kenny, or Cartman takes me to YouTube and clicking on the South Park sign takes me to the Reddit Front Page.      At my Taekwondo Dojang, you have the option to test every two months. $69 a week before the testing date and you're pretty much guaranteed to go up a belt. No one ever fails.   I think it's a little ridiculous how easy it is to go up Belts. I've already paid $300+ and there's still 10 more Belts to go before I reach Black Belt. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm learning anything new besides forms when going up belts though. I don't think I'm getting adequate training and I want to say the same for my fellow students as well.  As an Orange Belt sparring with Brown and Black Belts, my teacher has asked me to go easier on them which I find ridiculous. The level of skill that the majority higher level belts have is very lacking. I shouldn't have to go easier on higher belts just because I train harder than them in my free time.  I was thinking about this earlier and I realized how pointless these Belts are now. I don't think I can afford to keep paying for my Belt testing and that is why I will never achieve my dream of becoming a Black Belt.  Besides, money is scarce right now and college books are more important to me.  **tl;dr: Belts at my Dojang aren't so much a measure of skill as they are a measure of how much disposable income you have.**  Thoughts, opinions?   Thoughts, opinions. Discussion.   Trying to do MMA for the first time. Can you guys give me your opinion on the pricing for the MMA gym by my place?  $250 first month for membership fee + sparring gear. Access to unlimited Muay Thai Classes, Xtreme Kickboxing, Heavy Bag room, and Weight Room, and No Gi Jiujitsu. $125 a month after the first month.   It's a 1 year contract.   Total comes to $1,625 a year.            I've been doing Olympic-Style WTF Taekwondo for a year now.  My Taekwondo school has been getting really stale lately. The only people in my adult class are two 12 and 13 y/o boys, three 15-16 y/o girls, a ~40ish y/o man, occasional 30 y/o women, and a 17 y/o me. I can't fucking spar full force against anyone without being afraid I'll break them (literally). We've had to **cancel all our sparring classes** because the low number of students in the Adult class who actually show up on Sparring days. So right now all we do is Forms, Kicking Drills, BS Self-Defense lessons (Oh, if you punch me I'll step to the side and strike your organs! Wait no! You're supposed to not react when I chop you in the ribcage!!! ), and other random things that would get me *mugged* irl.   I practice by myself these past few months after all the teenage boys/ young men around my age left. I usually don't show up to class as much anymore, and when I do we hardly even do kicking drills anymore.  I feel like I get a lot more practice just doing kicking drills with the dummy on my own and going to class and comparing myself with the Black Belts confirms it.   The Black Belts in my class aren't real Black Belts, imo. They don't remember their One-Step forms, Poomsaes, and they're very sub-par when it comes to Sparring. I usually make short-work with them and I'm only a Purple-Striped Belt. It got to the point where, when we did do sparring, that my Master would ask me to go easier on them. I'm 100% sure they would get mugged irl too.  I recently went to an **MMA Gym** and tried out the Muay Thai class there and man was I impressed. People do not waste time there. We spend ~10-15 minutes or so warming up by Jumping Rope (Which is one hell of a leg burn) and alternating between Push-Ups and Sit-Ups. Afterwards we grab a partner and practice various sets of combinations/techniques with the pads and then we get to have a "free round" where we can practice anything we want. We get some time to spar at the end of each class as well. Let me tell, you. It was intense. No one was going easy. In fact, after getting into the habit of always holding back with my strikes, the students there and the teacher there encouraged me to hit harder because I was hitting too softly (compared to everyone else who uses their roundhouse kicks like they're swinging a freaking bat.) At the end of the day I was really sweaty and ridiculously sore all over, a feeling I would never get in Taekwondo class. I learned so much in that one day class trial too and got the chance to come to another day for free. A lot of Taekwondo techniques do transition over to Muay Thai pretty well and the coaches there offered to help me build off of what I already know since they also have had experience in Taekwondo. Oh, they also have a huge gym too. There's a weight room, heavy bag room, octagon/cage, everything. Also everyone in here looks like they're in **very good shape**. It's mostly young men, a couple older guys (that're still in very good shape as well), and a few girls that can probably take on all the Black Belts at my school single-handedly.  A lot of the habits we develop in Taekwondo - like not keeping our hands up is a very *very* **very** bad habit in Muay Thai since in Olympic Taekwondo, they restrict face punches. Now since Boxing is a big aspect in Muay Thai, if you keep your hands low, you're gonna get knocked out.  I also realized how terrible my hands were. I can't recall a single day we practiced punches in Taekwondo, despite the fact that the Master keeps claiming it's 70% Kicking and 30% Punching. Unless, you include the Punching we do as part of our forms as Punching, than yeah I guess. Looking back, Olympic Taekwondo sparring is no way analogous with Practical/Realistic Fighting whereas Muay Thai is **very** practical.  Unfortunately, if I stop doing Taekwondo (my year contract is over by the end of this month btw) before I reach my Black Belt, my father would be very disappointed. My father has encouraged me so much to earn my Black Belt (because apparently it looks good on college applications or something) and it's heavily implied that I would make him very proud if I managed to earn it. But, I don't want to spend his money on learning all the nonsense I've had to put up with this entire year. It's not worth it, imo.  Oh yeah, by the way, you can pretty much go up a belt every two months if you can afford to pay the $70 Belt "testing" fee. There's fucking 15 Belts though and I'm not even halfway there yet. I've gone up 5 Belts in a year though.  Disclaimer: NO disrespect to my Master or the Art of Taekwondo, itself. This is just my own opinion with my particular school and experience.   tl;dr: I'm not learning anything new in TKD. Went to a Muay Thai class, learned a lot and broke one hell of sweat doing so. Should I switch and make myself happy (and a better martial artist) or should I try to go for my Black Belt and make my father happy?   EDIT: Hopefully I get at least a few answers. I can already tell I pissed some people off by the *huge amount of downvotes*. Even though I have no idea why. Sorry if I posted this on the wrong subreddit.    **EDIT#2**: Stunning realization at 3 AM I've wasted time and money learning fucking nonsense that the school has taught me.  Who the fuck fights with their guard down?   I DO.   Who the fuck has to spend half the class doing ridiculous Yoga stretches?   I DO.   Who paid $70 five times for my own master to evaluate me to go up a belt that means fucking nothing since I've had to go easier on Brown Belts when I was an Orange Belt?   MY FATHER DID.   AND WHO HAS BEEN PRACTICING "Self-Defense" TECHNIQUES AS IF THE PERSON I'M USING ON WON'T REACT TO IT AT ALL AND ALLOW ME TO PERFORM 5 CONSECUTIVE STRIKES WHILE THEY STAND COMPLETELY STILL!?   -I FUCKING DO.   Who the fuck spars with little boys and young girls and expects to improve?   I fucking do   Who the fuck has been practicing a style that involves no face punches?   I do.   Disclaimer: Granted all the things above, I was forced to do by my Master since he was teaching the goddamn class. I used to look up to him like a fucking God. Now I realize what a joke everything is.    WTF Taekwondo is a bunch of bullshit and if I hadn't been practicing on my own, I would've had absolutely nothing to carry over to Muay Thai. At least I've gotten good at the Spinning Back Kick and the Spinning Heel Kick (which seem to have made it's way over to MMA very well) and obtained a good level of flexibility.   **tl;dr: I've realized I've gotten really good at something that's dumb.**    EDIT#3: Public Service Anouncement - If you do Taekwondo, realize that you're doing it for sport and that it is NO WAY analogous or similar to Real Fighting at all. You can and likely will get knocked out irl if you try to fight with your hands down and do tippy tap snappy kicks that have no power behind them.  Trust me, I've been training pretty hard at this. And it fucking sucks.   EDIT#4: Too many fucking edits. This post turned out to be way longer than I intended it to be. Sorry.    EDIT#5:   Who the fuck spends time breaking wooden boards to "showcase their power?"   I do..   I've been doing Olympic-Style WTF Taekwondo for a year now.

Disclaimer: NO disrespect to my Master or the Art of Taekwondo, itself. This is just my own opinion with my particular school and experience.      On YouTube, I see a lot Olympic Taekwondo Knockouts resulting from Spinning Hook Kicks to the Face or the Chin. I've seen videos where people get knocked out from getting straight kicked to the face with a jumping back kick as well. I was told in my Dojang that you are only allowed to do Head Kicks to the Helmet. Would such a Knockout lead to disqualification in a Tournament?      It seems silly that punches to the head are forbidden yet kicks to the head are allowed, yet kicks to the head can be much more devastating than a punch to the head.  I asked an ex-Karateka this question and he gave me quite a silly answer as to why his dojo enforced this rule, "Because head punches kill." He was totally serious, btw.   First of all, I should mention that I'm not a mixed martial artist.   Watching UFC, I noticed a lot of fighters throwing leg kicks at each other in a fight, but I never notice the effect/impact that it has on the person taking the hit. I believe the purpose of the leg kick is to, obviously, injure the other person's base and slow them down but most fighters seem to be able to tank the hits just fine.    It seems to me like leg kicks are usually just checks. Is that true? Can someone explain this to me? I'd really like to know.   They always release an update and it gets bombarded with complaints about glitches and crap.    I started taking Taekwondo in October of last year. I thought I would be learning an intense martial art and get a great workout out of it. I want to get into MMA, eventually because I really like the versatility of it. I thought Taekwondo would give me a great striking base and an advantage over other striking styles because of the unorthodox kicks like the Wheel Kick/Spinning Hook Kick and the Back Kick. Anthony Pettis, Anderson Silva, Cung Le, Edson Barboza, and various other MMA fighters with TKD backgrounds have inspired me to take up this great kicking art.   I was fucking wrong.   90% of the people in my class are either teenage girls or moms. The other 9% are young boys who somehow made the adult class and out of shape middle-aged men. I'm 17.   I find myself having to go easy on everyone. Even though I'm only a Purple-Stripe belt (6 belts from White Belt), I spar better than everyone in my class including the Black Belts, which are all teenage girls btw, other than the Master and his son.   Apparently, no one in my class likes Sparring other than me. We used to spar twice a week, (Tuesdays and Fridays) but then it got cut down to one because no one showed up to Sparring on Fridays.   Tuesday Sparring is bullshit. We don't even spar the entire time, we practice on one-steps/basic kicking drills first and then, IF I'M LUCKY, we get to do free sparring for 10 minutes or so. Most of the time, there's more girls than guys in the class. When that happens, the Master sits all the guys down and has us watch the girls. So, basically, if there's not enough guys in the class, I don't get to spar.   I've always wanted to get a Black Belt in Martial Arts because I thought it showed commitment. But, belt testing is $69 per testing and I don't feel like I'm truly learning anything new each time I move up a belt. Pretty much, the only reason why I'm at the level I'm at is because I watch a lot of tutorials by Kwonkicker   GingerNinjaTrickster on YouTube along with TKD Competition videos which teaches me techniques I haven't learned in class and good combos to go along with them.   Most of the time, in sparring, the other people in my class just stick with basic roundhouse kicks and predictable/ill-timed back kicks. On the other hand, I use my entire arsenal. Roundhouse Kick feint into Spinning Hook Kick, Side Kick transition to jump Back Kick, etc. etc.   I wish there were more people around my age that could spar with me. My Master's son is a very good fighter and has proven it time and time again in National competitions. His footwork, timing, speed, feints, and dexterity with his kicks is insane. I want to get that good, but I know I'll never get that good with the kind of competition I'm sparring with, when I get to spar that is   I feel like I've been wasting my time and money here. Though, I really want to just detach myself from this dojang and go learn some real fighting, I'd feel like it'd be a waste for me to drop my training when I haven't even gotten my First Degree Black Belt. On the flipside, I feel it's a meaningless title if I keep training with the people here.   tl;dr: Competition at this school is stale. Is it worth to keep going to get my Black Belt before training in Muay Thai, or should I just drop now?   I started taking Taekwondo in October of last year.

Is it worth to keep going to get my Black Belt before training in Muay Thai, or should I just drop now?   What sets it apart from Karate, Taekwondo, Sanshou, Kickboxing, etc. etc.   Is it just more well-balanced and better suited for the MMA ruleset than the other striking styles?  Karate, Kickboxing, TKD, etc. etc. have limitations in their sparring rules. But, Muay Thai sparring seems to be the most "free" of all of them which is good for transitioning into MMA. Is that what it is?  Oh, and is it possible to be a good Striker without adding Muay Thai to your skillset? Having come from doing a lot of traditional Martial Arts as a child, it seems to me that all the striking arts have the same basics. When you get into the more advance techniques, what works and doesn't work for MMA should depend on what you believe is right for the current situation. For EX, Spinning Hook Kicks are encouraged in TKD sparring as it yields the most points. (Also, it's done very often because there's no punches to the head allowed) However, in MMA or Muay Thai, wheel kicks can also be dangerous because you're turning your back. So basically, what's encouraged and good for certain TMAs sparring rules, can be risky for MMA.   For MMA, you need to be able to adapt to the Striking rules there. There's no "no head punches" rule, no points, or etc. etc. so you gotta be able to adapt. It's more of a mindset than anything and Muay Thai seems to be better suited for that from the get-go. Is that right?   EDIT: Great answers everyone!!! Thanks a lot.   Did Peter Parker continue to wear contact lenses? Or did the Spider bite correct his vision? It was never clear. He still wears glasses after getting bit in the first movie but he wears no glasses in this movie.   EDIT: Why so many downvotes :(   There's only one Judo school where I live, the rest are BJJ. I would love to learn the art after seeing how effective it is in MMA with Ronda Rousey. However, this Judo School only focuses on Sport Judo with Gi, but I'm only interested in learning how the Judo Throws without Gi.   Is it easy to transition from Gi to No Gi on your own?   Also, why is there no button on the top banner that redirects you to the main page of the South Park reddit like most subreddits have?               Lee-Daiga, Lee Daga, Lee Daigo, Lee Dega. Wtf did he call him and what's the significance of the name? Does it mean teacher in some type of Asian language or something? The Ghost shows up to Jason and tells him to refer to him as "Lee ____"   Edit: I've looked all over the Internet and I can't find a credible answer.   EDIT2: Here's the movie. Skip to 47:44 for the scene I'm referring to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1FpHWAMFks   Started my freshman year of college last month. Never had a girlfriend throughout High School. Got rejected three times in a row with three different girls and that just hurt my confidence and self-esteem for awhile. But that's in the past.   Cute girl in my English class. Been wanting to talk to her for awhile just too shy to. She walks my direction on Monday after I'm walking to the parking lot because class was cancelled, I let her know and she thanked me.   Today, I was waiting in my car for class to start and she happened to park right next to me. Tried to say Hi but she didn't notice. Left my car and went to class about 3 minutes before she left her car.   Both of us were waiting infront of class for the teacher to come. I start talking to her. I make up jokes about how I hope class'll be cancelled again. Also, jokingly tells her I noticed she parked right next to me and I tried to say Hi but she totally ignored me. She laughs and such. Asked her about her Major, what she wants to do etc. etc. In class, sits next to her, introduces myself and she introduces herself. Goes in for a handshake in which she jokingly replies that I should have a firmer handshake.   Jokingly asks her if I could copy off her for the quiz with a wink. She says yes and laughs. Some basic flirting here and there etc. etc. etc.   Turns out with both have the same major but she switched to Poli-Sci and we have the same classes with the same teachers (just at different times besides this English Class) If anything, that's at least one thing that we both have in common that I can talk about :)  Was planning on getting her number at the end of class but totally chickened out. (I had my phone stolen yesterday but just got a spare phone from a friend) Instead I told her I'd see her next week while walking out of class and she just smiled and waved at me.   Next class is on Monday :/ Really wanted to keep talking to her. She's outrageously pretty, smart, and funny :)   I think I made a pretty good first impression, she was pretty engaged when I was talking and making jokes. :) I was trying to be myself and was acting confident doing so.   Anyways, advice on getting her number on Monday and maybe getting closer with her? I have terrible experiences with girls and I'm determined to change it my luck this time around :D   Thank you, Reddit. First time on this sub.   P.S. Sorry for grammar.   Edit: Also she looks extremely out of my league.            In my Taekwondo Dojang, we learn applications of self-defense from Hapkido as well as part of our standard Taekwondo curriculum. Most of our self-defense techniques involve learning how to release yourself from a wrist-grab and following up with a joint lock whether it be an armbar or a wristlock.  So far, I have learned 10 different ways (2 techniques learned per belt) of releasing yourself from a wrist-grab and I've found it unnecessarily excessive that we have to practice so many different techniques to release ourselves from a wrist-grab. In most hostile situations, I doubt knowing how to release yourself from a wrist-grab would come in handy. I wish we would learn more practical self-defense like how to block punches or something instead of learning a million ways of defending yourself from a wrist-grab.  Can someone explain to me why wrist-grab self-defense is so emphasized? I'm pretty sure there's a good reason, I just can't come up with one on my own and, to be frank, I doubt I will ever need to apply this technique in a real life scenario.     The problem when learning these "One-Step" Self-Defense techniques is we practice doing them as if the opponent wouldn't react. I doubt in a real life situation if someone ever grabbed your wrist, they wouldn't just stand their and allow you to release yourself. The moment you'd try to react to the wrist-grab, they'd probably punch you in the face.

I've seen so many ridiculous explanations to why Taekwondo practitioners keep their hands down to the side and do not punch. Some even argue that Taekwondo practitioners do not punch because "punches do not score as much as a kick" which is ridiculous because anyone who does WTF Taekwondo Sparring knows that a Punch or Kick to the body is worth one point.   I've watched several videos of big WTF Taekwondo competitions ranging from World Tournaments to the Olympics and the style of fighting is very much the same. Many practitioners keep their hands to the side and do not throw punches even when in punching-distance (they go in for the clinch).  While there's probably a valid strategical reason for this, it just doesn't make sense to me why 99% of people do not throw punches in this sport even though it is perfectly legal and, according to the rules, scores a point. People will argue that kicking is the shortest distance between you and your opponent, but isn't the shortest distance really a straight punch from the leading hand? Punching is quicker than Kicking if you are in proper range.  Because of the way I've seen other practitioners spar, it has affected the way I spar. I feel extremely awkward whenever I am in punching-range with someone and try to exchange punches with them because we never practice throwing punches, at all. (Except maybe for Counter Punches here and there where you block with one hand and go in for a punch with the other hand) I'd get into range with someone, exchange some punches then taking some punches (because I was never taught how to Block Punches) then slide back to kicking distance. I feel almost like punching is discouraged.  A friend once asked me if you could win a Taekwondo fight with purely punches and I did not know how to answer his question. Theoretically, according to the rules, you should be able to. But, that fact of the matter is, I have never seen someone throw a punch (if they even throw a punch) in WTF Sparring and scored a point from it. I believe that since the the rules make it so difficult to score a point with punches, it is actually discouraging punching in a way.  tl;dr: Why do WTF Taekwondo Practitioners spar with their hands by their sides (Guard Down) and do not throw Punches? This seems like a very impractical way to fight and, in my own personal opinion, creates bad habits for when a Taekwondo practitioner fights under a different rule set or in a hostile street fight situation.            IGN: Kevin  Details: Light Skin,Black Fedora, Black Sunglasses, Brown Hair, Blue Eyes, Red Shirt.  -Thank you very much.            I consider myself a huge follower of Bruce Lee's philosophy.  (The Following is a sample of Bruce's Philosophy in my own words and interpretation) Bruce believed that a martial artist shouldn't be limited to any one style of fighting. According to him, a martial artist should be able to adapt to any situations. To him, "styles" are attempts to "arrest the flow of conflict" and in actual combat, the opponent doesn't wait for formalities. The opponent isn't a robot, but a human being-fluid and alive. To him, "traditional arts were a blind devotion to the systematic uselessness of routines that lead nowhere." That's why he went against tradition and created his own martial art/philosophy of "Jeet Kune Do" a style without styles so that it may assume every style. (Sorry if that's a bit confusing). My father is a traditional man and is against my intentions of studying other martial arts outside of Taekwondo. In my opinion, a good martial artist should be proficient in multiple fields rather than just one. For example, Taekwondo is a good striking art that uses kicks as the weapon of choice and is well known for their variety of deadly kicks. However, everything has their strengths and weaknesses. Taekwondo fighters are generally not very good at using their hands offensively and since kicks can only be thrown at a long distance, they would be at a huge disadvantage at close-range fighting against a trained Boxer. Also, when it comes to ground fighting and grappling, Taekwondo fighters aren't usually taught how to handle those types of situations. So, if I were ever taken to the ground by a Jujitsu practitioner, I would have no idea how to handle myself properly in that situation. With all that said, my point is that every martial art has their strengths and weaknesses. If you only know one martial art, you're stuck with that one style's weakness. However, mastering other arts may compensate for each others' weaknesses. This is what I believe and what I find logical. However, my father believes that mastering one art is enough to handle any kind of situation. I strongly disagree. I just came here today to ask for everyone's opinions on me   my father's beliefs. I want to hear the Pros and Cons of Cross-Training in Martial Arts.  Thank you for your time.  	132
 The Hobbit. Every one of my friends loved it growing up. Insisted I should read it before diving into the LOTR trilogy. I couldn't stand all of the singing dwarves and poems and nonsense of the like.   Suffice it to say I've never read any of the LOTR books despite being a fantasy/sci-fi fan. I can appreciate them for what they've done for the genre as a whole, but I cannot stand them on a personal level.    I'm with you on this one. Dare I say I liked the movie more?   Nailed it.    I regrettably started this, put it down about 100 pages in, and never picked it up again. Me thinks I have to start fresh again.    I feel like this may be a Stephen King novel, if only because he uses that "dear reader" phrase from time to time. Maybe even a piece of the Dark Tower series?   The Hegemony Consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and played Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient but well-maintained Steinway while great, green, saurian things surged and bellowed in the swamps below.    And yes, that field goal was with only two seconds remaining.      First off, I won't even pretend I know what it's like to be deployed or serve in combat, so I'm sure this book hit you differently than it did me. But here's my story:  A company I used to work for had a book drive two days before I left for a business trip, a 14-dayer in the middle of Mexico. Minutes before a company bus was prepared to take us to the airport I noticed my kindle was dead AND I didn't bring the charger. I rushed to the boxes of books we had a drive for, promising to return them when I came back. One of those books I snagged was "A Farewell to Arms."  Now, again, I was never deployed overseas, but this was the longest amount of time I was spending away from my family and friends. The way he describes all of those points you mention - attitude, demeanor, love - hit me in a way that left me thinking about home more than I would have liked. At the same time, a week or so into my trip, I found out a good friend of mine with a one-year-old boy had just learned that he had leukemia. Had I been stateside I would've been in the hospital room that day. But unfortunately the best I could do was get a calling card and call home to chat with her. There was something about the book that related to my reality, even if it wasn't a direct correlation. I too found myself thinking, "Man, life is short - sometimes too short, and we have to really appreciate the time we have with each other." The average person doesn't need a book to find that out, but it was a stark reminder no less.  Also, and I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone, but I really thought this would be an exception to the Hemingway format. Which is to say, I didn't think anyone would die at the end. But then bam, with three pages left he drops a bomb on the reader. Not cool Ernie. Not. Cool.   Still, what a fantastic read that sent me through an array of emotions at the time.   (And for those wondering, my friend's son has since been in remission for three years and seems to be on the up and up for good.)   Can't say I've ever had much interest in anything he's written. The only book of his I remember reading is "Velocity," which I purchased in a bookstore during a significant layover in North Carolina. Read it in one sitting on the plane, and felt like the story was all over the place and didn't have all that great an ending.   And on a side note, I'm happy you still have 40% of your intelligence left. I wish I could say the same - for a myriad of reasons. :-)   Yeah, it's been a while. Probably about 15 years since I've read it, so my memory is a bit shot. Doesn't change my stance of it being one of my favorites, but I just remember talking to a friend of mine about that scene and saying, "Do you think King channeled his younger self for that role?"    There may have even had something to do with his window. Maybe one of the vamps was outside of it? Argh.    Hard to remember exactly, but I remember it was later in the book. There was something to do with a kid who wore really thick glasses, played with models and model figurines, and maybe even liked horror movies and comic books. Man, I'm going to have to take a look again later tonight.    To be honest, my last few visits to the library have been for book sales. I think it's a win-win though: I get a bunch of books for less than $10, and the library benefits from a few extra bucks. I don't think I've taken a book out from a library in almost a year, although I do tend to visit them from time to time for a little solitude and peace of mind.    Yeah, I suppose I could've gone with one of the more modern "threats." I think Castro was in my head after having just read a story about his brother requesting a return of Gitmo and all those trade embargo talks. But thanks, glad you liked!   Try and work Salem's Lot into your to-read list. One of my favorites.    Wow, you managed to read more books by him in one year than I've managed to read in my lifetime. Kudos to you.   11/22/63 has been sitting on my shelf for a while. I'm sure I'll attack it one day.    Man, tough question. I'll go with my Top 3, although I still haven't read everything he has to offer.  1. Salem's Lot - My all-time favorite, without a doubt. I enjoyed every bit of the characters, including the younger, nerdy kid later in the book who made only a small cameo but somehow struck me as King writing about his former, childhood self. Maybe it helped that I read it before all of the vampire craze from about five years ago. Then again, it's so much better than anything in the past decade or so that's been centered on vampires, so it will be hard for anything in that realm, or anything else by King, to dethrone this as my #1.  2. The Stand - I read the unedited, unabridged version, if only because King prefaced it by saying, "This is the way I meant it to be before editors hacked it up" (I'm paraphrasing, of course). At nearly 1200 pages, you can really get a feel for the parts that editors cut out, because they just stand (no pun intended) alone as this one-off bits. That said, still one of my favorite books by him, and I'm fairly certain I will one day read it again.   3. Misery - I agree with one of the earlier comments about the imagery. King also did a great job of capturing the insanity of Annie Wilkes, famously played by Kathy Bates in the film rendition (which I also enjoyed), and the desperation of his protagonist whose name escapes me at the moment.   All in all, I've read about a dozen of his books, which is to say only 1/3 of his collection. So take my recommendations with a grain of salt.    Fidel Castro's hand hovered over the red button, once encased inside a plastic cover to prevent any "accidental" attacks but now wide open to all deadly possibilities at the hands of Cuba's dictator. At this rate an attack was imminent, as one lone Cuban Missle Intern searched desperately for the one thing that could alter the tides of humanity.  "I swear to fucking God, if I don't get a bag of potato chips I'm going to blow something up."   His staff of able-bodied assistants stood idly by, beads of sweat dripping from just below the rim of their green military caps.   "Senor," said one of the assistants, "We have sent an intern out to find you potato chips. I assure you there is no need for this."  Castro eyed up his assistant, not recalling a single name as he scanned the young man facial features.  "I'm the one in charge, I say what is needed and what is not."  The assistant took a step back to realign himself with his cohorts, lucky to be alive for even making a mere suggestion. If anything the sheer fact that Castro's trigger hand hovered over the nuclear launch button may have been the only thing that saved him from immediate death. Not that he couldn't have the same result in a few minutes if that dumb shit Pedro failed to find potato chips.  An eerie silence hung over the room, broken only by the heavy breathing of Castro as he tried with no avail to unfuck his Chi.   "You know, I do nice things, do I not?" he asked no one in particular. "I host fiestas, I partake in breakdancing competitions, I even clothe the homeless seconds after I take everything they have. Why must I look like the bad guy?"  With each man in attendance afraid to answer, the room remained silent.  "And now, here I am, hovering my hand over a big red button that could wipe out countless villages in Russia. Or South America. Or America. I haven't even decided on a target yet."  "Sir," one man spoke up. "No one has done anything to deserve. None of those countries has done a thing to us, or you for that matter. Think of the lives lost. Think of the children."  "Children? CHILDREN?"  "Oh shit," whispered one of the assistants.  "Children are the sole reason for my being here, right now, at this given time. Have you ever tried to get a minute of sleep in a house filled to the brim with screaming children? And then, when you can't sleep, find solace in something as simple as a bag of potato chips, only to find the diablos have eaten the entire lot, down to the very last one? HAVE YOU?!"  "No senor, I have not."  Castro took a deep breath. "It's very simple," he sighed. "Potato chips for me, no bomb is dropped. Muy simple."  Off in the distance the sound of slapping feet pounding the pavement drew closer.   "It's Pedro!" screamed one of the assistants, equal part relieved and surprised that the dumbest of the crew managed to find a bag of potato chips in the middle of Guantanamo Bay.  Castro breathed a noticeable sigh of relief and began to slide his hand away from the red nuclear button.  "Pedro is here," panted Pedro. At that moment it was obvious to all in the room that he had once again dressed himself that morning, evident by the pants on his head, shirt around his waist, socks on his hands and scuba diving flippers on his feet.   "Give them here!" screamed Castro, as he snatched the bag out of Pedro's hands and returned to his hovering stance over the nuclear button.  "See?" he said, breaking the tension with a small laugh. "Is OK now. Huh?"  The bag of chips crinkled under his grip as he tore open the top.   "There is nothing to be worried about. Is OK. IS OK MY FRIENDS!"  He casually reached into the bag for his first chip. Instantly the look of anger returned to his face, the redness in his cheeks matched only by the red button. Before anyone in the room could notice the error of Pedro's ways, it was already too late.  "FUCKING RUFFLES!" he screamed, tossing the bag aside and slamming both hands down on the button.   Could it be that I'm strange?  Sitting here alone on a couch with delusions of grandeur dancing in my head?  Wondering if, when and how my dreams can become a reality,  Desperate to know if all is futile, whilst debating the every-day struggle of mixing passion with profession.  They say when you're strange, faces come out of the rain,  But in this cloud it would appear I'm the one begging to surface from the torrential downpour.  Am I to think a civilized sense of normalcy is the be all and end all to our lives?  To pursue the discomfort of the so-called comfort seized from waking up, working eight hours, commuting home and watching primetime television?  Why must the mold be built for us?  I aim to construct my own.    "...through the gate!"   That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet. Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place.   Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time.   "All is lost!" he screamed. "The enemy is through the gate!"   Perhaps the enemy forces marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, not many people possess the ability to sleep through an attack. But they're not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels.    All around me enemy forces were charging forth to the soundtrack of clanking armors, barreling hooves and cheers of valor. I prayed they didn't see me peeping through the smallest of gaps in the bunker, had they even noticed it in the first place.    What was I to do? Fighting was futile. Running just the same. Even the choice to rejoin my comrades would require a  sprint to and through the gate, which at this point was entirely populated by the enemy.    Still hazy from my unprovoked nap, I rested my back against the bunker wall. There wasn't much I could do. As one of the guards had confirmed already, all was lost. Nothing more to do but wait until the cover of darkness in an effort to make my mistake.    Until then I'll just sit here, rest my head against the bunker and sl...   "OK, let's head up to the counter then."  "One second," he said. "I want to ask it a question."   "OK kiddo. Go for it."  "Will Mommy buy this for me?" He shook the eight ball, flashing a huge grin across his face.  "You don't need a Magic 8 Ball to answer that one, Andy. Come on, let's pay for that and head home."  Unable to contain his excitement, Andy asked if I could take the toy out of the box for him so he could play with it on the way home. Sure, I thought. Why not? We could have a little fun with it.   "Will I win a hundred dollars?" he asked.  "Maybe" replied the 8 Ball.  "Will Mommy win a hundred dollars?"  "Very doubtful," the 8 Ball said. We both got a good laugh at that one, after I read the word out to him, of course.  "Here, you try," Andy said, handing over the toy.  "OK. What to ask, what to ask. Will I get a new job?"   "He never loved you."  I nearly choked on a lump in my throat.   "What does it say Mommy?" Andy asked.  "Nothing. It says...nothing."  "You're lying!" he laughed. "Tell me!"  I couldnt believe what Id read. I even blinked a few extra times to make sure Id seen what was sitting right there in my own two hands.  "It says yes," I lied.   "Ask another!" Andy insisted.  Suffice it to say, I didn't believe what I had just seen. "Impossible," I thought. "No way." Clearly even my mind was functioning with Magic 8 Ball-like responses to what I had just read from the toy.  "No, it's your turn," I said, offering to hand it back. But Andy insisted that since it said yes, I had to ask another question.  I stared blankly at the toy, almost afraid to ask again.   "Come on Mom!" Andy said. "Ask it."  "OK!" I yelled, a bit harsher than I had planned. The fun of our banter had suddenly slipped away.  "Will...I...get a new car?"  "He's still with her" it replied.  By now tears had swelled in my eyes. The temptation to throw the toy was greater than ever, but my maternal instincts knew I couldn't show that side in front of my son. Especially since I couldn't even fathom the trauma he would have if I broke the first toy he'd ever purchased with his allowance money. I could see it now - on dates in high school or college, telling his girlfriend about the time his mom smashed his first toy. The therapy. The psychological trauma. The scars that wouldn't heal.  OK, I was getting a little carried away. I took a deep breath, slowed my breathing, and handed the toy back over to Andy.  "Why don't we put it away for a little while?" I suggested. "We can play more when we get home."  Slightly dejected, if not even a bit scared since I raised my voice, Andy was quick to do just that.   "OK, Mom," he said. He looked like he was on the brink of tears.  How could a toy know? How could anyone even know? I hadn't seen him in years, ever since he stormed out the front door and left me seven months pregnant. "It's better this way," he yelled. "I won't hurt you any more."  Later that night I put Andy to bed and sat on the couch, racking my brain for answers and obsessing over a little eight dollar piece of plastic. Consider it a face off, if you will: me, sitting on the couch, picking at my cuticles (a nervous habit I cant kick), staring across at the Magic 8 Ball resting on my coffee table. Cue the cheesy spaghetti Western music.   I wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.   But, what if I asked it a question about...him? What if I faced the question head on? Clearly there was something wrong with this toy. All night long I'd looked over Andy's shoulder as he played with it, and through it all not a single answer came up that you wouldn't expect from the toy. "Ask Again Later," it would say. "Signs Point to Yes."  What if?  I drained the last sip of wine from my glass and reached for the toy, making sure to keep it in hand with the answer facing down.   "OK," I said, taking a deep breathe. "Here we go."  "Will I ever fall in love again?" I asked, shaking the toy. I held my breath and flipped it over.  "Yes," it replied.  Wonderful, I thought. A standard response.  Again.  "Will I ever marry again?"  Outlook good."  Had I imagined those earlier responses? Was I suffering from heat stroke? Food poisoning? Anything?  "Will I win a hundred dollars?" What the heck, right?  "Reply Hazy, Try Again."  I tossed the toy back onto the table, equal parts disappointed and relieved. Maybe it was in my head. Maybe it was all just my imagination playing tricks on me. Whatever the case, it didn't change one thing: He was still out there, perhaps still in love with her, and I was on my couch with Andy sound asleep in the other room, knowing without a doubt that I was loved by a seven-year-old just as much as I loved him.  Some fortunes are hard to predict.   I've always made it a point to not spoil my kid. I never wanted to be the parent standing over my bratty child in the toy aisle seconds after he fell to the ground in a fit of hysteria begging for a toy. I operated under the simple assumption that if he sees a toy he'll want it, and if he wants it I'm not going to get it for him. It's not that I'm a jerk about it, but my parents instilled responsibility in me at an early age. I'm going to do the same with Andy, even if I have to operate under the tough love umbrella.  Truthfully, there's nothing worse than an entire room full of sad, past-their-prime toys. Maybe it doesn't resonate with a child, as they just as easily toss aside an "old" toy for a "new" one (loose terms, of course, considering "old" can be measured in sheer minutes). From where I come from, it's almost like I can see him growing too old right before my own eyes. Suddenly that monster truck he was so excited to open on Christmas morning two years ago is pushed to the corner under a pile of former, short-term toy affairs. The slinky, for example, that entertained him for about 20 seconds before he realized it didn't power up, turn on or propel itself across the room. Or the Furby, who so boldly stated that he loved him, seconds before his bulbous, glazed-over eyes closed for good behind the powerless batteries that were never replaced. A merciful death for something that irritated me beyond comprehension.  Andy's only seven year old, but that's just about the right time for him to start taking on some small chores around the house. Just last month I sat him down and told him what I had in mind. He didnt contest it, much to my surprise. His only response was, So if I clean things, youll pay me? Chalk it up as disbelief.  I started small at first. Clean up your room, make your bed, put the toys away after you're done playing with them - all small tasks that really begin to build a foundation for a work ethic that will ultimately carry him from one job to the next. Last night I asked Andy to take out the trash which, I must admit, was just about as comical as I thought it would be. For his sake, the walk down the driveway isn't a long one. And one day, if he inherits his father's genes, he'll be well over six feet. But as of right now, his small body can barely muster up the strength and dexterity needed to wheel the trash down to the curb. He tried and tried and likely wouldve kept trying had I not taken pity on him after witnessing his struggles through the front window, looking out over the driveway. Perhaps I was a bit overzealous. I may have to wait another few months after all. There's still plenty of time for him to grow up, and I'm in no rush to see it.   Nevertheless, he showed a real interest in helping out, even if it does mean I peel off a few - very few - shekels in exchange for his services.   When Andy asked if he could go to the toy store, I thought nothing of it. Of course, I thought. Let him reap the rewards of his efforts.   So, down to the toy store we went, hand in hand, as I started to prepare myself for the possibility of Andy picking out a toy that was not in his ten dollar budget (eight dollars from chores, two dollars from the tooth fairy). How would he react? Could I resist the temptation of covering the difference if he chose an item out of his price range?  Rocky's Toys is a little shop in the center town, your typical "shop local" joint with its slightly higher prices and collection of toys that haven't moved off the shelves in decades. The novelty items are cute and all, but when was the last time you've seen a kid playing with a ball on a string? Or a yo-yo, for that matter? It's one of those stores that leaves you wondering how the owner barely covers rent, let alone earns a living.  Still, it's the closest toy store to home and the idea of taking Andy for a little walk narrowed down the options quickly.  "So, what are you going to get with your allowance money?" I asked.  "I don't know," Andy replied, a quizzical glance coming over his face. "I guess I'll just have to see."  "The weather's been nice lately. Maybe you can get a frisbee or a football or something that you can use outside."  "Maybe," he said. "Maybe I'll get LEGOs."  Red flag. For those who don't know, and by that I mean for those who don't have to do holiday shopping for kids, LEGOs may be quite possibly the single most expensive collection of plastic pieces I've ever come across in my life. I applaud the building and creative elements behind it, but the marketing ploy is simply demonic. Where else can a company recycle a bunch of old plastic bottles, mold them into shapes, slap a Batman logo on it and top it off with a sticker reading "$50" before they fly off the shelf? Maybe some kids' parents have that kind of money to spend, but as a single  mother on a limited budget, I certainly do not.   "Let's just take a look around," I said, hopefully steering him away from his idea. "You may find something you never thought you'd want."  We stepped in through the front door of Rocky's Toys, complete with the small-store jingling bell to signal our entrance. We were greeted shortly after by the owner himself, a small, aging old man who was hunched so far over his hands practically dangled at his shins. For some reason he'd always reminded me of Geppetto from Pinocchio, and even that stemmed from the days when I was a kid shopping in his store. Even then he was no worse for wear.  "Good morning, good morning," he said. It was common place for Gep...I mean, Rocky, to repeat himself from time to time. It was as if one response was for the customer, and the other was for him.   Either that, or maybe his shop had an echo.  "Hello Rocky. Great to see you again."  "Great to see you too. Always good to see you. Always good." He barely looked up enough to make eye contact, but I took no offense to it. He hadn't been in tip-top shape for years. I didn't expect him to start doing backflips right then and there.  "What brings you in today? Birthday?"  Andy stepped right up to the plate, never too shy to talk to a friend. "No sir. I'm here to spend my allowance money." He proudly showed off his fist-full of singles, which he briskly withdrew from his pocket. In the fit of excitement he even dropped one, but was quick to snatch it up with his free hand.  "Ohhhh, I see," Rocky cried. "Well this is a big day for you. A very big day for you. Well, go ahead and look around. What's mine is yours.  Andy took off down the first aisle, past the dolls and dollhouses accessories, toward the back where Rocky kept his GI Joes and plastic soldiers.    Despite not knowing what he wanted, Andy seemed dead set on going to his favorite section right away. Yet nothing seemed to really pique his interest right off the bat, and he quickly shifted toward the aisle where Rocky kept his puzzles, rubiks cubes, and things of that nature.   Thankfully, all of those items would fall under Andy's budget. Unfortunately, I didn't expect him to come up with any of those in his hand.   Andy's eyes darted from left to right, hunting for the perfect toy. Much to my surprise I saw him grab the occasional toy, glance at the price tag, and then move on. He was learning quickly, even if he was still learning his basic math.  As many parents know, take your eyes off your child for one second and anything can happen. Sure enough, as I glanced around the ceiling at hanging planes and UFOs, I heard Andy make his decision.  "I want THIS," he said, holding up a Magic 8 Ball.   Truth be told, it's one of those toys you forget even exists. They're often times in large basins in the center of the big-box stores, collecting dust and waiting for that woman looking for a prank gift for her girlfriend, or the guy snatching up a last minute pick for his office Secret Santa. At no point does anyone ever say, "Gee, I'm struggling with this presentation right now. What would the Magic 8 Ball say?" Best case scenario it sits on a desk. Worst case scenario, and the most likely one, it winds up buried beneath other toys, going the way of the Furby, toy trucks and stuffed animals.  "Really?" I asked. "You want...that?"  "Yeah!" he said. "Bobby has one of these and we played with it during his birthday party. It's so funny!"  I wasn't about ready to shoot down his dreams, but I also failed to see the humor in messages that said "Maybe" or "Ask Again Later." Then again, the childhood joy in a toy like that wasn't necessarily in the answer, but in the question being asked. I could only begin to imagine what kind of questions two seven year old boys ask the 8 Ball universe.  "OK. Well, if that's what you want..."  Andy eyed up the price tag and smiled. "It's eight dollars and five," he said.  "Eight-fifty. Remember? The first number is the dollar amount, and the second number is the pennies. So, eight dollars, and then 50 pennies, or cents. Now, can you tell me how much money you'll have left after you buy it?"  "Ummmm...four?"  "Nope, you'll have one dollar and fifty cents."  "Awesome!" he exclaimed, clearly thrilled with the idea of earning and toy and keeping some money stashed away.  Rocky seemed enthused by the conversation between Andy and I. I couldnt help but wonder if he started remembering all of the previous kids who came into his store buying Magic 8 Balls. The questions they asked. The thrill in their eyes. The hard-earned allowance money poorly spent.   "Hey Mom? Yeah it's me. Yeah, I made it. OK. See you soon."  Fin  	24

I KNOW I'M FUCKING SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN IT!   I fucking love the atvs   Fuck that   WHAT THE FUCK IS A REDDIT         I have been doing WBTB and i would wake up and not be able to fall back asleep. Then I tried WILD I slept until 3 o'clock and woke up with my alarm, no matter how hard i tried i couldn't induce sleep paralysis so I tried to go back to bed it was about 3 hours until I finally fell asleep, And after I fell asleep, I had my first lucid dream. but it didn't feel real it felt like i was playing a video game. here is how it went down. I was walking through my house and my grand-mother came up to me and said "apple pie" I noticed that didn't make any sense and looked at my hands, I had 12 fingers, so i bit one and there was no pain just numbness. I jumped up and started to fly. I broke through a wall and into my back yard, I created a house to do "stuff" inside. (I will spare you the details.) but i lost the dream and kind of woke up but drifted back into the dream and tried to bring in a famous person (wink wink) but no luck I couldn't get any thing to join my dream world not cake, nor a gun, nor a skateboard. i started losing the dream again and decided to experience what it was like to wake up (the time before I didn't pay attention I was too focused on trying not to slip out of the dream) so every thing look like i slowly closed my eyes and i woke up and had some breakfast.  TL;DR- I need some other methods can i have a good description of one that preferably doesn't involve waking up at the middle of the night?                I like this method because it usually only takes a quick glance. Just when ever you do your reality checks look for the rim of your glasses. Due to the fact that you do not always wear your glasses if they are not there do a different reality check.                                                                 	121
       I have study hall and I have nothing to play.   How'd you, Rob, and Charlie meet? How close are you guys?   I mean I think they would play really similar. It's not like they would have to change the whole way he played. But after they sorted out all the copyright issues then I think it would work. I don't expect it to happen I just think it would be cool and really fun.   I think this would be so cool being a huge god of war fan. I think it wouldn't be too difficult since they both have the same kind of weapons, just change the look. I don't know what others would think.  Just an idea.    Alright man I'll take into consideration what you said and I'll definitely apply it next time I play. Thanks a lot dude   This is awesome. Thanks dude and what do you think is the better matchup for Marth and Squirtle? R.O.B. or Sonic?   I main R.O.B. and Sonic and I need to figure out how to beat my friends mains. (Squirtle/Marth)   Self confidence man, self confidence    Haha what was her reaction?   Just curious to hear these.   My parents are divorced and are still friends, my mom recently started dating a black man (my family is all whites), my dad was over looking for a key to a car. Keep in mind my dad has NEVER made a vulgar joke around me. While talking about the key to the car she says, "Yeah, it's big and black."  and so my dad says,  "Yeah, that's two things that are big and black." You can clearly see how butthurt my mom is.  Five minutes later he comes up to me and says "Daddy's clever, right?" and high fived me. I've never laughed so hard.    Dad: "Oh did you hear about that celebrity that stabbed her husband? It was Reese something..."  Me: "Witherspoon?"  Dad: "No, with her knife."     	15

 Heard it has a bit of a chlorine after taste.        Go to the post office to get money out, you can get absolutely any amount out and they don't charge you a withdrawal fee like the ATM's there if you're not with that bank.     The pizzas are pretty decent as well.    I highly recommend De Bortoli. They have a really good range and their staff is pretty awesome.    The Warner's Bay place is Hunter Valley Martial Arts. They do BJj I think 3ish classes a week but they get an instructor down from Sydney who is very good. Did that a little bit and it was really good.    You can always check out the brewery.  Plenty of stuff going on there.     As someone who works in charlestown square I'm Damn happy it was shut. But the 27th was nuts.   	8
 When I was a kid, My family (consisting of my mom, dad, twin sister and myself at the time) lived in the country and so we lived in a couple of old farm houses over the course of about 18 years.   The last house we lived in sticks with me though. Not only was there a ghost dog in it (you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor and the sound of a dogs tail hitting the corner of the doorways as it wagged it's tail) But there were lots of rumors floating around about the woods we lived around.   As you can imagine, being the only two kids, my twin sister and I were little Hellions.(the oldest of our two younger brothers wasn't born until we were 4.   Anyway, so because we lived in the country, we were pretty much allowed to do whatever we wanted, so long as we took our whistles (this was back before cellphones were a thing) and so long as we were back before dark.   Fast forward to being about 10 years old, My sister and I had some friends over for the weekend, my sisters friend Jade and her brother Andy and a girl called Silvette.  Being 10 (and it also being close to Halloween at the time) we all decided it would be a good idea to walk around the woods just as sunset was coming. Y'know, freak ourselves out every time we heard an owl or heard a fox bark. Silvette was a total city girl, so it was a lot of fun to freak her out (my dad and her dad worked together and her parents and my parents would get together to hang out)  Anyhoo, I remember us walking through the woods, we'd gone pretty far, when all of a sudden, Silvette says "Hey guys, let's go check out that spooky old house"   I think all of the rest of us said "What house?".   You see, we'd found ourselves on the treeline of this field that was behind our property. Silvette points ahead and goes, pretty persistantly "THAT house"  The rest of us look (I remember this beyond anything to this day) there was no house.   Silvette gets mad, thinking we're picking on the city girl again and storms back into the woods towards out house. So to keep her from getting lost, we follow her back.   Later on that week, my sister and I went back through the woods to the field we'd found, and there was indeed a house, but it had been burned to the ground at some point and was just a pile of ash and broken glass.    The old farmhouse I lived in as a child had a ghost dog in it, It was several years before we actually got a dog and occasionally, you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor in the hallway upstairs. Every once in a while, you could also hear a slight thumping sound (which as I found out after we had a living dog) sounded like a dogs tail thumping the corner of the doorway as it wags it's tail. I was pretty young, but I can still remember those moments.    They're just playing, that's how they learn, that's also why it's *never* a good idea to give kittens away at 5-6 weeks old. between the ages of 5-9 weeks, they learn bite inhibition, they learn how rough they can and can't be.  	3
    As a kid, did you ever used to close your hands over the end of a flashlight, and marvel at the way they glowed red in the dark? Maybe it was just me.  Yesterday at work, the power went out. We work in an older building, and it happens occasionally. For some reason, Gary, the guy who sits in the cubicle across the hall has two high-powered LED flashlights. I think they were the kind made for hunting. Anyway, the things are blinding.  Meanwhile, my computer is down, work has stopped, we're just waiting for them to find the fuse and reboot our tedious workday. I guess I got nostalgic, because after a while, I was putting my hands over the end of the flashlight like I did when I was a kid. Gary's flashlight was brighter than the ones I'd used before, and you could see the outlines of the bones.  There was something unusual about my left ring finger, though. The skin there glowed differently. Tiny lines stretched from my second knuckle to the third, nearest my palm. It looked like I had a tattoo.  A bar code.   The first creature that I saw in this place... I never saw at all. It was before I'd found a light. The only way that I knew that it was there was by the sound of its breathing, stirring the emptiness.  I was naive. Inexperience in this endless cavern told me that the rules still applied. That an empty room in the dark was still empty.  "Hello?" I called, and my voice echoed back. Still, there was something there. I could hear the faint ticking raspiness of air moving through its open mouth.  At this time, I was still standing. Foolishly, I stretched my hand toward where I'd heard the noise. My feet carried me half-heartedly. Left foot forward, then the right one coming up to join it.  It must have been close. I could hear its breath with perfect clarity now, deep and huge. I could feel the cool air against my sides, pulling me toward it; smell the scent of decay on its warm breath. Each time it inhaled, there was a whirring, ticking sound like tiny ratcheting gears being wound.  It was my nose that betrayed me. The dead-smelling exhaust tickled my nostrils and brought tears to my eyes. I sneezed, and loudly. Before the echo even made its way back to my ear, a huge metallic clang tore the silence from the air. It felt at the time as though my sneeze had broken the world.  Behemoth footballs, ringing one after the other, washed around the endless space. My ears split and popped from the noise. My hands, uncommanded, clawed into my ears, trying to pull the painful noise from them, but only managed to dull the edge a little.  Then it was gone. Wet drops poured from my ears as I lay in a pile on the smooth, cool stone.   My name is Jack Sweeney, and Im from the same place as you are. Set aside a few superficial differences, and I could have been you. This is important, because when I lived in your time, I did nothing to stop the events that are now happening in mine. Because I didn't know. No one did.  I could have been you, and if Id known the things that Im about to tell you, then I could have stopped it.  It started with LImBo in the U.S.; Land-based Impassable Borders. They finally had a low-cost, sustainable and highly efficient solution to controlling their border problem. With a few field emitters, the entire southern border was almost instantly walled off from Mexico and South America. A blue, impassable screen stretched two thousand feet above the surface, and as deep as they could drill below.  I've touched them. They feel cool and smooth like glass, and you can see distorted shapes of things from the other side inside it, swirling with the field.  The fields required no further energy beyond the simple setup. Three emitters to make a triangle of any size, four to make a square. Once theyd been set, it was supposed to take over a hundred years for the molecules to decay and turn back into air. This meant that the transmitters could be removed and reused infinitely.  It was the threat of war that persuaded the smaller European countries to put up their own walls. Skilled technicians were in high demand, erecting fences across the many borders. Borders were disputed, complex agreements were signed, but once the walls went up... there was nothing much more final than that. Pictures from the orbit at night showed Europe glowing blue.  A few of the smallest countries seemed to disappear completely. The only way in or out from these places was by air. The average person would never see the inside.   There was no war. Not in the sense that theyd been expecting, anyway. The first time a border fell was between the small town of Trevechia and its larger counterpart, Yuhgo. Trevechia held about 3,000 people. Its largest attraction was an ancient church that stood in the middle of town. The border changed from cool, dark blue to fiery red. From the people of Yuhgos perspective, the little town was burned away like some kind of deathly MRI scan. It plowed a smoking trough through the middle of the country, Gerzek, toward its capital city of the same name.  In a last-ditch effort to stop the wall, a set of field-emitters and a special team were flown into Gerzek. It was, perhaps, the best team anywhere in the world. My team. Wed been prepped to respond to the escalating tensions in the region, ready to stop anything that started. Even we werent sure that it would stop this, however, and we made sure that the helicopter pilots kept the rotors spinning in case things didnt work out.  At midnight, and not a minute too soon, we initiated the field. It was thick. The thickest any of us had ever seen.  You could feel the red wall vaporizing the ground as it pressed toward us. My team was hovering above the ground with as many passengers as we could take when it found our blue border. Like molten glass, it bent, curving to match the angle, but its momentum never slowed. At the moment when it could go no further, the air crackled like it was full of electricity. Our helicopter dropped. The only lights left were the moon and the stars. When I crawled clear of the wreckage, the walls were gone.  The secret to turning the borders into weapons of mass destruction was out in a matter of days. Teams like mine, composed of only a few people could systematically destroy entire countries. Europe and Asia bore many scars.  Ten times as many LImBos went up. They were the weapon, but also the defense. Threats were made, and bombs were dropped from the sky. AImBos were engineered, and aerial warfare and travel almost totally ceased. The first time an Aerial Impassable Border was turned into a weapon, it turned Hawaii into nothing but a cloud of steam.  Then, after enough walls went up, the world fell into an uneasy peace. People went about rebuilding their lives from inside their transparent cubes.  It wasnt the U.S. that broke the peace. Not that we werent trying to think of a way. Someone small, independent and well-connected enough to get inside, found it first. Huge triangle-shaped swaths of Earth simply sank into the ground in four different countries. The walls theyd built to protect them against the outside world sealed them in instead. They were slowly consumed by the red Hell beneath their feet.  Its going to be an awful way to die. As I write this, the East Coast of the United States is sinking. Its genius, really. In a few more minutes, the ocean will drain into the void that is left. Its too late for walls.  I have to believe that if wed known, we never would have built that first Border. *I* never would have built that first Border.  You know, now. Please, stop me.   Staff Sergeant Donovan Berr woke up, face down in the middle of the road. Sergeant Berr had seen better days. In the past week, he'd survived a plane crash, a chemical weapons attack, fended off a family of mutant boar, and had quite possibly survived to see the end of the world.  What a week.  As Donovan lifted his head, a mix of drool, blood and quite a bit of something else entirely stuck to the side in a thick string. Heat rose from the asphalt below him and beamed down from above. Everything hurt. Donny's neck gave up and laid his head back on the blacktop, and he pinched his one usable eye tight against the sun.  The last thing he'd remembered was the smiling faces of his three companions. Other survivors of the plane crash. There had been fire, and drinks. Man, had they been drunk. Must have been. "Open bar!" one of his friends had called out to them from the unpowered glass-doored beer cooler. And it had been.  Poor Donovan heaved up a wet, chunky mixture of last night's all-you-can-eat steak and pizza.  *Wait, fire? A fire inside?*  He tried to recall the image, but the lack of a clear airway brought his thoughts back to the present. With an awesome effort, Donny managed to turn his head and exhale enough bile through his nose and throat so that he could take another breath.  *Fire. Drinks. A party? A party for what?*  "A party for what?" he'd screamed into dead, senseless eyes. "Everyone everywhere is dead, we left those two back at the fucking hangar. They're going to die! We have to get help! Don't you understand that?"  He'd shaken the person wearing a camouflage uniform until his sizeable arms had gotten tired. He wanted to hit them, to scream louder, somehow from *inside* their lolling heads, so that they'd *have* to listen. They were gone, though. Lights on, nobody's home.  A person younger than him, maybe an Airman, started pouring lighter fluid onto a childrens' clothing display. Automatic rifle slung across his back like some kind of action movie hero, he flipped the bright orange stub of his lit cigar onto the soaked, folded shirts. Pity, he didn't stand back far enough, and the lighter fluid quickly found him.   Two of the three remaining in the dark, but not so dark anymore, Target superstore began laughing and pointing maniacally.  Donny watched in horror as the kid went up in flames.  Donny - the hot Donny, the one being fried like a griddlecake out on the street - well his stomach threatened to heave again. Since his head had turned, his non-sealed eye was in the shade of his broken nose, and he could get a little look around without bringing too much pain onto himself.  Palm trees and trimmed green grass. Hawaii. Probably fell out of the back of the truck somewhere near a golf course. God damn it, it was hot, though. Where was the fog they'd had when they'd landed? *Tried* to land, anyway.  The fog. That weird fog that hung over the whole island. Hadn't it been more than a little bit purple? Glowing, even? Not for the first time, Don wondered if maybe that had something to do with why everyone had disappeared. Not that there would be an explanation. Four guys (well, six if you counted the two they'd left at the hangar after the crash, though they might as well have been in the Alps from where poor Don was laying) weren't about to solve any kind of worldwide mystery on their own. Don couldn't even lift his own hand.  Maybe that fog could explain why the others had gone... *off* too.  Don heard a scuffle nearby, and felt a small breeze blow across his hot face.  A crazy thought occurred to him; maybe he should have gotten drunk with the guys last night. He couldn't have known that it was about to be his last day alive, but surely with everyone else gone, there was no future. Ol' Donny was just a little slower on the uptake than the others. Maybe they were the ones who'd had it right.   *That kid with the kerosene, yeah, he had the right idea. "Go out in flames" was the saying, after all.*  Something smacked the side of D's face, sending a few red droplets down into his narrow field of vision. It felt like a hand made out of fire that grabbed something underneath the layers of missing skin and rearranged bone, and then pulled. Some... *part*, something never intended to be on the outside, gave out with a pop, and his brain registered light from his eye on that side for a split second.  More scuffles, and a flutter of large black wings.  More and more, he regretted not taking that drink. Stealing some steak and pizza and huddling into a corner of a Target Superstore, listening to his crazed coworkers singing and screaming their own made up language was hardly the way that a man should have to spend his final night.  His eye closed, then saw just out in front of him was sitting an ice cold can of beer he hadn't noticed before. He reached a hand out and took it, feeling the coolness of it in his palm. Tasting the hoppy, foamy bitterness on his lips. Now that was a way that a man should die.   Constructive Criticism, Please!  ---  Staff Sergeant Donovan Berr woke up, face down in the middle of the road. Sergeant Berr had had better days.

Tasting the hoppy, foamy bitterness on his lips. Now that was a way that a man should die.         Let's talk about expectations for a minute. Stereotypes. Associations.  What comes to mind when you hear the word "teacher?" What do you picture? If that's too broad, think of a "high school English teacher, male, in his late 20's." What's he wearing? What did he drive to work? What expression is on his face?   Now, these exercises are, by nature, reductive - a person is not solely defined by his job title, age, appearance, gender, race. One man can can even have many sides, depending on who he knows is watching. They're reductive, but that doesn't mean that they don't serve a purpose. In college, there was an assignment to list 100 things about someone based on only a few details. This was so that when you wrote a character, called ["The Janitor,"](http://redd.it/2deuf4) without saying anything else about him, you would know how your audience was going to picture them.  Think back to that teacher that you pictured earlier. I'll feed you some details this time.   This is Charlie. He's wearing the same pale blue button-up for the third day in a row, hoping no one will notice. It's the same shirt he wore to his internships, only with one fewer button, allowing his newly filled out gut to push through. He came to work in the same Volkswagen P.O.S. that he drove away from this high school after he graduated. On his face as he grades an endless pile of shitty book reports isn't an expression. The particular fuse in his brain that controlled facial expression burnt out sometime around 2 am. Now there's just red, and clear beads of fever sweat from a month of living on fast food and the Smirnoff he kept hidden in his desk.  As he scribbles "F" on one more paper, the pen fails to stream any more ink. After what's felt like eons of tireless, thankless work, the pen has given up. As it's stabbed into the desk, it collapses under the force and shatters. Clear plastic splinters lodge themselves into the flesh of his hand, the teacher's own red fluid stains the desk like sponge paints, again and again.  The only thing that stops him from tearing apart the desk, the students desks, the windows, the cheesy posters and chalkboard on the the walls, and then going to work on himself is the feeling of eyes pressing on him from the rear of the lecture hall, just out of reach of his small desk lamp. Is it the feeling of eyes, or the barely audible sound of someone breathing heavily?  In the stillness, he can hear it more clearly. It's not a whisper as scratchy as sandpaper and a snake's hiss, it's laughter, coming from a dark shape in the darkness. Staring, straining to see in the dark, he hears the breath catch and go silent.  "Hey! Who's up there?"  *Pop!*  Charlie's alcohol-depressed nervous system reacts without him, flinching away from the tight, hollow sound.  "Come out of there. You're scaring me."  "Charles?"  Something about the word, fetched from the darkness isn't right. It's too dry-sounding, like the throat that produced it was full of dust-bunnies. It's too round, like the mouth that formed it was too lazy, or lethargic from years of misuse. It's too formal, like it forgot where, or when it was.  These details rattled through Charlie's brain for a moment before being swept away by the sight of something emerging from the darkness.  Two points of light, reflections of the lamp in each lens of a pair of over-sized glasses. A man, hunched and pitted, like he's been dried in the sun. His face is covered in wrinkles like cracks, little spidery voids that expose the black void within. A set of coveralls so ancient, it looks like they're made of purely dirt and dust, swept from some unknown basement.  The further the man comes into the light, the more corpse-like he appears. Eyes are gray and flat, like newspapers.  "Charles Grant?"  Charlie remembers himself and tries to run, but stumbles over his heels, and ends up sitting hard on the desk.  For some reason, despite the toll that years of death has taken, Charlie can just recognize the janitor from when he did his time as a student. After all, it had been the janitor who had cut the lock from the locker on Monday, when he'd been stuffed there on Friday. The janitor who had pulled him down from the flag pole, and cut the duct tape from around his mouth and wrists. It was the janitor who had found Charlie unconscious in the girl's bathroom, covered in blood where a group of kids had broken his jaw and left him.  It doesn't take long before the janitor has found his voice again, and begins telling the new teacher the things he's seen.   Terrible things. Horrible tales about the seemingly normal and happy families and people who passed through the halls of the school every day. Things that he couldn't have known - that no one could have known.  I am Charlie. Excuse me, "Mr. Grant."  This is how I met the janitor. How he came to me, in order that I might finish what he could only dream of starting.               [Custodial Engineer](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2cvf2w/im_a_janitor_excuse_me_a_custodial_engineer/)  [Janitor After All](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2cyxa6/im_a_custodial_engineer_pardon_me_a_janitor/)  ---   It took some time to build the contraption. It was time well-spent, however. It's important to always use the proper tool for the job.  Sure, there were a lot more efficient options for killing... but somehow this one seemed more fitting.  Cleaner.  The setup was simple. A small compressed gas chamber, put pressure on top of a two gallon reservoir of 10% bleach in water. The pressure pushes the solution through a hose to a trigger-operated shutoff valve. And the whole thing is tipped with a 6-inch-long, lethally sharp, quarter inch gauge stainless steel needle. In less than one second, the bleach solution could be blasted into the needle at pressures above two hundred pounds per square inch.  It took some planning to get Mary S. alone. It had to be predictable and I obviously couldn't allow myself to be observed or interrupted. I followed her for a day to feel out her routine and to find an appropriate location. While I was waiting, I found my next victim.  I was parked in front of Mary's workplace in a gravel lot. Having a police cruiser pull up behind my car gave me a scare, and I thought of the difficult- (but not impossible) to-explain bleach blaster in my trunk. When I caught a glimpse of the officer's face in the mirror, it was almost a relief.   Of course I know who he is. I know all about Officer Morgan. I know all about *everyone* here, now. It's almost encyclopedic. And the truth is, real monsters are all around us, hiding in plain sight. I could see his sins as plainly as the stains breakfast had left on his uniform.  * Accepts bribes in exchange for tips on places with low security or where the owners will be away. * Runs protection against the law for drug traffickers doing business in town. * Has been directly involved in the cover-up of five separate missing persons. * Responsible for the murder and disposal of a hooker.  No, excuse me. A "lady of the night."  I'd known McKenzie, since she'd been a student at the high school. She was a good kid, but she got dealt a bad hand at home. It was her dad who forced her into the game, and her mom and all her uncles took the money to get high. Sometimes, when a kid goes through that much slime, it doesn't wipe off. Especially when the people they crawl to for help throw them right back into the shit bucket with a little bit of cash.  He had it coming now.  I watched him as he walked up the side of my car, peered through his mirrored aviators at me, and without a word, wrote me a ticket for being illegally parked. I was outraged, and got out of the car to protest. The worm didn't even acknowledge my existence. He waddled over to a red-painted wooden beam that was intended to mark part of the fire lane, dragged it through the gravel into position behind my car, and dropped it there with a hollow "thunk." What a dick.  Excuse me, what a *fucking* dick.  Later, I followed Mary to the school, where she went to pick up Kayla. Pulling into the familiar parking lot, I noticed that the generator area where I'd found the door was roped off with yellow caution tape. Suddenly, I couldn't remember whether I'd locked the door that night; I couldn't remember anything except the rush of finding the truth. Since that moment, I'd been so caught up in this that I forgot all about work. I hadn't cleaned all weekend.   I found my reserved parking slot, but saw that there was a familiar, gray van parked there instead.  The Happy Janitor  I'd been replaced.  I guess it's official. I'm that kind of janitor anymore.  The next morning, I snuck into the back seat of her car before she left for work. Everything was in position and perfect - I practiced how I would strike, and the needle slid through the seatback like a hot knife through butter. I imagined what it would be like, her sitting down, oblivious in the pre-dawn haze of morning. She'd start up the car, back out of the driveway using only her mirrors, take a left at the end of the street, and then pull off onto the shoulder to light up a cigarette, a habit she kept from her husband and her kids.  It wasn't the only filthy thing she'd done since the sun had gone down.  Everything went perfectly. Right down to the way she'd retrieved her cigarettes and lighter before rolling down the window, so that her screams would be muffled inside the sealed car.  I pushed the needle up to the hilt and pulled the trigger, bracing myself for the kickback, the probable explosion of viscera and bodily fluids and bleach that would be forthcoming.  Instead, there was nothing.  Mary rolled down the window and lit her cigarette.  I frantically checked my rig. Everything was perfect. It wasn't possible that the needle hadn't pierced into her heart or lungs and powerfully disinfected her from the inside of her chest cavity out.  I stabbed again. Shot again. Nothing.  When that had failed, I tried to use the hose to strangle her... But she sat there, unaware and unaffected by my straining efforts to depart her from this world.  I couldn't kill her.  I can't kill *anyone.*  But I know just who deserves it.   I see the truth of the *uncleanness* of the world around me with perfect clarity... Yet I am totally unable to do anything about it.  Is this Hell?  ---  [Teacher.](http://redd.it/2ed3yb)   [Custodial Engineer](http://redd.it/2cvf2w)  ---  My first is Mary S.  Mary S. hurts her kids. She loves her son, Robbie, but she hates her daughter Kayla with some unimpeded passion. In fact, most people dislike Kayla.   Excuse me, "hate" Kayla.  They do it in varying degrees and show it with different types and elevations of violence against her. Each of which leave their own brand of scar.  And the honest truth is, even I didn't like her... Before. I mean, she is kind of... strange. She just doesn't fit in. She's not like the others, and the differences aren't borne gracefully.  Now, there isn't anyone who doesn't have at least a few flaws. No one is qualified to *cast the first stone*, so to say. But that isn't the system that I operate by. The way I like to work is by tackling the big messes first, and wiping them away. Justice.  Pardon me. "Retribution."  And what makes *me* qualified to be the judge of whether a person is worthy of their sentence before their natural death? The truth, of course.  The truth was revealed to me as I passed through the door last night. The truth is what was in that basement. At first, I had thought to fight it. To kill it. But as I crossed the threshold, in the place where I had expected the personification of evil, I found beauty itself in all its magnificence.  I saw.  The truth is light - and it should not be feared for the things that it is cast upon. And she has cast a *great deal* of light on the people of this town.  Which brings me to my revelation about little Kayla. I can say with a conviction deeper than knowing that she is clean. She is as undeserving of her mother's hatred as her brother is of her love. A love gone too far.   The truth that everyone else misses as they shy away, made uncomfortable by the sight of a mother who hits her daughter, is that that the same mother turns around and lusts for her own young son.  And so Mary S. became my first.  But not my last - far from my last. I suspect that this town will be a much smaller place when I have finished my work. A great many people have brought this filth here. They've managed to hide it, a festering sore, full of infection that could spread to the rest of us, spreading the filth and shit, unchecked.  And if there's one thing I hate, it's a mess.  I'm a janitor, after all.  ---  [Not That Kind of Janitor](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2d4zgq/im_not_that_kind_of_janitor_anymore/)   It's not the easiest job being a janitor.  Excuse me, I'm supposed to call myself a "Custodial Engineer" now.  You might think that it's just brainless, rote work, but you end up finding yourself thinking a lot about whether you really want to do the things you're about to do.  *Why am I scraping this gum off the floor? It's just going to be there again tomorrow.*  *I just had to put that bag of garbage down because the smell was too much. Do I want to pick that up again?*  *Do I really want to scoop ten pounds of human waste out of this toilet right now?*  Getting into these kinds of dirty situations isn't natural, in the biological sense. Some strong, primal segment of your mind is telling you not to go there. Not to subject yourself to that. That it's not safe.  I found the entrance to the basement two days ago. Not *the* basement, there are separate basements under each section of the school; the gym has a storm shelter under it; the band room stores their old and broken instruments in theirs; under the lunch room, there are props and costumes for things like football games, homecoming and prom. The basement I found is under the auto shop.  It was midnight, and despite clear, starry skies, the power went out while I was mopping down the History and English hallway. To turn on the lights, I had to turn on the auxiliary power generator, located in an enclosure off of the auto shop.  Excuse me, it's a "Vocational Training Lab" now.  Anyway, I go past the auto shop, into the enclosure, turn on my flashlight and... there's a door. And for some reason I've never seen it before, or I saw it and didn't realize that it was a door. From the outside, it's just a little square with a hinge. It could be a vent, or an access panel for wiring, but this night, for whatever reason, I realize that it's a door and that the bottom half is buried in the gravel that rings the cement pad that the generator sits on. I dig a little and find a handle.  As soon as I touched the handle, I could hear voices from the other side. At first I thought there were two people arguing, but now I'm sure that it's just one. And Jesus, the things that it's said...   About me, about the other students and teachers. About my friends and family. Things that *no one* knows. He told me which of my neighbors beat their kids. Which of my friends cheat on their spouses. He told me about the time the old Economics teacher, Mr. Parker was in high school and accidentally hit someone with his car and got away with it. About what Principal Taylor and his frat buddies did to someone's little girl...  It's been down there a long time, watching, listening. I sat and listened all night.  I haven't slept.  I can't close my eyes because if that thing with the whispering voice like a mix of sandpaper and an angry snake's hiss were there at the foot of my bed when I opened them... I'd just rather die than live that moment.  I dug away the gravel. Today, I'm going to open the door.  I got a sharp piece of metal from the auto shop, and wrapped the bottom of it like a spear. Do you think that'll work?  As a janitor, you find yourself asking yourself a lot of times if you really want to do the thing you're about to do, and I definitely don't want to go through that door, but I have to.  Because there's something in there. Something unclean.  ---  [Janitor After All](http://redd.it/2cyxa6)  [Not That Kind of Janitor](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2d4zgq/im_not_that_kind_of_janitor_anymore/)   [Part 1](http://redd.it/2bqjb8) // [Part 2](http://redd.it/2bvr8p) // [Part 3](http://redd.it/2c0as9) // [Part 4](http://redd.it/2comej)  ---  We stayed in Ahmed's "model house" for 14 days.   Ahmed was right; other than the plane, an attempt to escape would have gotten me killed. There's just nothing out there. Apparently the mock town they'd built to test weapons was one of a few that was never actually used, and that's the reason that it's safe to be there for any period of time. I asked Ahmed what his role in all of this was, and he couldn't give me many details. He was... quirky.  He worked for the U.S. National Parks Service. For about ten years they've had him conducting sweeps of the abandoned houses and buildings out there. It was a logical step to adopt one as a "home camp," since trips out there weren't exactly easy. I went with him on some of the sweeps, it was pretty uneventful. Most of the buildings were in bad shape. The sand had shifted and been swept by the wind up around most of them, and the hastily-constructed structures couldn't often take the weight. I never quite got used to seeing the families of mannequins huddled around the T.V. or laying on bare mattresses.  Most of the time, the only danger Ahmed found was from wild animals who had made their dens in the abandoned buildings. He had found squatters before of course. People who had driven off into the desert for who-knows-what reason. They were the reason he'd started carrying a gun. Then he met a man in a bar.  "The man wore a suit - full suit to this bar and he asks me what I do. I tell him I give tours of the parks for most of the year and sometimes I travel to the remote federally-owned lands to look for problems. This man is very interested in this, and talks to me for a long time about how technology takes our independence. I talk to him again a few times through e-mail and he asks me if I can take someone with me on one of these trips. It's not usual, but I tell him that I could do it and no one would know.  "The first person he sends, I meet them at a hotel in California. He thinks I don't know that he's watching and asking questions to see what I know. I bring him here - this is before I purchased my plane - and he tries to sabotage us. He pours out the water, sabotages the food, cuts apart his shoes. But I know how to find water. I can hunt here, I can make shoes. So after two weeks, we go back to California. Then I hear from him again. This one I meet, North in Idaho. They are blindfolded and handcuffed. They give him to me and tell me he cannot use the phone, and that he is very dangerous.  "This one I watch very closely. The first night, while he sleeps, I hide the keys and remove the battery from my van so he cannot take it. When I get back, I see him leaving, trying to head North. This way, I know, there is nothing. I pack my bag and I follow him. He is smart, and hides from the sun in the day and moves at night. So I follow him further and let him think that he is alone. The next night, he starts to go a different way. From this, I know that he does know where he's going. There is a small town that way, but it is still too far to go.  "He starts to cramp from the lack of water, and falls down. I come up behind him and he begs. Begs like a dog for water and food and for me to take him back. I don't have enough water now, and I told him not to try to run. So I shoot him, and bury him there in the desert.  "After this, every few months, I get a call for someone to bring. No more tests."  After our two weeks was up, we head back to the plane. We load up the gear and take off, but stay low. We're flying at night now. An hour away, he sets us down again on a little lighted runway where we meet a fuel truck. He really didn't take any chances.  After re-fueling, we returned to the municipal airport we'd left from in Oregon. On the ground, Ahmed seemd to be irritated about something. Someone was late, or not showing up to pick me up. He said he'd give me a ride instead, but I detected a little bit of worry sneaking into his normally reserved face.  We went to the coffee shop first, since it was closer. I was wearing fresh clothes that Ahmed had brought packed for me, but I hadn't had a shower in two weeks, and I was sure they would be able to smell me coming. If they would have been there.  All the doors were locked, and the windows were blacked out. No one was there, not even a car in the parking lot, including my own. Ahmed agreed to take me to my house so that no one would ask questions. I didn't have money or a phone or anything. He wanted answers as well, but no one was returning his calls.  I let myself in with a spare key. Everything appeared to be untouched in my house. My phone was still missing. On a hunch, I went to check my email. Amid the junk that had piled up there, there was one from Sam. It was an image of a bunch of warped text like a Captcha. It loaded instantly.      test_subject4116,      Hope you get this.     They were too fast.     They found us before we could get away with it.     Plus, I think my New York friend turned.     :(     |'m sorry for everything, but at least you're safe.     | wish I could have been here when you got back.     Go, run away. The     only way they won't find you is if you keep     on the move.     ...     Good     luck,     | wish you all the best.     Vegas is nice this time of year. I know how you used to     Love to gamble.     Ha. Maybe someday,     everything will be okay and I'll see you again.     0n the back of the monitor is your cut. I hope it helps.     Thanks for letting us use your internet. -Sam  This is where my story ends for now. Sam if you're out there, I'm okay. Vegas was nice. So was Atlantic city. And London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Honolulu, too.  So, when do I get to come home?  By the way, Sam, I cancelled my Dial-Up.   [Part 1](http://redd.it/2bqjb8) // [Part 2](http://redd.it/2bvr8p) // [Part 3](http://redd.it/2c0as9)  ---  From the donut shop, I was carried outside. I tried to yell for help from anyone who might be outside, but I was quickly silenced as someone drove their foot hard into my stomach. I was pushed into a car, where a man with a Middle Eastern accent spoke to me from the front seat.  "I have three simple rules. You don't follow my rules, and I kill you. One, no running. You run, I shoot you in your back. Two, no communication. No phone, no internet. I don't care how you do it, I will know. And I will kill you. Three, you do exactly what I say at the moment I tell you. That's clear?"  "Yes."  I could feel myself sandwiched in between two other men in the back seat of the car. My wrists were zip-tied behind me before I got into the car, and the angle of my arms was giving me a cramp. It was hot, and getting hotter as I strained to keep the pressure off the zip-ties cutting into my wrists.  "Who are you?" I asked, but the only reply was from the rocking of the car as it sped along some unknown road.  The car came to a stop, the doors opened and the men on either side of me exited. I was being pulled out into the afternoon sun, and then I was left. I flinched, and braced myself, unsure of what was going to happen next. I heard the car accelerate and drive into the distance. The bag was taken off my head.  In front of me was the owner of the voice I'd heard. He was short and I judged that he was in his mid-fifties. He wore an old black leather jacket and gold-rimmed sunglasses. Using a black, pointed blade, he cut the zip ties from my hands.  "I am Ahmad Bari. I will be your..." he searched for the word, "*companion* in the coming weeks. Please, step on board. Be careful of your head."  At that, he motioned behind me, to a small, white airplane. We appeared to be on a runway, the town's municipal airport, I had to assume. I eyed the weapon in Ahmad's shoulder holster, before turning my back and getting on board. Once in the cockpit, Ahmad handed me a large headset and began manipulating the buttons and switches in order to prepare for takeoff.  I'd never flown in such a small plane before, and would have found the lack of equipment between me and the long drop terrifying on even my bravest of days. With the added suspense of not being told where we were going, I watched the ground fall away with a feeling of dread.  We flew for hours in silence. Only the drone of the engine hummed between us. Just as the sun was beginning to make contact with the horizon, and barren desert stretched out below us, he began to descend. I couldn't see any place to land, towns, cities, lights, roads. I couldn't see anything below us except flat desert until we were much closer. I started to be able to make out the outline of a narrow road with sand covering it. Ahmed set the plane down, and taxied for several hundred yards more. He pulled the plane under an open hangar. The rusted metal structure looked to have been long-abandoned and so caked with dirt and sand it must have been invisible from above.  He ushered me out, and had me take some gear from the rear compartment of the plane - a case of water and a large backpack. From the hangar, we headed out into the barren desert about a half mile. The sun had gone down by this time and the awkwardness of carrying the water had transformed my fingers and wrists into numb claws.  A dozen yards ahead of me, spotlighted in the bouncing beam of my flashlight, Ahmed was using a GPS signal to track something, but all that was around us was flat, barren desert.  Then, in an instant, he was gone.  I stopped walking, and began questioning my sanity. Even lying prone and without his gear, I'd have been able to see him. I turned to look in every direction around me, and then walked to where I had just seen him before he had disappeared. As I approached, out of the ground Ahmed's head and torso resurfaced.  "Come, come in."  There was light coming from through a round hole in the earth. I climbed down a ladder, and into a normal-looking, if outdated living room. Candles sat atop the flat surfaces in the room. Doorways beyond opened up into a kitchen, and a hallway with more doors.   I was inside a house. Underneath the desert.   Held prisoner by Ahmed Bari, who was already making himself comfortable on the green and orange patterned couch.  "Put the water in the kitchen." Ahmed pointed. "And you may have the last room on the left."   I entered the dark kitchen, and rounded the corner. There I realized that we were not alone. Someone else had been sitting in the dark at the kitchen table, waiting. Watching.  I set down the water next to the one that Ahmed had brought, but kept my eyes on the silhouetted person on the other side of the room. Something about the way that they hadn't moved had unsettled something inside me. Some alarm was going off.  "Hello?" I ventured. My voice briefly echoed in the nearly empty kitchen. Still the figure didn't move.  "Huh?" Came Ahmed's voice from the other room.  "Who are you?" I called, trying hard to keep the nervousness out of my voice.   If I looked away, and kept it in the corner of my eye, I could see that they were sitting with both hands flat on the table. were they wearing a suit? The candle light from the other room was much too weak to tell.  *Fine,* I reasoned to myself. *Another game. Another charade and hoop to jump through. Another reason to hate Sam for getting me into this. These people were monsters, and if they wanted to act like it, then that was fine. I turned my back to the figure and left the kitchen. In the living room, Ahmed appeared to be nearly asleep, reclined on the couch. I took my pack from the ground, and started for the hallway.   "Don't worry about Ricky," said Ahmed unexpectedly.  "What, he doesn't talk?"  "No, he can't hear."  "Deaf?"  "No." He lifted himself off the couch. "He's a mannequin. It's fake. Like this house. It looks like a house, but it is only a model."  "A model house?"  "The military used to make them in order to test their weapons."  I nodded. I'd seen them in pictures and movies. They weren't any kind of place that I'd ever wanted to visit.  "Remember my rules. I wouldn't even have to kill you out here. You would find a way to die on your own."  I went to my room, set my bed and slept.  ---  [Part 5](http://redd.it/2crxek)   [Part 1](http://redd.it/2bqjb8) // [Part 2](http://redd.it/2bvr8p)  ---  "Sam, look. I've seen Breaking Bad, okay? I know that this money has to be laundered or hidden or whatever. What good is it going to do except prove that I knew about this?"  "The money's legal."  "So that's why you told me to leave my house? Why we're hiding out in a closed donut shop?"  "Look, I brought you in because I think you deserve to know what's going on. That's also why I cut you in on it when the others told me not to."  "Cut the bullshit. What did you get into and how deep am I in it?"  "Remember when I said that I'd do anything to have connection speed like yours? That wasn't some hypothetical 'ask Santa' wish. I already had big plans for it. More than just the Bitcoin mining pools I told you about. Those brought in some initial capital, but the big fish lied in investment transactions."  "You're speaking in code."  "The stock market. It's called low latency, high volume trading, and it normally requires some very specific hardware." He could see the blank look on my face creeping back. "Big computers that can tell when a stock is bought or sold, and can buy or sell on its own at pre-set price points."  "So you legally got all this money from the stock market?"  "Yes. It may be frowned upon, but it's new enough that there aren't any rules against it, or against how you do it. With a fast enough connection and enough computing power, you can drop latency to under a millisecond. Nobody's ever done that before."  "So what? You're not a stock market whiz kid."  "Right. That's why I brought in... my friend. He lives in New York and he *is* a 'whiz kid.'"  "Friend," I made air-quotes with my fingers. Sam pretended not to see them.  "He knew the systems and strategies of the big big investment companies well enough to make improvements, but he was ultimately under-appreciated and ignored. I offered him a sandbox, with all the tools  he needed to invent his own system."  "So... What went wrong?"  "Nothing."  "Nothing?"  "It worked great. We've made lots of money haven't we? And it's only been a week."  "What the fuck, Sam? I thought someone was coming for me."  "Right... Well... That's..." I could tell that he didn't want to tell me what was coming. He bit his lip and leaned back in his chair. "Somebody knows about us. I mean, we're a small target a long ways away from them, but somebody's not happy about it."  "They think we stole their money," came a voice from behind the glass display case. A man in a disheveled blue button-up shirt with dirty blond hair, and a blazer that failed to close over his gut stood up and took a bite of a pink donut. "Fucking hypocritical of them, but that's what they say, anyway."  "Friends of yours?" I asked the owner of the new voice.  "Not anymore," he shrugged.  "So these are what, like hit men? Are they the mob?"  His laughter echoed around the room. I could hear the nights of booze and smoke that had settled into his lungs. I disliked him instantly for his obtuseness. "The fucking *mob.* Who is this guy? I think I like him." When the other men didn't laugh at his theatrics, he turned back to me. "Okay look, Junior. There's no mob, there's no hit man. There's no Boogey man or Santa Claus either. What we have here is an entitled asshole who just lost his investors a few million big ones."  "To us."  "To us. Which shouldn't include you if you couldn't fucking figure that out already."  "So what, he's going to steal it back?"  "No." The donut man said nonchalantly. "Nah - he just wants to kill us."  "KIll *you*, you mean?" I jabbed back. I saw Sam flinch a little as I said it, but as I saw it, he was as much at fault as this clown standing in front of me. I expected him to respond, but he only looked at Sam.  "Tell him! You're the one who wanted to bring him here."  "I'm sorry, man. It's your name on the bill for the internet connection. I still don't know how it happened, but whatever you got wasn't intended for you, and it didn't come out of nowhere either. Somebody spent big money for it. And now they want it back."  "So I'll just cancel it. I'll turn it off - they can have it. I don't give a fuck, I didn't ask for this."  "Whoah, there slugger," said the man in the blazer.  I stood and looked down at Sam. "Sam, I'm getting out of this. I'm turning it off."   "You can't."  I felt, rather than heard two men move in front of the doors behind me. Sam looked up, his gaze piercing into me. "You can't turn off the connection until we're done."  "What do you mean 'when you're done?' No way! Sam! Stop this!"  "You're going to go away for a while. It's just easier this way. At the end of the month you can come back. You can have your cut. Honestly, it's for the best, this way."  The man in the blazer clapped and pointed at the tho men blocking the doors. "Alright then. Let's go."  A black bag dropped over my head.  ---  [Part 4](http://redd.it/2comej) // [Part 5](http://redd.it/2crxek)   [Part 1](http://redd.it/2bqjb8)  ---  I can't be angry at Sam and his friends. They had a good idea... a great idea, even. But in some Crichton-esque twist, while running through the whats and hows, they never stopped to think if they *should.*  Over our burgers, Sam explained what he and his friends were up to. I didn't quite follow, I was distracted by the weight of the fat envelope tucked into my jacket. He mentioned something about Phase I, bit coins, mining, hardware limits. It wasn't a business pitch, he was genuinely excited about this. He had a huge smile on his face the whole time, and he was talking so fast... Even if I'd paid attention, I don't think I could have said anything intelligent about it. My head was spinning.  *$4,850.*  *"My cut."*  When I went home that night, I didn't even log onto the internet. I had everything I wanted. I read a book and fell asleep.  A week went by and I got a text from Sam.  Get out of your house now!  I grabbed my backpack, with my laptop and the envelope of cash and left. As I was driving, I got another text.  Meet me at Henry's.  Henry's was a donut shop in the next town. I tried to text him back asking what was going on, but he didn't respond, and my call went straight to voicemail. The shop was closed when I got there. Thinking - *hoping* that it was some kind of joke, I tried calling him again.  The doors of Henry's opened and two men pulled me inside. A third extended an open hand. Not knowing what to do, I started to shake it.  "No. Cell phone. And keys, we're going to have to move your car."  Just then, Sam came over and shook my hand.  "Sorry, cell phones stay outside. It's a safety thing."  "Sam, what the hell's going on here?"  He sat me down at one of the few tables not covered in computers, cords and wires, but didn't say anything before pulling out another envelope. This one was thin, and inside was what felt like a credit card.  "$279,000, the last I checked," he said.  ---  [Part 3](http://redd.it/2c0as9) // [Part 4](http://redd.it/2comej) // [Part 5](http://redd.it/2crxek)   Do you ever get nostalgic for your childhood?   Want to go back and play the games and watch the movies that you grew up with?  So you'll understand what started me on the quest to get dial-up internet. It wasn't about the dial-up (though the sounds *are* pretty good memories) it was for a certain video game that wouldn't recognize anything but an old-school phone connection, and wouldn't let you play without it.  I had to go to my small-town electronics store to sign up. The place was sad and outdated. A Best Buy opened a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure the place hadn't had a customer since. I signed up for a phone line and the old man didn't bat an eye when I said I wanted to set up a dial-up connection.  Everything worked the day after I signed up. Of course, the multiplayer function of the game was abandoned, but I'd expected that. What I really wanted to do was upload the old mods and hacks and just play some rounds against the bots. I sure as hell wouldn't be able to convince anyone I knew to join in.  After a few hours, I got bored and logged out. In all, the setup had cost $27.78, and if I wanted to, I could play the rest of the month.  With the dial-up still on, I decided to try to browse the web, just to see how much faster it was now. I loaded Reddit - everything popped right up, including RES, pictures, thumbnails, video... Everything was working great - in fact, it was fast.  I went to Youtube. Remember pausing to buffer?  But it didn't even load. Videos played straight through on HD, with the highest resolution. The buffer bar was full as soon as the video started. Something was wrong. I was running multiple HD videos with no lag at all. With my normal connection, I had to wait a few seconds for even one page layout to load.   I double and triple checked my connections to make sure nothing else was on. I considered for a second that if I unplugged it that it might not come back, but I had to know. Besides, there was no way that what I was seeing was real. *It's 56k, for crying out loud.*  My regular connection started up. It seemed slower than the dial-up from a few seconds ago, but no slower than normal. The moment of truth: I disconnected the network cable and plugged in the old-school phone line. The connection dialed, the robots had their argument and then it was on.  It was back. I was running Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Video in separate windows without a second's delay. It was unbelievable!  If you haven't noticed already, I don't know all that much about computers, networks, internet connections... Keeping in mind that I could still be doing something wrong, I called my friend Sam who actually does know about this kind of stuff.  He was extremely skeptical, but as he opened up some ominous-looking black windows and typed a bunch of gibberish, awe started to set in.  "How much would I have to pay you for your username and password on this connection?"  "What? Why wouldn't you just go start your own? It was really easy."  "I don't know that it would work. Look at this, though. This is your connection speed. Normal is like... a few digits. Yours barely fits on the screen."  "Really?"  "I would kill for even.... a ten-thousandth of this speed."  "How did this happen?"  "No idea. The weirdest thing is just that the hardware isn't set up to even process this much data. It should not be happening, basically. The only thing I can even think of is that since absolutely no one is on the grid with you, everything works for you. It's sort of like having thousands of connections at once."  "Am I going to, like, get in trouble for this somehow?"  "Well... No, I don't *think* so. If anyone found out, they would definitely cancel this though."  I did end up giving him the username and password. I put the hundred bucks he paid me toward an external hard drive, and started downloading. Movies, games, books, whatever. For most of the stuff, I clicked and it was there. I talked to Sam online that night, and he said that everything was working great on his side as well.  When he tried to set up his own dial-up account, everything worked normally - that is to say, very slowly. As he'd thought, something about my connection in particular was special. Then he suggested that we should try to sell the connections. I pretty much had access to whatever I wanted - I was no kind of power user, and when he started talking about making $1000 a week selling a connection that I'd paid next to nothing for, I was sold. I re-upped my contract, trying to hide the excitement in my voice as I told the worker at the electronics store what I wanted.  The rest of the week was quiet. On Sunday, I met Sam at a Burger place. He sat down and handed me an envelope, inside was close to $5000.  "What the fuck is this! You said ten people!"  "This is from ten people, including myself. It's your share." He took in the look of surprise on my face. "Honestly, I'm sorry it's not more."  ---  There's more to this story, but I don't have time right now to tell it. I have to keep moving, or they'll catch up to me...  Sam, if you're out there. Believe me, I'm so sorry.  ---  [Part 2](http://redd.it/2bvr8p) // [Part 3](http://redd.it/2c0as9) // [Part 4](http://redd.it/2comej) // [Part 5](http://redd.it/2crxek)   "Cofee" was the name of a tiny mobile coffee shop. The kind that sells lattes out of a VW bus. It rolled into my town last fall, set out its misspelled sign and waited. The parking lot where the green van was set up wasn't far from my work. In fact, it was on the way. When I went there, I thought that it might have been closed because it was so dark inside. Just before I drove away, the modified side window slid open. There was a girl close to my age on the other side, smiling.  "Hi, can I get a-?" I started, but realized that they didn't have a menu anywhere.  Slowly, the girl squeezed her head and shoulders out of the window. For a split second, I thought she was going to climb straight into my car, but after her shoulders were clear and she pulled her hands through, she handed me a cardboard cup with a picture of a wagon wheel on the side and a white plastic lid. The whole time her face never changed. She withdrew from the window back into the dark and closed the window. I never even paid for it.  It was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted, or maybe will taste again. It was perfect in every way. It made me god damn *joyous*. I wanted to share the beautiful way it made me feel with the rest of the world, I mean it was just that fucking good.  So what that the girl inside had been acting weird? Maybe she'd been dared, or lost a bet. Maybe I was lucky she hadn't called me a "chicken fucker" instead.  I parked my car and started walking toward the front door of work. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a shadow moving between the other cars in the lot. I spun around, to check behind me, but no one else was anywhere around. As soon as I took another step toward work, a huge dog cut between the cars in front of me. I thought it might have been part wolf - the thing was huge and its black fur was matted and wild. It started growling and slowly walking toward me.  I backed away, but the dog advanced faster. I didn't know what else to do, so I dropped everything I'd been carrying and took off through another row of cars, hoping that it would give up the chase. It must have worked because I made it to the front doors alive.   The next morning, I slept through my alarm and woke up with a terrible hangover. My efforts to get out of bed transitioned into a wild sprint for the toilet as everything I'd eaten the day before fought its way up. I was going to be late for work, so I skipped the coffee stop. As I was driving by, the memory of the smell and taste of that coffee   from the day before washed over me. There was a short line in front of the little bus, and the same girl who I'd seen the day before was leaning out the window again. Only instead of looking into the car at the window, she was looking at me.  And she wasn't smiling.  Being late for work meant that I was twice as busy as usual. I probably would have caught up sooner if I hadn't been fixated on getting another coffee at lunch. Every few minutes I was checking the clock. It didn't matter if it took my whole lunch break, I had to go back.   Finally, my lunch break came. The afternoon sun was up, but just as before, the bus looked abandoned. Only this time, the window never opened. I waited my whole half-hour lunch break and the window never opened.  When I got back to work, I went to see my boss and told her that I was sick (which was actually still true) and needed to go home and sleep it off. She didn't seem to have a problem with it. As I was cleaning my area to leave, my friend Dan came and asked me what was up.  I should never have told him or anyone else about that coffee. He thought I was joking when I told him that the real reason I wasn't able to focus was because of a cup of coffee I had the day before. Maybe I *was* sick. I went home and tried to relax.  The next day was Friday, and I woke up feeling back to normal. I made breakfast and coffee at home, and while it wasn't as good as the one from Cofee, it did the job. On my drive to work, I thought that today would be no problem. When I passed the lot where the Volkswagen was parked, I saw that it was gone. I felt an unjustified panic seize my chest.  At work, I started noticing that several people had coffee cups with the unique wagon wheel design. Everyone seemed to love it as much as I had. When I left that night, I saw why - the green van was now parked in the back of our parking lot.  On Monday, I arrived at work to find an empty parking lot. The doors to work were still locked. I waited around for almost an hour but finally left when I saw a familiar green Volkswagen bus slowly pass by.  The police wouldn't listen when I told them that it was the coffee that killed them. They said that it was some kind of poisonous gas leak under the building that wouldn't show up in an autopsy. They never even tried to find "Cofee" or the strange girl who worked there.  As I said, this all happened last Fall; almost a year ago. The reason I wanted to tell you this is because I just saw the same black dog on my way to work yesterday, and I'm worried that Fall is coming again.

Thank you in advance!      [Original Prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/28lw8q/ip_the_ghost_thief/) by /u/Lexilogical   [Image](http://www.kimsokol.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GhostThief.jpg) by [Kim Sokol](http://kimsokol.tumblr.com/)  ---  The girl opened her pack and extracted a fat green bottle wrapped in fur. It was one she'd used several times before for this exact dark purpose. The crumbling cork slid loosely out of the opening. She crouched next to the lifeless body at her feet, her tight leather armor creaking softly as she moved. With a muffled word and a mysterious swish of her hand, the air in front of her glowed softly, then faded.  With a frustrated swear, she repeated the charm. The light glowed a little brighter this time and Jarod, standing in the shadows, thought that he could just see the outline of a tortured face being framed in the glow. This spell faded as well, and the girl swore louder. Jarod couldn't see why the blonde thief would even bother. This area had hosted several wars throughout the years and remains were plentiful; one only needed to look around the cave that they were in to know that. Wasting an enchanted bottle to capture this spirit wouldn't bring her any fortune, especially from here. No, this was something else.  On the third try, the thief's spell illuminated a satisfied smile on her face and caused Jarod to slink behind a pile of bones. The face, glowing in the darkness, was stretched and almost as thin as the skulls lining the walls. She began to reel the spirit into the bottle with one waving hand. Obviously clumsy with magic, her brow pinched in concentration. Jarod thought how easy it would be to incapacitate the girl right now. He had cause; the body she knelt over had belonged to his mentor, a silver-robed mage that had earned some renown in a long-ago age. Therein lied the reason that Jarod stayed his attack. The apprentice felt that he had long ago gleaned all he could from the old man with his strict code and laws, and finding him dead at a cutpurse's hand lifted his spirits.  Her work was complete. She carefully wrapped the glowing bottle and set it into her bag with the rest of her collection, considered the cavern around her and set out, her new shadow creeping along the tunnels behind her.  The town of Zale, where Jarod and his master had come was due east. The girl struck a path to the south through the woods. He admired how at home she seemed to be, even as she avoided the main paths. Early on, he had summoned a sphere of silence around himself so that the girl wouldn't hear him breaking branches and twigs. Her own magic seemed to be grounded in her skill and dexterity; he hadn't heard her once. For reasons he couldn't fully explain, he was captivated by the girl; her beauty seemed to grow with each obstacle she overcame.  He began to feel the length of the trek taking its toll. Briars and branches had claimed the hem of his robe, and his cloth shoes, once cobalt blue were now brown and caked with mud. His mark emerged from the trees onto a wide dirt road. Her pace had never slowed in the brush, but now she clipped along even faster.  The road ended in a wide, flat valley that housed a community of small farms. In the center of the valley, a group of huddled buildings stood above than the rest. The sun was setting on the hills framing the village. Against its glow, the girl's silhouette disappeared into one of the buildings. That was fine by Jarod.  For twelve years the young mage had studied under his old master. Creatures, places, artifacts, scrolls, tomes... It had been an endless cycle, a tedious life. He intended to study the girl in her own environment, untainted by his observation, as he would have studied a Pixie or a Bogg Toad. He wasn't in search of companionship; he only wanted to know her, while enjoying the power that anonymity afforded him. That power swirled and mixed with the feeling of freedom inflating in his chest as he found his way to the cluster of buildings.  The only building with light and activity coming from within it was an inn that doubled as a tavern and a small trading post. A squat, mustached man frowned at Jarod's undeniably impractical and dirty clothes from behind a wooden counter. In the next room was a tavern where hardy farmers were gathered around handmade tables where they were loudly sharing cups and tales.  Jarod's hand made a subtle movement and the mustached man's frown became dulled and the light left his eyes. "I'll be needing a room and clothes. You don't need to know my name or my business, only that I wish to be left alone." He set a pile of coins on the wooden countertop. "I am quite sure that this will be sufficient to cover my stay. My key, please."  ---  A short time later, Jarod descended the stairs wearing black pants and boots with a forest green traveling cloak. The noise from the small pub rose up the steps to greet him. Ignoring the man at the counter, he grabbed the handle of the door to leave. Jarod released the handle and his hand slowly dropped to his side. He turned his focus back to the bar. Standing there, next to a group of men at the table, was the one he'd been following. He walked into the bar and pulled out an empty chair at one of the tables - the only empty chair in the room. The strangers stared at him for a moment, but Jarod's gaze was fixed on the girl as she went from table to table, laughing and joking with the men she obviously knew. Her dexterity and finesse were obvious here as well, and her beauty more so. Two of the others at Jarod's table went back to their stories. The third tapped him on the shoulder with enough force to .  In normal circumstances, the mage would have resented the uncalled for touch, but the discomfort of his clothes was a constant reminder that he was in disguise. He swallowed his discomfort and looked toward the man. A thick beard was soaked with mead, and he smelled like dirt and sweat. "She's somethin' huh?"  "Something... Yes. Do you know her?"  "Sure do. That's the girl I'm gonna marry."  "You are her betrothed?"  "Well... no. She doesn't actually know me jus' yet. Gotta work up a little courage is all."  "You've never actually met her, then?"  "Oh, I met 'er. She... might not 'a got my name right..."  "I see."  "She's such a cute li'l thing. Her family's got a farm back toward the red hill." The young man tried to focus through his inebriation in order to take in Jarod's appearance. Before he could finish, the girl had appeared beside the table.  "Hi, Bill. Mort." She nodded to the old men at the table. "Another drink for both of you?" Both nodded and went back to their conversation. "And you two... well, hello. I don't believe I've seen you here before" she said, looking at Jarod. "Brothers?" Jarod glanced at the other man ogling the girl. Thick arms and shoulders flanked a barrel-chest with a wild blond beard hanging over it. The two could not have been more dissimilar.  "Ah, no. Afraid not. I'd like to purchase a drink for my new friend..." Jarod dragged out the last line, hoping that the lovestruck man at his side would offer a name. It didn't come, but the object of his affection kindly ignored the awkward pause.   As she left, the the oldest man at the table leaned over toward Jarod. "Ye don' want to be gettin' yer hopes up with tha' one," he slurred. "Strange, she is."  "Hear tell she's a necker-mancer," the fourth man whispered loudly enough to hear over the din of the crowded room.  "She ain't no necromancer! She's a *collector*. She collects things 'n puts 'em up in her ol' man's barn.  "Well, her ma an' 'er ol' man are weird ones too. Whole family of 'em out by Red Hill."  "Point bein'... Ye're best to leave 'er alone." At this, the bearded man looked slightly crestfallen. The barmaid arrived with the drinks and smiled at everyone else at the table before locking her gaze onto Jarod. For several seconds, she just stared. Jarod shifted in his seat and felt himself start to sweat. The moment passed and her smile returned before leaving.  "She winked at me!" shouted the bearded man. She certainly hadn't, but no one was cold enough to correct him.  "You said that she's a 'collector,' what did you mean by that?"  "Naw, I said she a '*necker*-man-"  "Shut up, Mort! I already told ya, she's not a necromancer." The man turned back to Jarod. "Her an' her family aren't from here. They came from some place I never heard of. That was 'bout four, five years ago now. So they show up outta the blue, and they buy a farm and then stuff just start disappearing."  "Stuff?"  The blonde walked close by the group's table and the man telling the story lowered his voice, ominously. "Yeah, stuff. Had about five of us out in the woods picking this certain kind o' mushroom. We sit down for some lunch and when we get to movin' again, no' one of us can find our bags. A whole morning's work, gone."  "Oy, I 'ad somebody trod off with me flask once. D'ya think-"  "I r'member yer flask well enough, Mort. I r'member 'cause I saw it fall in the lake when we was out fishin'." Bill shot him a look to silence him, but the man was occupied trying to pull something out of his pockets. "As I was sayin'- er... what was I sayin'?"  "So you think they stole your mushrooms?"  "Not just the mushrooms. People started to notice they were losin' their stuff from all over town. Their old stuff. Like Grappler's gran gave 'im a locket from 'afore the war, Brawn had a set o' armor his pa gave 'im. I 'ad a nice knife from me ma... used it fer cuttin' carrots. Stuff that was right inside peoples' homes, an' it just went missin'."  "You think she's got somrthing to do with it?"  "Well I dunno if it's *her* exactly's doin' it, but she's got the stuff in her old man's barn, that's fer sure."  "Yeah 'n my flask! It were green 'n fat."  "Was it glass?" Jarod asked.  "Yeah! How'd you guess that?" the man asked in wonder.  Without pausing, he responded "If it had been metal, surely the two of you would have been able to recover it when it fell into the lake." Bill laughed loud and drunkenly. Jarod followed the girl with his eyes for a while. "So, Bill, if everything is there in the barn, why hasn't anyone gone in and taken it back?"  Bill looked around him, lowered his head so that the tip of his beard just dipped into his cup of ale, but didn't lower his voice whatsoever. "It's haunted."  Jarod perked up at this, pulling his gaze from the girl. Mort burst out, "See! That's what I' been tryin'a say. She's a necker-"  "She ain't!"  "Well then what's that I seen her doin'-"  "You ain't seen shit, Mort."  "Please," Jarod ventured softly. "I'd like to hear what Mort here has to say."  It was Mort's turn to scowl at Bill, and he relished in the moment for a long second. "As I say. I seen the girl ou' in the woods one night, 'n I think she might'a been hunting 'cause there were something dead by 'er. So's she stops 'n pulls out this little bottle - blue, like the sky - and starts wavin' her hands and sayin' some kind o' spell. Then outta nowheres, that dead thing's spirit starts floatin' up, glowin' real bright in the dark, and she stuffs the thing into her blue bottle. I think that dead thing was a man... but I never went close enough to see. Ye' ever hear anything like it?"  "Actually, I have."  "Told you!" shouted Mort.  "Now hold on! The mister din't say boo 'bout necromancers yet."  "Sorry, Mort. I don't think that she is a necromancer. I don't think that she's much of a magician at all, actually. There are simple charms that one can procure to give the power to capture a departed soul in an enchanted container. Now, do you know of why she might want to do such a thing?" Jarod allowed their silence to linger a moment before answering his own question.   "Because she's a collector."  A smile spread back into Bill's face. "Yeah!"  The souls that she had taken were nearly worthless, but they might have contained sentimental value. However, if he could get inside the barn where she kept it, he may yet find some artifacts of worth.  Oddly, not a single customer had left the tavern yet. The starstruck young man had fallen asleep, a line of drool was strung from his beard to the table, and nearly hung to the ground.  Jarod stood, his drink was only half-finished, but he felt his balance waver for a moment.  The cool air of night blew across his body. He supposed for a moment that he should have asked where exactly the barn was, however it wasn't necessary. The mage had other means. The soft orange lights of the tiny town shrank behind him. In the darkness, he thrust his hand high into the air, feeling for the pulse of magic. Puzzled, Jarod lowered his hand. He felt magic all around him.  In the field beside him he heard rustling. It was getting closer. The young mage raised his hands in front of him, ready to react with fire and wind to whatever may come from the tall plants.  The soul thief emerged. She was wearing her thieves' leather again. Seemingly oblivious to Jrod's presence, she plodded down the road in front of him.  Jarod tried to count the number of things that had made him feel uneasy today. He traced the girl's writhe silhouette in the light, and forgot to feel uneasy. He followed.  Though something was interfering with his senses, Jarod didn't require a spell to know that the barn that he was approaching was something special. It simply hummed with mystery. Looking directly at it, the structure appeared normal. If he looked through the corner of his eyes, it appeared to have a faint glow just at the edges, as though it was filled with light and the corners sprung a leak.  Jarod was examining this phenomenon when a black boulder rolled from the edge of the road and on top of him, knocking the air of his lungs and pinning him to the ground. The boulder grabbed him began slam his head into the dirt again and again.  "Shane! Shane, stop it!"  The young mage, trapped under the huge, bearded man could not clear his head long enough to form a word or thought. He could think only of his burning, empty lungs until the weight cleared off of him.  "What are you doing?!"  "Ye know my name!" said Shane, equal parts surprised and elated.  "I know plenty, except what you're doing here!"  "Well I sees this guy in the pub an' he's watching you all night 'n then he gets up to leave. On'y he doesn't go up to 'is room, he goes outside. I was thinkin' it was a little strange to be sneakin' around at night. So I follow 'im, an' he starts comin' to your barn."  "I see. That's enough, Shane." The thief craned her neck to look down at Jarod with malice. "And you."  Jarod lay on the ground, still stunned. Something in his chest felt broken, and the pain dulled his usually sharp wit.  "You've been following me ever since I left the bar?" She pulled out a long, wickedly curved knife from her belt. "You had better start talking."  "Wait. No, I..." He struggled a moment to get to his feet, causing Shane to shift uncomfortably beside him. Jarod put his hands up in front of him as a gesture of surrender. For a practitioner of magic, however, the motion had a much different meaning. "I was drawn toward something in that barn."  "*My* barn. How do you mean, 'drawn?' Are you a wizard or something?" The knife glinted in the moonlight as her deft fingers twirled around the handle.  "A wizard?" Jarod forced a laugh. "No, no. I'm nowhere near old enough for that sort of thing. My name is Leopold Pozy, travelling musician," he finished with an exaggerated bow.  "Musician, huh? Let's 'ere a song."  "Well you see, Shane, is it? Shane, and..."  "Lexi."  "Shane, Lexi, this is the very problem which has drawn me here. I have hit a bit of a dry spell, a writer's block, a patch of creative impedance which prevents me from performing."  Jarod had seen a silver-tongued traveling musician once. He'd snuck out of the tower late at night when he was a child. Having never been out of the building, he had aimlessly walked the streets, imagining every circumstance when he might need to summon a fireball. The muddy roads had brought him to a pub where the most beautiful music and smells were wafting into the streets. Jarod stood, peering through the foggy windows of the tavern for over an hour. When the music stopped, the bard had come to speak with him. Jarod had felt in awe of how eloquent the performer was. He thought of that night as he spoke, and hoped to the gods that his speech was moving.  "I found my inspiration in the bar today; a beautiful girl with haunting grace. The rumors swirling about her proved almost as interesting as the girl herself. Rumors that seem to include the barn in question. "  "You're a terrible liar."  "Pardon me?"  "You want to see my barn, huh?" The knife stopped in her hand, and she clutched it in a slim, white-knuckled fist. "Very well. We'll all go and see what's in there, to put these rumors to rest."  Jarod's heart felt like it would beat out of his chest in excitement. His late master had always forbidden him from interacting with people outside the tower. Yet, here he was, without even using magic, he was able to get the things he wanted.  After a short walk, the three stood before the huge doors of the structure. The mage detected a faint humming in the air, and the light was more apparent now.  Lexi gripped one wooden door, while Shane grabbed the other. The doors slid silently apart, revealing only darkness. Jarod peered ahead, squinting and turning his head, but could see nothing beyond the opening. Lexi ushered him inside with a wave of her hand. As Jarod crossed the threshold, he began to see shelves lining the walls of the barn, reaching far over his head. Dark objects were crowded along them, stretching all around the structure, covering every inch of the walls.  Straight ahead in the shadows was something larger. He could only the dark silhouette against the shelves. It moved, slightly, and before Jarod realized that it was coming closer to him, a firm hand had grabbed his wrist. He tried to spin away just in time to see the barn doors slammed shut behind him.  With an explosion of sound, Jarod summoned a fireball. He was forced to close his eyes against the white light and heat, and burned into his eyelids was the image of a person in a robe. No, not a person. A mage.  Marcus the Silver, returned from the dead.  Jarod's fear possessed him, and he just managed to tear his arm away and scramble into the complete blackness. He thought of another spell; held it in his mind, ready to use it. From somewhere in front of him a terrible laughter came. He threw the spell, a series of tiny points of condensed energy slowly went forth from each of his fingertips, searching for a living thing to cling to. Their faint, shimmering light showed only an empty barn before winking out.  "YOU FOOL!" his master's voice shook the walls of the barn all around Jarod, things crashed as they fell off the shelves. The terrified mage backed against the wall. "You abandoned me," came a whisper in his ear, causing him to crawl and run forward into the center. He released another stream of fire, the impact blowing a hole clean through the wall of the barn and catching some of the things on the shelf aflame.  More laughter came, swirling and pulsing around him from all directions. Shadows moved across the walls, specters flew through the air over his head. The fire spread quickly, dropping onto the dry hay-covered floor of the barn. "What are you?!" Jarod shouted, unable to follow any of the hundreds of shadows with his eyes.  "I am death itself," the silver mage said, emerging from the flames.  "I'm sorry!"  "Sorry," he spat. "Weak. You are no apprentice of mine, just a traitorous cur needing to be put down."  "No!"  More shapes lurked in the flames behind the old man, the walls of the barn disappeared in the white light. Lexi, spinning her wicked dagger. Shane, slamming his fist into the palm of his other hand. The two old men from the bar, still sitting at the table, talking excitedly. More shapes milled around, seemingly ignorant of the flames all around him.  The barn walls spun around Jarod. He was in the cave again, surrounded by piles of bones and skulls. Lexi was there, coaxing the glowing spirit. Marcus's voice came unseen from the shadows, "You have ignored all that I have ever taught you. Here is the thief, bottling my departed spirit. Instead of defending me, your gracious master, you follow her! Chasing her further into the illusion of my creation, never once able to recognize that the world around you is a farce. Never questioning."  The cave spun around him. He was in the bar, watching himself from the corner of the room. He sat at an empty table, carrying on a conversation with the empty chairs around him. The walls of the pub faded, and he saw himself sitting in a grassy marsh, sitting on a stump, his robes soaked with filth. He looked like someone who had lost their mind.  The scene shifted around Jarod, and he was back in the barn. The flames were all around him now, he tried to shield his face and body with his arms against the intense heat, and he felt that he could hardly breathe. "Master!" he choked. "Save me!"  At once, the flames disappeared. The barn around him was empty, and moonlight filtered in through the open door. Jarod looked at himself. He was wearing the robes he'd worn at the cave, covered in swampy filth. Cautiously, he made his way out the door of the barn.  In every direction stretched an open grassy plain. Ahead, with his back turned toward Jarod, stood the mage in wavy, silver robes. Jarod stumbled up behind him, watching closely for any movement of the old man.  "Remember this day. For as long as you breathe, you will not receive a second chance." The old mage was gone. Behind him, the barn had disappeared as well. Jarod dropped to his knees and wept under the stars.  ---  Lexi watched the young mage as he wept on his knees. She opened her eyes, and saw the body of the man in silver robes lying on the stone ground before her. Flies had begun to feast on the corpse, and in the hours since his death, a stench had filled the cave, more than usual.  Looking on the corpse, she thought of the advice her mother had given her study of the magical arts had first begun. *There are two kinds of magicians that exist in the world. Those who are alive, and those who are dead.*  The Silver had been too dangerous to keep alive, coming into her domain, searching too closely. She smoothed the front of her robes, and retreated deeper into the caves, her mind put at ease knowing that Jarod would never find his way back to her. She had set in motion for him a perpetual state of illusion, sustained by his own mind. The entity he'd formed in his mind of Marcus the Silver was now the image that he'd see for the rest of his life. For him, Marcus would never die.  Entering her chamber, the illusionist set the common green bottle onto its place on her shelf. Too often, the simplest illusion was the strongest. The secret behind any lie was that people see what they want to see, or are afraid that they might.  When the Silver had come into the caves, she'd adopted the persona of the young thief, the bottle and the "soul" were used as props to lend credibility to her disguise. As Marcus had thought that he was sneaking up behind a distracted thief, she'd struck him down. Noise still echoed around the caves. The second mage coming and planned to use the same deception.   She couldn't say exactly why she'd spared the young mage. Perhaps she felt pity for him, blinded as he was by arrogance. It was a happy coincidence that the man, Mort, had crossed her path a month earlier. She had been able to use his memories to create the illusion of the town and the rest of the bar patrons. The poor man had stumbled into his own perpetual illusion at her hands. Lexi sighed, and cast her eyes along the hundreds of other items on her shelves, each representing a person caught in one of her webs, then made her way to bed.         There was this girl at the bar.  I know how that sounds, but she was different, strange, *alien*. I tried to talk to her, but... she just stared at me, silent.   I left alone, but saw her again in my dreams. As I slept, she came through my bedroom window.   http://i.imgur.com/2uWRbQp.gif   (from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy_gif/comments/260idp/this_one_always_gives_me_the_shivers/) on /r/creepygifs.)   Hi everyone! I just wanted to give you a quick update.   **First off, we hit 100 subscribers! Hooray!**  Amazing. /r/nosleep really has one of the greatest communities supporting it.  If you've been here for long, you'll probably notice that I've been less active in posting stories here lately. That's because I'm helping moderate a few other subreddits and just haven't spent the same amount of time digging into nosleep. **I've been slacking.**  **But you know who *HAS* been digging through /r/nosleep for the best stories it has to offer?**  **Your faithful staff at /r/NosleepIndex!**  I can't say enough good things about what the (*creepy?*) staff's doing over there. If you don't know what **[The Index](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/index)** is, it's a compilation of all the series posts on nosleep.  Their most recent project is the **[Nosleep Archive](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/archive)**. Look at it. Seriously. Do it. Go there. If you're here to find a definitive "Best Of" /r/nosleep... It's there.  **So if The Archive is the "Best Of" nosleep, what's going to happen to NoSleepReruns?**  I'm so glad you asked. This month I tried something different on Reruns by getting rid of the requirement for stories to be "underrated." That's coming back, and Reruns is getting back to its roots. **/r/NoSleepReruns will be the place for people to share their favorite underrated, undiscovered and underappreciated stories from nosleep**... again  I want that story that the writer poured everything into, that got one upvote and a downvote and dropped off the frontpage. I want the story that *you* were the only person who ever read, but you thought it was great, and it made you afraid of the dark the next night.  Since Reruns is going be re-focused your submissions, I'm changing the format so that the public can create posts.

My wife and I went camping last Friday. She died on Sunday and it is all my fault. I was the one who brought us here to the woods and in doing so, doomed us both. Three of us, if you include the new life swelling in her belly.   We should have left that first night. The first time we saw one of *them.* It was a tiny creature, starved, filthy and wet. When the thing came begging at our tent, it was pity, peppered with hope from our own coming child that moved us take it in. We both agreed without saying a word that we'd try to reunite the pitiful little thing with its family. We were so wrong.   I can at least take some comfort in my darling's words as she lay bleeding.   "You could not have known."  I fear that she was right. Who could have known, save for some cold, distant God? No man could escape from these woods, me among them. I am damned.  I can hear them now, their treble laughter wafting through the darkness, creeping closer, poised just out of sight, playing with me in a cat and mouse game. Soon it will be over. Soon, the children who own these woods will come and remove me from this world.    This is something I wrote for /r/nosleep a couple of months ago. People didn't seem to understand what had happened. What do you think?  Any feedback is appreciated.  ---  3/23/2014  "No Pets Allowed"  That's what the sign had said in the rental office. I was pissed. Of course, on the quick tour of the apartment, I hadn't had time to find the dog food and collar that someone had left behind the stacking washer and dryer. Why a dog? Why couldn't it have been a cat? I'm not allergic to cats. I hadn't had any sneezing or itching eyes yet that first night, but I expected that the first time I vacuumed and stirred up all the dander settled under the carpets, I'd also be stirring up my own personal hell.  I thought about leaving, or getting a different apartment, but I knew realistically that there wasn't one. The nearby university had been growing faster than the housing market, and if I left now, with Spring term just a couple days away... I didn't even want to think about it. Not to mention the fact that I'd just spent all day moving my things in. No, I was staying.  Best to go back to the rental office, complain and hope for a carpet deep-cleaning. I picked up the dog food and collar and put them in a plastic bag. I tried to pick up as much hair as I could out of the corner as well. Tomorrow, I'd go there and let them have a piece of my mind.  3/24/2014  I ran into my neighbor as I was leaving the house. I'm in 150a, and he's in 150b. He had long hair and was standing outside smoking. Since I was carrying the bag, I held it up (in what might have been an accusatory way) and asked if the previous person who lived here had had a dog. He said that if she did, that they'd kept it hidden. He'd never heard anything. He looked like a pot smoker though, so I wonder if he would have even noticed.  The young girl at the front desk of the rental office said that she couldn't do anything about it until the owners got back at 4:00. I told her to have them call me. By 8:00, I had abandoned all hope of that happening.  Night #2 in the new place. I stayed up late (well, late for me) watching movies and putting off unpacking. At about 1:00 in the morning, I turned in for the night. Any question of how thick the walls were between 150a and 150b were quickly answered, as I heard a steady thump like music while I laid in bed. By 1:45, I was alternating between fed up and amazed. Who can listen to one techno song, loudly, for this long? At about 3:00 am I drifted off to sleep.  3/25/2014  "Shit. Literal, actual, shit, is all over my attic." The girl at the rental office was useless. It wasn't her fault that she couldn't do anything, but I didn't care.  That morning, I'd seen 150b outside, smoking again so I went to ask him about his music. I was pretty sure that he was lying when he said he wasn't even home last night, and hadn't had any music on "for sure." When I went back inside, I heard the steady rhythm again. Like a pissed off soccer mom, I power-walked over to his front door to try to catch him in the act, but when he opened the door... there was no music.  Mr. Helpful from 150b followed me back to my apartment in order to "help me find the music." He reeked like pot. I knew it. Back in the living room of 150a, the pulsing sound was louder than ever. 150b proudly announced that the sound was coming from the attic.  There must have been a raccoon or something in the attic, because when he came down, the thumping had stopped and he was holding something in his bare hand.  "Something," in this case, was a hunk of feces, one of hundreds spread around the small attic in small piles.  3/26/2014  Last night, a noise outside my room woke me up at around 3:00 am. I rolled over and brushed it off until I heard something moving around in my kitchen. Thinking that it was a raccoon or cat from the attic, I threw open my bedroom door, charged into the kitchen and turned on the light, all while yelling.   A horrible, piercing scream rang in my ears, and in front of me, scrambling back under the kitchen table was a terrified child wearing dark and dirty clothes. I screamed in shock and if my legs hadn't buckled, I'd have run straight out the back door.  I fell against the wall, and involuntarily sat on the boxes I'd left there. The screaming stopped, and I took in the fact that there was a long cable, the kind that people use to tie up their dogs outside, that was snaking like a tail across my kitchen floor. One end was frayed, but the other led up to a collar around the child's neck. Also on the floor, were the shattered remains of a ceramic bowl.  3/27/2014  When I came back to the rental office to pick up my refund check, I noticed that they had amended their sign in permanent marker:  "*Only One Resident Per Unit* No Pets *or Children* Allowed."      I think we're all wondering when the next WvW thread is going to emerge,  as well as hoping that nothing is wrong with /u/Realistics. In the meantime, I thought it would be fun to run our own, informal WvW round in which anyone can participate.  **Prompt:** Where in the world is /u/Realistics?   **Submission Deadline:** Wednesday, May 14.   **Voting Deadline:** Friday, May 16.   **Target Length:** ~750 words.  Edit: Last day for submissions is coming up! Thanks, mods, for the sticky.  Still wishing all the best to /u/Realistics. S/He definitely has some clever stories to come back to.  Edit 2: Great stories! I hope you all had fun, I did. Look out for another sign-up post in the future. Just the sign-ups, though, then I'll disappear too.      Thanks, all. I'm always impressed by the amount of talent here.   My friends and I used to go explore abandoned buildings. We'd been to some houses, stayed the night in a cabin in the woods, and wandered the halls of an old office building. But there was nothing like the old hospital.  Inside, it was everything we'd hoped for. A lot of things had been left behind, and it even had that sterile smell like a hospital. We came in through the main chapel, where the intricate panes of a stained glass window lay in shattered pieces on the ground. We wandered through reception and the nurse's station. Found a break area with torn couches and a broken television. The whole experience of being there fell perfectly somewhere between thrilling and creepy.  Then we went up to the second floor. The hallway there formed a big loop with rooms on either side. Overnight-stay rooms for patients, labs, test equipment, stock rooms and offices. All the doors we tried were locked. Just before we called it quits and headed back down, we saw a streak of yellow light spill out across the hall from under one of the doors.  "Hello?" I shouted, my voice echoing down the hall.  The sliver of light grew wider. A woman in filthy blue scrubs stepped out. Her tangled, greasy hair hung over her face and we couldn't tell if she was looking at us or not. She slowly turned away, and shuffled down the hall, disappearing around the corner and into the darkness.      Sometimes, I randomly get a pain. It's like an itch that I've got to scratch and in a moment it's gone. I always thought that it was just a random thing before today.   I was "people-watching." For no reason in particular, I tracked one man through the crowd with my eyes. There was nothing strange about him. I'd probably passed a dozen people who looked and dressed just like him today without giving them a second glance. As I watched, I noticed that every person he came close to suddenly rubbed their skin like they had that random pain. That itch.   Before he left, he threw something in the trash. I was curious. I hadn't noticed him carrying anything before. So I went to the garbage can and looked. And there, right on top of the food court wrappers and paper cups, I saw it. A tiny syringe.   I shivered myself awake. I was in my car, in a 7-Eleven parking lot, but I didn't remember driving anywhere. I didn't remember anything. I decided to get some coffee to fight off the chill and think over what happened last night.  I went to the 7-Eleven. As she rang up the coffee, the cashier pointed to the right side of her neck. "You've got something..." I rubbed my neck with my hand, and pulled away some black flakes of dried blood.  In my car again, I felt gently around the cut just behind my ear. I thought that I felt something about the size of a Tic-Tac under the skin. I tried to squeeze it out, pressing the sides of the thing like a zit. It squirted out. The tiny black object shot into the mess of garbage on the floor of the car.   While looking for something to clean off the blood, I noticed an unfamiliar magazine and another 7-Eleven receipt on the passenger's seat. I stuck a napkin on my neck, and opened the magazine.  Colorful pictures of tattoos were on nearly every page. I came across one that looked liked it had been scribbled in permanent marker, and took a closer look. It was a bright, full-page picture of the side of a pale, skinny head. There were words written on the page of the magazine in Sharpie..  *They're coming back for you.*  There was an arrow to a spot behind the man's ear.  *Cut here.*  *Run.*   I shivered myself awake. It was dark and cold. The kind of chill that sinks deep inside your body and saps your energy.  I was in my car, but didn't remember driving anywhere the night before. I also didn't seem to have crashed. I was just parked next to a 7-Eleven. I checked my phone. 06:15; 7% battery remaining; no missed calls; no weird text messages.  I shivered again. Since I was already there, I decided to get some coffee to shake off the chill and think over what happened last night. As I got out of the car, a dizzy spell came over me. My eyesight went dark and I had to put a hand on the roof to brace myself. I must have stood up too fast, I thought. I waited for it to clear the rest of the way and went inside.  I entered to the familiar two-tone motion sensor chime and headed to the coffee bar. On my left, I noticed that the cashier was still sporting the unkempt remains of Mustache March. Also, I noticed that they were a woman.   One other person was in the store, carefully choosing something from the glass drink case. We got to the counter about the same time. Him with his illegal-in-several-states size energy drink and me with my I-didn't-intend-to-get-up-this-early coffee cup. I stopped short, letting him check out first. He smiled politely, and set his drink on the counter, causing the cashier to look up from her phone with a sigh. The man in line looked back at me quizzically.  "You've got something..." He pointed to the right side of his neck. I rubbed my neck with my hand, and pulled away some black flakes like dried-on mud.  "Thanks" I mumbled back, feeling slightly embarrassed and unsure of how much more remained.  When the mustachioed lady rang up my coffee, she looked me over then pulled out a magazine from under the register and added it to my total.  "Wait. What's that?"  "What? You forget?"  She raised her eyebrow like I was stupid. "You were just in here a couple hours ago, said you couldn't pay but you'd come back for it."  "Oh. Sorry, yeah. Actually, I don't remember anything from last -"  "So you don't got the money again?"  "Yeah. Of course. Here." I handed her my debit card.  I took my coffee and magazine (*Tattoo Magazine*, boasting a picture of a heavily inked and sparsely-clothed girl on the cover) and went to my car. When I got in, I pulled down the little vanity mirror in the visor to check the spot on my neck. I was surprised to find that what I'd thought was dirt was actually a trickle of dried blood from a small cut just behind my ear. I pulled on my ear and tried unsuccessfully to get a look at it. When I let go, there was a strange tension under the skin before everything slid back into place.  I felt gently around the cut. It was puffy around the wound, but I thought that I felt something about the size of a Tic-Tac inside. I tried to squeeze it out, pressing the sides of the cut like a big zit. Pain shot down my neck and temple, but eventually it squirted out. My hand was slippery with blood, and the tiny object shot into the mess of garbage on the floor of the car.   Freshly opened, the small cut bled and bled. While looking for something in my car to clean it with, I briefly considered using the magazine, but went for an old fast food napkin I'd found instead.  I still couldn't remember anything from the night before, but the magazine seemed like a really strange choice for me. I don't think I'd even looked twice at Tattoo Magazine before, let alone paid for one. With the hand that wasn't occupied by the napkin, I flipped through the glossy pages.   Inside was pretty much what you'd expect. Colorful pictures and elaborate designs were on nearly every page with interviews and articles scattered here and there. I quickly skimmed each page, still clueless as to why I might have wanted to buy it earlier. Most of the tattoos were excellently done, so when I came across one that looked liked it had been scribbled in permanent marker, I took a closer look.  It was a bright, full-page picture of a pale, skinny man's head from the side. On his neck, was a tattoo of a super-realistic tree frog, but what really stopped my heart were the words written in Sharpie on the page of the magazine.  *They're coming back for you.*  There was an arrow to a spot behind the man's ear.  *Cut here.*  *Run.*         Just getting into writing more seriously, and I want some general feedback on what I have so far. Everything on that site is a connected story, but The Old Hospital parts should stand well enough on their own. It's a horror story, and the violence ramps up in Part 3. Thanks in advance.

[1](http://goo.gl/g4bvog) [2](http://goo.gl/JPHKTV)  I looked at Ryan and then back to rippling water in the doorway. No one was supposed to be there.  No one was there; we'd just been through every other room in the decrepit clinic.  A person would have had to come straight here like they knew where they were going. A person without a light. A person who didn't give a shit about seeing two men with flashlights in an office in the basement of a hospital that had been abandoned for over 20 years.  Or maybe it wasn't a person.  Ryan had moved his hand to his police-issue Glock, but otherwise stood frozen. The ripples in the hallway dissipated. "Ryan," I whispered as quietly as I could. My voice was the first sound audible in thirty seconds, and despite my best attempt, it shattered the silence like a pane of glass. Ryan didn't respond, except for a flick of his eyes to me and then back to the door. I took it to mean that he'd heard me. "Did you see it?"  "No."  "Is someone here?"  "... Maybe."  I took a step toward where Ryan was, close to the door. I could feel the numbingly cold water up to my mid-calf swirl around my boots. And hear it. Whatever was in the hall had to have been moving very slowly in order to keep quiet.  Ryan jutted his head out into the hall. He held his hand backwards like a relay runner reaching for the baton. I struck the weighty Maglite into his palm, which he pointed down the hall. Right, left. He looked back at me.  "Let's go. Slow. Quiet. It went to the end of the hall and to the right." I could barely hear Ryan's whisper.  I nodded and followed him out into the hallway. We took one step at a time, hugging the wall, making tiny waves in the black water but remaining silent. The term "silent as the grave" forced its way into my brain. All I could hear was my own breath inside my head. The pace was excruciatingly slow.  About 40 feet past the office door we'd left was another, larger, doorway. Beyond that, the hallway ended against another cement wall with a dark brown window set into it. A ventilation duct, I guessed.  We slowly approached the open double doorway. The beams of the flashlights barely touched the wall inside it - more flat, gray cement. As we got closer, the light panned around the room. A couple of rusted, metal, rolling tray tables. An I.V. fluid stand.  Ryan stopped and pulled his gun from its holster. I could hear his sharp intake of breath. He held it, his arms so tense that they shook. I heard splashing from the room ahead.  "FREEZE!" The word boomed through the empty hallway.  *I can't see, oh god, what is that, is that a person, what the fuck are they doing there, what the fuck are they doing what the fuck, fuck, fuck.*  "Who are you?" Echoed Ryan's voice again.  I nearly lost control of my bladder when I heard the voice that responded.  "Hello," a woman's voice, tonal but raspy like sandpaper brushed along a metal pipe, spoke from the darkness. "Yes? Can I help you?"  More splashing, someone's legs as they waded through the water.  "Ma'am, stop where you are."  "Ohhh, am I in some sort of trouble?"  Ryan paused, seeming unsure of how to respond. "Ma'am, it's not safe here."  "Bah," she hissed, and the wading continued.  I shifted, keeping one hand on the wall as I looked around Ryan and into the room. An old woman in all white was walking through the flooded room. Her skin was pale, criss-crossed by blue and red veins, made more noticeable by the harsh white light of the flashlight. You could see her slightly yellowed teeth through her parted, thin lips. A large, angry sore on her nose drew attention from the rest of her face. Her hair was gray, pinned up in a tight bun under a small white hat. She was wearing a nurses uniform.  "Stop." Ryan called again, his voice quieter, the panic leaking out of it.  With a frustrated movement of her hands, she huffed and turned toward Ryan. "Stop! Stop? You stop! I'm working here!" She splashed through the water again, heading toward an ancient, completely rusted operating slab in the center of the huge room. As if as an afterthought, she added, "Don't make me call the police!"  Ryan looked at me, confused fear in his eyes. Before he even said anything, I realized that he was out of his league. "I need to call someone, we need back up - an ambulance, maybe," he said half to me, half to himself. "This is wrong, something isn't right."  He retreated back into the tunnel and pulled out his cell phone. "Watch her," Ryan ordered, before slipping out of sight.  The woman had reached the operating table and went to work with long, bony hands to undo the rotted leather straps there.   "Ma'am? Um, do you need help?" I cautiously offered. My own voice sounding strange to me in the large room. She didn't respond.   I looked around the room. It looked like about two dozen overturned desk-chairs, the type I remembered sitting in during school were shoved against the right wall. The back was lined with shelves in bad disrepair. Ryan's voice echoed from the hallway as he argued with someone.  The woman, intent on her work, gasped and sniffed, the noise bringing my focus back to her. I saw that she seemed to be crying. I walked closer, feeling a sudden unexpected compassion for the old woman. I don't think I'd ever seen a clearer diagnosis of insanity.  She squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her hands out like a person with bad arthritis. I tried again, "Ma'am?"  "Your friend doesn't like me," she spat.  "Oh he's -"  "I think I *know* why."  She stretched the word "know" abnormally long, as if giving a small moan of pain. She reached a finger up to the sore on her nose, drawing blood from it with a long fingernail, but giving no indication that she'd noticed. "He's afraid of me. It's because I'm - I look like a -" She frowned with sadness, unable to even say the words. She moved her left hand to cover her face and turned back toward the table, continuing to scratch with her nails.  I turned back, feeling as uncomfortable as I could possibly imagine. I looked for Ryan in the hallway, but his flashlight was just a thin glow of light around the corner. The woman was crying again, louder now. When I turned my light back to her, I saw that the entire side of her nose was now shiny and red with blood.   "I was pretty once," she moaned. She was scratching her cheeks and forehead with both hands now.  "Ryan!" I called, alarmed. I heard him splash through the water, but he didn't respond. The woman winced at some unseen pain, and gave a mournful groan.  "Ryan!" I yelled again, backing away from her. The woman reached her hands up, feeling along her face. She reached up to her hairline, just below the white nurse's cap and sunk her fingernails deep into her scalp. I could see the resistance of the skin and then the eight little *pop*s as the skin gave way, the nails sinking deep into the flesh. With a blood-curdling scream, she pulled down. The strain of it bent her neck.  I tripped backwards, landing in the hallway, splashing water onto the wall behind me. When I regained focus, the woman was sloshing forward in my direction. Her face was a mask of blood. It poured down, soaking her bleached white scrubs. Long pieces of skin stuck to her fingernails like tangled strips of scotch tape. I scrambled back to my feet, turning to run back up the way we'd come in.  I took a full step before I saw Ryan in his dark clothes, balled into the corner. Someone was standing over him in the center of the hall - another person in pure, fluorescent white. My screams reverberated off of every cement surface in the narrow hallway. I ran against the wall, backing into the corner at the end of the hall, trapped like an animal with nowhere left to run.  An explosion ripped through the underground chamber. My ears were suddenly in so much pain, I could think of nothing else. I opened my eyes again to see blood run like an open faucet from the wound Ryan's face, having taken his own life. His body slowly slid beneath the surface of the water.  Solid concrete behind me. Beneath me. Above me.  A tomb. That's what this place was.  The nurse had left the operating room. She wiped the blood from her eyes, and began to stagger toward me again. Purely on animal instinct, I tried to run again; to escape. I felt the flat wall behind me. A sharp angle dug into my left shoulder. I punched at the brown glass of the vent with my right hand, the one holding the flashlight. The window shattered, freeing years of accumulated black rot and pine needles in fetid rainwater. Everything was plunged into darkness. I dove headfirst up into the air vent. It was completely hopeless, I knew, but fear and need had taken over.  I had my head and shoulders in the hole, and groped for anything to pull myself with. Jagged pieces of glass cut across my belly. My hand brushed across something flat and metallic about four feet into the hole. I grabbed and pulled, hoisting my lower half up into the opening.  The metal handhold rotated in my hand - a fan blade. I planted my foot against the inside of the window frame and rammed my shoulder and head against the fan. The rusted metal tore away and I army-crawled further into the hole, the sides pressing uncomfortably tight against my shoulders. I pulled my legs up to my chest and away from the opening behind me. I stood up in the dark. The ceiling made a hollow metallic sound. I pushed straight up, as hard as I could, feeling the quarter-inch-thick steel cover slide away. I pulled myself up, out of the air duct, and found myself on the edge of the hospital's side parking lot.  I ran. An overdose of adrenaline commanded my legs. My body's momentum slammed into the side of Ryan's car. I yanked open the door and got in. The keys were under the visor where he'd left them. I struggled frantically to find the ignition, then started the car and tore out of the gravel parking lot. I didn't take my foot off the gas pedal until I reached the next town.   [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/21s9w8/the_old_hospital_part_1/)  "Only one place left to go."  I went first, through the heavy rubber divider and down the shallow incline. At one time, the passage had been covered in 30-foot-long slip resistant rugs. Those were now visible rolled up and laying in the still water at the base of the ramp. I felt my boot threaten to slip more than once against the slick, wet surface. I reached out and touched the wall to steady myself but quickly pulled it back, wiping it on my jeans instinctively.  Everything underground was wet. The water even formed rivulets as it ran from cracks in the cement walls. I was forcibly reminded of the dreams; dreams of water filling the world, pouring from every crack and crevice; of trying to run, only postponing the inevitable; of the people who rose up out of the water and turned to look at me, to chase me; of being pulled down into the deep, turbulent green water; of being drowned; of being killed.  I told myself that this wasn't a dream - that those things couldn't hurt me in real life. What a strange thing, to be so afraid of fear itself that you try to tell yourself *this is real.* I tried to control my breathing, but the thick smell of mold kept each breath shallow.  "Hey. You with me?" asked Ryan. I locked my wide eyes onto his inquisitive ones. Somehow, they brought me back again. I think it was the humanity, the connection that told me that I wasn't alone.  "Panic attack. Sorry... I-" I wanted to explain why. To tell him about the dreams and show that I had a good reason. I didn't. "I'm good."  "You sure? We could come back tomorrow."  "No. I need to know."  "Right. Can't be much more, this place isn't that big."  The water that covered about three inches of the floor of the basement was freezing. The cold pierced through my boots and socks, and crept up my legs. The sounds of our feet splashing bounced around the walls. On our right was a doorway; locked. I guess that's why I had brought the sledgehammer. With a deafening crack that echoed into the unexplored hall, the door was blasted open.  We walked into an office with a large walk-in file room in the rear. Nothing looked like it had been moved in 20 years. Urban explorers sometimes say that they feel a high as they cross the threshold into a forgotten place. I've heard some of them talk about the smell of those places being intoxicating.  They're right.  I walked into that room with a smile. To my left, on a waterlogged wooden desk was an electric typewriter, still plugged in. A stack of papers, rippled from the wet air, sat in the "out" box. The chair behind the desk was pushed back like the person had just gotten up and walked out of the room five minutes ago. In the filing room stood three large cabinets. Surely something was there. A name, a record, a clue to what had happened.  Ryan cracked the first cabinet with his crowbar. The old, thin metal gave easily. I pulled the first drawer out, eagerly looking inside. Empty. Not even the dividers were left. The second cabinet was the same way. We thought that the third was too, until we came to the bottom drawer. A pile of papers were sprawled crookedly, half-submerged in the murky water.  They looked like reports of some kind, like you might write for a college class. The cover sheets all said "Case study number: ######" in bold writing, and below that, "Philippe R. Menser, M.D." the insides were too detailed or too damaged to try to give a proper summary; in the first one, I thought that it might have been a trial for a new medication. Several were listed in the early paragraphs, but the latter pages mentioned nothing about them. Instead, they gave a long, detailed description of the mental state of the "subject," their habits, dietary preferences, etc. In all, there were about a dozen case studies, each containing 50 - 100 pages.  Ryan and I were looking through the papers spread across the desk by the light of our flashlights, trying to get a sense of what we'd found. Something in the hall caught his eye. His head snapped up and he glared intently at the water. His whole body tensed, then I saw it too.  The water in the hall was rippling. Something had just moved past us into the darkness.  [Part 3](http://goo.gl/xgTQni)   You're on the honor system.  Special note: Spelling and Grammar Nazis, you may not find enjoyment here.   EDIT: For you visual people, I drew up a [model](http://imgur.com/a/FDpQE) of the first floor.  The hospital grounds sat in the middle of the town like a bullseye. This was most likely a coincidence; the oldest parts of the town were closest to the river that formed the southern boundary and over time, the town had expanded North and East. The newest building, and the furthest North, was a medium-sized retail store that the town had fought to boycott. Towns that grow over a long period of time are devoid of any master plan, since people just add what they need when they need it. In this case, the evidence all over town could be found in the large expanses of forest and sand dunes that were left between one developed area of town and the next. If a place had been too costly to build on, it was skipped over.  After the "old" hospital, which it was still referred to, was closed in 1990, the small patches of forest around it took back the grounds in only a matter of months. The building itself fell to a different sort of wilderness. Being out of view from the street below, daring high-schoolers and vagrant meth addicts moved in. in only a few days, every one of the windows had been broken out. In a couple weeks, some had tried to burn it down. After more than 20 years, it looked like the place was about to fall down.  "The police don't really come up here any more," explained Ryan. "They just kind of drive through the parking lot and check to see if the place is still standing. If it isn't on fire or there isn't a car parked in the lot, they don't even check inside." From the passenger seat in Ryan's car, it was easy enough to see why it didn't require security to keep people out. Yellow caution tape was off-putting. The collapsed ceiling and dark, metal-screened windows were threatening. The place looked downright dangerous.  "Why doesn't someone just tear it down?" I wondered aloud.  "Well, are we going to do this?" Ryan killed the headlights, casting the building in blue light from the one streetlamp over the gravel parking area. I took a sledge from the trunk I'd borrowed from Nicole's house. Ryan had brought a crowbar as well, but just in case we found anything serious in there, Ryan had brought his pistol. Guns usually make me nervous, but I counted having an armed, off-duty cop with me as a good thing.  "Now, that - " Ryan said, pointing to the chained set of double doors just to the right of a sign saying [Town] Medical Clinic, "- is the main entrance. There's no key anymore, but people have found other ways to get in." He took us around the left side of the building where we found a door propped crookedly in its frame. The nails of its hinges had pulled out of the soft, moldy wood. Once we were inside, we turned our our flashlights on and got our first look at the inside. Something about being in that place was really unsettling. Thick patches of green moss had grown over the floor and walls near the windows and  doors. Beneath the holes in the ceiling, huge ferns grew out of the dark, wet carpet. Under everything was a slimy layer of green mold. It smelled like a forest. A large beam had fallen from the ceiling across the room like a downed tree trunk, adding to the clutter and claustrophobia of the small room.  Have you ever seen the footage of scuba divers or those robotic submarines who sift through old shipwrecks and underwater buildings? That's what it reminded me of. Everything had something growing on it, and there was dust hanging in the air, unmoving. It was the silence that really drew the similarity; it was thick and oppressive, as if there were a thick, weighted blanket over everything.  That first room looked like a break room, or staff area. Against the left wall was a small kitchenette area, with cabinets along the floor and ceiling and a sink set into the counter top. Across from the door we'd just come through was a gaping black hole that had once been a doorway. Some long-ago fire had rounded its edges, leaving an oblong black portal. To the right, was a staff bathroom area, which had a couple of lockers, a shower and a toilet. We had to be careful walking across the floor. Shards of glass from the broken window and mirror in the bathroom were scattered across the carpet. Near the doorway, the fire had eaten through the floor, exposing the supports.  The next room was bigger, looking like it might have been a place to gather everyone at the hospital together at once. It had the most evidence that people had been living in it. Bottles, beer cans and black trash bags were in every corner and across the floor. A sleeping bag lay crumpled under the black, grated window against the far wall. Metal folding chairs were scattered about, casting long black shadows along the ground as Ryan and I shined our lights.  Through a larger door on the right-hand side of that room was a long hallway. This was the main leg of the hospital which consisted of five separate rooms with tattered, white curtains hanging in the doorways. I couldn't see all the way to the end of the hall. It looked like it just kept going and going. The wall on our left, opposite of the rooms, was made almost entirely out of metal-caged windows that looked out onto a small porch. During the daytime, you could have seen the trees and bushes beyond.  It was here that I began to have the feeling of being watched. The metal crosshatch pattern over the windows and abysmal blackness beyond made it impossible to see out. I imagined it was something like a one-way mirror. If someone had been standing outside, they could have been watching us like gerbils in a cage.  Ryan and I checked the first hospital room on our right. Everything had been stripped and removed, even the cupboard doors and drawers. A tiny slit of a window on the back wall of each room let in light from the one bluish streetlamp that illuminated the parking area outside.  Ryan went inside, and I stayed watch. Watching for what, I don't know, but I ended up staring into the blackness at the far end of the hall. Maybe it was my imagination or my anxiety, but I thought I heard something down there, a soft shuffle in the dark. There was no echo; being inside that place was like being in a vacuum. I turned off my light, and just looked and listened. My fear grew, as I focused on anything at the end of the hall. It was so dark, I could see the phosphene swirls I normally only see when I close my eyes. It was silent, but I was sure that there was someone there, at the end of the hall. My heart rate rose, I could feel it in my tense shoulders. Was that a sound? A whisper?  I was shaken out of my concentration by Ryan's hand grabbing my arm. "You okay?" I hadn't seen his flashlight illuminate the hall way around me.  "Yeah..." I didn't know whether to tell him that I'd heard something or whether I'd been just been daydreaming. "Let's split up, I'll check the front door and see what's at the end of the hallway."  "Sure," Ryan said, going into the second room. As quietly as I could, listening as I went, I went to the far end of the hall. The reason we hadn't been able to see anything at the end was that there was a wall made of strips of flat black rubber hanging from the ceiling. I parted them and shined my light through. The smell of mold invaded my sinuses. Past the curtain, the linoleum floor turned into finished, smooth cement. The hallway dropped off in a downward slope, ending in a pool of standing water.  Before the curtain, alongside the patients rooms, was a moderately-sized reception area. Light streamed in from the parking lot through the locked front doors. On the left was a tall reception desk built into the floor and wall. Behind that was a computer desk and some rusted-out file cabinets. The metal cabinets had signs of being pried open long ago. As was to be expected, nothing interesting was left. Whatever papers had been left behind had probably been burned, leaving more charred areas on the floor.  I turned to leave, but something behind the computer desk flashed, catching my eye. Fallen in the area between the desk and the wall was a glass frame of some sort. Mold had grown inside the glass, and water had damaged the printer paper inside, but you could still make out the words "visiting" near the top, and "unwanted" near the bottom right corner. Nothing with a doctor's name on it.  I left the reception area, expecting Ryan to be nearly done checking the patient rooms. I didn't see any light.  "Ryan?" I called weakly, moving back down the hall. The feeling of being watched was overwhelming and the hairs on my neck stood straight up. Ryan didn't answer. In the second room I found him standing stock-still, facing the wall, his dark flashlight in his right hand. He was staring at a broken mirror above a tiny porcelain sink. "Hey. Find something?" I asked cautiously, staying outside the doorway.  He turned his whole head ninety degrees to look at me, taking a full second to respond He shook his head like he was shaking off a dream, "No." He seemed to have snapped out of whatever trance he'd been in. "Fuck this place, man." At that moment, I was so glad to have Ryan with me. Who knows how long he or I would have sat there, staring off into space without the other there to pull them back to reality.  "Yeah. You get the feeling like we're being watched from out there?" I asked, gesturing outside the large, glassless windows.  "Now that you mention it, yeah. Thanks for that." He said with a sly smile, joining me in the hallway. "Only one place left to go." He pointed his light at the rubber curtain.  It occurs to me now that there was one more room we didn't check. The fifth patients room. We hadn't found anything in the other four, and it seemed like there was a slim chance we'd have better luck with the fifth. At least, that's what we thought at the time. Maybe that was where we went wrong.  ---  EDIT:   [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/21zwx7/the_old_hospital_part_2/)   [Part 3](http://goo.gl/xgTQni)   [Home](http://goo.gl/u84b4A)     3/23/2014  "No Pets Allowed"  That's what the sign had said in the rental office. I was pissed. Of course, on the quick tour of the apartment, I hadn't had time to find the dog food and collar that someone had left behind the stacking washer and dryer. Why a dog? Why couldn't it have been a cat? I'm not allergic to cats. I hadn't had any sneezing or itching eyes yet that first night, but I expected that the first time I vacuumed and stirred up all the dander that had settled under the carpets, I'd also be stirring up my own personal hell.  I thought about leaving, or getting a different apartment, but I knew realistically that there wasn't one. The nearby university had been growing faster than the housing market, and if I left now, with Spring term just a couple days away... I didn't even want to think about it. Not to mention the fact that I'd just spent all day moving my things in. No, I was staying.  Best to go back to the rental office, complain and hope for a carpet deep-cleaning. I picked up the dog food and collar and put them in a plastic bag. I tried to pick up as much hair as I could out of the corner as well. Tomorrow, I'd go there and let them have a piece of my mind.  ---  3/24/2014  I ran into my neighbor as I was leaving the house. I'm in 150a, and he's in 150b. He had long hair and was standing outside smoking. Since I was carrying the bag, I held it up (in what might have been an accusatory way) and asked if the previous person who lived here had had a dog. He said that if she did, they kept it extremely well-hidden. He'd never heard anything. He looked like a pot smoker though, so I wonder if he would have even noticed.  The young girl at the front desk of the rental office said that she couldn't do anything about it until the owners got back at 4:00. I told her to have them call me. By 8:00, I had abandoned all hope of that happening.  Night #2 in the new place. I stayed up late (well, late for me) watching movies and putting off unpacking. At about 1:00 in the morning, I turned in for the night. My questions of how thick the walls were between 150a and 150b were quickly answered, as I heard a steady thump like music while I laid in bed. By 1:45, I was alternating between fed up and amazed. Who can listen to one techno song, loudly, for this long? At about 3:00 am I drifted off to sleep.  ---  3/25/2014  "Shit. Literal, actual, *shit*, is all over my attic." The girl at the rental office was useless. It wasn't her fault that she couldn't do anything, but I didn't care.  That morning, I'd seen 150b outside, smoking again so I went to ask him about his music. I was pretty sure that he was lying when he said he wasn't even home last night, and hadn't had any music on "for sure." When I went back inside, I heard the steady rhythm again. Like a pissed off soccer mom, I power-walked over to his front door to try to catch him in the act, but when he opened the door... there was no music.  Mr. Helpful from 150b followed me back to my apartment in order to "help me find the music." He reeked like pot. *I knew it.* Back in the living room of 150a, the pulsing sound was louder than ever. 150b proudly announced that the sound was coming from the attic.  There must have been a raccoon or something in the attic, because when he came down, the thumping had stopped and he was holding something in his bare hand. "Something," in this case, was a hunk of feces, one of hundreds spread around the small attic in small piles.  ---  3/26/2014  Last night, a noise outside my room woke me up at around 3:00 am. I rolled over and brushed it off until I heard something definitely moving around in my kitchen. Thinking that it was the raccoon from the attic, I threw open my bedroom door, charged into the kitchen and turned on the light, all while yelling. A horrible, piercing scream rang in my ears, and in front of me, scrambling back under the kitchen table was a terrified child wearing dark clothes. I screamed in shock and if my legs hadn't buckled, I'd have run straight out the back door.  I fell against the wall, and involuntarily sat on the boxes I'd left there. The screaming stopped, and I took in the fact that there was a long cable, the kind that people use to tie up their dogs outside, that was snaking like a tail across my kitchen floor. One end was frayed, but the other led up to a collar around the child's neck. Also on the floor, were the shattered remains of a ceramic bowl.  ---  3/27/2014  When I came back to the rental office to pick up my refund check, I noticed that they had amended their sign in permanent marker:   "*Only One Resident Per Unit* No Pets *or Children* Allowed."      This whole situation just hit a new level of weird and terrifying.  If you want to read about what's happened to me before, you can go [here](http://goo.gl/u84b4A).  I'm still having the dreams. Always with those fucking dreams - sinking, being closed in on, isolated and killed. Over and over. But really, the worst part about them is that for half of the time I'm dreaming, I can't even tell the difference between it and reality. I wake up, I do normal things, I move on with my day and then things take that awful turn.  Today, if I am dreaming, it just got so much worse, and I can't wake up. However, I think this was real.  I woke up (I work nights, so this was in the afternoon) and as I drove to work around 7:30 pm I saw the old man who broke into my house a few weeks ago. He was standing, dripping wet, wearing the same clothes as that day that he came into my house. Standing under the overpass behind a short, chain link fence, I could see his one good eye tracking my car. I nearly rear-ended the car in front of me because of while I watched him.  But again, that's how my dreams start. Everything's normal and then some part of reality shatters like glass and that's the first sign that something is wrong. Then it breaks more and more and by the end...  But this wasn't a dream. Maybe if I say that enough, even *I'll* believe it.  I went to work, which has been its own mess, and zombie-stumbled my way through again. I only vaguely remember my boss telling me about how I've been acting different, that he's worried about my performance. It just doesn't seem worth concentrating on, especially with my mind on the fact that the old man was back. What was he doing there?  I drove back home, arriving at about 4:30. Early morning is about the only time I enjoy it here. It's cool and calm, unlike the rest of the day. As much as I thought I wouldn't, I miss the hell out of Oregon.  This is what I was thinking when I walked up to the front door, and with key in hand, in the brief light of a passing car, I saw him through the window. He was standing, crouched on the dark stairs. I could just see his feet and torn pants, and the bottom of his old rain jacket as he sat about eye-level on the stairs above me.  At first, I didn't react other than backing away from the door. I was so shocked at what I'd seen that I couldn't even form a plan of what I wanted to do. Then I ran. It wasn't the reasonable thing to do - I should have called the police again, but with the last two times that they've come ending with my own interrogation and nothing good coming from it, I subconsciously decided against going down that road again.  So I ran. About a minute after starting, I think I forgot why I was running and just... blacked out. I guess it was sort of like being in a daydream, except there was no dream. It was actually nice.  I found myself in a small park at the end of a dead-end residential street, just as the sun was beginning to come up.  I sat on the swings while I caught my breath and called the police. The dispatcher said that they'd send someone, but that my address had a note against it in their system and that I should meet them in the parking lot that I share with the other houses in the area.  I agreed and started jogging back. How had I run this far in slacks and dress shoes?  On my right, I could see the road that I'd driven this morning, the various overpasses, exits and signs filling with red taillights of people going to work. I was really close to where I had seen the man this morning. Close enough that I could take a minute and see if anything was there, I reasoned.  I left the sidewalk and followed a dry, dusty path beneath the overpass. There were a surprising number of footprints and trash all around. People had obviously been living there. Were living there. I thought, a little further back there might have been a sleeping bag in the corner where the cement pillar met the ground. At the bottom of the hill was a small... I can't call it a pond, but it was standing water, and all around the edge where it had receded in the recent heat was trash and various debris. Everything you might expect to find except, floating near the edge was a wooden oar. I remember thinking, *what the fuck is that doing there?*  My minute was up; I turned to go, but silhouetted against the rising sun was a profoundly greasy-looking man in an old rain coat.  He moved with startling speed, having the upper ground and the element of surprise. I tried to run, but in the soft sand, I managed to take only a couple of steps before he was upon me. I crouched, bringing my center of gravity down, and then exploded my body upwards into his. The stink of alcohol, body odor, and garbage was overpowering, and he was still very wet. He fell down the hill, crashing down onto the edge of the not-pond.  Unfazed, he got up, grabbing the oar with both hands. Again I tried to run, but he was faster. He brought the oar down on the top of my head with a low, fleshy crack. Things went dark. I could feel myself being picked up and dragged, and I thought I could hear a little girl screaming...  I felt my body lifted up high into the air, and cleared up enough to make out the man screaming "... be baptized and ye shall be free!"  I was in the water again, disoriented and now unable to breathe. I opened my eyes, but the only thing I could see was the man's face and arm, under the water holding me by the throat, bringing me down further into the water. I reached for the bottom, anything to get a grip and push off of. *How is it so deep?*  The water started to froth and bubble around us, and soon I couldn't even see his face. I kicked wildly, and finally connected with something. He let go, and I was free-swimming in the deep water. I figured out which way was up by following the bubbles, and after another few seconds, broke the surface. The air felt cool on my fiery lungs.  I wasn't in the not-pond anymore. I was in the middle of a large lake, near a dark green fiberglass rowboat. I scrambled up onto it in my panic. Where was the man? Where was I? What the fuck just happened?  I sat in the boat, curled into a ball, just breathing for several minutes. I hadn't heard a thing break the silence on the lake around me. I peered over the edge and saw the man, floating face-down in the lake, a dozen feet from the rowboat. I took the paddle and set off toward land.  After a few paddles, I realized that this was the lake that I'd been thrown into before. I was back in Oregon - back in my hometown, even. I paddled up to the bank, toward the only house I still knew in the area, Nicole's.  After spending the day in police custody, they finally released me back to Nicole's where I'm writing this now. As I said, things have drastically escalated, and this is far from over.  I can't go back home. I'm here. And despite feeling like I've fallen into my own Twilight Zone episode, there's also a feeling of being back home... So now I'm going to get to the bottom of this thing. Nicole has agreed let me stay, so long as I try to keep her out of whatever is going on.  Tomorrow, I take my first step toward solving this. Wish me luck.      I haven't gotten any comments and don't have any IRL people to show it to. Read a sentence or the whole thing and let me know what you think! This is the longest thing I've written and I'm at the point where I'm not sure if it's worth going on, or if there's something I could be doing better. Seriously, tell me how much it sucks. Tell me how bad blogger is. Just tell me if you *didn't* read it, at least that's something!  Thanks in advance.  **[Link](http://atomgrayhome.blogspot.com)**   Hi everyone. I'm starting to get into writing as a hobby, and right now I'm working on a series for /r/nosleep. I'm not getting a lot of feedback there, though. So...   Thoughts? Questions? Smart remarks?  Leave your constructive criticism in the comments [here](http://atomgrayhome.blogspot.com/).   I'm back home.  "Home."  What is home?  Is home where you go at the end of the day? The place where you park your car? Where you sleep? Because if so, then yes. I'm home now.  But maybe home is where you come from; where you were born and grew up. The place that formed you into the person you eventually became.  Maybe it's the place where you feel like you belong. That part of the world that continues to shape as well as reflect you. Like when you tune a guitar and you can hear the dissonant vibrations getting smaller and smaller until the sounds become indistinguishable from each other. A place that resonates with a person. That sounds like home to me.  In any case, I'm back from my trip to Oregon, my hometown, and the nightmare going on there. You can read about that here:  [1](http://goo.gl/mUbcoc),    [2](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8),    [3](http://goo.gl/Omv2sC),   [4](http://goo.gl/51dlgg)  I've had a really hard time dealing with everything over the past week. I haven't slept. I go back and forth between wanting to figure out what's happening there and getting frustrated when I can't find anything new. I should probably just consider myself lucky to have gotten away alive. I wish that I could just forget the past and move on.  But growing up in that town has rubbed off like a stain on my mind. Going back and *dying* there...   For starters, I see my sister now. That sentence looks insane sitting on the page. I feel insane. But I'm too tired and too scared to deny that it's true. I see her nearly every day. Sometimes, especially after more than a few drinks, we'll even talk. What's weird is that her presence seems normal now. What could be normal about seeing your dead sister's ghost walking around in your house? Though, I'm not even sure that she is a ghost. I think there's a chance that she's always been there, but I just couldn't see her.  I wish I could ask her what's going on. I wish I could ask her for help in closing whatever I opened by going back to that town. But I can't, because aside from being dead, she's just a normal four-year-old who doesn't know much.  "Marissa, where does your daddy work?"  "He makes the Monster 'Messanin' at the fac-tor-y. He makes the Monster Messanin!"  "What's Monster Medicine?"  "Um. It's a messanin."  "Do you take Monster Medicine?"  "Yes."  "Why?"  "'Cause I go to sleep, and I eat the messanin!" she says, jumping on my bed.  [Newport Pharmaceuticals](http://goo.gl/5MeEOf) is still around, by the way. Please don't bother them. I wrote them an email through their website to ask if they'd ever owned a factory or laboratory in Oregon near my town, and I got a response a couple days later saying that they had no records of it. The company has primarily moved to Europe though, and no longer operates near Newport Beach, California or Newport, Oregon (which, to clarify, is not the town I'm from though neither are far away).   So that's a dead end. Again. I'm not sure where to go from here.   I don't know what else to ask her, though. Like I said, most of the time she's mute. Sometimes she's here and other times she seems to disappear. Most of the time, she's sad, and I've heard her crying at night. Physically, she seems normal, except for a long scar on her head where her hair doesn't grow. It looks like I'd imagine a brain surgery scar would look like, but I'm not sure. I can touch her, but she draws away, like the contact causes her discomfort.  Two nights ago, I got back from work after dark, exhausted. I re-heated some pizza and shakily poured myself a drink, sat down and flipped through the pages of Reddit. My eyes were already heavy, and after nodding off on the couch a few times, I got up and started to clean the kitchen before going to bed.  Marissa had shown up, and I could see her pacing in the hall to my left as I faced the sink. I had turned the garbage disposal on and was spraying out the egg shells and coffee grounds from the morning down the drain when I noticed that she had stopped moving.  I finished spraying out the sink and loading the dishwasher, then looked up at her, which made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. She was backed into the corner where the floor meets the wall, with one finger pointed straight out at something behind me.  I slowly turned and like a nightmare you wish you could wake up from, saw a man in shabby clothes standing in the doorway to the living room not six feet away from me. I have no idea how long he was there watching me. He was wet, his long hair and beard were scraggly and matted, with streaks of gray.  I froze again, not sure what to do or which way to run.  Then he flashed a smile, as if he'd been waiting to be acknowledged. I noticed that one of his eyes was pure, milky white. He anxiously pawed at his neck like someone satiating a nervous tic. "You're not supposed to be here," he said, his face sinking into a confused frown.  "Okay, whoah, if you're here to rob me... I don't have much. Take what you want and just go."  "Rob you?" he asked slowly, as if processing each word separately. "No. No, no, no, no." With each word, his eyes traced some invisible thing moving back and forth across the floor. His hand shot up to his neck again. "It's already mine. You're dead." The man backed up through the door into the dark living room and disappeared from view around the corner.  I left through the front door. On my way out, I heard him yell from the living room, "Jesus continued: There was a man who had two sons!" before I shut the door. I called the police from my cell phone, telling them what had happened. When they came to the house and searched it, they didn't find anyone, though the sliding door in the living room was left open.  Then the smelled the alcohol on my breath and began to question me. You could see the exact moment that each officer lost faith in what I'd told them.  "So tell us again what he looked like, sir."  "Like I said, he had gray hair and a beard. Maybe 40's or 50's? About the same height as me, and he had a dark raincoat on."  "A raincoat? What color was it?"  "I couldn't tell, it was all wet."  "It was wet? Is there a river or a lake around here?"  "Um... No. It was probably wet from the rain. Like he walked in from outside."  "Sir, it doesn't look like it's rained for a week here..."  They left pretty soon after that. Finally after triple-checking that I'd locked all the doors and windows, and as many drinks to calm my nerves, I laid in bed. The door opened and Marissa came in, crawling up onto the foot of my bed.  "Who was that?" she asked.  "I dunno. Some tweaker."  She laughed. "Like Tweety Bird?"  "Yeah, if Tweety Bird was a drug addict."  "Oh," she said very seriously, with feigned understanding.  God, I'm so tired. I wonder if this even makes sense anymore.   What if I really did imagine the man? From the white eye to the wet rain jacket... two sons... What if I really am losing it? Or what's worse, what if this is all real? I just don't know anymore.  What do I do now, /r/nosleep?      I don't know where to start. If you haven't read the rest of this series, you may want to do that now, in order for this to make sense. If this even can make sense.  [1](http://goo.gl/mUbcoc) [2](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8) [3](http://goo.gl/Omv2sC)  Last week my uncle, the last living relative I had in my hometown, died. With him gone, the police and other prominent members of the town had me followed away from town. They also took some pictures which had revealed after my mother's death that I had had a sister who died before I was born.  The police warned me not to get involved. They said it would be better if I got away while I still could. They said that the people who were at my uncle's house after his "suicide" were dangerous people. People capable of making someone, a child, disappear.   In spite of that, I had to know. If I'm being really honest, what I wanted more than anything else was to finally put my past to rest. That's the real reason I came back to Oregon after my mother died. The feeling throughout my whole life that the town I'd grown up in was rotten, backwards and wrong.  After I was sure the police had stopped following me, I turned around and came back to my mother's house. I'd been staying there and doing research on the town. I'd started with some of the prominent members of the town and their families.  What I learned is that many of the older adults who "run" the town, from the fire and ambulance services, to the schools, construction, police, commerce, and even the mayor have something in common. They all have past records of being homeless. Almost every well-known person in town that I could think of had something like this. Suspiciously missing from this list was Pastor Charles, the massive man who operated the local church. This wouldn't necessarily mean anything, of course. However, it did seem strange that all these prominent people had come from around the country, and in fact the world, to this one small town and had all done extremely well here.  I began to shift my search to what might have drawn them here. In the 1960's through the 1980's, jobs had been as plentiful as the trees here. Then in the 1990's, those jobs had dried up.  I found a few old scans of newspaper articles from the 1990's (since none of the people who were still here were involved in the fishing or timber industries), but none of them showed any kind of attraction to this town in particular. Good schools, fast growth, but little else. So I went to the library, where they kept a near-complete collection of local newspapers and found a front-page article from 1985, which included a black-and-white picture of a ribbon-cutting ceremony in front of a huge pharmaceutical plant. A man in a black suit who I didn't recognize was holding the scissors in the age-old pose, but it was the people behind him that shocked me. There they stood, half of the people I felt were responsible for whatever was wrong with this town. And my father in a white lab coat.  I went to print the page article and got an error message about paying a fee to the librarian. Stupidly, I went to the front desk. As I approached, the girl working there did a double take, and then slowly got up and walked to the back room.  It was time to leave.  I got in my car and scribbled down what I could remember from the article. "Newport Pharmaceuticals Plant Opens Doors." "55 new jobs." "November 13, 1985."  I'd never heard of any kind of plant near here or "Newport Pharmaceuticals." As far as I'd known, my father had moved here shortly after he was born, and the whole time I'd been growing up, he'd never had a job for longer than a year.  I headed back to my mother's house to see what I could find on the internet. I hid the car as before and walked up to the front. I was walking up the driveway when I saw the neighbor sitting on the front porch. She'd seen me, so I couldn't get away, though she was smiling as if she was happy to see me.  She said she was locked out of her house, and came to see if my mother had a spare key. She must have been going absolutely senile, because she didn't even seem to realize that she hadn't seen me since I was 18. In fact, the last time I'd seen her was after one of my mother's fits when she'd kicked me out of the house. I'd ended up going next door and having dinner. Even though I'd had to sit through an hour of her and her husband tell me about how it wasn't that bad and that I should forgive my mother, the food had at least been good.  I told her that my mother was dead, and she looked so sad. "Oh no. Oh, you poor thing," she said, coming closer with her arms outstretched. I half-heartedly returned the tiny woman's hug, eager to get inside where I wouldn't be seen, when I thought I felt an insect sting me on my ribs.  I went to brush it away, but didn't feel anything remaining on the spot where I'd felt the bite. Then I realized that the old woman was smiling widely again. I started to feel dizzy, and tried to escape back to my car, but before I could even make it off the porch, I was unable to walk. Suddenly, several people came from inside the house and carried me into a car.  They drove me to the lake, and loaded me into a small boat. Two older men, one who owned a furniture store in town, and the other who I'd seen before, but didn't know his name, took me in the boat to the deep center of the lake.  [I don't swim.](http://goo.gl/Rk6nmc) I haven't been able to get over my fear of open water since I was 12 years old, when I saw something terrible lurking deep under this same lake. It was dark now, the only lights were the colored running lights. I fought to move, to fight, to get away, to scream. Anything. I couldn't move. I could barely breathe, my chest felt like it was being crushed. The two men were waiting for something that I couldn't see, and after what felt like an hour, I finally gave up. I felt cold, and tears streamed down my face as I lay in the bottom of the fishing boat.  One of the men broke the silence, "There. Let's do it."  One grabbed my arms as the other grabbed my ankles, and with a grunt, they heaved my body like a bag of cement over the side of the boat.  I know that I drowned. I felt every second of it, clearly as I am sitting here typing this out. The fear forced the precious air out of my lungs and I sank, serene and peaceful, down into the black.  Inside my mind, a primal panic broke loose again, creating chaos but my body remained motionless. The last thing I remember was the intense pressure, and the sensation of losing consciousness.  Then, impossibly, I woke up. It was almost like going through a door, on the one side was one world, the world you feel when you're awake, the "real world." And then on the other side, I woke up into a completely different world, in a different place. I wasn't in the lake any more. I stood up in the middle of an empty house I'd never seen before. There was enough light to see around myself, but it didn't seem to be coming from anywhere, like maybe I was glowing.  I walked from the living room into the dining area, which had a large table and was set for seven. I heard a sound, like a child giggling and small footfalls coming from the doorway on the other side of the room.  "Hello?" I tried to shout loudly, but no sound came out. I ran through the doorway into the kitchen, and heard more footsteps sounding like they were going upstairs. I ran after the sound and came to the top of the steps. The door on my right was open slightly, and I could hear a child laughing and talking on the other side. I pushed it open slowly, and there sat my sister who I'd never known, playing with a pair of knitted dolls. She like she was about four years old, just like she'd looked in the pictures I'd seen of her.  She looked up at me as I walked in with a big, sweet smile and then held out one of the dolls for me to take. Jesus Christ, I got down on the floor in that dark, otherworldly house and played dolls with my dead sister.  Then the sound of a door opening and closing came from the bottom of the stairs. My sister looked sad. "You have to go," she said. "I hope you come back. I don't like it here. He's not nice."  I tried to ask her *who?* but still no sound came out. Heavy steps were coming steadily but slowly up the stairs.  The bedroom door opened, but all I could see on the other side was blackness, then a huge, bone-white hand shot out of the darkness, grabbed my whole head and pulled me through the door. I woke up in the lake again, able to hear something crashing through the brush on the banks. I dragged myself onto the shore, and heard a woman's shrill voice yelling "Oh thank God, you're alive. Are you okay?"  The woman's name is Nicole. She took me out of the lake and to her small house in the woods near the lake. I'm alive, and feeling better now, thanks to her. I don't know what to think anymore. Tomorrow, I'm leaving the state and going back to my old life. I think it's clear that what's going on here is beyond me. If any of you have any idea of what's going on here... please, help me.  I should never have come back home.  EDIT: Linked the story of why I don't swim in that paragraph.  [Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP)   When I was young, my friends and I would play hide-and-seek in the woods near our houses. The "woods" were actually an overgrown, undeveloped lot surrounded on all sides by residential or commercial areas.   Let me tell you, I was the *KING* of hide-and-seek. I hid in the same spot every day, but no one ever found me. See, most people thought that the woods had always been overgrown, but one day I crawled on my stomach to under a thick patch of brush and cam face-to-face with a tombstone.   [Original Post](http://goo.gl/mUbcoc)  [Update 1](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8)  This morning when I finally reached town, I noticed a squad car tailing me. It followed me all the way up to my uncle's house on the southern edge of town. The police officer never turned their lights on or anything, but it wasn't exactly trying to be subtle.  I parked in the driveway, and stayed in the car. The squad car parked behind me. Two overweight officers got out and slowly walked over to flank my rental car. "Good afternoon!" said the officer on my left. His voice was young, causing me to do a double take.  "Ryan?" I said.  "Hey Adam." He said sheepishly. Ryan and I had been in the same class in school. We weren't close friends, but when you've known someone through 12 years of school and grew up in the same small town, you get to know them.  "Listen, Adam. I'm afraid I've got some bad news."  My uncle is dead.  Ryan and the other officer who I didn't know both tried to stop me from going into the house. They said it was suicide. He hanged himself in his bedroom. I told them that all my belongings were inside the house, and firmly told them to let go of me.  Ryan told the other officer to wait while he escorted me inside. In the living room, there were several people, a few who I could recognize. The pastor of the local church, the old lawyer, and a few other people I knew from around town.  As soon as he saw me, the pastor came over to me and Ryan purposefully. "Adam. You really shouldn't be here right now," he said.  Just looking at him, made something rise up inside me. Learning about Marissa yesterday, and having this hostile greeting today... The fact that all these people had suspiciously shown up here at my uncle's house, and now I wasn't allowed. I opened my mouth to tell them all to get the fuck out, but thought better of it. I didn't need to get off on the wrong foot with all these people at once. "I'll just grab a couple things and go," I said, and walked purposely toward the second bedroom that I'd been staying in.  Behind me, I could hear the pastor whispering harshly to Ryan.  Once in the room, I shut the door. Quickly, I threw my few clothes and belongings into my backpack. Clearing the small desk, I noticed the plain envelope that had contained the pictures from the night before. It was empty.  I searched around on the floor and under the bed when I heard someone open the door. It was Ryan. "All right, Adam," he said, "you ready?"  I looked at him, taking in his expression, and sizing him up. Who the fuck could I trust anymore? "Something is missing," I said flatly.  "Sorry about that. You could try asking the people out there if they've seen it. But..." He stepped inside and closed the door behind him. "Adam, they want you *gone*. I'm not charging you with anything, but they're starting to whisper that you had something to do with your uncle's..."  "What?"  "Hey I'm not accusing you of anything, like I said. But I think you should get out of here. Now. Leave town and don't come back. These are people you don't want to get mixed up with. Dangerous people." His face was deathly serious as he said these last words.  Someone knocked on the door and started trying to push Ryan out of the way.  Pastor Charles was a huge man. He must have been about 60 years old now, but I can still remember him closer to his prime playing sports with my father when I was much younger. It was as if every aspect of himself was hand-picked to make him physically imposing. He stood at 6'6" and wrapped in muscle. His customary black suit was fit him like he'd been poured into it. As a kid, what had scared me the most about him had been his left eye, which was pure milky white and completely blind. He pushed his way into the room, and reached to grab my arm.   "It's time for you to leave, child" he said, staring at me intensely at me with his one good eye.  I told him to get off of me and stormed out through the living room. The people there had all joined hands, with one opening presumably left for the Pastor.  Ryan's squad car followed me a few miles outside of town before turning back. This whole thing has me really scared.  What was that? Is this how law enforcement usually handles a suicide?  Maybe this was stupid, but I went back to my mother's house. I took another road that skirted the edge of town so that any police that were posted on the highways wouldn't see me. I drove by once to check that no one was there, but with my deep tire tracks and disturbed gravel still there from when I left, I was fairly certain that no one had been there since that night.  I hid the car on a side street and walked back. In the afternoon sun, the house didn't seem as menacing. I opened the front door and quickly slipped inside before anyone could drive by. The carpet in the living room was still dark and smelled strongly of mildew from the spill, the TV screen was still broken and gaping. Everything looked just like I'd left it. I shivered as I looked at the spot on the couch where I last thought I'd seen my mother.  Maybe I'm crazy, and maybe this won't help. This might even be a really bad idea, but I just need somewhere to think. I've been feeling like there's some kind of purpose for my coming back to Oregon. Like something drawing me here. Maybe it's Marissa, or maybe it's my mother. Either way, I'm not taking any action just yet. I'm going to spend a few more days here to see what else I can learn about my sister and my uncle's death.  I can't just run away from this. Not yet.  EDIT: Sorry I can't update any of you now. Since I got here, I've been feeling sicker and sicker. I slept feverishly all night and day today. Feeling too weak to even do anything else. When I'm back on my feet, I'll clue you all in on what I've turned up in my search of the town's history. Unfortunately it's not good news.  [They Tried to Kill Me](http://goo.gl/luAfwb)  [Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP)   [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xlpn8/come_back_home/)  Sorry for not updating you sooner. As some of you know, I recently came back home to the Oregon Coast because of my mother's death.  Last Thursday I went to her funeral. The service itself was somber and... respectful. My mother had made very few friends in her life. Not that her family had ever mistook her for a friend.  The next day, we got a call from the elderly lawyer who was handling her estate. As I said, apparently I was named for something in her will, even though she had said I would get nothing. That afternoon we met with him in his small office.  "Thanks, gentlemen, for coming in today. I called you in to discuss the last will and testament of the deceased Rachel Smith. Henceforth referred to as 'the deceased.'" What followed was a listing and rather boring conversation about the things that my mother had owned. I sat awkwardly, feeling out of place wearing torn jeans and hoodie in the lawyer's clean, new office. Even worse, was the nagging thought that had my mother not hated me, I might have been the one having this discussion right now instead of my uncle.  "Finally, Mr. Gray." The lawyer said, continuing his drone.  "The deceased has specified that you are to have this." The lawyer pulled a plain, white envelope from his folder and placed it face-down on the table in front of me. "This concludes today's business." He read off of his notes, showing an expression of surprise that it had ended so abruptly, checking the back of the page, as though he had expected to go on quite a bit longer. Then he looked intently at the envelope and at me, then to my uncle. I could be wrong, but I thought he looked nervous at whatever was in the envelope.  Since I wasn't sure what was going to be inside, I stuffed it into my wallet without looking at it. If it was a message from my mother, I didn't need to be getting emotional here, in front of anyone and everyone.  I fell asleep in my uncle's truck on the way back and had a vivid dream. It's a dream I'd had before, when I was young. It starts out with a faceless marionette in one of those little curtained booths. The puppet looks like it's trying to talk to me, only I can't hear, like I'm deaf. It looks over it's shoulder and turns to me like it's pleading, but I can't help it. Then my mother's face lowers from behind the curtain on the top, with a huge smile.  I woke up as my uncle pulled into his driveway.  I waited to open the envelope until after midnight when my uncle went to bed. Inside were four faded pictures of a girl I'd never seen. She looked to be about four years old. The first two pictures were of her walking outside. The third was of the little girl on a stage of some sort. The last picture made my hair stand on end though, because it was the little girl being held by my smiling mother and father inside the first house I ever lived in.  I flipped back to the previous picture, and recognized the stage as being from the church that my father had taken me to as a child. In the background, you could just make out other children standing in a row, their parents behind them.  I focused on her face, her blond hair and blue eyes. She looked so much like my mother. Like me.   In my head, I heard the small voice that had whispered in my ear my first night back home.  "Unwanted."  In the corner of my eye, I saw something move in the shadows. I jumped off the couch and turned to face it. My uncle was standing there frozen.  "Adam." He said. I could tell in his eyes and tone of voice that he knew what I'd seen.  "Who is that?" I asked, the fear and hurt tightening the muscles in my throat.  "Adam, I'm so sorry. Adam, I want you to know... I thought they should have told you. I tried to tell your mom. She wouldn't listen to me though."  "Who *is* she?" I asked again, louder as I held out the pictures.  "Her name was Marissa. She's your sister."  "What?"  "She died before you were born. Your mother... She threatened everyone so that they wouldn't tell you. She tried to act like it never happened, that Marissa had never been alive."  Hot tears stung my face now. I'd known my mother had been crazy, but to have had a *sister*, and to have had the whole town cover it up. I looked at my uncle, ready to scream at him, but then I saw that he had tears in his eyes too. His expression was so guilty. So sad. You could tell that he thought he deserved whatever I could do.  I deflated, sitting back down on the couch and dropping the pictures onto the ground. He came and sat next to me, and wrapped his arms around me.  Today I drove to see her grave.  Marissa Gray 1984-1988  The grave site was almost two hours away from the the town we lived in, the graveyard where we'd buried my mother three days ago. It was inside one of the largest graveyards in the county. A simple granite plaque, just one among hundreds. It took me most of an hour to find hers.  I stayed for a while, just staring, wondering what my life would have been like had she not died - wondering whether I would have even been born. I put off getting back in my car. The truth was out now, and eventually I'd have to go back, knowing that everyone in my small hometown had been carrying a secret - keeping it from me. A thousand little uncomfortable silences and awkward stares started to make sense.   A dark cloud moved in front of the low sun and shot a chill down my spine. You know that feeling of being watched, even though you *know* no one is around?  With that, I figured it was time to leave, and briskly made my way to my car. As soon as I turned the key in the ignition, heavy rain started to pour down.  *Oregon*, I thought to myself.  On my way back West, the rain got worse as the sun dropped behind the hills ahead of me. One thing about this area, is that it's full of back-roads. One wrong turn and you could end up 40 miles in the wrong direction. Even though I'd driven this road dozens of times, before long everything started to look unfamiliar.  Wherever there weren't trees overhead, I had to slow down to a crawl just to see the road through all the rain. I came around a turn and out of nowhere, I saw something huge in the middle of the road. I slammed on my brakes and turned the wheel, and skidded off into the gravel shoulder. Behind me, in the middle of the road I could just make out a pair of traffic barriers.  I heaved a sigh of relief that I hadn't crashed and reversed out of the ditch. My headlights illuminated a wooden sign on the side of the road that just said, "Welcome to," which stuck me as being really unusual.  I stopped at a bed   breakfast not far up the road from there to ask for directions, but the owner kept smiling and seemed so happy to see me (and was so bad with directions) that I decided to stay the night here instead.  At least they have free Wi-Fi.  Tomorrow I'll go back and try to find out more about Marissa. I don't think this is done yet, /r/nosleep. How does a person convince a whole *town* to not tell them about their family? About the people they grew up with?  I tried calling my uncle, but he didn't answer. I think I'll try to get some sleep and head back in the morning.  EDIT: Left the B B early... The whole place smells like no one's actually stayed there since the 90's. Also, I didn't really feel like eating breakfast with the overly excited caretaker and his I'm-going-to-steal-your-kidneys smile.  I ended up having to take the long way, since the closed road to the south actually leads to the highway. Weird thing is that when I was almost to Veneta, the road was closed on the East side too. Like all of Veneta's been closed off. GPS is jumping to random locations, so I'm going to have to try to find a way around on my own.  Before the sun came up, I kept thinking I was seeing kids on the side of the road, but as soon as I would look at them, they weren't there. I just stopped to write this update when I thought I saw a little girl behind me in my rear-view mirror. Creepy day today.  [Update 2](http://goo.gl/Omv2sC)  [They Tried to Kill Me](http://goo.gl/luAfwb)  [Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP)   My mother is dead.  Dead people can't hurt you.  I keep telling myself this.  Yesterday, I arrived back in my home state of Oregon. Early this morning I drove from Portland back to my hometown.   I'm from a small town - one of the many fishing and logging towns on the gray coast. Towns that grew like ripe fruit, healthy and strong from the surplus of jobs and profits reaped from the beautiful surroundings. Eventually, when the fish were hunted to the brink of extinction and the logging industry was cut down at its base by new legislation, those towns rotted.  Everything was still there, from the schools, roads and businesses to the people who'd flocked there for a good job and the chance to raise a family. Only now, with the money and main industries gone, all those things shriveled, dead on the vine.  When I was ten, my parents divorced. I spent half my time with each parent, trading off every week. I basically had two houses, but I never stayed in one place long enough to feel like I had a "home." Neither parent was meant to have a child, and this was apparent in their treatment of me. After their divorce, each parent made their best attempt at pretending that nothing had ever happened.  My father was in-and-out of work constantly, and never held any one job long enough to settle down. Eventually, I think he just couldn't take it, and after school one Friday when he was supposed to pick me up, he wasn't there. I never saw him after that.  I spent the rest of my time there with my mother, who hated the responsibility of having me there. Unlike my father, she had a job and could afford to buy a small manufactured home near the lake that she loved. That house was her baby, set up just the way she'd always planned it. I wasn't part of that plan.  I slept in the "guest bedroom" and kept my clothes in a suitcase. I wasn't allowed to listen to music that could be heard outside the room or watch movies after dark. She had always been adamantly against having cable.  Things in the house had to be set back to exactly where they belonged as if I'd never touched them. On multiple occasions, when she'd had friends over, I'd been locked in my room told to never make a noise, or sent outside to the garden shed without lights or power so that her friends wouldn't have to "put up" with me.  As soon as I turned eighteen, I got the fuck out of there and never looked back.  Then last week, I found out that she'd died.  That's why I'm back. My uncle was the one who wrote to let me know. He encouraged me to come to the funeral and, he said, to collect something that was in her will. I still don't know what it is. She made it clear to me more than once that I wasn't going to get anything when she "keeled over."  The funeral isn't until next week, but I felt compelled to stay in my hometown for a while. For a long time it felt like I'd never be welcome back. It's weird, seeing how little the town has changed. All the same little shops and stores are in all the same places. At the grocery store, I saw a few people that I went to school with. Things here seem like they haven't changed at all, they've just gotten older.  My uncle owns my mother's house now. He hasn't decided if he'd rather sell it outright or rent it out as a summer home. He told me that I'm allowed to stay there as long as I'm in town. It kind of made me wonder why we weren't closer while I was living here.  After the sun went down, I drove out to her house for the first time since coming back. The feeling of driving was so strange after being gone for so long. I felt like I still remembered every corner and sign and bump in the road from before I'd left, like I'd only been gone for a weekend instead of five years.  I got to the house and pulled into the gravel driveway. Headlights illuminated the prim garden, wooden privacy fence and the brick red and white house. I left immediately.  I was so filled with anger and sadness at being back in that place that I almost couldn't stand it. I drove to the nearest grocery store and bought two six-packs of beer and a bunch of junk food.  I drank one beer in the parking lot before driving back, and another in the driveway before getting out of the car. I opened the fence, averting my eyes from the tool shed and without questioning it, took the key from the hiding place on the porch and opened the door to go inside.  The house was exactly as I'd last left it. I knew it would be. Everything in its place. I put away my food in the empty fridge and pulled out my laptop. The internet was still up. I went into the guest room and set up up on the desk there. I almost closed the door... five years ago I would have had to, but I thought better of it and left it open. No one was left to upset now...  I spent a few hours alternating between Netflix and Reddit, finished the six-pack and ate half the junk food before I felt my eyes begin sagging.   From the living room, I thought I heard the high-pitched whine that the tube TV made when it was turned on. A couple of seconds later, the hiss of static gradually met my ears. I could see the faint light from the TV shining down the hallway.  My heart was already pounding in my chest, but I had to go over and see what was going on. Trying not to make any noise, I got up and went into the hall. I could see the TV now, the screen a million bouncing points of light. I crept toward the living room, and right before I entered it, I saw her there. My mother. Sitting on the couch I could make out her shoulders and the back of her head.  The strength went out of my legs and my chest froze, unable to even pull in a breath. I couldn't look away. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but no lack of belief would make it disappear. It seemed that reality itself was broken.  "No!" I tried to shout, but only a faint sound came out. The static on the television, the only source of light in the room, began to pulse in rhythm, as if the sound had fallen into it like a rock into a pond. Each ripple dropped the room into almost total darkness, and the sound of the static seemed to come from all around me.  I turned back, to try to escape down the hall, but the instant I looked back, all the doors slammed shut. I looked back to the living room and I saw my mother start to turn her head to look at me. The light from the TV faded to a single point, as if someone had turned it off. Then darkness.   The sound increased to a deafening roar, like a waterfall. It increased until I thought my ear drums might rupture, then immediately, as if it had been muted, it stopped.  In that small moment of silence, a young female voice from the darkness right behind me whispered, "Unwanted."  The sound erupted forth again, and the lights that I'd left on earlier came back blindingly bright. The television exploded, and a  huge torrent of water burst forth into the middle of the living room, full of fish and lily pads and other leaves and debris.  I sprinted for the front door, slipping across the wet carpet, ran down the steps and into my car.  I'm writing this from my phone in a hotel room. I've got no idea what the fuck that was or what to do. All I know right now, is that I can't go back to that house.  I've got exactly one piece of comfort right now. And that is that my mother is dead.  Dead people can't hurt you.  I keep telling myself this.  [Update](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8)  [Update 2](http://goo.gl/Omv2sC)  [They Tried to Kill Me](http://goo.gl/luAfwb)  [Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP)   I grew up in Oregon, right on the cold, dismal edge of the Pacific Ocean. Fifteen minutes in any direction would take you to a beach, an open expanse of sand dunes, a National or State park, or one of about a dozen permanent lakes. For years, every summer we'd go to a family friend's house to use their lakefront property and their dock. Looking back it doesn't seem like much, but I can remember spending countless hours there swimming, kayaking, paddle-boarding and snorkeling.  When I was twelve years old, I refused to go again. I hated the lake, I hated that house. I had nightmares for years and never explained to anyone why it happened.  I still don't like to talk about it. Whenever I do, I feel like I can smell that lake again. People don't realize, but lakes are dirty places. Animals piss and shit and die in them, all kinds of plants rot on the surface, people dump their garbage. There's so much water that stays clear that people think that it's clean. It's not. All the lakes I've been to have a certain *smell* like they're not totally pure.   This lake - *my* lake - slowly developed a smell like death.  That sounds dramatic. It's not like you could just sniff the air and think "That's death." No one would have gone to the lake if it had been like that. It was just a subtle thing that you caught a whiff of once and then it was gone. Maybe you looked around you for a dead fish or squirrel or something and then you forgot about it. I probably only noticed it was getting worse because on most days I was there from sun-up to sun-down.  The dock our friends owned was a simple hand-built thing that involved Styrofoam and treated two-by-fours. A few times it had come loose from the rope that held it and had drifted across the lake. It sat sandwiched between two bigger and more impressive boathouses. As you faced the lake from the shore, the boathouse on the right was freshly painted bright red and housed a small white fishing boat. A simple pulley system allowed the boat to be lifted out of the water while it was stored in the majority of the year when it wasn't being used.  We never saw inside the boathouse on the left, and we also never saw anyone use it. It was made of plywood that had once been painted dark green, though years of weather had warped the edges of the wood and it had shed about half its paint. That summer when I was twelve, it disappeared and we all assumed that it had just been torn down so that it wouldn't be such an eyesore.  That summer was the first one that I got really into snorkeling. I had explored the surface of the lake many times before in a boat, but that summer, I got to see a whole other world hidden below the surface. My friends and I caught salamanders, built things out of cinder blocks on the sandy bottom  and found everything from fishing lures and golf balls to pieces of old boats and docks from the past.  As you might have guessed, the lake was pretty small but it was frighteningly deep. Huge trees would fall into it on occasion, become waterlogged and would turn vertically with only their roots or broken bases poking above the surface. A swimmer drowned there once and even though they used scuba equipment to try to find the body, it was never recovered. At a depth of about ten feet, the water was already as cold as it was in the winter.  At about fifteen feet, it was dark enough that a thick forest of weeds were able to grow on the bottom. Beyond was just cold and darkness.  My friend and I devised a plan to use an upside-down plastic barrel full of air and a boat anchor to allow us to dive much further than we could while only holding our breaths from the surface. We'd go out to the dive spot using a surfboard, then, with the barrel covering our heads and masks, we clutched the anchor and jumped off, quickly sinking to the bottom of the lake. You basically dove blind, since you had the bucket over your head. We could go far enough that the pressure would compress the air in the barrel to half its original size. All we had to do in order to surface was to release the anchor, and the barrel full of air would propel us quickly to the surface. Then we'd reel up the anchor with a rope and start again.  This was fun for us to see how far we could go, and we got pretty good at it. The only bad times were when we would land in the deep weeds, which instantly tangled around our legs and ankles. We never got seriously stuck, but it would freak you out when you were expecting to land with both feet on the sand and instead landed in the weeds.  On a successful dive, you could see about five to ten feet in any direction, and looking up, you could see the outline of the sun, and the long shadow of the surfboard.  The last time I ever dove into the lake - the last time I ever swam in open water - was when I found the remains of the neighbor's boathouse. It was the first dive of the day, and we had paddled the surfboard straight out from the dock, a bit further than we normally did. It was about 10:30 am, and the water was still slightly cold from the night before. I put on my mask and snorkel, put the bucket over my head and curled my legs around the anchor like normal. This day, my friend had brought his father's underwater flashlight, so I readied that as well as the bucket above my head and took the plunge. I remember falling a long time. *Too* long, because the pressure was pressing my mask against my face uncomfortably, and the air in the barrel was compressed to smaller than I'd ever seen it. The rope, holding the anchor pulled taut, and I almost lost my grip.  I don't believe in the little voice inside of a person that tells them the difference between right and wrong. I did, however, experience a very loud message from inside myself telling me that this was not a place I should be. It was too cold, too dark, and the pressure crushed in from all sides. It wasn't the first time I'd realized the absurdity of our little diving system, but it was the first time that it had struck me as being truly stupid. My body gave me the message loud and clear that I was an idiot, but my curiosity ultimately won out. Just a quick peek.  I lifted the barrel above my head, and got my first sight of how deep I'd come. I was suspended on the rope between a gradient of gray/green above me to only blackness below. If I could have looked at myself from the outside, I'm sure I'd have resembled a worm on a hook.  I had to let go of the barrel with one hand in order to grab the flashlight tucked into my swim trunks. The air in the bucket strained to float up, and the container tipped at a dangerous angle, but the bubble of air, being so compressed, stayed intact. I clicked on the flashlight, shining it down right in front of me.  The thin beam of harsh white light sprung into existence like a camera flash, and what I saw there...  People.  Pale faces through thick, motionless black hair staring up at me from inside the remains of that old green boathouse, flipped upside down or fallen apart. They were there, right below me.  I screamed, and dropped the flashlight at the same time as I kicked off from the anchor. The barrel started pulling me up to the surface, faster and faster. In a complete panic, I thrashed my remaining arm and legs in order to try to go faster. I had expelled all my air and I felt like this was the moment I was going to die.   I felt sure that they were right behind me, their pale hands inches from my ankles. From one moment to the next felt like an eternity. The end of the rope fell past me. *Ten more feet.*  *Nine.*  *Eight.*  Fire in my empty lungs.  I don't remember breaking the surface. I do, however remember being on top of the surfboard, alternately breathing so hard that I couldn't cry and crying so hard that I couldn't take a breath as my friend pushed my to shore. Once I reached dry land, I left without looking back.  I felt then that it was so crazy, that I couldn't tell him, or my parents or anyone. There were people down there, not living people, but dead ones, with empty eyes, staring up at the gray, faraway surface. They must have been weighted down, or restrained. I don't remember.  What I do remember is that as the flashlight fell into the weeds, it shone on the most horrible part of all. The legs of one of these... things had been roughly sewn together to create the image of a grotesque mermaid, including a large and elegantly shaped black tail.  For a long time after that incident, I tried to pretend that it hadn't happened - that I hadn't seen what I thought. Trees, or logs, not twin female bodies. A patch of sand through the weeds... *Anything* to not have to accept a reality that that scene could exist in.  As an adult, I've had to accept it. I still see it in the dark. I can't escape it. I've realized that whoever owned the boathouse, must have been *experimenting*. The swimmer who disappeared was probably one of those victims. I don't know who the other woman might have been. Somehow, the bodies would have to have been preserved. The only evidence of decay being from the eyes, which still stare at me in my nightmares.  I'm still torn between wishing I'd investigated and learned more about it, and wishing to hell that I'd never, *ever* seen it.                  I never knew too much about Gary. He just never acted in a way that made me wonder about him personally. Perfectly uninteresting, I guess you could say.  I remember when I met him. Gary Sheffield; 27 years old; a Bachelor's in Business specializing in Accounting from a small university; 2 years of experience as a secretarial assistant; hobbies included hiking and photography.  Pretty ordinary, on paper at least. Gary was the first assistant I'd ever had since I started my own business. Gary was on top of things. He seemed to know the ins and outs of the business better than I did at times. He built rapport with our suppliers and customers, always seemed to know how to set up my days so that I'd feel productive but not overworked.  I loved Gary as an extension of growing my business and my dream. To me, his enthusiasm every day reflected the positivity of my own success. Maybe that's why I never got to know him. I never even asked him about the single picture of his wife he kept on his desk. Ask me on any given day, and I couldn't even have told you if she had blonde or brown hair or what she looked like. Just a person in a green sweater.  Then one day when Gary came back from taking a week off, unshaven and disheveled, I started to worry about him. His work performance tanked too. I caught him napping at his desk, which I guess was the straw that broke the camel's back. It wasn't even just Gary, I'd had a bad week - fighting with my wife and an increased workload meant that I'd been sleeping at the office more nights than not... but he didn't really deserve to be sent home. I never even asked him how he was.  After trying to call him a few times that night, I finally looked up the address he'd listed last year on his resum. 150 Halcourt Drive. I typed the address into my phone's GPS when I got into the car. It pulled up directions for Halcourt drive, and I took off through the heavy rain. 20 minutes outside of town, I found myself on a gravel road in front of a closed iron gate. Closed, but not locked. There wasn't an intercom or bell in sight. There weren't even any lights out here.  I went inside the gate, sloshing through the deepening puddles in a grassy field, unable to see anything except for outlines of bushes and rocks in the corners of my vision. Then, about a hundred feet in front of me, I saw a small orange light coming from a single window. I changed course and headed straight toward the small cabin, but slipped on the wet earth and caught my shoulder on a huge rock. Some yard I thought, as I stood up, rubbing my shoulder. Finally I remembered that my phone had a light on it. As the LED lit up the rock that I'd fallen on, my breath caught in my throat.  Rose Sheffield   1986 - 2011   I will never leave your side. There will never be another.  I quickly turned off the light. A tombstone. His wife's tombstone. Oh my god I thought. That poor miserable boy.  I had to go see him. I had to apologize. Whatever I could do for him... I was prepared to do it.  I walked quickly up to the cabin and knocked on the door. It wasn't latched, and the rickety door was pushed open from the single knock.  Inside was a single room with a bed, a toilet, a camera on a tripod, a girl in a green sweater chained to the floor screaming and a hundred pictures pinned to the wall - a hundred different girls in green sweaters.            Hello. I own a Dell XPS 14 laptop. I don't know very much about computers... but a few weeks ago three of the function keys (F4, F5, and F6) stopped working. All the keys around them work without problem. I tried messing with it a little, updating BIOS chipset drivers, etc. and after calling Dell, I sent it in to their depot for maintenance.  They said that the spill sensors had been tripped and that I'd have to replace the motherboard for half of what I paid for the computer in the first place!  **TL;DR, My question is:** How do I know for sure whether it's actually the motherboard or just the keyboard that went bad? Obviously money is a bit of an issue. (Isn't it for everyone?)  Thanks in advance!   Hello.

You gotta love that feeling of sipping a delicious hot beverage out of an perfect mug, but what makes *your* perfect mug?               Could be your boss, your crush or a random stranger. Tell me your stories so I don't feel like the only person this happens to.   At work we had an air compressor and hose set up like in the picture [here](http://imgur.com/UIs0nhH.jpg).  At the end of the hose is a partially open valve. The gauge on that valve is periodically calibrated. The gauge built into the air compressor is not regularly calibrated.  The gauge on the air compressor *always* reads higher than the gauge on the end of the hose, no matter what position the shutoff valve is in. There are no obvious leaks in the hose assembly or air compressor.  #1 says that there is never a perfectly sealed system, and because of that, pressure from the compressor leaks out between the gauges and doesn't transfer all the way to the second one.  #2 says that pressure must press out constantly in all directions (Pascal's Law) and that the gauge at the compressor must be off by some amount.  It's on!  EDIT: So the situation is this: Person #1 is running the air compressor and reading that gauge, and 30 feet away Person #2 is manning the shutoff valve and reading the gauge there. There needs to be 75 psi at the end of the hose for what we need it to do. Person #1 cranks up the air compressor to 75 psig, but on #2's gauge it only reads 50 psig. For safety, neither of us wants to exceed, say, 100 psi on the hose. #2 says the gauge is wrong, and that #1 is only actually dialing the compressor up to ~50 psi, but person #1 says that both gauges are accurate and to get 75 psig at the shutoff valve, you would have to exceed the 100 psi limit.

 Obviously we will deal with the aftermath of last season but the producers have said that season 1 was mapped out to much fewer episodes as that's what was given meaning the rest of the season was padded out  So they say that season 2 will arc the entire run meaning it will be less panicked and cobbled together so am hoping for a more cohesive storyline with various arcs and can we get the Court of Owls please?  It would drive the whole thing for me not just this season but following ones as well, they're the puppet masters who will eventually reveal the killers of Bruce's parents    It was Mark Snow who created the original theme so hope he gets a nod in the new limited run, he also did the theme for Millennium...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Snow   Here's my take on his entrance in season 2  He wonders in to Falcone's house during the episode maybe at the end of the first one, he looks around an empty house with a bemused look on his face then he enters Falcone's office with the chair facing the wall  Then all of a sudden, the chair swings around like Blofeld in James Bond, it is Penguin  Zsasz thinks WTF then Penguin grins and begins a sombre laugh  Episode ends  Then next episode, Victor decides not to work for Penguin and goes solo, meaning him against Penguin and Gotham, holy moly   She should put too much pepper in a pot or something with her name being Pepper and how about those plants huh, could we see her mixing some herbs or making potions at some point?   I think Cat is the most obvious as she basically resembles her future character already but we need more Ivy action, she is more intriguing to me   Would be a great little nod to the Adam West series if they put an old rotary bright red telephone somewhere preferably in Wayne Manor  It wouldn't need to be anything cheesy it could be in Bruce's bedroom somewhere as the camera pans across or amongst his possessions   Yeah and him tossing his coin, very homage   Yeah like spike someone's food with poison ivy   We need an extensive archive of all the little Easter Eggs littered throughout the season, I for one have seen multiple bats on buildings and in smoke and obviously in the pilot with Wayne's parents on the floor shaped as a bat, then there's the leaf when Bruce fell down the hill  The Riddler ? on the cup was the most blatant one and there's the Killer Croc reference when Bruce was sketching in the book  Then the collage of Arkham that Pengy did had the speech bubble saying oink   Yeah but less Cat and more Pepper   We really need the original intro, titles and theme for the limited run if it is ever going to be worth watching, some half assed modern version will not cut the mustard with fans  We need this...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbBX6aEzEz8   I sure hope they give her far more screen time next season as she has barely been noticeable in the first season and the young actress Clare Foley is a great choice, very creepy but strangely alluring for a kid but largely under utilised  We need to see her pull more pranks and see her back story with her parents and what she gets up to, Ivy has just as much influence in the Batman universe as Cat but it seems Cat has gotten all the attention in season one  	12

I've been having issues logging into the app. I have cleared the login sharing and cache, deleted my account and then re added it with no luck. I've even tried uninstalling then reinstalling the app. Any ideas?   http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1pjr3g/aziz_ansari_black_dudes_are_blown_away_by_magic/   So I bought a couple of bags of fresh cranberries at the market yesterday. I get home, pop some in my mouth and almost hurled at the taste of the wretched things. They were so tart! I had no idea!   Anyhow, I want to make something healthy with them (low in carbs) and was looking for some recipes.   Thank you in advance.   Everytime I buy a certain cheese flavored chip, I am always curious as to the addition of MSG. I know it's supposed to make food taste better but I've never had that chip without it.   Same goes for any product you've tried that was MSG free.          Look, I've tried donotcall.gov, I've tried being nice and telling them to please remove my number from their list. But they're adapting... Like this:  I'll get calls from numbers all over the country, when I pick up they hang up on me. I would ignore them but if I don't pick up they'll call me 4-5 times a day. Just yesterday I picked up and didn't say anything and I could hear a guy speaking Farsi. As soon as I said hello he hung up on me. If I call them back then it'll take me to a rep and when I ask them to remove me from their list they just hang up on me.   I would love to scare the shit out of them or take legal action. It kinda freaks me out when I answer and get hung up on. Can anyone help me?

 Go find the best free games on steam and try playing through them. Or you could try reading a heavily involved book, such as War and Peace.   Rome- Seat of the Roman Empire, seat of the Papacy and center of ancient and medieval Europe.  London- Second city (after Rome) to reach one million people.  Jerusalem- The thousands of years of warfare and religious intrigue surrounding this ancient city are more than enough reason.  New York- A hub of international trade almost since the discovery of the New World, and currently the seat of the UN.  Athens- Less so for being an important city and more so for the scholars it produced, namely Aristotle, Plato and Socrates.

I, Robot revisited?   A Song of Ice and Fire total war would work pretty well too, but I doubt they would be able to get the rights.    Honestly, if you want an emotional roller coaster ride and want an amazing story as well, read the "Dark Tower" series by Stephen King. Make sure you also find some room for "The Wind Through the Keyhole" too.   Maybe that's why GM is in such deep shit all the time.   	23
                         As a part of my get healthy plan, I'm quitting soda completely for a month (I'm only assuming that's how long it will take for me to not crave it, but really I want to quit until it's not something I want to drink every day) and then after that I'm limiting myself to one, per week MAX, whether it's at home, out and about, or at a restaurant. Otherwise my drink of choice is water.  Over the last few months I let myself go and I pretty much stopped taking care of myself and drank a LOT of soda. Before I was always good at drinking it only in moderation but now every time I drink it I just feel like a fat unhealthy piece of crap. So no more soda!  What are some other healthy drinks I can have? I have a hard time trusting anything from a grocery store...everything is loaded with sugars nowadays...   I play WordFeud with my wife because it's something that doesn't really require a huge time investment and we can be going about our daily lives and get notified when it's our turn. then I thought, how cool would it be to have a turn based game similar to Final Fantasy I can play but be able to take a turn and then go about my business. Does such a thing exist?   Today I went to the dentist for the first time in 2 years. I got married 2 years ago and up until a year ago I didnt know I could still be on my parents insurance. After that I just kept forgetting to make an appointment. I hardly ever brushed or flossed my teeth but today the dentist informed me I have no cavities. He seemed frustrated because of my lack of dental hygiene and yet my teeth were perfectly fine?  What about you Reddit?      And I ended up using every single cable   Or did they for some reason remove the option to turn that off from swifkey x?   If so that's annoying because I always end up typing too fast and delete words while I type.         When you click on a link to imgur, if it isn't a link to an album, and it isn't a direct link to the image, I wish that the app would load the direct link instead. Landing on imgur's site on my phone gets annoying a lot.      For me it's the light and fan switch in my bathroom. They are swapped. The fan switch is closest to the door and the light switch is furthest from the door. Since I spend more time in my house than anywhere else, I am now trained to flick the furthest switch to turn on the light and now when I visit friends and family I turn the fan on by instinct because I forget that everywhere else is the opposite of my bathroom.         He said he'd mostly be using his new PC for gaming but he also said he'd be working with things like the CryEngine 3 devkit. I know that the logical cores for hyperthreading is really only useful for encoding, but I don't know much about the CryEngine devkit. Would someone really benefit from the logical cores in the 2600k for that purpose?            And why did they make the chat pad incompatible with the older style headset controllers?   I personally find the headsets to be annoying since the volume and on/off switch have to be dangling I stead of just being attached to the controller. With the newer headsets you have to take your hand off the controller to turn the mic on or off which is incredibly frustrating and distracts from the game. If someone walks into the room and wants to talk to me in the middle of the game I can't just easily turn the mic off.   I'd like to buy the chat pad for messaging but what's the point if I have to use one or the other? WHY MUST MICROSOFT FORSAKE ME SO?   I've tried setting up security on my Buffalo router but it seems like every device I own will drop and reconnect every 10 minutes or so which is really aggravating. I've never had this problem with my wifi being open though. I know I can filter approved MAC addresses but I don't want to alienate anyone who comes over with their phone or laptop and want to use my wifi. I don't want to have to find out every MAC address from people who come over, and not all of them are even tech savvy so that's not the best solution.  So now I've come to want to troll the people who are using my wifi. I don't know who's doing it because I don't interact with my neighbors too often. I thought about setting up something where they can pay $10/mo per computer they connect with that goes to my paypal, but the paranoid in me thinks they will complain to the ISP that I'm reselling their service and have them shut me down.   Another thing I thought of is to change my SSID to "I can see what you're downloading"   I messed around with some of the settings and so far, I've filtered the offending neighbor's MAC addresses so that they get a max of 1500kbps down and 100kbps up. I'm also in the process of setting up access policies for the same MAC addresses to block all p2p traffic and block websites based off of the keywords "porn" and "facebook"  What else can I do that I can chuckle myself to sleep at night?   http://i.imgur.com/95u8q.png   With recent events and certain posts, I find myself wanting to scroll through and find a mod's word on the subject but not all the posts are the color they should be   But I'm drunk and I love the bars we have here. It's always a good time and I love going downtown at night      It seems like everywhere on the internet and out in the real world people always proclaim how amazing that fast food place is. I can understand liking it but anytime someone has a different opinion they are quick to attack it. Why fight over which shitty food is slightly less shitty than some other shitty food? It's all fast food, and none of it is very good. I had it for the first time last summer and honestly it didn't seem any different from any other fast food restaurant. They just have a more "efficient" way of taking orders because they have less items on the menu so people who don't know what they want don't have to stare as long. I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so amazing. I'll cook a burger on my own grill/stove any day.   **edit** Just as I expected. Don't like In 'N Out? Downvotes for you   So that leaves me with the only option of making home-made ranch, because let's face it, the stuff you buy at the grocery store just doesn't cut it. What home-made ranch have you made that just blew you away with its awesomeness?   I always tell myself I need to do this, and I need to do that, but how do I go beyond telling myself? I can never actually bring myself to do it. Every once in a while I am able to get myself to a gym and I find myself actually having a good time cycling or using the elliptical for an hour listening to my music and I enjoy myself, but despite that it's still a struggle to even get that far. I feel unhappy with my life and the minimal things I have accomplished. I feel extremely unattractive, and it doesn't help that thanks to my family's genes, all my fat accumulates in my belly, so I almost look as if I'm pregnant.   The only good thing I've felt that has happened to me in the last couple years is getting married. I love her very much and I couldn't ever possibly see myself with any other woman. Somehow she saw through any physical or mental facade I had and saw the real me. But my problem is I don't even know who I really am anymore. It is hard for me to get out of bed every morning, and if I didn't have any other obligations, I would lie in bed all day. I set multiple alarms for myself and I cancel each and every one when they go off in the morning. Even if the alarm is on the other end of the apartment. I will get up, turn it off, and go back to bed.   I eat unhealthy food and can't make myself eat things that are good for me. I feel like I'm in a cycle of self destruction and I can't get out. It's killing me from the inside but I only keep making it worse day by day. I need help, what do I do?   **edit** Thanks a ton for all the replies guys. I promise that I've read every single comment that was a reply to the post (I don't know if I'll be able to get through all the subcomments). I am indeed a very disorganized person, and people have given me links to places that can help me keep track and help me set goals for myself. The first step I am taking will be to wake up at specific times every day (save for the one or two days a week where I work until 3am). My plan will be to wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and go to the gym. I think I'll also pay for a personal trainer so I can get some sort of workout plan since I really don't know much about the gym and when I go I just mindlessly do stuff with no direction (this will help in the goals department)   spoilers for anyone who hasn't finished yet (why haven't you?)   I just don't see how the "first" crew could have existed once the "second" crew decided not to open the stargate while inside the star. The only reason the first crew ever got sent back 2000 years is because they went through the stargate, so if the second crew coming through didn't go through the stargate, wouldn't the first crew not exist?   Every other subreddit I go to except for this one has both a link that goes back to reddit.com and then another one that goes back to the front page of the subreddit. I'm used to clicking that link to get back to the subreddit because sometimes I enter through comment replies so I have to click on the "my reddits" at the very top and then scroll to r/simcity which is a little frustrating when I don't have to do it anywhere else      I don't have cable TV so I had to find a stream and indeed they are airing 3rd generation Toonami. Dear god don't let this be a cruel April Fools prank   I can't seem to find a relevant law except in vehicles. Either it is legal or bozeman cops are extremely lax about open containers late Thursday, Friday, or Saturday nights   If there's one thing I don't entirely understand in SC4 is having neighbor cities. A lot of people say that the only way to really have a successful city is to have it connected to neighbor cities. I guess I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I can move one city +50 years and the other city sits dormant until I load it up. I just don't understand how that actually benefits me.   Looking to get some paints for my wife's birthday because she wants to get back into doing some painting. What are your favorite acrylic paints and what colors should I get? Any brand I look at I can't find "just red" or similar base colors...my wife likes to mix her own colors rather than buy tubes of pre-made colors.

I was just waiting in line to buy a soldering iron at Radio Shack and when the old guy in front of me got up there he asked if they carried GPS blockers. When the puzzled salesman said no he asked where he could get one but the salesperson had no idea.   Do you think this was an old guy paranoid the government is tracking him every day through his cell phone's GPS? Maybe he read the stories about the FBI putting trackers on peoples' cars and he didn't want it to happen to him?      http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/opinions/poll_af55af34-5f39-11e1-8760-001871e3ce6c.html   I mean Ron Paul isn't perfect but the other 3 are absolutely out of their minds   I have a couple Renegade Ops gifts in my steam inventory and I'd like to trade for something, I don't know what though.   The music. Both Mass Effect 1 and 2's soundtracks have been listened to by me more than any other soundtrack, movie or game. And I'm sure that the music in the third franchise will not disappoint me. I think that they deserve my money. I know there's a whole lot of other shit going on with ME3 and EA, but I hold the value of the music very high, and as such, I will purchase the game, and I will enjoy every minute of music that is heard.   On top of that, Clint Mansell is onboard for music this time around, so it should be interesting. For those of you who don't know, he's responsible for the Requiem For A Dream soundtrack.   http://www.box.com/shared/g7cqtrg51i  The only thing I have to go off of is that the original file name was "The Story" and I bet you can imagine how useful typing in "The Story song" on Google is. I'm just hoping someone else finds this song familiar because I'd like to hear more like it! It has been on my hard drive for years and I still have never heard of a source  I feel like I've looked at every single music related download on TES nexus and I still haven't found it   I wish I had taken a picture of the wire management before. This case has absolutely no cable management features, it was rather frustrating for a young me to get things to look nice. Having a smaller graphics card certainly helps! [Picture of current wire management](http://i.imgur.com/NuWao.jpg) It's not the best cable management but it is pretty much the most I can do. The only place I can hide the un-used cables is to shove them into the 5.25" slots.  [I can't believe how much smaller the 6570 is compared to my old nVidia 7800GT](http://i.imgur.com/Euvm1.jpg). It was always annoying because the power connector faced where the hard drives were and it was an extremely tight squeeze which regularly made maintenance a pain. I will never own another case where the hard drive bays face that direction again.  [bonus picture of my new computer's cable management](http://i.imgur.com/KIzCE.jpg)   http://i.imgur.com/zbhXY.jpg  The 6950 is what's in the PC I just built, and the 6570 is what I just got in the mail today to put in my old PC so I can have HDMI out with audio   Woke up out of nowhere even though I didn't get any sleep the night before. Starting to feel a bit hungover. ffuuuuuuuu  also, still drunk lol   What do you like to drink? What's your favorite alcohol? Do you prefer straight up shots, mixed drinks, or beer? What is your favorite drunk story? Do you drunk call, text, Reddit, or internet?  Auto correct is such a godsend while drunk!  I love fireball whiskey. I bought a whole case of it last time it was on sale. I usually drink whiskey over any alcohol. I hate beer it tastes nasty. I only drink it when I'm drunk enough that my tongue is numb so I can't taste  What do you eat while drunk? I'm quite partial to pizza!  I haven't eaten anything today so I didn't have to drink that much to get drunk! I like it that way. Less alcohol to buy. I'm at the point where my face is numb!  I don't have many stories with me being drunk because I shunned alcohol for a while. But you know what? I don't care anymore. My side job is sitting with a bus driver either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to transport drunk people around. We usually get 70-100 people per night. That job is so easy and I'd consider myself somewhat of a pro at handling drunk people when I am sober, but I love being one of them. Its awesome when I get on the bus when I'm drunk because I dont even have to remember where I live since I'm friends with the drivers.  Thanks for reading this Reddit night crew. I love social interaction when I'm drunk despite being somewhat of an introvert. My wife and my friend and I are about to get on the bus to go downtown in 15 min            Gonna throw it in my old PC with an ASUS A8n SLI Premium, AMD 4200+ X2, 2GB DDR 400. I know it's a little overkill for an HTPC but it was cheap and I had a gift code to use that was expiring soon. All I really needed was a little improved performance over my nVidia 7800GT and HDMI out with audio.  What software and hardware do you guys use for your HTPCs? I was thinking of also getting the logitech RF wireless keyboard that has the trackpad on it for $40   OT XI? :noes::run::greddy:   Now i can't get my OT fix for the night. Guess I get to browse Reddit more :/      I can't seem to ever find the motivation to do anything I want to do. I just waste away and do absolutely nothing. At the end of every day I am ashamed of myself of not setting forth to accomplish the goals I set for myself and I tell myself I will do better tomorrow, and it all begins with waking up.   I want to get around 6-7 hours of sleep, but no matter how rested I feel when I wake up, I still lie in bed, pressing snooze or even setting the alarm to a later time. I sleep until I feel tired from sleeping too much. Any plans that I had that I planned for the morning before I started my day will not get done, there is no time. I feel as though I never get out of bed unless I have an obligation to go to such as work or school. I've tried moving my alarm so it's not next to my bed, hell I've put it downstairs so I actually have to walk down the stairs to turn it off. And what do I do? I climb back in bed and sleep for another hour.  How can I convince myself that going to the gym in the morning is an obligation BEFORE I go to class? I'm overweight, out of shape, unhealthy, and eat only two-sometimes one meal a day. I want to change this. I need to wake up after 6 hours of sleep, I need to go to the gym, I need to eat healtheir, but how do I begin?      Everyone must either use a Bluetooth headset or a dashboard mount to talk on the phone (dashboard isn't really hands free but I'm not complaining)  Mp3 players are still allowed I guess.   Should I bring these? I made them on New Years Eve and they were the most amazing things to have ever come out of my oven so I'd like to make more and share them with the world!   http://imgur.com/l132r.jpg         I gotta say it was kinda funny seeing people complain on Facebook and hearing people complain about it. I had a constant connection all night         I like whoring out the crappy music I made years ago to new people               I got some roasted Almonds from them and oh god they are some of the most delicious Almonds I've ever eaten and I MUST have more!      How should I go about mounting the H80 with this particular case? Should I just take off the fan on the back of the case and mount the cooling reservoir fans there? Or is there something else i should do?

I had stayed up all night finishing a project and came back and slept away the afternoon and the food halls were closed by the time I woke up.  I don't usually like eating by myself at a fast food restaurant, plus I'd rather have been watching TV/sitting at the computer while eating so I got my food to go. When I got to my car I put my food on top of the car so that I could put my soft drink into my cupholder. And there's the mistake I made. The classic "order something to go, and put it on top of the car, and completely forget as you get into the car and drive off" mistake.  Of course I was completely oblivious that I was forgetting something vital to my nourishment that night as I got into my car. Not only until I got most of the way back (just outside of my parking lot) that I realized something had gone horribly wrong. But that's when I spotted it. It was a miracle, a godsend, a grand triumph. Something was flapping in the wind over the top of the spoiler on my car! Yes, you guessed it! It was my McDonalds bag of food! It slid all the way down from the top of my car, and the bulk of the weight got wedged underneath the spoiler only to have the top of the bag freely flap around.  I quickly parked my car and ran back to retrieve my spoils that I had so carelessly forgotten about in my hungry stupor. The very main reason I had left the confines of my warmly flourescent-lit room made of brick and tile. The safety of the carefully selected position of my desk. The blue glow of the lights emitting from my computer tower. Much to my surprise, the food was still very warm, and all items I had ordered were accounted for.  I rushed up the four flights of stairs to my room. Today there was a triumph. I could have lost something vital to my very identity as a human being. I devoured my meal with much vigor. The fact that it was nearly lost to the solid black rivers of transportation that we call roads made it that much more delicious. The events of tonight had truly went better than expected.  TL;DR: I put food on top of my car and left it there on accident. It got stuck under my spoiler and rode all the way home and I didn't even lose a single fry.

Any suggestions?   Obviously, I'm going for a gaming PC, but I also do a bit of music production and would like to do some midi orchestration.  I'm thinking I should get an SSD for the computer, and really my only requirements is that the PC have at least 16gb of RAM.  I don't need any more hard drives other than the SSD, I already have about 10tb laying around. I don't need any monitors or speakers.  Problem is, I don't even know where I should start for the build. And with black friday around the corner, I don't know what deals I should be looking for to get the most bang for my buck   "9-1, undefeated in conference and guess who's playing like a high school B squad? Sad day in Bozeman."   I recently installed the update for the appstore app and while visually the app looks great, it has been a nuisance ever since. It's all in the notifications.   I'm fine with a notification telling me I have an update, but not allowing me to close the notification from the notification bar is just plain wrong. There's no reason why I should be forced to open the app to see that update.   Another notification problem: the app decided to try to download an app/update even though i have it set to wifi download only. But instead of actually downloading, i had a lovely status bar in my notifications that read 0% all day long. Again, no way to close the notification and when I opened the app, it didn't even say it was downloading.   I tried looking in the settings but i couldn't for the life of me find an option to disable notifications. I went into my Android application settings to see if I could just force close the app but even though i kept getting these notifications every hour it didn't say the app was running. That leaves my only option which is to uninstall it which I don't want to do.    Does anyone know how the game is going to be broadcast? We weren't able to get tickets to the game so we'd like to invite a few people to our house and watch it on our TV, but the problem is we don't have Cable TV. Just internet. Does anyone know if someone will stream the game over the internet or if it will be broadcast over the air so I can pick it up with an antenna?               Some friends of mine started up a Red Power/BuildCraft combination server. Both mods work really well together. We were trying to kind of keep the spirit of minecraft but have some improved redstone stuff and basically endgame material. We didn't add IndustrialCraft because it just seems like way too much.  Anyone else use these mods? Have any cool builds you did? Unfortunately I don't have anything to share because it takes a while to get up and running! Though the high amount of gems you can use for pickaxes help a lot! that way you can leave diamonds for pipes and gears   I really think that something needs to be done about experience orbs. When a player dies in SMP it creates way too many floating entities. I just died on a server from a creeper and all the experience orbs just about crashed the server. I had to lag my way slowly over to where the orbs were and sit there for a whole two minutes so that I could pick up what felt like half a million experience orbs. Stuff like this CAN'T be good for larger servers with more people online and possibly more than a few dying at the same time. I was the only one online at the time of this happening, so I can't imagine what would have happened if there were more online.   When there is a lot of experience orbs in one area, they should group together and become one to a few large orbs instead of a ton of tiny ones.   As for how hard this would be to implement? I don't really know, but *something* has to be done because it's a near game-breaking thing.    I'm not always up-to-date on my minecraft news, but has Notch ever addressed this issue? If he has could someone perhaps clue me in?   Rifle Hunting season opening weekend was last weekend here in Montana. I brought my phone with me, as I bring it everywhere, and as I expected, there was no service up in the mountains. I was messing around with it and much to my surprise and enjoyment, I found out that my phone doesn't have an aGPS chip/unit, it actually has a standalone one, so I was able to use GPS Essentials and plot waypoints and see how far they were from my position and all that all without needing a cell phone signal. Talk about nerdgasm! I wasn't expecting to do anything on my phone but play some offline games I had.   Now this leads to the point of this post: what apps out there are good for the outdoorsman who has no wireless signal? I found that Google Maps caches some maps (I presume the surrounding area of wherever you live, as my entire city I could zoom all the way in on in Maps, but my current position was just a blur). But I'd like to go further, is there an app where you can cache maps from google maps, or load other maps into it so I can see where I am via GPS and plot waypoints to navigate through the mountains? GPS Essentials did a lot but I'd like to take it a step further. I'd like to see maps and record where I went and see how far I traveled. For some reason the tracks function in GPS Essentials only records the distance between the starting point and the end point in a straight line, instead of distance traveled.   Another awesome thing I could use is an app where I can load maps that show me private and public plots of land. Sometimes while driving along the road we see something but we don't always know whether the land out there is private or public.   The wife and I are trying to find some horror movies. We always watch the same movies year in and year out during October. It's hard for us to want to stray from those movies and spend money on something that turns out to be a gorefest. The problem for me is that the horror category groups both creepy/scary movies in with slasher flicks. We like paranormal movies, not stuff like Saw. I mean some death is fine but i just don't like movies just full of people dying gory deaths. I want something that will be haunting or make my skin crawl.   Any suggestions?                I saw that this was on the known bugs section for the minecraft wiki. But it seems that of the 3 servers I play on, only the one I play the most on is having this issue. Has anyone found a temporary fix for this?   I made an underground tree farm in a server I play on. I noticed that when one grew, it only had one or two leaf blocks on it. I thought that was strange so I went to walk over to it and I got stuck where leaves usually are. I logged out and in only to find that the leaves did indeed spawn with the tree...but for some reason they were invisible to me. The only way for me to see the leaves to chop down the tree is to log out and in after the tree grew         Usually when i drink with friends I just take a shot here or there but I barely ever get a decent buzz going. So last night was the first night in two weeks I could drink and either not have to sit at home or worry about a ride home so I said FUCK IT. I wanted to take the fast track so i drank 4 double shots of fireball whiskey before getting a ride to the bars.   I had an awesome fucking night and I don't even know why... We barely did anything! But for some reason everything was funny and everyone was amazing. If you can't tell it was my first real time being drunk. I didn't even realizz I was drunk until someone told me I was... I kept insisting I was only tipsy. I also retained the ability to use proper Grammer while drunk texting/IMing    Busy night tonight being it some beer festival or whatever. Last run is gonna be a shitshow   This compilation of mods is super awesome. I had some trouble getting it to run without crashing but it was worth it. Millenaire is one of the best mods i've seen and i don't know how I haven't heard of it til now.   I hope towns in 1.8 are similar to how the ones in Millenaire work or else I might be a tad bit disappointed =/         It seems like every time I have somewhat of an emergency the only thing available is that emergency place that costs a ton of money just for my animal to be physically looked at. At least in Billings I have a 24 hr vet to go to.   For being such a pet loving town, the vets sure aren't very animal friendly...    Not sure if there are any super serious injuries but almost the entire police force has been called down there. Cool car got fucked up and took out a fire hydrant   It's a good thing there weren't people on that corner like there usually are or it would have expected been a real bad ordeal. Happened just now at 110 AM   At almost any time i look at my phone is have a notification for email. It's borderline annoying. I had to turn off sound notifications for it because I get one like every five minutes. I also get annoyed with my Led blinking whenever i'm trying to go to bed. I don't want to turn off notifications because i do like seeing when i have new mail... I just get way too many. Anyone else stuck in this predicament?       I looked through all the daytime routes and it doesn't appear that anything has changed unless it was too minor for me to notice. Maybe times have changed but I don't think so. The only major thing is a couple buses have a half hour service for "peak hours"  Both Upstream and Downtown start an hour earlier each night (Friday and Saturday, and Thursday, Friday, and Saturday respectively). So Downtown runs between 8PM and 3AM and Upstream runs between 9PM and 3AM. Last pickup at the bars is at 2AM. As usual Upstream runs up to campus twice within the last run. Once at 1:50 and again around 2:10 (or however long it takes to get up and drop everyone off and come back)  Downtown's route changed a bit. We do not run up to the Greyhound anymore. and we do not go past Catamount and the First Student bus depot, instead we drive right between Target and Costco. We now drop off right across the street from the side of Wal-Mart instead of by the gas station across 7th Ave. And we now drive past the Filler   Maybe one day I'll see a fellow redditor on the bus!   *edit* Here is the link to the LateNight routes http://www.streamlinebus.com/routes-schedules/latenight-service/   I live in a college town and the city doesn't have any public transportation. Instead we have a bus system that started five years ago that is mostly paid for by tuition and the whole operation is ran by students, aside from the drivers and bus maintenance ... That is contracted out to a company.   Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday there is a bus that runs from 8 to 3am.  Our last run is when the bars close and everyone is drunk and needs a ride home. I keep them under control and make sure no fights break out and take the necessary actions if an incident does occur. I've never had anything I've had to call the cops for though... I've had relatively good luck and haven't had too many rowdy crowds. Once we fit 100 people on a bus that seats 23 to go to a hockey game   I have about an hour to the last run right now and usually this run is pretty quiet so AMA      I was just wondering if anyone else uses an app on an android device for a HTPC.    First i found teamviewer which is awesome for remote desktop which could be useful to me in the future for troubleshooting and also i thought it was damn cool that i could connect to my laptop over 3g to track progress on a download. After this i got the idea that i could use the app as a sort of remote when i connect my laptop to the tv to watch videos instead of having to either get up and lay on the floor to navigate or pill out mt keyboard and mouse and use that on the coffee table. It worked well,  however whenever i would disconnect the application would pop up with a message saying thanks and whatnot. I didnt want to stay connected with the phone for obvious reasons so this didn't work too well.   Then i came across remotedroid which was awesome. Works like a trackpad + keyboard over wifi.. You just start an application on the computer and connect via ip with the phone app. However it gets glitchy every once in a while and i cant seem to get rid of the keyboard without disconnecting from the laptop. The other problem is that i occasionally have to ctrl + scroll up to increase text size on websites to read on my tv from the couch... And that is not possible with this app.   So now I'm wondering... Is there any better apps out there that r/Android can recommend to me?    Not sure where to go with this one...bought a whole 1.75 liter bottle of Jack Daniels and want to make some barbecue sauce...anyone have recipes?            http://i.imgur.com/v1GTb.jpg  My cat got a little too playful last night and bit me pretty hard... For some reason this particular tooth mark is really bad... The others are fine. But this. One has been hurting and swollen since the moment he but me. It's difficult to move my wrist as there is a sharp pain every time i try to use my hand. I asked someone at a pharmacy and he said most likely some neosporin will help it but that was hours ago and it still is swollen and still hurts...    So... Should I see a doctor?    I've been busy this summer with travelling and work and recently I've been getting the urges to start a new Minecraft world....but my only problem is knowing that there is going to be a pretty big update...and I don't want to start a new world now only to have to start another new one when the adventure update comes out...anyone else have this problem?      I keep seeing the same few people posting up here.  It would be nice to have a few more people up here so we can discuss local happenings! Also when is a bozeman reddit meet gonna happen? We should start throwing some ideas out there for meetup activities as well.   Here's a couple:  Bars (obviously... But from another post I read not all of us are of age)   Music on main?   Follow the Pigsty and hang out where they are lol  Hike to the M  Floating the Madison   Fishing trip?    The bozeman guide to drinking post said that montana spirits and wine was the cheapest... Can anyone else confirm this?    I saw them the first week they started up but my schedule didn't seem to meet up with when they'd be out.  Finally got a chance tonight at the reopening of the Rocking Real Bar. It was definitely some good bbq.  Cole slaw on the sandwich and all! I highly recommend to try it out if you like bbq. I'm hoping that this isn't the last food truck that Bozeman will see. I was in California for a couple weeks this month and the food trucks there were awesome and i'm glad it's spreading elsewhere.   If you want to check out their site its at www.pigstymobilebbq.com Follow them on facebook and twitter to find out where they will be!       I'm driving from Montana to California tomorrow. This is my first road trip I've ever taken. What things should I bring that could be useful or potentially life-saving?  Android appa are welcome as well!         When I receive a new MMS with either music or a picture in it, when i view the picture and then press the back button to go back to my inbox, the screen turns white for a second and then goes back to the picture/song. The only way to get out of this is to press the home button..any idea what's up?                        If people come to your door selling magazines in order to go on a trip, and they look around 25 years old and talk about "points". Call the police immediately and tell them the direction they went in. Do not let them come into your house to fill out forms under any circumstance. I managed to get my entire wallet stolen with lots of personal information. I've just spent the last 2 or 3 hours cancelling my cards and talking to the police. They mentioned being in Billings so it seems that they are moving West. I'm hoping that by posting this I can make more people aware and hopefully I'll be able to get my wallet back because it's long gone once they leave Bozeman.   *EDIT* I found a site with pictures of the people going door to door:  http://www.uscctravel.com/sales_team.php    This one is specifically the one that came to my door:  http://www.uscctravel.com/images/emps/chris%20coppick.jpg   If people come to your door selling magazines in order to go on a trip, and they look around 25 years old and talk about "points".

I guess lighting the place up doesn't help, I've been placing torches every 6 blocks, horizontally and vertically. I'm starting to think that right now my best option is to create vertical walls that are just under the width of the screen so that they can't come bother me while I'm working         I was recently talking to someone about spaceship design and we discussed how 99% of all games/tv shows/movies don't portray ship movement right and suddenly I had a moment of nostalgia and remembered that demo of that awesome game that never really got released from so long ago. Nexus was still good but it never lived up to what IG3 was supposed to be and the gameplay felt kindof shallow compared to how complex IG3 was. And if you ask me, even when the demo came out, the game was way ahead of its time, especially in the regard to particle effects    Here are some screenshots: [Image 1](http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/news/03/28/galaxy/andromeda_screen004.jpg) [Image 2](http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/news/03/28/galaxy/andromeda_screen003.jpg) [Image 3](http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/news/03/28/galaxy/andromeda_screen001.jpg) [Image 4](http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2002/news/10/24/ig3_screen001.jpg)     I'm just wondering if anyone else gets in the same nostalgia boat that I'm in whenever I think about this game. It's the same one where we mourn great games that never got to see the light of day. (though this one in some form sortof did). I just tried to install the demo and play it again for old time's sake but alas, the installer won't work on Windows 7 =\  	146
 Within reason of course (i.e. there's a legitimate issue)   I grew up bilingual. So grateful. Definitely gonna raise any kids I may have speaking 2 or more languages.               I definitely prefer Chii's rendition. In general I don't like a lot of KPP's music, save for a few songs. "Fun" is a good word to describe her music in general, in my opinion.    You've given us quite the taxing challenge. How about "Washing"? Could you afford us more characters? This really constitutes a problem...  Sorry I don't have anything better :(    I just found this. imo she sounds amazing! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGPz-tggCIA  And she's hoping to go professional: http://www.gofundme.com/2fubu0  Any redditors want to aid me in supporting her dream?!   Is it better to play someone old, that you've played many times and has had quite an impact on your life, or to play something you haven't played, but you know the franchise, the mechanics, the rough story line etc? Is the (relativity small) novel experience more valuable than the nostalgic experience?   I feel like I should know this, but what's that from?   Obama sucking Hitler      Man, what kind of birthday songs are your friends and family into? That sounds messed up.   They will look up and ask "Tell us about Bryson" and I will whisper "no".    This had bugged me for some time, being a Belgian studying in America. I grew up speaking Dutch and French, so whenever an American pronounces a typical Dutch/French word incorrectly, it gets under my skin.  One recent example is my professors pronunciation of 'apartheid'. In Afrikaans or Dutch it should be pronounced something like 'apart hide', but my profs use the American 'th' pronunciation in the word.  Am I in the wrong here? If no, what are foreign words that get mispronounced that really bug you?      Tough project. You may want to start with a clean slate.     	19

 It actually blows my mind that America was ever close to Pakistan. Popular sentiment in India is probably very pro-American, but is the opposite for large parts of Pakistan.   China is slowly repositioning its economy as it looks like its going for a soft landing -- no way in hell the leaders there will let Russia fuck with its plans. Not only that, but the only friendly connection to Russia is historical. They would lose almost all political support with the world if they sided with Russia. China really wants to prove that it can be a proper world power, not one that is isolated from everyone else. Not only that, but popular sentiment is pro-American.   In that case doesn't that count as attempted murder?   At least some part of the Ukraine government knows how to play the long game. Regardless of the short term consequences, Putin has most definitely lost. In the medium to long term most European and former Soviet countries are thinking twice about dealing with Russia. Expect new oil and gas agreements to start popping up. You have massive wealth loss in Russia. You're starting to get protests in Moscow too. There is no way in which Russia comes out of this crisis in better shape than when it entered, even if it annexed all of Ukraine. When the only people on your side are Syria and Iran, and the people on the fence are having second thoughts, then the geopolitical game will finish you off. It's what happened in the 80s when the USSR finally collapsed (when Middle Eastern oil made short work of the Russian economy), and it will happen again if Putin continues to put his short term pride over long term prudence.   Nokia too. AFAIK there was also some kind of weird tax break and they actually bought the company out at a huge discount after the first announced price.   I've mentioned this in a few threads now, but wanted to point it out again: this plane was communicating with the satellite for much longer than anyone thought. Wasn't it supposed to land at 8:30am in Beijing that day? It was still pinging when it was supposed to be in China airspace! The fact that it can fly for six hours without anyone noticing blows my mind.   Look at that quote: "According to the new data, the last confirmed communication between the plane and the satellite was at 8.11am (Malay time) Saturday 8th March." That thing was in the air for a *long time*. AFAIK, it might have still been communicating with the satellite when it was supposed to land in Beijing! AFAIK the transponder signal was flipped off at ~1-2am, which means this thing was in the air for a solid 6 hours without anyone noticing.   Man, this guy is slower than Shatner.  Edit: Holy fuck, this guy just said it was still communicating with the satellite at 8am.   It could be that something went wrong for the hijackers and they were dumb enough to not have a backup plan. So they tried to fly it somewhere else and ran out of fuel.   No kidding. For the sake of comparison, my friends who did not graduate from a top-tier law school are having problems getting by while paying off their loans. Not to mention some of them who graduated without offers were pretty much completely fucked.   The problem is making those student loan payments with a "small" job. There are many people who come out of law school without offers from a firm, and barely scrape by trying to make payments.   It is antagonistic and stupid when all it takes is a simple 5 second google search for "Glyphosate". Some people refuse to be open minded and just yell out "source?" when they in fact are just too lazy to do their own research.   I wouldn't be worried about them dropping Drive, but Google has a track record recently of limiting integration with other services.   Have you tried fetching data from it though? I've had friends who tried to do a restore and they said it was really slow.   The problem is with zoning laws. Unless you are living way out there, it is unfortunately very difficult to get a development made out of shipping containers even if you are in the suburbs.   What is the endgame there? Let's say there was an actual hostage/ransom negotiation that the Malaysian government was involved in. The longer they keep this from the public, the worse they will look in the end.   With regards to #2, it's really hard to land a plane anywhere in that part of the world without anyone noticing. It's one of the most populated regions on the planet.   Yes, but I don't think shooting at a tweaked out road rager would be a good idea. Unless you're a professional and can take him out with the few bullets that you have, I think you'd just enrage the driver more and get run over.   I'd get one for the rear view too!   We try to communicate with these animals because they're at least genetically similar enough to share some behavioral traits. We're genetically 70% identical to zebrafish, and much closer to the animals you mentioned. Given the fact that life likely started at completely disparate times in the Universe, it's likely that the genetic/"functional" difference between any extraterrestial and us would be like how we look at E. coli.   Your mortgage is my monthly rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in the Bay Area.... :(   I played up to a few levels into the Arson stage. The game is just incredibly repetitive, with interrogation options that make no sense. Gunfights were a total joke too. The voice acting is pretty decent, but the plot was basically going slower than molasses.    Inland crash would come with fire and smoke, which would be easy to spot  by air or satellite.   I think it's more useful to look at effect size, in conjunction with p-value. This is a "non-drug" based approach to cancer therapy, with a good number of patients achieving remission. That kind of change in survival is practically unheard of for 99% of cancer drugs in Phase 1.   Not to be too much of an optimist here, but even for a Phase 1 trial full remission is nothing to sneeze at. That's a gigantic effect size, considering that most drugs only extend survival by months to at most a year. I haven't read the full details of this trial (or much about it in the literature), but if we can get cancer immunotherapy to work on solid tumors then it is definitely game changing.   I second that. Dry ice can last a long time in a covered (not sealed) styrofoam container!   What about used lab equipment on places like LabX or laboratory surplus stores?   Man, there are tons of Canadian racists in this sub-thread. Kind of shocking. I grew up in Alberta so I thought I've seen everything too.   By and large first-generation immigrants (especially labor or service work) do not mix well. These are the ones who come to Canada to primarily have a better life for their children. Canadian children born to immigrant parents generally do much better at integration, end up being well-educated, and have much better economic outcomes compared to their parents.   I'm a Canadian living in the USA for the past 8 years.  Let's be fair here: when stratifying by ethnic groups, standards of living in Canada are by and large **much** better than the USA. It's not even a fair contest. Crime rates in Canada are downright laughable compared to the USA. It is true that jobs are segregated across racial lines but that is changing a lot as the children of immigrants get out of college, start second-generation families, and compete with white folk for top-tier jobs.   With respect to the first point: how do you think the World Cup is going to be? I was a little apprehensive when they had it in South Africa but that ended up being pretty much okay.   My current girlfriend always compliments on my "bone structure". She was talking about my face and not my penis, but to this day I don't really know what she means.   I asked my girlfriend recently about whether she likes forearms and she said "What? No, that sounds ridiculous." Not sure if it's as common as the internet makes it out to be...   Not to mention that in many European countries, children are "tiered off" at an early age into brackets that determine your future career. Movement between these tiers is extremely hard. But in this way you game the "Math and Sciences" exams because the students who take them are already selected to be smart.   Can you use this to install Google apps such as Hangouts? I desperately depend on a hardware qwerty but I use Hangouts a lot to chat.   To be fair, not all of us who favor intervention are in favor of military action. There are a lot of steps to go before you send in soldiers. Fundamentally I think the notion that another country's problems are not our owns is somewhat racist. It's like saying their own problems are not worth addressing. There are non-profit programs all over the world that work in health and education and people support the development of these infrastructures, but as soon as civil strife and violence comes in everybody throws their hands up and says "not our problem" when civil society is one of the most important aspects of ensuring day-to-day stability. It's like saying that these other countries aren't "good enough" or "civilized enough" to join the world society at large.   It's ridiculous, really. We expect college students to be able to plan out their lives in **freshman/sophomore** year and criticize them for choosing the "wrong" major, but we pretty much give every adult a pass when they have to make the same choice.   No way, China knows not to fuck with the US. Going SE into Asia is a bad idea when there is a SK/NK conflict going on, because that would mean a two-pronged war at their doorstep. Three-pronged, if Japan decides to jump in for fun.   Let's be fair here -- they removed Russian as an official language in the East on the first day of the "new" parliament, which prompted massive protests. Many cabinet members in the current government were part of a far-right nationalist party as well. The ethnic tensions go **both** ways.   How do medical professionals protect themselves from this kind of thing on a daily basis? Do doctors and nurses get sick more often compared to the general population?   Palo Alto is a disaster in the summer time. There's no central AC anywhere and apartments boil.   Too late, some aspiring screenwriter probably saw this and is writing a script now.   I think this is great news, and validates a few things: (1) viral load is a pretty good predictor of infectiousness, (2) basic molecular biology models of the disease hold up: if you have low levels of the virus, you're not going to infect another person, (3) heterosexual couples where the male is HIV+ could easily bear children who are HIV-, and (4) if this study were expanded to more people and longer time points, ART could essentially eradicate HIV over time regardless if couples have sex with or without condoms. HIV+ patients could possibly lead even more normal lives than previously thought.   Also easier to reduce tax breaks for gains from real estate, or heavily tax people who own multiple houses (not multi-unit apartments) with high net worth.   Perfect example: the Philippines. I think I saw an article about how a naval ship was using the power plant on board to generate fresh water for people.   A coffee maker is too inconvenient, and the water doesn't get hot enough to extract nice flavors. Here's an easier method:  1. https://shoponline.melitta.com/items/COFFMKRSPROVER 2. Boil water 3. 3 Tbsp of coffee 4. Pour hot water onto grounds. If you are really fancy you could pour at a constant rate like those hipsters do. I just fill it to the top because I don't care. 5. Drink. Throw away filter.     If people start starving like in Soviet times, they will most definitely revolt against him -- that time wasn't so long ago.  Edit: not to mention that the internet makes a lot of propaganda completely useless, especially in the big cities that matter (eg. St. Petersburg and Moscow).   So, if an eagle decides to fuck you up, what's the second person gonna do? I'm pretty sure that it'll still end badly.                  I'm looking for one to do microfluidic mold prototyping, as it looks like the cost and turnaround time would blow current methods out of the water. The only issue is that a lot of 3D printers have poor resolution. I'd like to use one that has resolution in the 10-100 micron range. Are there any in the market that can do that? The height of the layers should be in the same range too. Price isn't really an issue, but I'm hoping for 10k if that's possible.  Edit: price is not really a concern -- it's going into a grant application anyway so other things can be budgeted accordingly.      Obama is eager to fly drones and do airstrikes in an easily radicalized region and provoking extremist groups, but doesn't want to touch a region that only "has a potential" for future radicalization. I'm not saying he should bomb or invade Syria, but Obama doesn't seem to be interested in anything beyond waving a finger in their direction. There is a lot of room for diplomatic work but we haven't seen anything substantial for the past two years. What gives?               Here's my favorite: not practicing proper hygiene in order to "train the immune system". That's not how it works...            The Pathogenic Role of Intestinal Flora in IBD and Colon Cancer Author: Rescigno, Maria Source: Current Drug Targets, Volume 9, Number 5, May 2008 , pp. 395-403(9)  http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cdt/2008/00000009/00000005/art00007  The intestine is populated by a large variety of microorganisms that colonize the host soon after birth. The gut microflora contributes to several intestinal functions, including the development of the mucosal immune system, the absorption of complex macromolecules, the synthesis of aminoacids and vitamins and the protection against pathogenic microorganisms. Its composition varies along the different segments of the gut, with a gradient from the stomach to the colon where it is more abundant. Given the vital relationship between the microflora and the intestinal function, it is important that the microflora is kept continuously under control so to preserve gut homeostasis. When this is not achieved or perturbed, several immune disorders can arise, like allergies or inflammation. Protracted immune deregulations can also lead to severe disorders including diabetes, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is therefore crucial that the immune system learns both to tolerate and to control the growth of beneficial microorganisms so to preserve the intestinal homeostasis. The mechanisms that are in place to achieve this control are not yet understood but recent work has started to unravel the complex relationship between several players including the microflora, intestinal barriers and immune cells. In this review we will analyze how the microflora interacts with the host and how deregulation of this interaction can lead to inflammatory disorders and eventually also to cancer.   I eat at least 2-3 cups of cereal for breakfast, so I tend to go through a box every 3 or 4 days. I typically eat the healthy kind too (eg. multi whole grain flakes) so it's become a non-trivial cost. Does anyone have a good recipe for homemade cereal flakes? I'm not a big fan of granola (scratches my mouth too much), and the recipes that I've found online look like blogspam or haven't had much of a discussion about taste/quality.   Honestly, I'm pretty good at cleaning a room but the thought of dusting something has never occurred to me. She mentioned something about some kind of spray and a towel? What am I supposed to be wiping? And the fan in my room is absolutely caked in dust -- how do I clean that without spreading dust everywhere? Also, my down duvet spreads little feathers everywhere and I don't have a good way of wiping those off surfaces.  TL;DR - Girlfriend wants me to wipe down my room and I don't know how. Not a euphemism!   I'm going to be buying a new notebook pretty soon, and I'm torn between getting a beefy one with a decent graphics card versus an ultrabook/ultraportable. Most of my time is actually spent doing academic work and doesn't require much graphics muscle, but from time to time I like to play the occasional video game. I'm also pretty tired of turning my graphics to low and 800x600 resolution just to get a playable framerate.  Enter Onlive. Can I use this with a decent academic internet connection, and will it play nice with integrated graphics? I'm also worried about any latency issues too. The great thing about it is that I can play pretty much any game I want without worrying about system requirements. The problem is that I haven't read many recent reviews since its initial release nor have I read many anecdotes about whether the service is any good...   Fabrication of polypyrrole micropatterns through microchannel-confined electropolymerization and their electrical conductivities    Electrochimica Acta, Volume 54, Issue 17, 1 July 2009 , Pages 4253-4257   Yiqing Lu, Guangxia Shen, Chongjun Zhao, Shouwu Guo  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468609003405  "Creating micropatterns of electrically conductive polymers on solid substrates is important for the low-cost construction of organic microelectronic devices. This work develops a novel strategy for the preparation of large-area polypyrrole (Ppy) micropatterns through area-selected in situ electropolymerization of pyrrole within microchannels. The effects on micropattern formation of electropolymerization procedures such as dynamic potential polymerization (DPP), static potential polymerization (SPP), and constant current polymerization (CCP), the solvent, and the polymerization time were studied systematically. The electrical conductivities of the Ppy micropatterns were measured and compared with a homogeneous Ppy thin film synthesized under the same conditions. Given the straightforward and versatile nature of this method, it is expected to contribute greatly to the convenient fabrication of low-cost organic microelectronic devices."   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927775700008219  by M.E. Karaman, D.A. Antelmi, R.M. Pashley, Volume 182, Issues 13, 30 June 2001, Pages 285298  "The adsorption of various carboxylic acids onto alumina substrates has been studied as a model system for the study of the long range hydrophobic interaction. The adsorption was studied using classical adsorption isotherms, contact angle measurements and colloid probe atomic force microscopy. Carboxylic acids form esters with the hydroxyl groups present on the alumina surface and produce surfaces with a range of hydrophobicities and stabilities depending on the acid's functionality. Hydrocarbon carboxylic acid adsorption was found to be adequately described by the Langmuir adsorption model and produced stable surfaces of varying hydrophobicities which resisted dissolution by water. By comparison, hydrophobic surfaces produced with fluorinated acids adsorbed from aqueous solution were not always stable, although their stability was greatly improved when the chemisorption was carried out in a non-aqueous solvent at elevated temperatures. Adsorption of these fluorinated carboxylic acids produced the most hydrophobic surfaces. Interaction forces between alumina surfaces coated with adsorbed propionic acid were as expected from DLVO theory with no evidence of hydrophobic forces."     Way back before Ron Paul became a candidate to be taken seriously (think Election 2008 and before), he was pretty much loved by Reddit and especially on r/politics. Since then the subreddit became a little too spammy for me so I removed it from my front page, but I decided to check it out again because of the coming election. How does the community feel about him these days now that he's been given much, much more airtime to voice his platform (especially during the debates) and is being substantially less marginalized this election?    You know what I mean -- a protocol isn't working, and you google it online. The results are pure garbage. I would imagine that this would only be useful for grad students, which would clear out all the undergrad homework help threads. Also, I think it would be great for just general suggestions/advice for good control experiments/help with data analysis. Of course, a lot of the threads can't be too specific because of publication concerns, but I think that we can keep it solidly based on methods help. The only issue is that a subreddit like this would need lots of people....         It's becoming clear that the current patchwork of deficit reduction and continual small scale stimulus isn't going to turn around the economy. Corporations are hoarding profits, maximizing productivity from their existing staff, and minimizing new hires. The United States is getting their asses kicked by globalization, especially in terms of manufacturing. It is inevitable that several industries that we take for granted in this country will cease to exist in a decade's time. If you were the President of the United States, what policies would you implement to create job growth and transform this country?         Some posts (like the Oslo one on the front page right now) deserve to be on the top spot for a day or two. Yet, it will fall off the front page because of the post's age. How about a separate voting scheme of whether a post stays "stickied" at the top or not, or at least a modification of up/downvotes so that a submission's lifetime is higher?         I haven't gone out to see the fireworks in years, and last time was at the Hatch Shell (which was an... interesting... experience). Does anyone have any protips for the holiday? Some friends and I are heading out to see the fireworks but I don't really want to head down into the Esplanade. I've heard the Longfellow and Harvard bridges are good but crowded. Is it as bad as they say or does it get better if you walk closer to the middle? Or is there somewhere else that works much better?   I've been thinking of setting up Sharepoint Foundation or Office 365 for my lab, so that we could collaborate on paper writing, data sharing, internal wikis, etc. We already have a wiki set up for things like lab inventory and scheduling, but currently document writing is still a huge mess where we email back and forth drafts and get confused over the version number. Office 365/Sharepoint Foundation sounds like it might be a good fit because it hooks directly into Word (some people in our lab are not so tech savvy). The only problem is that there is no way to try those out before we take the plunge (Office 365 would work out to about $100/month and the beta is ending in a day or two. To use Sharepoint Foundation we need a beefy computer and that costs some money too). Are there any alternative solutions we can try out? I've thought about using Office Web Apps for collaboration, but many of us don't have/want a Windows Live ID and Google Docs is sorely lacking.      Hi everyone! I'm part of a Harvard graduate student science outreach club that hosts a lecture series on current science topics. Tomorrow we're going to be hosting a seminar on the origins and applications of pluripotent stem cells. In the past two lectures we've had we had amazing attendance for topics such as sleep and black holes, so this one should be good too! Our lecturers are given by Harvard graduate students working directly in the field. Given that reddit is a pretty science-friendly crowd, I figure that I should at least give a shout to my favorite internet community. :)  The lecture is happening tomorrow, June 1st, at 7pm at the Harvard Department of Chemistry Pfizer Hall (12 Oxford St).

The entrance is at the very end of the building on the right. Hope to see you there!!!   Hey, thanks for those who did come out to the one we had two weeks ago on Black Holes (http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/h1no2/event_free_harvard_science_lecture_on_current/). We had about an attendance of 60+ people from the Boston community. This week we're going to talk about a topic that is dear to everyone's hearts: sleep. How does sleep work? What benefits does the brain gain from it? Do we need it?  As said in the other topic, in full disclosure I'm part of the organizing committee on this event and I thought it would be fun to spread this out to my favorite internet community, in which I've laid the smackdown sometimes (fine, occasionally) on r/science. It's a completely free lecture, no registration required. We're a Harvard graduate student organization dedicated to science outreach for the general public. Our website is https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/.  Event Details: May 18th at 7pm, at 12 Oxford St. (Harvard Dept of Chemistry). You have to go in the side door (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=s_q hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 ll=42.376998,-71.115961 spn=0.001286,0.00284 z=19 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=12,5.93,,0,-5.69) at the very far end of the building to the right. Full directions are at https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/directions/.  Hope to see you there!!   Hey Redditors! We (Science in the News, a Harvard grad student science outreach organization) are hosting a spring lecture series on current science topics. The speakers are all young graduate students and the lectures are geared for general non-specialist audiences.   The first one is on May 4th (this wednesday!) at 7pm, and is going to be on black holes. It's being held at Harvard's Department of Chemistry at 12 Oxford Street. Our website is at https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu and you can find the full details and schedule there, but I can also answer any questions. Hope to see some redditors there!  UPDATE: Hope to see some of you tomorrow! Here are the directions: https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/directions/ and the building is the one on the right hand side: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=s_q hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 ll=42.376998,-71.115961 spn=0.001286,0.00284 z=19 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=12,5.93,,0,-5.69   So my girlfriend (also a redditor) is looking to buy a new laptop. We agreed that it would be easier for me to post this since I can better explain her needs.   She's looking for a laptop 14" and under that is pretty durable and can be taken around a foreign country while she does fieldwork (non-technical) on a semi-permanent basis. Basically, she is just using basic office applications and watching hulu or dvds or video chatting when she has free time. I've recommended the Lenovo T420 or T420s to her because it has a good balance of both mobility (weight and battery life) and durability. I've also considered the Macbook Pro 13 or the Macbook Air 13 but the issues with those are the poor screen resolution in the former and price of both. Because she will be doing fieldwork it would be hard to get service for it at an Apple store but Lenovo has pretty extensive worldwide support. Also, I question the value/struggle of learning a supposedly easier operating system when she has other more important academic matters to deal with. Are there any other computers that I have missed, or should I go for any of the computers that I've mentioned (Lenovo and Apple)?   For example, chemistry has many top-notch journals that accept one or two pagers for work that is short and sweet. Why isn't this the case in biology? I understand the need for publishing a complete story (see: Cell), but even Nature and Science publications average 3-4 pages and should really only be for your career's best work. The whole spending your whole PhD/postdoc hoping for one big publication isn't very sustainable in the long run, so why do journals keep perpetuating this problem?   I'm not exactly sure how this would potentially work, but for really long multi-levelled threads that stagger back and forth it's hard to see who is commenting to what. It would be nice to have a little icon on each comment that you can mouseover to see what the immediate parent is. Of course, it wouldn't be very useful to see what the parent's parent is, but it would be better than nothing.   Also, I plan to keep this laptop for 3-4 years. Is there any point in getting the accidental or extended warranties?  Edit: I plan to go with the business line laptops.      Okay, so I have practically zero experience on this kind of thing, due to a very small amount of partners in the past. But my girlfriend really loves it, and I want to make it great for her too. I'm pretty bad at it, partly because I feel that my tongue has no strength at all and that I'm not sure what/where it should be doing. It's also pretty short, compared to Caucasian tongues (I'm Asian, and yes, feel free to make all the jokes you want...). Lastly, I don't know what to do about all the hair that's there since I really have to get in there for my tongue to get any access. She keeps it trimmed but it still gets in my mouth sometimes (which I figure is unavoidable).   I want to get some Canadian Ice Wine for my girlfriend's family when I visit them (in Ohio) at the end of the month. Is there a place that sells it in the area? I think I would also have luck at a generic fancy wine store in the Boston area. It has to be accessible by public transit though, because I don't have a car and it's too fucking cold to walk. :(      I thought my entire life that this was normal, but apparently a lot of people don't suffer from this! Basically when I wake up in the morning (in addition to no cognitive abilities), I have no strength in my hands meaning that I can't even open a bottle of water if I'm thirsty. Can't grip doorknobs, etc. This also happens when I find something really funny or when I get tickled (I also get lightheaded and dizzy from tickling). Can anyone relate to my silly disorder?   Those World Cup fan threads have made me wonder: Eastern European women are pretty good looking but many suffer from middle age burnout. Is there an equivalent for our beautiful friends to the south?   For example, this reddit submission: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bphq8/school_sex_education_about_breast_sizes_what_you/   Or would the universe just implode?   In a post-Bush world, I think the American public will be more resistant to these changes. Who or where should the average person go to in order to voice their concerns? Something has to be done about this bullshit theater of security.      Seriously. What gives?                    	107
                An odd, iridescent material that's puzzled physicists, 45-year physics mystery shows a path to quantum transistors for Post-CMOS Era in next-generation Electronics.                     The 3D printing materials market size in terms of value is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20.4% between 2014 and 2019 to reach$1.052 million by 2019.                                                                                                   See how world's big leader laugh?         Mutant-like superfast wireless connectivity in Australias European-styled city of Melbourne               Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds could be used to construct vital components for quantum computers. But hitherto it has been impossible to read optically written information from such systems electronically. Using a graphene layer, a team of scientists headed by Professor Alexander Holleitner of the Technische Universitt Mnchen (TUM) has now implemented just such a read unit.            These materials are predicted to show a phenomenon called the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, and belong to a class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides, with layers a few atoms thick. QSH materials have the unusual property of being electrical insulators in the bulk of the material, yet highly conductive on their edges. This could potentially make them a suitable material for new kinds of quantum electronic devices.      Commonwealth Bank of Australia will get early access to developments made in this highly technical field, quantum computing. The centre for quantum computation and communication technology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) aims to make the manufacture of quantum computers increasingly viable by 2018.                  We can continue this development towards 2017, we will put ourselves in a great position to challenge for the 2017 World Cup title                           The list details 400 cities, suburbs and towns across Australia where homes and businesses will be connected to the network by June 2016 - or 100,000 connections per month.

Philip Nelson, EPSRC chief executive, adds that the hubs "will draw together scientists, engineers and technologists from across the UK, who will explore how we can exploit the intriguing properties of the quantum realm". He adds that "The area offers great promise, and the hubs will keep the UK at the leading edge of this exciting field."

 To put it bluntly, no. Your laptop has a built in GPU ('graphics card'). That slot can be used for external wireless cards, tv tuners etc.   I'm looking for one that has a display port input as active adapters are quite expensive. Any ideas?  Edit: Want to use eyefinity in the future so the display port saves me the cost of adapters. A monitor with both display port and dvi is ideal.   Have you set the power control settings to -20 in the Catalyst Control Center?    MW3.... Burn it with FIRE!         Someone was obviously living there, that's what you were hearing.

 She hasn't been exsanguinated nor given Digitalis. Hopefully she'll be alright and this has nothing to do with the Eve's.   I'd certainly read more!    That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Thanks for sharing with us, OP, and I hope things have changed for the better for you.   Tell your brother the truth. Tell him about the picture, the woman in the kitchen, remind him of the heavy breathing. All of it. It isn't fair for him to think he's crazy when you know the truth.   Thanks for clarifying that.  Can I ask though, now that it's done, have you got any clarity as to why you did it?     Is the mark in the same place your wife's cancer started? Did she lose her hair during treatment?   You ok OP?   My mom does that too.   She'd dump out my cup of freshly made tea and put the cup in the sink, then complain about how many dishes I've left, or take all my shower stuff out of the basket I have in there, and replace it with hers, then act oblivious when I ask where my stuff is. The best though is when she takes a bag of my laundry to wash with hers when I'm busy, and then SWEARS she can't find any of the items that were in that bag. Which I then find in her room. My whole life has been spent looking for my stuff she refuses to admit she moved/lost.   Was she.... your sister? What?    Nosleep = crack. Even when I want to stop, I can't.   I'm sad this was removed!  But on a better note, I won this game this morning! Had a hair elastic in my hand while sitting in bed, don't remember setting it down, found it underneath my pillow!   Edit: Did you change the clock on my stove? I reset it after a power outage and the next day it was 11 minutes off. Second edit: 3:49 am. Have lost my cellphone 3 times now, twice found in bed, once in bathroom. Bunch of Chrome tabs I don't remember opening. I promise to never notice you again.   North Wales Hospital right? I've read about it. Are you alright? Did you get into the burned out bits or just the stuff where they were trying to convert it to apartments? (Stupid plan, eh?)    Upvoted cause my black lab named Abigail and I are seriously curious about this.   I... don't think so. I feel like an idiot having done this but all the randomly capitalized words ends up being: ssmrtwdmhwhhttiiattttoatfohotujoto. Which I think is nonsense.   What?   This is seriously my favorite thing on the internet.   Just a suggestion, please format the conversations a bit better. I want to read it but I can't follow the huge block of text. :)   I think something is up but I can't place exactly what it is, it's just a feeling plus Steph being M.I.A. The dog I have no explanation for. It's only when we put Jake in his room though. Not any other time.    No worries friend. I've got a grown man snoring on one side of me, Jake is asleep on the other side with every blanket on the bed on top of him, and the dog is on my feet. I've had to read my replies 3 or 4 times to check for typos, EVERY time. I think we may go stay at my dad's for a bit. He lives out of the city in a pretty quiet spot (thankfully with wifi.) I've got a few days off coming soon and Win has some vacation time still.    Hey folks. I wasn't sure where to post this but figured here was a good start.   Suffice it to say, my son is 7 going on 8 and he has been through a traumatic event. Could this be causing him to regress in certain aspects but not others?  We practiced extended breastfeeding and he weaned at around 3.5, with the odd nightmare or stomach bug bringing him back to wanting to nurse up until about 5. He's an articulate kid so he understands why I'm  not allowing it now and he can communicate his desire although not necessarily his reasons.   I'm just wondering if any other EBF mom out there has dealt with something similar, and what you'd suggest I do in this situation.  Thanks in advance.   Ah okay I get where you were going with that. But no, poor guy just seems to have shit luck. I had one miscarriage before Jake, his next girlfriend had one and left him shortly after, and Steph's had two previous to this pregnancy.    Something IS off.  I wish I could put my finger on it so I could describe how it feels here or all of /nosleep could just be here for a day to feel it.   Like Win even brings Jake to see me when I'm working because it's this tight chest can't focus kind of desperation and general wrongness. Left over anxiety maybe?    As for Win being involved... He has the kindest and gentlest soul I've ever met. He loves Jake and I so much and he is such a genuinely good man. I trust him as much as I trust myself. I can say with certainty that he isn't involved. His only flaw here may have been withdrawing from Steph the way he did, to be with Jake and I.   Not much but a small update added.   Tiny update added.   Op deleted their account, what do we do now?   Update us again soon Op! Stay safe.   If I went into my mom's room upset about knocking in the middle of the night, she'd tell me it was gas and yell at me for waking her up. Stuff like this is like 90% of the reason I got a dog.    Your writing is beautiful OP. I'll be checking for updates!   Oh. My. God. I was picturing Animal from the Muppets the whole time I was reading. Lol.   I was picturing Animal from The Muppets.   I haven't got much reason to suspect her but I feel the same way. What if A: She was involved or B: Something happened to her. But at the same time, she told Win she was pregnant and then he moved in with me cause our kid was missing. I would be peeved too. Either way though Win is trying to get in touch with her family to see if they know where she is. I'll update this post when/if I know more. Edit: Typo   Part 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2g328t/jake/ Part 2/3: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gfo97/jake_update_2/   Part 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2g328t/jake/ Part 2/3: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gfo97/jake_update_2/   Final Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2h0kgp/jake_final/   Final update: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2h0kgp/jake_final/   Hey nosleepers! Sorry this has taken so long. A lot of things have happened.  Jake, Win, and myself, are home and healthy and safe. We had a few cops hanging around for a while but it's all finished now.   The security guard from the hospital? He took Jake. He left the box of things for us to find. He came into our home while we were gone and took those things back after a set amount of time. I only got to keep the key card because I had Jake's keys with me when he came here. He did the same to the families of every woman we found in that room, only they came alone. I would have ended up as his next victim had I not brought Win with me.  He would take the child, keeping them alive and well, dragging them around with him as he planted clues, and then he would sedate them when the mother got close enough to find them in the room. If the mother came alone, he would sedate her, kill the child, and move on to the next victim. He was looking for someone to win his game. I guess he was looking for me.  According to the police, his home was full of pictures of me. Some taken from my Facebook page, some he took himself from short distances while I was out or working, dating back to the time I was volunteering at the hospital. It seems I was his end target. He had deemed me smart enough to win.  The hospital has been shut down now, the guard is being held in a secure wing at the forensic hospital, and my life is going back to normal.  No one has heard from Steph, her things are gone from the apartment she shared with Win, her phone is disconnected, and were moving on. Win, Jake, and I, are going to be a family like we should have been. None of us can stand being apart. As Im typing this, Win is sitting on one side of me, Jake is asleep with his head on my shoulder, and the dog is asleep on him.  Everything is going to be okay. I just wish we could find Steph.   Update: (I know I said this was final.) ___________________________________________________________________________________________  I just wanted to let everyone know Jake is doing great being home with us. He doesn't even really seem freaked out about what happened. He says he knew we'd find him, just like I knew he was okay. I swear this kid and I have some sort of telepathic link. #momproblems. Win hardly leaves our side. We've decided to keep Jake out of school for a bit until things calm down so I'm down to part time hours at work and I'm homeschooling him. All three of us sleep in my bed every night with the dog. We tried putting Jake in his own room last night but no one could sleep and the dog wouldn't stop freaking out so we brought him back in with us and everything was fine  On the Steph front, there hasn't really been much. Win has been in touch with her parents but they haven't heard from her since Jake went missing. Her phone rings straight to voicemail. I thought I saw her walking by across the street from my work the other day. I was out smoking on the front stoop at sunset, which is of course the least conducive time visibility wise, but I would have sworn it was her. I yelled her name a few times but she didn't look up. I guess it wasn't her.  Win has thrown himself into being Jake's dad and being here for me. I know he's still shaken from Jake being missing and I know he's terrified something's happened to Steph and the baby. A lot of the pregnancies Win creates seem to end in miscarriage. There are just a lot more questions than answers right now.  I'll keep updating this post until I run out of space.     I'm Canadian! Born and raised.   No idea! The redditors don't like me. :( I added the second update to the third one and the final one will be up in a few days! Edit: Link http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gfo97/jake_update_2/   Fixed the problem. Update was added here. :)   Sorry for losing you with this one. The update has been located and added to this one to make reading it easier. The post keeps getting taken down.   I had a hard time getting that one to stay up so I added it to this one.   Stay safe OP. Bottled water for a while and be mindful of what you eat. Keep us updated!   First Update:   After spending nearly half the day yesterday between the ear drum shattering roar of Wins straight-piped Integra, and telling people over and over about my missing child and begging them to put up his missing posters, Im exhausted but somehow still too wired for sleep. We didn't find anything new. The map is missing. I swear I had it in my wallet and now it's gone. I'm sure I set it down somewhere and forgot it. As with most missing posters, a phone number, mine to be specific, is on the bottom of the poster we've been putting up, asking people to call us if they have any information. I've had a few prank calls, a few well-wishers, and way too many false sightings. But tonight I had a different kind of call. Tonight a man who said he was a security guard at the mental hospital left me a message telling me he could help me. My phone didn't ring, but somehow between checking it at Tim Hortons and checking it again about 15 minutes later at home, Id had a call. Now, this hospital is nearly abandoned. I mean there might be 50 patients left, all long term residents with nowhere else to go, no doctors on staff, nurses and CCAs take care of the daily work and a Doc visits once a week. I used to volunteer there a few years ago, reading books to patients. I dont remember this particular security guard but I was only there for a few hours a week so thats not all that strange is it? Anyway his message said to give him a call at 5am when hes on break so thats what Im going to do. On the way home earlier I had thought the radio was talking about missing kids in town but after frantically fumbling at the volume knob and nearly knocking the car into neutral, it turns out theres a fourth woman gone missing. The newest one, Catie Millier, is an old school friend and her son is about Jakes age. Sad. I hope they find her. The last one turned up dead in New Brunswick. I got up at 4:45 so I could be awake to call the guard at 5. I was sitting downstairs at the kitchen table drinking tea and smoking when Win, looking rather disheveled, stumbled in and sat across from me. I dialed the guards number and put the phone on speaker so we could both hear. His name is Tim, and from what I gather he remembers me from the days I volunteered there. He asked if we had found anything Jake might have left behnd, like clues or anything, which I thought was a bit odd. We told him that yes, we had found a few things but were having a hard time making sense of them. It wasn't until he asked what Jake had left behind that I really got concerned. I guess you could say my "spidey senses" were tingling. I really just wanted to end the conversation there because I wasn't sure how this man though he could help us, of ir he had just wanted to snoop, or if he knew something he wasn't saying. Win got mad though and started cursing at this guy. I shushed him and leaned closer to the phone. Tim had gone silent and in the background over the hiss of the line, I could hear a loud speaker. Code White. All staff report to central desk. Patient Miller armed and considered dangerous. The line abruptly went dead and we were left stunned in the deafening silence of the kitchen. Patient Miller. Its an awfully big coincidence that she just went missing and I heard her last name during that phone call. I wonder Win has decided were going there tomorrow (today now I guess. We haven't slept.) Sunday is the day all the family members visit so we're hoping to blend into the small crowd. Hopefully security lets us in with no trouble but if not, I still have my pass card and hopefully my alarm code is still the same. We need to find out whats happening there. I still haven't figured out how to add pictures but since the map is missing anyway I guess it doesn't matter. I've asked around a bit and the key is almost certainly for a pad lock. No one knows what the pass card is for but it seems like a logo has been filed off somehow. Almost in the size and shape of the logo on my pass card for the hospital. My dog has been barking out my bedroom window for about an hour now. She stops for a few minutes at a time but keeps growling. We've gone outside and looked around but don't see anything. The house is locked up tight and we're all safe and sound in here. I'll update more as soon as I can. We're going to check out the hospital after work.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Second Update:   We got into the hospital.    My pass card still worked and my alarm code was the same. We got in no problem. We searched around for a while and couldn't find any staff and all of the patients were locked in their rooms for the night. I wanted to explore but needed someone to watch my back so Win set up shop in the empty security booth to keep watch over the cameras. Before I set out I grabbed a flashlight from the desk and called him on my cellphone so we could keep in constant contact.    The hospital itself seemed exactly the way I left it, except deserted. Only one of four wards was currently in use and housed all of the current residents. Charts were stacked neatly, chairs were pushed in, it seemed like everyone had just left for the night. None of the patient rooms had names on them, just numbers, so there were no answers about Catie Miller from that. I figured Id keep looking and come back to check out the charts later. I checked every room, jiggling the door handle and shining the flashlight in the small windows to see which rooms had patients. This whole time I had Win in my ear asking questions and letting me know I was alone. The hallway I was in seemed to go on forever. The way the hospital is set up is the main hub, with a corridor running off of each of the four sides. Three of them were shut with large steel doors, chained and padlocked.    I kept walking down the hallway I was in, expecting to hit a dead end, but instead I ran into a pair of steel doors just like the ones closing off the other wards. Only these ones were propped open with door stops. Behind them lay a few more feet of corridor, and what looked like a pair of elevator doors. I looked for buttons but couldn't find any, so I pulled the flat head screwdriver out of the bag slung across my shoulder and pried the damn doors open.    The walls in this corridor were disgusting. They were brown and damp looking with veins of black running from floor to ceiling. The lights were dim and flickering and the smell was unbelievable. Win let me know I had gone past the last camera and I was walking blind. I told him to head my way since the ward was empty and it seemed safer now for us to be together. I walked back out of this weird hallway and waited by the elevator type doors until he arrived. I hadn't realized how anxious I was until he came into view but I practically flying-squirreled him out of excitement to see him.    Together we walked back into the hallway and started looking around. There were bits of paper on the floor here and there and we could hear a steady hum, barely audible over our own breathing. Following the hum led us around a corner to a set of sliding doors like youd imagine for a quarantine section. My pass card wouldn't work but the card from Jake's keys opened them. We weren't prepared for what we found behind them. It looked like the morgue. A row of steel tables ran the length of the room and our breath could be seen in the air.    On the tables lay a row of women, seemingly naked, and covered from chest to knees by a neatly folded sheet. The closest to the door was a very familiar face. It was Catie. I walked cautiously over to her and checked her pulse, which thankfully she still had. That was when I noticed each woman was connected to an IV. Whoever put them here was keeping them sedated and alive. For what?   We checked each womans pulse, and each was colder than the last, her heart beating a little bit slower, but every last one was still alive. Win went over to check the rows of doors for body storage and in each of the 9 drawers there was a child, male and female, around the same age, none of them with a pulse. One child for each woman in the room. Turning away from the gruesome sight I realized there was one table left, the figure on it covered entirely by a sheet. The IV was still running so we pulled down the sheet and I hit the floor. My son, my Jake, laying on that metal table in that room with all those women. And that was when I realized it.   All of the women on that table looked like me. Dark hair, dark eyes, short, thick around the middle. We had similar features, seemed to be around the same age.   Jake was alive. He still had a pulse. Win dialed 911 while I held Jakes hand and sobbed into his sweater. All of the children in the drawers were naked but he was still fully clothed, wearing that sweater. It was mine when I got pregnant and he had claimed it a few years ago. It was still huge on him but the kid loved it because it had my name on the sleeve.    Win says it was only about 15 minutes but it seemed like a week before the police and paramedics showed up. Teams and teams of them. The coroner arrived shortly after but we didnt get to speak with him as Jake had been given something to wake him up and he was starting to come around. We left in the ambulance with him and were currently at the hospital. Jake is frail and thin and the poor kid is so pale but hes happy to see us and hes eating jello and we have officers outside the room keeping us safe.  Win just came back in from giving his statement and now its my turn. Ill update as soon as I can.    I agree with the salt. Do the doorways and windows, and maybe a circle around your bed.   Have you thought of doing what it says? Just... going up north? I'm sure us nosleep-ers would have your back!   Could you take a sample of the water to have it tested independently? Do you have a meal hall on campus, could it be food poisoning? Does your roommate have any chronic health issues? It could be a virus attacking those who are susceptible? Edit: Could it be lead poisoning? The article says the building was built is the 20's.   http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gcei5/jake_update/ Just a little update and some strange goings-on. I'll add more as soon as there is more. Thanks for your well wishes.   I'll add photos as soon as I figure out how. I feel like we're missing something obvious. I think the key is for a padlock but there isn't a lock in the entire house. I'm back to work this weekend but will update as often as possible.   No one at the school seems to remember him leaving. Everyone's response is the same. "His dad picked him up for a doctor's appointment. Expect him home later this evening." It's almost like it's scripted, like they have no other information on it. The police have no where to turn. There are no leads, no evidence, Jake's just... gone. Disappeared. I haven't figured out the stuff in the box yet but we're trying. He's such a smart kid, I know he left us something, I feel like I'm missing it. I'll update as soon as I know more.   Original was taken down as an intro. Adding the update here. Hopefully it stays up.  I suppose I should start this off by giving you a little bit of background so that things Ill mention further into my story will make sense. Here goes.  My name is Sarah, Im 23, and my 7 year old sons name is Jake, Yes that means I had him at 16. I was raised by a mechanic and a seamstress so resourceful and scrappy are second nature along with being just a little bit wild, hence being a teen mom.  I had never really put much thought into sharing my story but recently my cousin Diane mentioned r/nosleep  and after lurking here for a while I thought you all might be able to offer some advice or at least some support. Let me cut to the chase. My son has been missing for about 2 months. 2 weeks ago, they called off the search.  I work as a nanny and when Im at work, Jake hangs out with my mom. We all live together in a townhouse with a handful of cats and a dog who thinks shes a cat. We have a good and calm life and aside from scaring the shit out of myself on a regular basis with gore and horror, nothing eventful happens. I work, Mom works, Jake goes to school. Hes one of the smartest kids I've ever met. He loves to read and draw and he can make music with just about anything. His bedroom is right next to mine.  I hadn't seen Mom or Jake for about 2 days, which sounds terrible but because I work night shifts, Mom works days, and Jake is in school, we can pass like three ships in the night for a few days at a time. I got in around 8:30am, crawled into bed with my dog, and passed out like it was a normal day, but let me tell you, it wasn't. I woke up startled and uncomfortably sweaty around 4:30pm to my dog barking frantically at my bedroom door, hopping up and down trying to get out to see my Mom who was in the bathroom across the hall. I let her out and followed her, rubbing sleep from my eyes, and adjusting my shirt so that nothing was hanging out. (Im a rough sleeper.) Mom opened the bathroom door to greet us and I could tell something wasn't right. She explained to me that when she had gone to pick Jake up from school, she was informed that his father had picked him up for a doctors appointment at around noon and that we should expect him to be dropped off to us later in the evening.  That wasn't all that strange, Win picks Jake up all the time, but usually he tells us first, and Jake didn't have a doctors appointment. Mom had tried calling Win from the car but had no luck so after I tried a few times, I gave his fiance Steph a call.  Steph: Hey Sarah, how are things? Hows Jake? Me:  Hey Steph, thats why Im calling. Jakes school told us that Win picked him up this afternoon. Its totally cool if he did, god knows the kid could use an afternoon off, its just that he didn't tell me so Im worried. Steph: Sarah I dont really want to be the one to say this, but Win and I have been home together all day. I was sick this morning and he called off work so we could just hang out. Im going to explain to him whats going on and well be right over okay? Me: Okay Steph. Dont let him drive. The last thing we need is you guys getting hurt.  By this time I had started to panic a little. Mom was watching me, still standing in the bathroom doorway, and I slid down the hallway wall into a seated position. I waved my hands at her and stared blankly and thankfully the poor woman understood I needed a cigarette.  She sat down across from we and we just sat there staring blankly til the dog ran down the stairs to greet Steph and Win. They yelled Hey! while trudging up the stairs, the dog trying her best to herd them. Shes a half-assed Border Collie. Steph sat down with us and Win stepped over mom and I in the hallway and opened Jakes bedroom door. It looked exactly as it had 2 days before when I tucked him in. The bed was rumpled, books under and on top of the covers, a precarious pile of even more books with a water glass on top stacked beside the bed. His window was open a crack, which seemed strange, but I couldn't really place why. I got up and followed Win in, putting my arm around his back and feeling comforted when he wrapped his arm around my shoulders in response. Together we rifled through all of Jakes books, flipped pages and lifting dust jackets, finding nothing. A final scan of the room showed one lone book sitting atop his dresser, nearly falling of the edge. It wasn't really a book but one of those magnetic boxes that look just like a book. Inside was a set of keys, what looked like a map obviously drawn by Jake, and a framed photo of Win, Jake, and I.   We called the police. I had a feeling we were making a mistake, involving them wouldn't end well, but everyone else insisted so I gave in. Two officers came and checked out the house, gave Jakes room a once over, (at least my family let me hide the book-box just in case they wanted to take it,) and before they left I asked them to dust and fingerprint the window frame and sill. They treated me like I was crazy, because were on the second floor, but they did it because mom and I swore the window had been closed. The cops left to talk to a few people at Jakes school and file the report for us and that was the most action they ever took. A month and a half and no leads later, after questioning and accusing everyone I hold dear, including myself, multiple times, the search was called off and the case was deemed cold.  Win and Steph had been living with us by then, alternating sleeping on the couch and on an air mattress in my room with me. Steph's sick was actually morning sickness that was very nearly killing her, and the history between Win and I was beginning to cause some tension. The day the case was declared cold, Steph walked out on Win and seldom returns his calls. He started sleeping in my bed. Nothing happened. We didnt even cuddle. But being apart made us both anxious so we were sticking together. We still are.   This is way too long and wordy for one post. I just wanted to give background. I'll add more tomorrow. ___________________________________________________________________________________________  [UPDATE]  Win and I havent left each others sides. We do everything together. Last night we drank some wine and had a look at Jakes map again. It seems like to starts at our house, and takes us to the mental hospital by the community college campus, in sort of a 7 year old round about fashion. I dont know if he was confused, trying to confuse us, or trying to confuse whoever was watching him draw it. I can only tell because he used the same symbols Ive been teaching him since he started school. # is always home. I used to draw it on city maps and in his school agendas so he would always know that if he was lost, that was home. The ferry terminal, ~ (waves,) the school, ^ (dunce caps, he doesnt get this one but it makes me laugh,) and the two hospitals nearly across from one another, + (EMERG) and +  (Mental Hospital.) The map seems like its meant to go on but he was stopped short of finishing it. The keys are his, but with two additions. The first is a tiny brass key like youd use for a padlock, the second is one of those little keychain cards, like a store loyalty program, only its completely white with only the scan strip on the back. Ill admit we were a few sheets to the wind when we discovered what the map meant. Perhaps thats why it came to me so easily, who knows. After a particularly energetic round of the bed-spins, I was trying to steady myself, sitting against the footboard toying with the framed photo of Jake, Win, and I, flipping it over and over in my hands to distract myself. As I turned it back and forth I began to notice that the frame and the back were not entirely attached anymore. As if someone had separated the front metal frame from the velvet covered cardboard backing. Win had been rolling back and forth across the bed for a while but when he saw me slip my thumbnail into the space between the frame and the back he sat bolt upright. He leaned over and peered into the space as I used my nails to pry the gap apart. I expected to find nothing and boy was I shocked when I noticed the piece of paper wedged in there. We pulled it out and unfolded it and in Jakes carefully practiced, uneven lettering, it said I am Taken. Mom Hide. We mulled that over for a while and came up with nothing, eventually passing out on top of the covers, fully clothed. So this morning Im sitting here writing this, nursing a horrendous wine hangover, and attempting to eat the greasy fried egg Win swears will fix it. Were going out today to put up some posters and talk to some people. SOMEONE must know where my child is and Im gonna find them. Ill update when we get home if theres any information.  	48
             I know canon was the same, but I think it's too implausible that Quirrell happened to come across V just when Tom was about to come to Hogwarts, with exactly enough time for him to get a job.   Why is Voldemort known to be Tom Riddle? There seems to be no good reason for him associating them, so why isn't his Voldemort persona anonymous?              The situation between H and Q looks like classic Parfit's Hitchhiker. They each have no reason to cooperate afterwards, but have reason to believe that they will.  So who thinks this is all a leadup to a discourse on how to solve the problem in full generality?            I see a bunch of tumblr posts (see https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/inappropriate-audition-songs) which follow the format of   Hi Ill be auditioning for the role of X and Ill be singing Y by Z.  What's going on?         1. Hypothesis: "Harry" is a trigger that brings back his memories when said by Quirrell, which is why he never said it before.  2. Snape taught at Hogwarts for 7 years. Harry is 11, and was 1 when his parents died. Snape only came to Hogwarts 3 years after Voldemort disappeared, which is 3 years later than in canon. See http://www.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline_snape.html, which sources this from canon. This is probably significant.  3. I'd like to mention my last theories thread, which didn't get much attention because it was posted right before the new chapter. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w0xiz/last_crazy_thread_before_it_updates_spoilers_102/  4. I think Snape is being controlled by Quirrell also, as I don't expect Sprout to be powerful enough to have downed him. Remember, everyone found it *plausible* that Snape had actually downed Quirrell in Diagon Alley, so Snape must be pretty powerful.            Here, in no particular order, are all my crazy theories/questions that I wanted to get out before the update, from my notes. Assume spoilers all:  1. Why didn't Lucius know that Harry wasn't getting his mail? He should have at least asked Draco to tell him if Harry got anything or something. 2. There's precedent for Harry's thoughts being hidden; Harry's plan to have Draco rule wasn't mentioned until he said it in the meeting (assuming it was true). 3. Why did H C talk to Zabini and then immediately obliviate him? Seems wasted. 4. Why didn't they try to test Lucius to see if he was telling the truth about the Mark?  His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me.  Surely someone had a test that would tell whether the Mark bound him? Since they thought that the Mark sealed the lips of the bearers about itself, why didn't they demand that Lucuis tell them how the Mark worked, and test the response? This seems much simpler than Harry's thing with the actual mark.  * 5. Why is the prank when Harry learns about time-turners in his style? Presumably Harry would still cooperate with the prank regardless of whether it matched his style, so what does that tell us about how Time works? * 6. Why didn't Lucius know at the trial that Harry could cast a patronus? He gave Draco Veritaserum, right? * 7. Mcgonagall seems to have a *lot* of killing intent. Why? * 8. Snape is a Legilimens, which implies he's a perfect Occlumens as well. Why did Voldemort think he could trust the prophecy that he took out of his mind?  I omitted a few that I couldn't figure out they meant. Need to take clearer notes to make time-travel communication easier ...                                                               The first time I read through HPMOR (until chapter 101), I really didn't think Quirrell was Voldemort and behind both the Hermione plots. The main reason for that was because Dumbledore had a lot of evidence pointing towards him, and I kept on switching back and forth between thinking Dumbledore did one or both of them to Quirrell or some other perp. (What's mentioned in Harry's conversation with Lucius seems to pin it down, as well as some other things throughout the book.)  Then I saw that [Meta Spoiler](#s "EY had confirmed QQ=V in a retracted Author's note, which confused me. I now think it's almost impossible for that not to be true in at least some sense, or for QQ to not be behind both the duel and troll.")  However, all the evidence that points to Dumbledore is still there, and I don't want to blame *all* of that on Quirrell setting things up.  So my hypothesis is that Q and D are in this together, where "this" is some plan involving getting Harry to fulfill both of their wants.  Evidence in favor of this:  1. Dumbledore accepts Q apparently without needing to know who he is 2. Dumbledore doesn't grow suspicious of Q at any point in the year 3. There are pieces of evidence pointing to both D and Q for the same plots 4. Dumbledore let Harry off too easy for the prison breakout 5. Dumbledore plays along with the plot to get Hermione sent to Azkaban  Pieces of evidence against:  1. Dumbledore lost a lot in the war against V, including his brother (perhaps it's not really him/taken over by Horcrux, or brother's death was staged) 2. Dumbledore appears moral (perhaps he still believes in the greater good/ is trying to achieve immortality despite what he told Harry)  I'm willing to bet for this at 10:90% odds (I'll put up 1 to your 9). Any takers or alternate offers?  Edit: archived at https://archive.today/cZlqY for the bets.                                          **Disclaimer: this is obviously a scam, so please don't send any money to this person.**  Got this email with the subject line "[ATTENTION SENIORS] If you have $20, this explosive cryptocurrency could change your life"  https://imgur.com/a/F6E7L  So, of course, I immediately clicked on the link, curious which alt coin they were pushing. The link was to http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/?h=true, and the long text explanation of what was being sold is at http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/Full?h=true  Some hilarious excerpts  The value of Bitcoins in circulation has now topped $1.5 billion  more than twice the market cap of Apple. No wonder major companies like Dell, Amazon, and Target, all accept Bitcoin as payment.  Hahahahahahahaha.  Someone must have done the math too quickly, and thought that Apple's market cap was 700 *million* instead of billion.  And apparently Amazon and Target now accept bitcoins. Wonder if they got that from Gaw? That would also fit with the "get in for under $20" hahahaha.  Before I reveal this opportunity in detail, please allow me to **formerly** introduce myself.  Wait, does that mean you already introduced yourself?  No wonder Americas elite are using it too, including Jerry Seinfeld, Robert DeNiro, and Britney Spears. Its rumored that Denzel Washington used this currency to pay for a $30 million private jet.  Yeah, you can say anything in an article and that will make it have been "rumored". This probably can't be topped.  Even President Obama flashed it to the world while purchasing his lunch.  I take that back.  However, Ive discovered an amazing loophole in Americas rewards-points system.  And you chose to share it with all of us, of course. Wonder what that implies about its viability?  The report reveals the company actively mining Americas top rewards points systems...  Ooh! Mining!  I peg the value of your first opportunity at upwards of $56,700.  ... and I'll sell it to you for only $9.99. Aren't I nice?  On page 109 Chris reveals how a morning stop to his local 7-Eleven made him a fortune. Since Chris is an avid Snapple drinker, one day, he noticed the stores shelf spaaaaaace for Snapple products had shrunk from two full refrigerators to less than half of one. He immediately took action, executing his incredibly simple information arbitrage strategy. The very next week, Snapple announced that its inventory of unsold products had sharply risen, negatively impacting the companys profits. Chris tripled his investment in a few days.  ... is there anything I could even say to this? My guess is that he is either flat out lying, or invested in hundreds of companies and only reports the profitable ones.  Chris reveals how a friends unassuming Facebook post scored him a quick 50% gainer. The post simply said, Oh my! Chuggington?!!! I think my kids have died and gone to heaven! Within days of observing the post, Chris perfectly executed his information arbitrage strategy and invested ahead of Chuggington becoming a smash hit among children.   How can I get him to follow me so I can pump everything I own to this very rich person?  Below are a few of the fantastic letters I received from readers last week...  This is in almost every scam pitch I've ever seen.    Final thoughts: I am really disappointed. If you're going to write a scam pitch, at least make sure all the irrelevant facts in it are true. Also, this is dated from October, so why did I only get an email this week? Someone's slacking off.  (The company referred to is http://investor.points.com/, and obviously Robert Williams owns a large number of shares in it.)   Someone should get the list of Paycoin holders and sell it to this guy.  **Disclaimer: this is obviously a scam, so please don't send any money to this person.**                                                   I noticed the [transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2u3sqp/reddits_first_transparency_report/) on the front page, and the user that submitted it (reddit) is in red. This is similar (not exactly the same) as what Google [got in trouble for doing](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/technology/google-reaches-tentative-antitrust-settlement-with-european-union.html).                                 Are any altcoins profitable to mine with either cpu or gpu?  Are there any programs I can run that will benchmark every algo on my computer, then look up the prices of every altcoin and tell me which one is the most profitable?                        According to Josh's latest post he missed the mining panel because his family was sick and there was an outage. Who buys that? I'll sell it to you now for $2 and buy it back over the next 10 years for $20!   I know that the code says for coins not to be mined eventually. However, bitcon is likely to be hard forked many times by then, and miners are the ones who decide what happens, so why won't they just decide to continue making coins? They won't have the same commitment to keeping the protocol as us 100 years back, and would do whatever is best for them. Assuming bitcoin is still around then, what factors will affect whether coins stop being mined like scheduled?  The same question goes for every halving. What incentive will miners have to play along?   I think we're over due for a crazy theories thread, so here! My own list will hopefully get typed up on the 27th if I get around to it. To start off: Dementors are utility monsters and Harry realizes this, so creates a "utopia" where all of humanity is prisoner to Dementors forever, because their need is so much greater. CLEARLY forshadowed by the plant chapter. What's yours?   Because people here are lazy.         Should count up from when the floor was still supposed to be established. Say something like "this many days/hours/seconds/ since promise broken."      Like when they have a "live" tv "broadcast" inside of a movie or fiction tv, there should only be one take. If they do more and choose the best, then it looks too perfect for a live shot, and therefore unrealistic.                  I made a withdrawal from changetip, and the txid only shows up on https://btc.blockr.io/tx/info/29050a6f7509c760338f32860af6bc409d179a0d1df62a1d35f9616d86ad3746 but not https://blockchain.info/tx/29050a6f7509c760338f32860af6bc409d179a0d1df62a1d35f9616d86ad3746.  Does that mean there's a problem with the network? Usually transactions show up on blockchain instantly. It's also been a while and it hasn't been in any blocks on blockr.io. Is this a sign of anything?  Edit: it's been resolved.                                       https://imgur.com/a/EvW3I  (I assume no one will be answering because you're all asleep.)     What stops the agency from simply denying a request that is valid if it might embarrass them or any other reason? Do people simply trust the agency that they've revealed all the relevant documents?            The first question asked is "What is your honest opinion about the shortage of meat in the world?"   The interview was a huge failure...   The African asks "What does meat mean?".  The American asks "What does shortage mean?".  The Chinese person asks "What does opinion mean?".  The Russian asks "What does honest mean?"  The North Korean just waits. The reporter asks again, and is told "The Interview is no good!"   it was a no brainer               i loked throuh teh report by de senate. there are all dees parts dat are blacked out. now we no dat duh only weason someone would block it out is because dey work 4 teh ilerminaty! methinks dey didn't want to be exposed so dey blacked out der identidies! also, what the hell are lerminations?!               In the conversation Harry had with Mcgonagall in Diagon Alloy, we learn that he isn't superstitious:  Um Harry said. He took a deep breath. Thered been some muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a pan shed borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I didnt want to because I might get mugged, and she said, Harry, dont say things like that! Like thinking about it would make it happen, so if I didnt talk about it, I would be safe. I tried to explain why I wasnt reassured, and she made me carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesnt stop it from happening, so I was really scared.  So it is surprising that on at least two other occasions, in Chapter 21 and 38, he does things which are blatantly superstitious.   And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid shut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his head, waiting for the week to be over. 10:01. 10:02. 10:03, but just to be sure 10:04 and the first week was done. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket off of his head.  and:  He didnt sit at the same nearby table hed sat down at with Draco, the first time hed prepared to board this train. That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.  I'm *very* wary of suggesting this, but as it happened twice, maybe it's significant? Could someone have messed with his mind enough to change how he thought about fate? We know from the first chapter that magic caused Harry to believe that it existed without proper evidence (or at least that's how I read it, as confirming that intuitions exist in HPMOR). But Harry still hadn't updated by the time of the Diagon Alley talk, for some reason.      death, taxes, and people who can't count.      If partial transfiguration is just "enforcing a relation between separate past and future realities, instead of changing anything over time", then why can't it be used for arbitrary time-travel? Enforce a relationship between the me of "whatever now means" and the me of "now shifted to the past/future"?                     Harrys own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harrys ears, He has a surprisingly good explanation.  Why did Harry say that? Obviously, the direct cause of that statement was that Future!Harry remembered hearing it while he was Present!Harry. However, this doesn't explain the real cause. We know from elsewhere in HPMOR that time seems to do that kind of stuff when there would otherwise be a paradox. So this sentence implies that, had Harry not known of a good explanation coming, something would have happened that would cause him to try to change time. What was that? What would have happened had he not been told that, that was drastic enough to cause Time Itself to twist? Remember, Harry knows Not To Mess With Time, so it would have to be **really really important** for him to try doing something.  (I'd also like to point out that, since he heard the explanation while anticipating a good one, he is automatically subject to confirmation bias, meaning he would notice less if it wasn't good, without any Harry ever deciding it was good by "himself".)   I've read a little bit about this "net neutrality" thingy and I don't really get why it is a good thing.  As I understand it, we (the protesters) want the FCC or whoever to keep *more* regulations. That's the first red flag. I haven't seen any explanation of why the free market wouldn't work in this case.  Second, if your ISP started slowing down smaller websites, what would you do? Well, what if there was another ISP that wanted your business, and they offered equal speeds for all websites? You know what would happen? Three guesses:  * Everyone switches to ISP #2 * Everyone switches to ISP #2 * Everyone switches to ISP #2  That's called a free market. Do you know why Sprint still offers unlimited data for smartphones after all the other US carriers started limiting the amounts? Because there's a market for it. There are people who would switch away from Sprint to whoever offered a better service.  If all these people who signed, called, emailed, and otherwise joined the campaign, instead signed a petition that they would switch away from any ISP that doesn't give all website the same bandwidth, wouldn't that create significant incentives to ISPs to maintain the status quo? And companies that might pay for faster speeds will get less people to reach with them, so the prices will go down, and the ISP will not be gaining that much, so they'll switch back to neutrality soon.  I'm willing to change my view if someone can explain what I'm missing. I'm trying to understand, and don't get it. So why does the free market fail in this instance, and why is the government needed to step in?   Well in chapter 9:  Though Harry had been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The young woman hadn't even looked up from her reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville's direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage from the front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had contained his toad.  So there's a prefect (possibly Penelope Clearwater, possibly not) who knows some mind control methods, hanging around Hogwarts and Harry. I don't think a simple charm could have done that, it seems like it would need Legilimency to get the information and Confundus, Legilimency, or Imperious to get Neville to go there. I don't see any way around the Legilimency requirement, which is "incredibly rare", and thus suspicious. Is there any other method that could have been done with standard magic, or should we be *very* suspicious of unnamed prefect?  (I suppose it could have been done by hiding the toad in a known location beforehand, then sending Neville there with a standard Confundus, but it doesn't seem like she was setting it up, and she wouldn't know that she would be approached [or she could have Confunded Harry and Neville to approach her specifically, but we're getting complexity penalties at this point.])   I don't know if this theory has been proposed before, but what if  The curse on the Defence job works like the Comed-tea? That is, only wizards who are going to get caught doing a fireable offense during the next year get unexplained urges to work at Hogwarts? That might explain Quirrell's stated reason for working at Hogwarts, if he is not QuirrellMort.  Are there other plausible hypothesis for how the curse works?  	149
 I believe it was a 5 hour session if I remember correctly. I did go back for a 1 hour touch up after all the healing.   Here's mine. I basically just took the album that inspired me the most and went with something from it.  [http://i.imgur.com/tXvZxkL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tXvZxkL.jpg)   Dude. That is also a very well done job. I really like it. Calgary Ocular Orifice tats all the way.   Haha definitely bumped into you. Was an awesome show.   Sweet dude, thanks!   I had posters I was guarding with my life so I stayed back and head banged my neck stiff.                  I simply would like to know in what order have the bands been playing. I am attending tomorrow nights show, and I really would like to catch the faceless. Between getting off work and putting my son to bed I know I'll be running a little late. Thanks in advance, I am so stoked for tomorrow.                        Personally I'd love to see Construct and Avalanche, so many great memories on both. Big Team CTF on Avalanche was always my favorite map and game type combination. Also getting those easy grav lift grenade to head shot kills on Construct was too much fun, I could have done that all day.

So I'm putting together a slideshow for my Mother's 75th birthday this year and I found an old picture that needs a little help. If anyone could help I'd really appreciate it, thanks reddit.  [http://i.imgur.com/EkFszJI.png](http://i.imgur.com/EkFszJI.png)   So I went to see one of my all time favorites tonight, Animals As Leaders, during their supporting show for Meshuggah here in Calgary, Alberta. Grabbed my tickets, got inside and got a beer. As the guy poured my beer he commented on what was supposed to be tonight's short concert. Asking why, he explained that Tosin of AAL tried to break up a fight in Boston between a cop and a rowdy concert goer, that turned out to be an obstruction of justice charge apparently. I couldn't fucking believe it. So pissed I sold my tickets and left like a sulking baby. So heads up for anyone else anticipating an upcoming Animals As Leaders show in Canada.  **tl;dr** Animals As Leaders forbidden to travel internationally for the time being.  Edit: It was Javier Reyes, and not Tosin Abasi. Thanks Triangular_Desire.   "Hold On" was featured. Thought it was suiting. Thoughts?

Thanks so much Reddit!      I have zero Photoshop capabilities, so I thought I would reach out to the Reddit community for some help to make these pictures a little more hilarious than they already are. I know they are kind of blurry, sorry about that.  [Picture #1](http://i.imgur.com/kdyaX.jpg) [Picture #2](http://i.imgur.com/xAPMb.jpg)  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I'm looking for all and everything, especially Team Snipers. Any recommendations?    So I flew through Toronto to catch a Tool show on my way back from vacation in 2009. I was seated next to another dude flying solo at the show, he ended up taking a bunch of pictures, I asked him to email them to me and he came through, stand up fellow. [Thought I'd share.](http://imgur.com/a/sLvvN)   It was your [standard 10000 Days setlist](http://toolnavy.com/showthread.php?t=114069). Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/St1as.jpg) is the poster from the show, might be my favorite from the three I have.  Yeah some of them are blurry, but there are a few nice one's in there. Unfortunately this is the best resolution I have.           Has anyone made the joke "it's been 10000 days since their last album" yet?             Am I the only one that thinks halo 4 multiplayer is vastly similar the Call of Duty series? I was never a fan of those games for many reasons, 1) Unfair advantages among players due to tactical load outs 2) Point count for wins 3) Weapon markers 4) Ordinance. This game may look/play nice but it's so far from halo that I find myself quite turned off, I miss that level playing field we all once had, where the good gained advantage with knowledge. Anyways just my two cents. Just curious if I am alone on this. Oh I forgot to mention the sounds, every standard halo noise is basically gone.      After the birth of my son 11 weeks ago I've been somewhat out of the halo loop, I'm on right now and noticed the anniversary big team playlist is no longer available. Why did I buy them if I can't play them, am I missing something?                     Hey everyone, I'm at a loss as to where I'm supposed to turn next so I thought I would try r/newfoundland. My wonderful mother 74 years of age was a victim of robbery this past week. She has never been an overly wealthy woman, using what little wealth she has to support her very large family. Her house is small and quaint and doesn't contain many valuables (her television is tubed and her stereo is 15 plus years old, among the rest of her things that were left behind by the thieves). She has always been content with her humbled life and the only valuables she's ever really had came in the form of a few small rings passed down through the generations of our family. These rings of course hold no real monetary value (very small weight in gold), but the sentiments they hold in my mothers heart are unmatched.   I know this is such a long shot but if anyone has seen or heard anything in regards to breaking and entering and the sale of used jewelry on the streets in the Grand Falls area, could you please let me or the police know. It would mean so much to her to actually retrieve these small items and/or see the culprits brought to justice.  I completely understand that there are problems in our society, and that drug addiction among other things, can bring people to carry out the unspeakable, but it breaks my heart knowing that there are those who prey on the elderly. It's about time these actions are taken seriously by the system, and the law works in favor of the victims.  If by some even slimmer chance someone who was directly involved manages to read this, if you somehow still have my mothers jewelry and have it in you to return it, I will most certainly not pursue this any further, I would walk away knowing that all hope isn't lost. I would forgive you personally, and I will hold that gesture in such high regard for the rest of my time on this earth. I do not wish to seek revenge, but to make things right.  If you think you might know something and require further description please PM me.  Thank you for your time.                                	129

I woke up with a need to go outside. I went out, there was a light shining on a rock. I touched the rock and was given a vision. I've never had visions, I'm not mentally ill and not even interested in this and certainly won't talk about it. I've been married to a narcotics detective twenty years with two teenage boys. I'm not a sceptic or a believer to this point. When I touched this rock within 30 seconds I was given thousands of years of history of how "aliens" were here many thousand years ago and what they are doing. I was given information that a planet knew many thousand years ago their planets Sun would die. They wanted to make a new home. They found our planet they found out conditions were comparable to them. They have decided they didn't want to do the necessary things that need done to make the planet functional for them. They showed pictures of different species to develop the planet they experimented with. They showed me the help they have given along the way. They need certain things mined built and ready for them. They have given certain scientists and others knowledge the way it was given to me. They gave us religion so we work together because ants work well together, bees work well together but they had to make us more advanced to get us to work together, religion. They have given us the ability to understand how to process DNA but only the knowledge to use it minimally. They gave us fear of criminals and criminal elements so eventually the world will have every humans DNA filed from birth. They are able to read which of the humans by that they will keep when they come. I'm not religious per say but the rapture as we understand it is somewhat true but based on our genes. Almost like whatever people they need to further them will be used. They have astronauts kind of like we do that intervene if necessary, but it would have taken them too many resources to prepare our planet, that's why we are here and they give us motivations to go in the direction they want. They need mercury gold other metals. They need computers much more sophisticated than what we have, we are laying their groundwork. They will live in harmony with us to the best of their ability when they come,but not everyone will benefit the society. That's why we have been given DNA knowledge. I can't write everything I was shown it would take forever. But the information was given to me in thirty seconds. I don't know why ME, I'm nobody just a mother disabled with lupus. I spent 8 years in army reserves as supply specialist ages ago. There is absolutely nothing extraordinary about me. The light was a v shape the size of a small plane. The beam that came down was like a laser beam and I could do nothing but walk to where it shone and touch it. It didn't hurt it felt like nothing, but in the 30 seconds I was there I was given 3 lifetimes of information. It was specific it was visual and I retained it. I don't want to ever tell anyone this because they will think I'm nuts. I would think they were nuts. But I thought someone should have this knowledge,nd your the only people on the Yahoo I could see to tell. It's not like I can call the president and tell him. Anyway I wish there was a way I could give you all the things I learned, but I'm a busy mom and don't want to be responsible for this information, I really just want to forget it but my brain keeps putting it back no matter what else I try to think about. So I'm hoping I told you it will be over. A lot of the information I was given I don't even understand. But cave people were not the first people. We have been started over on more than one occasion. They have to be careful we have enough information to advance the planet where they want it but not too much where we blow our planet up and ruin it. They are walking a tightrope of sorts and not even as 'll them always agree and we are a work in progress. Thank you for taking this information, hopefully it's not mine anymore. [Name removed/CMS/rjl]"   If you are passionate about e-cigarettes, and more importantly freedom of choice, I urge you to boycott the Vuze brand, which is owned by RJ Reynolds.   If you haven't yet heard, RJ Reynolds has recently typed up a 120 page report, which it then sent on to the FDA, urging them to make all open air mods illegal. Open air mods include any type of e-cigarette that can be re-filled by the user with the e-liquid of their choice.   The report is filled with bullshit reasoning including that open air mods are more dangerous and more easily accessible to children. That's right, one of the leading cigarette manufactures in the world is claiming that open air mods are dangerous and should be made illegal. Ironic that RJ Reynolds has suddenly formed a conscience, isn't it?  Not surprisingly, closed air e-cigarettes such as Blu and Vuze are not mentioned in this write up.   In reality, this is a blatant attempt by RJ Reynolds to force their main competition out of the market by attempting to sway the FDA with sensationalized pseudo-facts and industry clout. Criminalizing open air mods would in effect give RJ Reynolds a near monopoly in the US e-cig market, forcing consumers who have decided to quit tobacco cigarettes into buying RJ Reynolds e-cig products and continuous cartridge refills.   I urge all of you who are passionate about this innovative and emerging market to show RJ Reynolds that we will not stand for corrupt politics and business practices.  People are quitting tobacco cigarettes at an astounding rate, and RJ Reynolds is desperate to keep their hands in our pockets.   Not to mention, I bought a Vuze before i found out about their letter to the FDA and it absolutely SUCKED. Worst e-cig product I have ever had the displeasure of using.  **Take a stand against blatant corruption. Boycott Vuze and all RJ Reynolds products, companies, and subsidiaries.**  [RJ Reynolds Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Reynolds_Tobacco_Company)      In regard to *hypothetically* seeking employment/potential upcoming drug test.  If you smoked 1 hit /day for a month, as opposed to smoking 4-5 bowls with a group (lets say on average 3 hits per bowl) each day for a month, approximately how long would it take each person to piss clean for a drug test. Would it be the same? Or would the 1 hit method have an advantage?  Lets assume the standard 30 days no smoking to be safe for the 4-5 bowl smoker. I guess the question would be, if somebody only smokes 1 hit per day for a 30 day cycle, is there any advantage in being able to quit smoking maybe a couple of weeks before the test as opposed to the standard 30 days?

Firstly, let me say that my condolences go out to the family members of the missing crew and passengers on MH370.  Secondly, I would like to clarify that the following analysis is a THEORY of mine, and while SPECULATION, it is based on known facts and inference relating to the events that transpired since lost radio contact. Trolls are not welcome here, constructive comments only.  I have been following the emerging details of this case very closely since the initial incident. From early on, I have maintained that this was no accident, and either the pilot(s) or separate hijackers were involved in this planes calculated disappearance. The evidence that has emerged since then has only served to strengthen my initial hypothesis.  **Here how I think it went down...**  + After takeoff, before MH370 reaches the East Coast of Malaysia, the ACARS system is manually turned off by one of the pilots in the cabin.  + After crossing into the Gulf, before reaching Vietnam, Malaysia air control contacts MH370, informing them that they are about to enter Vietnamese airspace, and their air traffic controllers will soon be taking over communications. The time is aprox. 1:30 am, it is at this time the co-pilot says "Ok. Goodnight" to Malaysian air traffic controllers. (Notice the nonchalant 'goodnight' *AFTER* the ACARS is turned off, indicating it was not done under duress.) **This is the last successful radio contact with MH370**  + Pilot manually switches off the transponder signal, which now joins the ACARS as being disabled.  + It is at this point that I believe the pilot(s) manually initiated a leak in the cabin's air pressure control system, slowly depressurizing the cabin. To those passengers inside the cabin, they would not know anything is wrong, and would slowly become drowsy with gradual oxygen loss.   + 5 minutes after last radio contact, at roughly 1:35 am, the plane is said to ascend to approx. 45,000 feet. **Keep in mind, this is above the planes service ceiling and this maneuver would never be done under normal circumstances, as there is a chance the plane could stall.** I believe that coupled with the manual cabin depressurization, this move was performed in order to kill the passengers on board.   + Following this maneuver, the plane is said to make a sharp turn to the west, coupled with a rapid decent to around 20,000 feet. (In my opinion, this erratic decent could have been planned to make it appear to radar operators as if there was a cockpit struggle taking place. It could also be a result of a stall or near-stall.)  + When the plane never reaches Vietnamese airspace, and radio contact cannot be made with MH370, ground control contacts a separate airplane to attempt radio contact with MH370. The pilot reports back that he could only hear mumbling, static, and interference coming from MH370's end. **I believe this is consistent with the pilot(s)wearing his oxygen mask(s), after depressurizing the plane.**  + At this point the plane flies west, back over Malaysia, and follows known aviation waypoints through the Strait of Malacca, toward the Indian Ocean. The movements of the plane coupled with the following of known waypoints indicates an experienced and current pilot being in control of MH370.  + The plane continues to be pinged for up to 7 hours after initial lost radio contact. This indicates that the plane is still flying, as a crashed plane or one that has landed and been "shut off" will not ping.  + 8:11 am, over 6 hours after last radio contact, satellite ping information puts the plane on the perimeter of a half circle, either west of Australia, or west of China. (The exact location is not known from the ping, just a general distance from the satellite.) *It is my belief that the plane headed south toward Australia, as a northerly route would take it directly over many countries whose air defense / radar systems would have surely picked it up.*  **I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PLANE CRASHED! It is my belief that this plane was taken, for use at a later date, in some sort of 9/11-esque plot. It is not my belief that Zaharie was the mastermind behind this plot, rather just the executor of this particular stage.**  + I believe the plane may have been landed in Australia, Indonesia, or somewhere close to where it was last determined to be located on the southerly track of the 8:11 am ping. After landing, the plane will be immediately painted over and 're-branded' so to speak. The transponders will be swapped/updated, and the plane will essentially be ready to fly again with no links to MH370.  + NOTE ZAHARIE'S FLIGHT SIMULATOR. In a recent interview with CNN, a close friend of Zaharie's says the simulator can be programmed with custom scenarios. **It is my belief that Zaharie may have practiced this particular flight many many times, in preparation. This would also afford him the knowledge of how far he could fly on a given amt. of fuel.**  + It has been reported that Zaharie's family moved out of their house the day before the flight went missing. Zaharie is also said to be a 'political fanatic', whose idol Anwar Ibrahim, was just convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 5 years in prison, **one day before MH370 went missing**. This conviction is being viewed by many Malaysians as political persecution, and Zaharie allegedly expressed his disgust at the verdict.  + Recently, a credible threat is investigated after Al-Qaeda supergrass told court that four or five Malaysian men planned a passenger airliner hijack. According to the Al-Qaeda member, **ONE OF THOSE MEN IS A MALAYSIAN PILOT.** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10700652/Malaysia-Airline-MH370-911-style-terror-allegations-resurface-in-case-of-lost-plane.html  + It is clear to me, and anybody in the know, that humans played a direct roll in this planes disappearance. This can be inferred by the intelligent movements made by the plane and the specific tracking features that were manually disabled. While I cannot rule out the possibility of hijackers gaining control of the cockpit, the circumstances and timing of this event lead me toward believing one or both of the pilots were directly involved. **THIS WAS NOT CATASTROPHIC SYSTEMS FAILURE. THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. THIS WAS A WELL EXECUTED PLAN, THAT LIKELY TOOK YEARS TO DESIGN.**  + I do not think this was a pilot suicide. The plane is said to intentionally avoid radar installations and detection once crossing into the Straight of Malacca. There is no reason for a pilot to strategically fly 7 hours off course, just to crash the plane in a more remote section of ocean.  + From the moment of the plane's last radio contact, everything about this case signifies detailed and well thought out planning, even down to the time of morning this occurred. I believe these events were perpetrated at this hour because it would give them the most time to get away and cover their tracks. The plane was not even reported missing until 6-7 hours after last radio contact, and even then, Malaysian authorities made it seem like the plane had crashed.  In conclusion, unfortunately, I think this event is just the first stage of a much larger plan. I do not think we have seen the last of MH370. I really hope I am wrong.   EDIT: Or they could just find the plane in the ocean... or at least a piece of wreckage linking to a 777. Then the truth should be in the black boxes. But if nothing at all is found wreckage wise, I'd be concerned.  EDIT 2: Updated for new information.  TL; DR - The plane didn't crash. I believe it may have landed for use in future terrorist activities.         http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/03/14/Missing-plane-pilot-simulator/  Is there any chance of Law Enforcement checking the flight simulator for evidence of planned/rehearsed flight paths which may match the projected improvised flight path of MH370?   https://blockchain.info/zh-cn/tx/ed2efa807c4d33a0ca6d15aab5e608ac624a30039965b508063c8baf9d9e8ecc  150K+ coins transferred from btc.sx to a wallet on 9/10/2012  These 150K coins are then broken down into 3 main addresses:  19N2NiMWcgF62mwmAzsdgEqKrVSafdyHo8  19FAyCiPzrrVrN1rXkYYMEVeS1aXYqocGT  1FDKQB5aN6w7y8WTfVwqFN4Yj3DyL8BCpu  I followed the 1FDK tree specifically, and the bulk of these coins are then rapidly transferred to new wallets at an incredibly fast rate, sometimes **every 10-20 seconds** on Dec 18-19th!

We were one of the first in the world physical location that accepted this new digital currency [1]. In the next couple of month we received a lot of attention, but no one has purchased anything with btc. Then one day, my wife calls me and informs that there is someone who would like to pay with bitcoins. I got excited and asked her to take a picture of the guy because he is the first one and it's a historic moment for us. He bought 2 crepes and paid using his smartphone and our QR code with btc address. One crepe and a lemonade was 1 bitcoin at that time :) After he finished his food my wife approached him and asked to take a picture of him for being the first. He blushed and politely declined citing that bitcoin is an anonymous currency. He wished us well, added that bitcoins should already be in our account and left.  My wife called me back and revealed that he refused to take a picture. So I asked her to describe him. She portrayed the guy as a humble polite Japanese man in his 50s. We joked maybe it was Satoshi, but I dismissed the idea. I assumed it was some one from Mt Gox since it was located in Japan.  Today I showed the picture of Satoshi in Newsweek to my wife and she recognized him.  http://bitcoinbabe.blogspot.com/2011/07/bitcoin-sex-drugs-and-baklava-and.html               http://gawker.com/does-mt-goxs-ceo-have-a-secret-history-of-online-payme-1534752110?utm_medium=referral utm_source=pulsenews         http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1za9sf/found_at_least_150k_btc_of_mt_goxs_stolen_coins/      http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/2014/03/02/mt-gox-announces-civil-rehabilitation-proceedings-what-to-expect-next/      http://www.whois.com/whois/gox.com   I am curious how your body burns stored fat.  Let's say you were to enter starvation mode, and your body needed to burn stored fat for energy. Would the oldest fat in your body be burned first (FIFO)? Or would the newest accumulated fat be burnt first (LIFO)?  Thanks, Reddit!  (Also, if you know of a better, more appropriate sub for this post, I am open to suggestions.)                  http://fox43.com/2013/01/09/state-senator-proposes-legalizing-marijuana-in-pennsylvania/#axzz2qr1Lltmn  Here is Leachs letter on the subject:  "This past November, the people of Washington State and Colorado voted to fully legalize marijuana. Other places, including California, have had de facto legalization for some time. This week, I will introduce legislation which would have Pennsylvania join these other states in ending this modern-day prohibition. My bill will legalize the consumption of marijuana for adults over the age of twenty one, without regard to the purpose of that consumption. Heres why:  For the past 75 years, our marijuana policy has been foolish, ill-conceived, costly and destructive, and it must end.  We have been waging a war on drugs that includes treating the use of Marijuana as a matter for the criminal justice system. We have spent billions of dollars investigating, prosecuting, incarcerating and monitoring millions of our fellow citizens who have hurt no one, damaged no property, breached no peace. Their only crime was smoking a plant which made them feel a bit giddy.  People across our Commonwealth have spent time in prison, lost time at work, been forced to hire lawyers and had their lives disrupted and sometimes destroyed because they used a product less dangerous than beer, less risky than childrens cough syrup, less addictive than chocolate and whose societal harm comes from its prohibition rather than its use.  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2006, an average year, 24,685 marijuana arrests were made in Pennsylvania at a cost to the taxpayers of $325.36 million. Each year we not only waste a similar amount, we leave several hundred million dollars on the table in taxes that we do not collect because marijuana is illegal, rather than regulated and taxed. Aside from the moral issues involved, we simply can no longer afford the financial costs of prohibition.  Further, prohibition of marijuana has done what it did in the case of alcohol in the 1930s. It has created a dangerous black market with violent and bloody turf wars that kill many people in our country and elsewhere. The original prohibition brought us the St. Valentines Day Massacre. The modern prohibition has brought us gun battles in the streets between drug cartels. The murders associated with the sale of alcohol ended with prohibition. The same will be true of marijuana.  To be clear, under the terms of this legislation marijuana would be a regulated product, treated in a way similar to how alcohol is treated. It will still be illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana, behave badly while publicly intoxicated or to sell it to minors.  Further, like alcohol, legalization and regulation will make marijuana safer.  People will no longer have to buy it on the streets from criminals who may have laced their product with other dangerous drugs. People buying legally will know exactly what they are getting and be able to rely on the safety of what they are purchasing.  The sad history of prohibition is that marijuana was legal, and in fact the most prescribed drug in that nation until the late 1930s. At that time, it was targeted by those who had an economic interest in removing it from the market. Today, prohibition is supported by myths, misconceptions and old wives tales that no longer stand up to scientific scrutiny.  For example, in response to my bill, Governor Corbett said he opposed it because he believes marijuana is a gateway drug. But science has clearly established that this is untrue. Well over 90 percent of those who use marijuana never go on to use harder drugs, and the percentage of people who do use hard drugs and had previously used marijuana is no higher than the percentage who had previously only tried beer.  The facts are that unlike alcohol, you simply cannot overdose on marijuana. Unlike alcohol and tobacco, marijuana is not physically addictive. Studies have shown that people on marijuana are much less likely to behave violently or recklessly than people who are drunk. And while breathing a hot gas into your lungs certainly isnt good for them, marijuana smokers on average smoke far less often than tobacco smokers. There is simply no way that marijuana does, or ever can, come close to killing the 1,100 people per day that tobacco does.  Yet despite all of this, you can drink and smoke tobacco freely. But if you smoke marijuana, you are a criminal and can go to jail. This horrific policy must end. People around the nation are realizing that. And it is a moral imperative that Pennsylvania wake up and end prohibition now."         Let me preface this by saying that I do not know much about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, other than the basics.  But in regard to the marijuana industry's current issue with banks..  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/us/banks-say-no-to-marijuana-money-legal-or-not.html?_r=0  Would it be at all feasible to create a cryptocurrency, Potcoin for example, and use that currency exclusively within the marijuana industry as a means of storing/investing/transferring money?  If that is not realistic, wouldn't a partnering of Bitcoin and the marijuana industry as it expands from state to state be a great idea for both parties?  What are your thoughts?      Since grabbing the KC Chiefs D/ST off the FA wire after week 1, the Seattle Seahawks D/ST has unfortunately been left sitting unused on my bench.  I am wondering what sort of trade value i should put on the Seahawks D/ST, if I were to attempt and move them straight up. Give me some examples of players at any position who would have a comparable value.  I like having the Seahawks D/ST on my bench, giving me the option of rotating the position on a weekly basis dependent on match-ups, however up until this point, I have started the Chiefs D each week (rightfully so) and feel like I may be wasting significant trade value which could be used to improve my starting lineup.  Should I keep the top 2 D's on my squad?  WWRD?      	118
    I'm editing a multi-camera live concert video that was shot with a bunch of DSLRs and a BMCC. The BMCC has vastly superior image quality, but as the night goes on, it seems to have developed a dozen or more hot pixels that show up as white or coloured dots and are quite noticeable on a black background.  Any ideas on how to make them less noticeable? Thanks in advance guys!                                                                                                      So we've been using sennheiser in ear monitors for the last 12 months or so, with the stock earbuds, and recently I had a chance to use the same radio pack and microphones with a set of shure earbuds. I didn't see what model they were, but they absolutely blew me away, the sound was just crystal. Full and clear.   So as I hunt around for earbud options, I thought I'd consult the pros here - have you guys found nirvana in a stage earphone? What should I check out?     An update to the thread I posted last week...  So today my band and I taped our Starking appearance. We sang with Girl's Day - at least, three of them, Minah must have known I'm dangerous and stayed away.  I never realized just how young those girls are - but they were totally charming, super professional and heaps of fun. Then we did a couple of songs with Brown Eyed Girls, who came across as... Sort of grumpy.  I don't know how our singing went, but we had an awesome time with the new hosts, Boom and Teuk (ex super junior) and it was a pretty damn hilarious day all up, once all the waiting around was out of the way. They seemed to think we kicked some butt, so who knows, it could lead us somewhere. :)  it's going to air in late November, I'll get a copy when I can and stick it on YouTube - but yeah, I thought you guys would appreciate what a crazy day I just had! :D      I sing with an Australian a cappella group, we're in Korea quite regularly, this will be our third visit this year. One of the things we love to incorporate in our show is bad imitations of k-pop songs, it's pretty funny since we're all guys.  Long story short, some TV producers saw us singing Twinkle Twinkle earlier this year and they've invited us to do a broadcast later this week.... And it seems like they're bringing Girl's Day in for the show as well. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be hilarious. :)  Wish us luck!                                          I've got a nice frontpage setup, but I like to see what's going on in the rest of the reddit world as well. Seeing as there's a few specific subreddits that are super popular but totally not of interest to me, is there any way to filter them out?   I've manually created a vignette effect (I know, I know) that I want to use on a dozen or so clips. I'm just dipping my toe into after effects, is it easy to save that adjustment layer and copy it across to the other clips, or am I missing the point? :)   I'm starting to shout at my telly now, having just come through the Vice section. The evidence is so weak and the questions so vague at this point of the game that you're more or less just guessing in interrogations. Even when you get questions right, you seem to get bugger-all in return. And it doesn't matter if you stuff every question up, the game goes on. It's like a movie in which you twiddle a thumbstick every now and then to get to the next scene.  The action is pretty ordinary and formulaic, the driving is both boring and unnecessary, the city has little in it that makes me want to explore further, the main character is a bit of a prat... Sure, the stories are great and the character animations fantastic - but the gameplay is so fucking irritating that I'd probably be happier if I left it alone and never finished it.  Next to Red Dead Redemption, this feels like a gimmicky vehicle for the awesome animation work of Team Bondi, a half way step towards future games that might put the technology to better use. But that might just be me.         I want to expand my abilities... Can you guys throw out some quick tips on how to make a project more visually interesting with the footage you've got? If you can point to any example videos I'd love to see them.    Sorry guys, beginner's question here: I'm working on a 25fps sequence using footage from 2 cameras - a Sony HDV camera and a Canon 7D. We've shot interviews and the like from 2 angles and want to be able to cut back and forth between vision from the two cameras - but it seems they shoot in slightly different frame rates.  If I create a 25fps sequence and just drop in the 23.975fps footage, does Premiere CS5 just sort frame rate issues out? Or do I need to process it somewhere else? Oh, and sorry if this is a stupid question!      Hey guys - just a quickie. I've been using prores transcoding in FCP, which does a great job of making 7D footage editable. Now I have to do a reasonably large project in CS5 - should I edit the 7D footage straight, or transcode it to something?  If I need to transcode it, can I do it using the Apple Compressor, or does Adobe have its own tool that works better? What format works best?  Cheers in advance!         Hey guys - thanks for the inspiration. I'm on day 2 of keto plus a few weeks into Starting Strength; I'm gonna be a total posterboy for reddit body transformation... heh heh.   I'm struggling already though... The thought of greasy food for dinner again is making me a bit nauseous, plus I feel headachy and drained. Just checking in to make sure this is normal... Is it?               Hi guys - and thanks for giving me the inspiration to get back to training after more than 10 years on my arse.  I went in and did my first squats, deads and press workout today, and ended up in a conversation with the guy running the place. I've got bad knees as a result of way too much basketball when I was younger, and I'm now carrying a lot of weight (~125kg) - getting my legs back in shape to support dodgy knees is the main reason SS appealed to me. I've been doing bodyweight broomstick squats at home for the last month or so.  The gym guy, an old fella who seems experienced in free weight training, is telling me I shouldn't jump straight into 5-rep heavy lifting in search of strength. That since I haven't been in a gym for 10 years I should spend at least a month doing low weights for 20-30 reps on things like leg extensions, unweighted or low weight bar squats and the like, in order to prepare my tendons and ligaments for the stress, that if not, I'm risking a blowout at the squat rack with severe consequences.  This seems to go against what Rippetoe says in SS - that the squat is not only the perfect conditioner of connective tissue, but that done properly, it shouldn't be dangerous. The way I read it, he seems to be saying learn the right forms and get straight into it. I'm confused... Help!                           So we're replacing a band member, and have found one strong candidate who seems to have a lot of the attributes we need - a rare combination. But his groove is non-existant - too much time in the classical world I think.  I've got time to spend with him if we decide he's our man, but I wonder what you guys' experiences are. Is groove innate or can it be trained? Will I be pushing shit uphill if I try to train him? And how would you go about it? Mixtapes? Metronomes? One-on-one sessions?   Any ideas?                                                   Thought I'd bring this one up because it always tends to flush out a bunch of other wonderfully horrific stories about how other dudes lost THEIR knackers.   SO:  I was lucky, because my nut started to hurt. In most cases, testicular cancer is absolutely painless, which lets it grow and spread to the lymph nodes, lungs and eventually the brain (which is the state it got to before Lance Armstrong did anything about it).  In my case, it was caught early because I'm a rabid motorcyclist and was learning to pull wheelies. When you're learning wheelies, you tend to smack the bike down and bash yourself in the nads a lot. The best guess of the docs is that weeks of testicular trauma due to mousetrapped wheelies had caused a minor bleed into a tumour that was growing in ol' righty. The bleed caused it to swell until the nut was twice its normal size, it hurt like a thousand bastards and I got it diagnosed. So it could be said that wheelies may have saved my life. Honestly, officer.  Apparently most cases of testicular cancer are discovered by the missus, in the bath. Or so I'm told.  The rest of the process was fairly simple. They chop out the diseased bollock (though it's not a simple case of cut the ol' scrotum and pull it out, they actually go in from your stomach, below your navel and off to the side, go figure), you go stash some wigglies at the sperm bank and then go for a short round of chemotherapy, which has a 50% chance of permanently sterilising you.  Chemo sucks, in my case it was just one IV bag of one chemical, carboplatin, which is so toxic that the nurse carries it in wearing elbow-length gloves. A nice touch. The treatment took 45 minutes, after which I had to go sing a gig. That was interesting. It left me with no appetite or energy for weeks, and for the next 3-4 years I felt kind of foggy in the head, as if I was thinking through cotton wool. I can only imagine things are worse for people who have to go through longer treatments - Armstrong is a good example, he had to have five or six, the poor bugger. With just one treatment, I didn't even lose any hair.  Anyway, I didn't find the process overly scary, and apart from the annoying effects of chemo, I can honestly say that one nut works just as well as two (the missus tested it out just hours after surgery). Looks a bit odd, mind you, but then the frank 'n' beans have never struck me as particularly pleasing to look at, even in the best of times.  So hopefully if there's anyone out there that's just copped a nasty shock, found a lump or had a diagnosis, I can reassure you a bit. There's plenty of blog posts, articles and whatnot on the net where fellas make a big deal out of losing one ball, what it means to their manhood, and generally make it sound very scary. It doesn't have to be, though, and your life will go on just fine. The guy at [www.mybollox.com](www.mybollox.com) has a pretty healthy attitude about it all (and incidentally, the same doctor as I had).  As for the rest of you, if this post gets you to fondle your nuts or the nuts of somebody you care about, I'd consider that a win for everyone. Even if you don't find anything.  Fire away!                        I'll be doing up a full review in time, perhaps a video review too - but since this is such a breakthrough bike, arguably one of the two most fascinating superbikes of 2010 alongside the S1000R, I thought you motoreddit folk might have some questions. So if you do, ask away!                     I know what you want to say, and I know you're struggling to get it out, and I know YOU know I know. What I don't know is whether it's ruder for me to finish the sentence for you so we can move on, or to wait for you to finish and let you hang out there because I don't want to talk over you...   So, uh, whaddya reckon, should I finish your sentences?                 	115
 just out of curiosity...did you do your own health plan or follow p90x?   I don't understand all the hate coming towards this. You started with an already slim figure so the results aren't as drastic. However, you can definitely tell they are there. Congrats on finishing the 90 days! whats next? Insanity? Another Round?    quinoa is not easily bought near where i live as there aren't of ton of organic stores and all the main stores don't carry it   Hey all: this is my second week of p90x. For the first week i just took a normal diet and put it through loseit.com just to see what my percentages were. I roughly averaged 40% carbs, 30%protein, 30% fat. Obviously the p90x fat shredder is 50% protein, %30 carbs, 20% fat. So how do i bring up that protein number in some practical ways?  Here is a sample day of meals for me:  * Breakfast:oatmeal * lunch:ham and turkey pita with provolone cheese/baby carrots/and grape tomatoes * dinner: white bean and garbanzo bean chicken chili(over minimal rice) * snacks:almonds(roughly 20 throughout the day), spinach shake(this is my recovery drink: 1 banana, 1 scoop protein powder, 1.5 handfuls spinach, 1/3 cup almond milk, 2 tbs peanutbutter, ice)  also what do you look for in a protein bar?   Just did my second chest and back + ab ripper x workout...I increase my weight on lawn mowers by 10lbs and did everything but the mason twist in ab ripper x. Currently drinking my protein/recovery drink   ANd behold tomorrow is rest day and it is very good. lol. My legs are on fire! upper body not so much. I used this first week to get myself into the rhythm of working out consistently...next week should be no excuses! pushing my body to the limit!   Hey, I'm also am doing the program(today is my day 6) and I wanted to give you some tips. 3 pushups doesn't seem to be a lot. I would consider doing 10 but moving to your knees if you have to(this is what i do). Anything less than 10 and you will be resting too much and stiffen up. Also with the chin ups try to do negatives(use a chair or jump up to where your chin is above the bar and then release as slowly as you can)   basically i have one scv per a command center building supply depots at all times.   Do/Did you drink a recovery drink on yoga days? especially during the early weeks? I'm on week 1 and i don't feel like i worked out nearly close to as hard as the other days(mainly due to not being very flexible).   isn't that Katu? He does Playhem casting once a week i think. He even plays zerg at high level. I believe i watched him beat oGsIllusion the other night.   reply i'm on day 4 but i agree!   I'll be updating this occasionally with a log of how I am doing. Not sure if i should do multiple posts.  Today will be day 3 of week 1...tbh I've never attempted this exercise in all my attempts at p90x...I'm always so sore and quit...today..I'm still sore but i will do the exercise.  right now: 5 foot 11 inches @ 190lbs. Lots of stomach fat + no upper body strength.   its on esltvs site http://tv.esl.eu/de/vod/view/23547   I may be really dumb but I can't seem to find all of them. The take tv sight has some...but not all. Anyone know best place to get them?   The problem is someone bought p90x for me as I can not afford it or another one really :(   I'm a 23 year old male 6 foot 190 lbs. I'm not happy with my upper body muscle and fat. I've tried P90X a couple of times but everytime i start, by the 4th or 5th day my body is exhausted and doesn't feel like it can go anymore. What do/did you do to get past this hump? Or What did you do to recover faster?   but don't you have to buy the game twice to get a second account?   aka but the game twice. no thank you   always fun watching the lakers lose!   the problem with this is that the current metagame has terran going fast gas for both terran and zerg(reactor hellions, fast tank/viking, cloaked banshee) where as versus protoss you do either one or two rax fast expand(no gas)   Hey, Just a general question that I think is helpful against all races. How do you deal with random players? I have three distinct builds for each race i'm playing and I really need to know by 11 food what the other player is doing(so I can go gas first if terran). How do you approach Random?  EDIT:Specifically for terran   no. We had one computer. But i didn't want her using the same account as me/save file. So we had separate ones so we could each play the game at our own pace. She have her stats and I have mine.    i'm sorry i lived in a house where it was a luxury to get one game a year? Both myself and my sister needed to be able to play it without running over each other.   quick question people. I had a friend move into my house and they want to play starcraft2. Do they have to buy their own copy? That seems unlikely because of how many houses have multiple children   same here   Is anyone else having problem with ads freezing screens. Specifically there is a Nikon ad that never seems to close. I keep having to refresh the stream until i get a different ad   i suggest trolling back and reporting him for spam   why else do you think they were giving away free tickets? they weren't trying to be nice...they were trying to get people to show up    you should a)have scouted the 4 gates+robo(i think standard scan of your opponents main is around 6:30ish) b)still be able to hold it off(if you are constantly producing out of 2 rax(bc 3rd rax is getting an add on) you should have enough to hold. Plus your opponent is incredibly all in at that point(he can kill 10 of your scv's and it wont matter bc you have two base down). Use the scv's to soak up damage(right click autorepair when you pull them so they soak up even more damage). You should be able to hold.   definitely do the 1 rax FE against toss and just grab 2-3 bunkers if you feel in danger. 2 Bunkers/8Marines/3scv's per bunker on autorepair holds off a 4 gate. You should have a stronger army...don't let the protoss max!   what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?    what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?    yeah i was just so use to doing 13 rax that i auto did it without thinking. If i get the add ons and he is 4 gating dont i lose bc i'm not producing units for that minute?   nvrmind...uploaded    I also added a replay of both builds   replay added   where can i load replays?    I'm in the states and lagging really hard   Their event went live over an hour ago to air the playoffs and all its been is watching Orb and Gretorp get set up and scrolling graphics. Incredibly unprofessional. You don't see other sports delaying their broadcasts by an hour without some explanation. Heck we don't even see other broadcasters do this. Ridiculous!   thank you! i started doing the one rax expand and i found out that if i can hold off a 4 gate(which i can with two bunkers and scv's set to autorepair) then i do much better/win the game :)   I'm a gold terran who can beat the occasional plat zerg and plat terran. I struggle against silver level protoss. Anyone have any tips. I open 3 rax into expand-mmm with vikings and ghost as neccesary and 3/3 ups. Still get destroyed by toss going colossi or DT's or anything  EDIT:Adding in replays for those of you that wanted it  3 rax: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=242869 1 rax: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=242870   gold terran/silver zerg  test_subject4671.465   So i was looking through the Open Bracket(http://s3.majorleaguegaming.com/2011-providence-starcraft2-open.html) and there are some sick matchups starting the day:  * Gatored(who beat Ganzi) vs Leenock * EGMachine vs Nestea * Spanishiwa vs TLO * Losira vs colMVPsc * Hero vs Keen * Sheth vs Major/Terran/Princess/xSix[fillintheblank]   Personally I'm looking forward to Machine vs Nestea. I really like machine. Which of these matchups are you most looking forward to?   thank you!   i don't run adblock   I'm a MLG silver member and I can't  get a voucher for the event...any one else having same issues?   So i've been watching EGMachine and for the life of me I dont understand why he doesn't have more viewers. He commentates every single game and really interacts with his chat. Also, he seems to do well at MLG's beating players like Slush, Tyler, etc. He also keeps a pretty good schedule of streaming often.   [Link for reference]( http://www.twitch.tv/machineusa)    listen to this man. Battlestar Galactica is AMAZING   Hi! i'm a gold level Terran and i've been dominating TvZ using the MVP build. Here are some quick notes.  1.)you didnt expand fast enough. Using this build you should be able to throw down a little bit after you start producing Helions. 2.) only produce 4 helions. This is the amount you need to get map control. Remember, the MVP style is about not taking damage and controlling the map instead of causing damage via drone harass. 3.)Once you switch your 1st factory to a tech lab. throw down gas #2 and factory #2. I prefer getting  an early siege as opposed to stim since the MVP build has no medivac usage...you actually hurt yourself with stim. 4)as soon as your second siege tank finishes, float your orbital down to expansion(circa 7-9 minute mark), transfer scvs, build gas 3 4(2 workers in each), and throw down engineering bay for upgrades and turrets to defend mutas. 5.)now you can actually afford the 4 marines/2 seige tank/ 2scv/supply depot production you were trying to pull off. 3rd goes down around 11 minute mark which should also be when you make your first push. Keep marine behind siege tanks and have your tanks hot keyed to go into siege mode. AS SOON AS YOU SEE creep, seige up and take out 3,4 tumors.   Thats all i can think of now. I may download a replay for you to see of me doing the build. Also, if you want to practice i play zerg as well test_subject4671.465   do you have an example (ie 2 rax into expand into factory or something like that)   hi all! gold level terran here. I'm struggling with the tvt match as i feel i really dont have a solid build or key idea. In silver league i could just mass marine marauder and get my upgrades to +3/+3 by the 16 min mark and win. Now in the gold league, other players macro is better and there is a significant use of siege tanks. I've been opening with a fast banshee build order:  10 supply 11 rax 13 gas 15 orbital as soon as i have 100 gas-factory once factory completes throw down reactor and starport once starport finishes switch onto reactor...keep producing marines/tanks and expand...the problem is that even if i do damage (6 scvs) my opponents seem to be able to attack me and kill me.. any suggestions?   i posted this last night and got downvoted to hell :(   painuser was suppose to arrive at the airport a hour ago to be picked up by sir scoots...and no one has been able to get in contact with him. this all via dj wheat twitter. Just trying to get the word out there http://twitter.com/#!/djWHEAT/status/130110499521167361         Hello from a member of the ODU alumni! My entire starcraft 2 group is ODU alumn :) VT is cool..i guess    hey, if you want a practice partner i'm a silver terran test_subject4671.465  I would like some tvp practice :)   game 2 boxer vs alive: boxer went for a fake helion reactor into cloaked banshee build but alive had a viking out in time an took little to no damage. The rest of the game played out with alive macroing better than Boxer(who has floating over 1k gas during a good segment of the game). Alive eventually killed Boxer's 3rd and then pushed in with marine/tank for the win. Also boxer used the userid of JethroGibbs for this match WINNER:Alive   Split screen not working   i went on a losing streak this morning but i still am ranked #2 in a silver league and constantly playing gold players.    how do i post replayz   50-60 workers in my usual game with a 4th base up and saturated usually. not claiming my micro/macro is perfect   i do have an 80% win rate in silver lol..bout to be gold as soon as i play more games.    Hey everyone,  I keep reading posts here that say "blah you are only silver league, all you have to do is have good macro and you advance." With that said I'm currently sitting on the silver/gold cusp and i disagree. I'm doing builds versus each race(2rax vs z, 3rax stim mm push, fast banshee) and executing them really well and most people hold these off. I then proceed to have a 20+ minute game where the only time i get over 600  minerals is when i max(600 because two factory thor). So what's your opinion? do we not give the lower leagues enough credit?  EDIT: I'm not saying i'm the best..i'm merely asking if we give the lower leagues credit :)   hmm...maybe i'm too into soccer to be a good evaluator of this fact. I do know that ever Sat and Sun ESPN2 shows an EPL game. But i agree that soccer has a much larger following than SC2.   i watch a ton of soccer and have never seen a commercial interrupted game.   sports like soccer have 45 minute halves with no adds at all. They simply state "this match is brought to you my gatorade" or something like that. I could see it being the same.   test_subject4671.465 silver terran   I'm silver terran test_subject4671.465   Silver Terran who is on at random times test_subject4671.465   i mad i couldn't see the games   any hurricane survival guides for the people in raleigh   Well i'm silver league and like everyone said...its will eventually depend on what build you want to do... but honestly i would throw a nexus down as soon as i begin floating the minerals necc to build one...usually ends up working nice, at least for terran   that might be my problem then...i never repair. Thanks! :)   Hey guys...silver league noob here...trying to get better. Anyways..I'm really struggling vs protoss...i find the other matchups easy...but i literally can not figure out for the life of me how to stop 4 gate pushes...bunkers near the front of my base? they warp into the back..mass marauders-killed...mass marines-killed....rushed to tanks-killed...help please?  Watching streams doesnt help me bc pros dont forgate really in pvt or pvz  Edit:To THose asking about warping in back...warp prism .   Destiny advocates a one base roach push strategy to stop this. You overlord on 9, spawning pool on 12, gas on 14(3-workers immediately) as well as roach warren, get a queen, and drone up to 20/26..then non stop roach/overlord production..if he doesnt have roaches out you win...and if he does he can not stop producing them or you will win...and since you are putting pressure on you can use one of your drones to expand.   Hey everyone, right now i'm chillin in the silver league as terran and am doing okay. learning/getting better all that jazz. The other day i started experimenting with the other races just to get a handle on how to scout them/etc. During this i found playing zerg to be especially fun...enough so that i legitimately am considering switching. My one question is how do you determine the # of lings you need to make at any one point...i always seem to make too few and get killed by early 3rax/4gate plays. or if i try to do a roach build i always get cannon rushed by protoss. I find if i can get to late game i'm beating everyone...so anyhelp stopping these early game pushes would be nice.   honestly i was able to beat the computer on hard/very hard by just microing out marine/maruader/medivac....but that does not prepare you for the game...I think its much better to just play 2-3 games on the ladder every day...as you play you should start to notice good timings etc   I started out just like you losing almost all my games. I quickly got very frustrated. What i found out is that i just didnt have a plan, i was building units willy-nilly and losing. I would suggest Day9 Dailies 257,267,285,and 289. But honestly the most important one to watch and digest as terran is #312. Once i watched that daily it all clicked for me. I'm now residing as a top Silver league terran who should be in gold any day now.  	79
 Thanks for your comments and feedback.    Looks like we're getting some Vancouverites on this post. I'll mention that I'll be giving a free PsychologySalon talk at Vancouver Public Library Central Branch, Alice Mackay Room (under the concourse) Tuesday March 26 at 7 pm.  Out of the Blue:  The Nature and Treatment of Major Depression.  More details on the PsychologySalon blog here: http://www.psychologysalon.com/   The Mindful Way Thru Dep is a great book; it's on the reading list for a workshop on Mindfulness I offer. I still have a bias that mindfulness is a bit better as a relapse prevention tool than as an "episode resolution" tool - lots of people in the depths of depression find it too difficult to settle the mind.   I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada. I've had a blog for 2 years at http://www.psychologysalon.com/ , and write posts on depression, mental health policy, and private practice.  Having written the equivalent of a good-sized book over the course of 160 posts, I'm ready for some outside input.  I have a particular interest in depression, having developed and run a post-hospitalization depression treatment group - a protocol that I train therapists across Canada to run for their own people - and having written Your Depression Map, a self-help guide to depression.  But I'm up for suggestions about topics.  These might be along the line of questions. I don't want to be the depression Dan Savage, but I'm curious what people might like to know - or at least hear someone's opinion about.  So what's something you've wondered about depression causes, symptoms, manifestation, treatment, etc that either you haven't had the chance to ask a professional, or that you haven't had addressed to your satisfaction? I can't give treatment advice for any particular person, obviously, but I can offer observations based on experience and research.     Big topic; I won't do justice to it.  One factor I've noticed is the fear that if you relax and just enjoy the fact that the depression is gone for the moment, it will jump back at you.    The metaphor I use with my clients is that one morning you wake up and there's ice on the lake. It's beautiful, and it looks strong enough to hold you up. So you go out walking on it and you can hear the creaks and cracks. There's a fear that at any moment you'll break through into the cold water.  In the case of real lakes, this is an easy one:  Avoid doing this and if it cracks get to shore immediately.  In the case of depression the job is more complicated.  Acknowledge that the depression, while currently absent, is probably not gone forever (especially in the early stages of recovery). Yes, you probably will crack through a few times. Yes, it feels tentative and anxiety-provoking, and often a bit fake. But just keep walking.  Let the depression be gone, if only for the moment. The longer you can let the ice hold you up, the thicker it gets.  That doesn't deal with the whole issue, but the reluctance to unclench, relax, and allow happiness or contentment to be there is very common upon recovery.     Hey redditors, Im a psychologist in Vancouver Canada. A few years back a colleague and I were involved in developing the British Columbia Depression Strategy.   As a part of that project, we realized that 80% of people diagnosed with depression were seen only by their GP, but all of the effort on enhancing service was going to mental health specialists.  We wanted GPs to have something other than their prescription pad to offer, so we developed the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, a self-care manual in pdf format that GPs and others could hand out to people who might benefit from it.   Its not therapy, and its not support, and its not detailed enough to suit the complexity of some peoples issues. But its something. And there are versions in English, French, Punjabi, and Chinese. Theres also a special edition called Dealing With Depression for teens, and a manual on Antidepressant Skills at Work.  Since we developed these (I was the junior guy on that project; Dr Dan Bilsker was the lead), tens of thousands of people from all over the world have downloaded the manuals, and hundreds of doctors hand them out as a regular part of their work.  You can access all of them free here: http://www.changeways.com/resources/aboutdepression/scdp/scdp.html  This is a page on my own website, which has links to the download sites of all of the various versions of the manual.   I've also got an online course on diaphragmatic breathing for stress reduction. That one costs $15, but there's a 100% discount for redditors (just use the Coupon Code "breathingreddit" and you get it for nothing). There's also a sample video you can look at without any signin. Here's the link for that:  https://www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/    This book is an excellent resource that I recommend for clients frequently - despite having written my OWN book on depression! It is a good idea to work gradually and to focus on just one book for at least a while.  Keep in mind, though, that there's nothing about reading a book that cures depression: people need to do the exercises and work at reconnecting with the more positive aspects of their lives.  When in doubt, read slower!   I'm a psychologist in Vancouver Canada. I treat people with a variety of stress and anxiety-related problems, and our clinic tries to get good, practical, and reasonably-priced resources out there in the world for people to use.  One of the most useful things I teach people is how to breathe using both the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. Stress affects multiple systems in the body, but most of them aren't things we are used to controlling.  We CAN, on the other hand, control our breathing. So breathing can function as a kind of "handle" on the stress response, allowing us to grab hold and throttle it down.  Breathing Made Easy is a 12-short-lecture course (about 90min total) that provides a bit about the physiology of breathing and, more importantly, a set of experiential exercises to help people distinguish between intercostal and diaphragmatic breathing. The program leads to a recommended practice exercise, four-stage breathing. With time, people can learn this technique and can apply it in more and more anxiety-triggering situations.  The course is posted on udemy.com, and normally there is a $15 charge for taking it.  But we're releasing several hundred FREE registrations for redditors.    The course is at www.udemy.com/breathing-made-easy/  There's a promo video you can watch without signing in or doing anything else. If you like the look of the program you can access it using the coupon code "breathingreddit", which gives you a 100% discount. Free, in other words.  Of course, if you want to help fund these programs (I'm developing more of them), you're welcome to use coupon code "changewaystraining" and pay $6 - still a 60% discount.  Thanks for reading. Don't forget to breathe!    Phelps and his family have been such a bad example of homophobia that no one wants to be associated with them. Today when people think of antigay sentiments, this church is one of the first images that come to mind.   Overall, I suspect that Mr Phelps has inadvertently done more for gay rights than almost anyone on the planet. If we had a parallel universe in which he did not exist, my guess is that equality rights would not be as far along in that one.   Brana's Restaurant, False Creek. For a city with a huge waterfront, we have only a couple of on-the-water places to eat. Brana's is probably the smallest of them all, at about 8 tables, but it's right on the seawall, overlooks a marina, faces west, has a patio, and makes great food. Dinner is great - but the brunch is Vancouver's best. Ate brunch at Hawksworth one day, Brana's the next. Brana's wins by a mile.      	10
 Oh Shit! I laughed way to hard at that! Nice one.   That's not majestic?   Why not repost to /r/PeeView a subreddit I just found out about today.   accidental spray back especially from drunks?   website http://www.wimp.com/luxuryproves/   website http://www.wimp.com/luxuryproves/   website http://www.wimp.com/luxuryproves/   Is that really a subreddit?   Really? I thought they were from the Cloisters in NYC. The site I found the pic on had no info.   More http://www.radass.com/no-pants-subway-ride-day-2015-27-pics/    More http://www.radass.com/no-pants-subway-ride-day-2015-27-pics/   Long time baker here, same advice I've given before. Find the top one or two Bakeries in your area and ask them if you can intern for free and for you to trail the guys working their shifts. Stick it out for as long as you can/they will let you. That's the only way to learn about the night life that a baker has. You work/bake at night and try to sleep during the day. A bakery is open 365 and it's almost impossible to miss even one day for ANY reason. Start going to restaurant auctions in your area, bring a note book and stay even if your not buying anything just to keep notes on the average prices of the equipment you might need. Trust me buying this way will save you thousands of dollars, for example a 30 Qt Hobart Mixer goes for a couple of grand but you might get lucky and pick up one for between 500 and a grand. You should also start going to the Food Shows and Equipment Shows that pop up around the country. I've already got my tickets to this one in March in NYC http://www.internationalrestaurantny.com/Content/16.htm. This is one of the better ones around, I've eaten better here than at the Fancy Food Shows because a guy selling a new oven is going to show off how good it works by making food for everybody! But you can see what trends are coming, what new equipment does what. Buy tickets and make the trip then check out Sullivan Street Bakery on 47 st http://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/and Bien Cuit http://biencuit.com/   in Brooklyn and all the other great bakeries in and around NYC   I hate you! I've been looking for something just like that for the last 6 months just because I want one. I'm lucky in one way that there is a GoodWill just two blocks away but it sucks in another that it is the last one in the area, down from 5 to this last one. Now they have large bins out front and hardly anything gets put on the shelf's anymore, just picked up to go to the larger stores in other neighborhoods.    Here's the link http://vedere.com/accessories/fire-escape-shelf?m=HardPin cid=2014 hscpid=1722369 medium=HardPin source=Pinterest campaign=type10 ref=hardpin_type10 but at that price I think it might make a better DIY project. Still kinda cool though.   Here's the link http://vedere.com/accessories/fire-escape-shelf?m=HardPin cid=2014 hscpid=1722369 medium=HardPin source=Pinterest campaign=type10 ref=hardpin_type10   Check this place out http://www.thebodyholiday.com/, it's where we went and they just had a renovation. Can't say enough good things about it.   Had a winter wedding in NYC, regrouped at the hotel for an hour then had to arrive five hours early for a flight to St Lucia (security and possible snow storm) got to our place, checked in and made the late dinner then crashed in our beautiful ocean view room. I woke up at two in the morning with severe cramps thinking I maybe got food poisoning from the local fish until around 3am I realized I was having kidney stones. I called the front desk for a doctor or an ambulance and was told the Island clinic was closed but if I wanted an English Hospital I would have to take a boat to the Big Island a few hours away and thought fuck that. So there I was in our beautiful marble tiled bathroom jumping up and down trying to make the stones pass on their own. I had some before and was told to do this by my doc if it happened again. After an hour of jumping I finally felt them and slowly worked them out of me over the tub because by now I was like a sprinkler and with a plink, plink plink sound I passed THREE kidney stones by myself in the bathroom. The next morning my wife thought I was pleasuring myself but before my bride went out to enjoy herself my body was having a reaction, I was freezing and my teeth were chattering but there was nothing but a sheet on the bed so my wife covered me with the sheet, my robe and towels from the bathroom. Thank God we were at a resort that two body treatments a day as part of the package and I was able to add one more a day so I had either water treatments or body massages which saved me! BTW this was going on while we were there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tpzBnbL04, also can t say enough about this place and they just finished a million dollar renovation http://www.thebodyholiday.com/   BAM! That's exactly what I was looking for but goddam is it ugly. Do you know the person who did this or is it off the net? Off the top of my head I would bring it back a few feet and just have aluminum from the top of the bus to the bottom for a much cleaner look. If your doing it this way why keep the windshield?   I'm trying to get as much info as I can between converting a school bus, building a Tiny House on a trailer (I've decided that if I go for that I'm going to use a goose neck trailer like this http://imgur.com/wxt6Doe) and I was just wondering if it was legal or possible to do this with a bus with the possibility of removing the front end of a bus and converting it to a goose neck style attachment for a pick up truck which I would need anyway with a tiny house unless I rent one or lease one for a cross country trip. Like this http://imgur.com/VwAG1Wq   Right, but having a vehicle's power package specifically designed for that should be better than stressing out one that was not designed for it.   I'm thinking along the lines of reliability, having a bus full of house stuff and towing a vehicle would add a lot of weight and strain to the engine, right? I've read on some of the school bus conversion blogs that the gas mileage is in the low double digits and I don't want to pay for repair after repair and in some cases adding a new power package (engine, trans rear end) would cost more than the bus itself.   Yea, that's along the lines that I was thinking. I've seen them with goose neck in the bed. I've seen school buses going for $3 grand with a ton of miles on the engines and I'm worried just how reliable they are. I drove for a private bus company years ago and we were using brand new Ford Cabs with extended bodies like this http://imgur.com/0gh6xLd and it was a bitch to get certain parts sometimes and we had our own mechanic and we were based in Brooklyn New York. Something like this http://imgur.com/qWldpwL   Has anybody seen/done something similar?   I have no idea how I missed it? It's gone. Thanks.   Are you kidding? When I saw this I immediately thought of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIjYbG7vB_I. Just think how many snowballs you could build!?!   Nothing. I didn't see it, I didn't karmadecay it because it's a pic of bike racks and it was early and I wish I had used a title something like yours because it's a lot better than mine. I wasn't being sarcastic.   Sheridan, you got me straight up trippen, Boo!   Sheridan, you got me straight up trippen Boo.   Thanks but with only 22 upvotes it's no wonder that I missed it.   Dammit, that's a way better title. Thanks kind internet friend.

Yes, it was a shoot by a photographer/artist. You can search the comments for a link but they were having problems then accessing it.

"French" style is more the second one and is my personal favorite, you can really taste more of the egg that way but when I made them for my family one morning I had to reheat them as they really didn't like them because they were just not used to them. After I learned the difference and when it came time to make omelets in class I was ready. When it was my turn I asked the Chef instructor which style he preferred I make for him, American or French I was rewarded with a smile and nod as well as an A+ for my efforts. These little things count, the poor guy was tasting overdone eggs all morning.   I became friendly with some of my instructor Chefs at my culinary school, especially after they learned I worked nights at an artisan Bakery so I could bring in fresh bread. We met early before class and ate the different things they would cook and I would stand there around the metal table and listen to their stories. I learned that each Chef had to do an egg omelet before they were hired. The reasoning is if you can't do an omelet then how can you be expected to teach students? The tall paper hats worn by executive Chefs have 107 folds in them signifying the ways a French Chef is supposed to know how to prepare eggs so yes, it is very important! Practice, practice and practice!!!!!   Taken in Russia.   That's really great and all but their just gonna put this on a shelf until it pops up to be installed into a poor bastards of a customers house. Just do it to one of their trucks. My favorite Fuck You go to, unscrew the air nozzle cap to their tires and insert a toothpick to keep the valve down and slowly let the air out of the tires. It's non violent, can be fixed easily and is annoying as hell! Just remember to do it towards the end of the day so no customers get screwed for long wait times.   What do you want them to do? Build a forty story hut? Just what is African architecture? From what I understand the whole country would be better off with highways, roads and rail lines than anything else.   I know, I know. Trust me I was in the food industry for over 20 years but now whenever I see a place that sells these this pic is going to pop up in my head.   here http://www.lostateminor.com/2014/12/29/africas-soon-tallest-building-looks-much-like-saurons-tower/   Yes, do you? I have shelf speakers an ex screwed up and have been wanting to repair them ever since.   While it's kinda cool it really doesn't have a lot of room for books so I think this belongs here.   Ok CurlyPants, I for one wish him luck and please take pics and let us see the progress. My wife doesn't want posts so we don't have posts. ;(   More info here http://www.tomfruin.com/watertower.html. It's a beautiful piece of art! It's also spectacular when lit up at night.   More info here http://www.tomfruin.com/watertower.html   More info http://www.tomfruin.com/watertower.html   I had a chef tell me to let it rest over some eggs, preferably the best brown eggs you could get so the Truffle will impart some flavor through the shell so you can have truffled eggs without using the truffle itself. If you can't smell a woodsy aroma immediately then you may have gotten an old truffle. If you have any left then bring it back and try to talk to someone who knows what they are doing in the store. Good luck.    Here you go, exactly what you need https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iKi3sCTpow   Merry Christmas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fyS5CLBgyM    I said to be a nice guy first but sometimes you just have to bend to the situation and become a total ass. It is a fucked up situation and in this day and age where electronics are disposable they think just spend a another few hundred bucks on a new one and everybody's happy. The squeaky wheel gets the grease I'm sad to say. Merry Christmas BTW!   Had a power problem on a 6 year old Toshiba laptop that I bought at Best Buy. Since I had a problem I took it to the geek squad to see if they could help. They took it and two weeks later was told I needed a new motherboard which would cost $900 bucks. I said no and took my laptop home. That day I received a mailer about a computer place called Micro Center opening up in Brooklyn only 10 minutes away so I took a shot and brought my laptop there. After signing in the teck took all of 5 minutes to figure out it was part of the power cord (which I had just replaced a month earlier) that connects from the plug into the power converter. He stood there holding the cord long enough to power the battery in the laptop enough to turn on and make sure that was the problem. They had one in stock for $9 bucks on sale for $6 so Micro Center saved me $ 804 dollars.    My advice, follow some of the good posts here and try to be a nice guy about it, at first. If you still have no satisfaction just stand outside the Best Buy with your laptop and a sign stating your problem, what happened and what Best Buy did or more importantly what they didn't do to help you. Bring friends and just be a pain in the ass until you get some satisfaction. Shit, if your in Brooklyn buy me lunch and I'll do it just for fun. And a lunch.   But but that would be an accurate title and we can't have that!   The story stated that the Statue was pierced by debris. The only way to the torch is up a 40 foot ladder in a small enclosed tunnel like place.

I didn't karmadecay it because I was in a rush to go out shopping with the wife. I'm sorry dude, I really am. I hate it when it happens to be.

Watch the master https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i157JyTRpUw, I would also suggest you get his books La Technique and Le Methode, I consider them bibles of the food world.   more cool pics with a lot in Brooklyn http://cavemancircus.com/2013/09/17/vintage-crime-scene-photos-superimposed-on-modern-ny-streets/   oops sorry http://cavemancircus.com/2013/09/17/vintage-crime-scene-photos-superimposed-on-modern-ny-streets/   sorry http://cavemancircus.com/2013/09/17/vintage-crime-scene-photos-superimposed-on-modern-ny-streets/   http://cavemancircus.com/2013/09/17/vintage-crime-scene-photos-superimposed-on-modern-ny-streets/   More great pics http://cavemancircus.com/2013/09/17/vintage-crime-scene-photos-superimposed-on-modern-ny-streets/   More great pics http://cavemancircus.com/2013/09/17/vintage-crime-scene-photos-superimposed-on-modern-ny-streets/   http://imgur.com/6SH1QMz   Because I first posted to another subreddit and they don't like albums, just a pic.

We could charge our laptops off the rover?   Jeeze, that was fast. How long have you been holding that one in?   Mr Rock, the wife and I were at a comedy show in NYC a while back when you popped up on stage with a Legal pad with jokes written on it. You kept saying lower your expectations to the crown applauding and cheering you but as soon as you saw that a girl nearby was holding up her phone you left the stage and then the building after being on stage for no more than two minutes. I can understand why you would not want new untested material going out over the net before you have a chance to hone it and just make sure it's just funny, but why not have a simple statement given by the mc stating that pictures are ok but only after the set?    Wow. I just found the pic, I didn't do anything to it but I guess that really makes a big difference. Thanks   This really pisses me off! I DID karmadecay it before I posted http://karmadecay.com/results/u4372548   off Tonga. I linked his site.   Yea your right, thanks!   Which Spa and please say it's in the states, the east coast and hopefully near me?   I think they count the flipper on the left as a whole whale.   http://photos.darrenjew.com/gallery-list   Is it just me or is their Bitch banner only allows you to see half the page?   Yes, I think he's just really frustrated about losing his place after 14 years. It must be incredibly hard.   How many pretty living or bedrooms can you look at over and over? Like a lot of rediters who comment I think I would like one or two things about a posted room but would hate the others. Everyone's got an imaginary house they want to live in that's constantly being changed by what they see here. I know mine has.   I noticed those bottom steps are like half the size of normal steps which makes me think it's right there in front of you as you cook on the stove. I think it would still bother me but another redditer posted the whole place, it's in Greece. Nice but just not for me.   Trust me, the first thing to go in a place like this is the quality of the food and the ingredients to make it. They buy cheap and hold for as long as they can which is why I can't stand having a big menu in a small place because once people think the food is sub par while they might buy a coffee or tea they will get anything else somewhere else.   I think the guy hoped that it would add to the customers enjoyment and hopefully add a pleasant experience to their time there but I'm sure towards the end he was watching every person just sit there with one coffee or tea mentally timing them and I'm sure it just drove him nuts. You could just feel the frustration even from that small article, even though raising rents, costs and everything else helped to close him down and he's frustrated and angry. The food industry is crazy.   I found it on a art/design page but they had no info on it.   I heard a story that when Nobu first opened there was a small waterfall along one wall and when the restaurant hit one of the partners wanted to remove it and replace it with two tables. The Chef argued that it was pleasing to look at and he always wanted one in his place, the partner then told  him each table would average about a hundred thousand dollars a year. You have to look at everything from the owners/bosses point of view. Everything costs money.   Hey someguyfromcanada, I haven't heard from you in a while so I must be getting better at posting. I don't think I'm gonna repost this pic. Other redditers have pointed out the photographer like I hoped but the image is not a straight photograph, it was digitally mixed of a few pics by the photographer. Is that OK on /r/Earthporn? If so I may repost but if not I won't. Have a great day and Happy Redditing!   It's all Starbucks fault for things like this. There's one in Union Square, NYC that have a bunch of people come in early, take a table and chairs and actually schedule business meetings all day long, only using their Starbucks reward card to order something when they have to. I was helping a guy open a small Cafe in Brooklyn that was near a college and he had to seriously think about adding free wifi because he didn't want the cafe overrun with broke college students who thought buying a bottle of water entitled them to hours of free wifi and a comfy chair. I'm sure the manager knew how bad financially they were in when she went off on the woman who thought it was perfectly ok to ask for a spoon to eat her yogurt she bought somewhere else and sit and take up space.    If anyone knows who the photographer is please tell us, thanks.   I was working a prom as a bus driver some years ago and over heard a kid brag that he had to wreck 2 new Ford Mustangs to get the BMW he wanted in the first place. He even had the pictures of the wrecks to prove it plus the spoiled little fuck broke a mirror off my bus because he was so "wasted" on the beer they were drinking. The boss billed them triple for the mirror and they didn't blink an eye. It must be nice to be rich. Plus if she did this at 15 it's a little to late to start giving her life lessons now. I guess the nannies didn't do a good job of raising her.   No I'm just somebody who just has a basic knowledge of computers and can't see a good reason to download tons of movies or music using what sounds like a lot of work and trouble from a site that seemed to have a ton of problems a lot of the time. Between Amazon Prime, I Tunes and a couple of other websites I pretty much have everything I need covered.   Thanks that was very informative. I kind of heard something for a while now but wasn't exactly sure what was going on. Does this mean the creators can launch another one using more up to date technology? Go to some little island country and redo everything again?   I never saw it before and I don't think I've ever posted anything to /r/woodworking before but I did Karmadecay it before I posted and just checked it again http://karmadecay.com/results/u4346219    It's never about getting some with certain guys, it's about power. The fact that all these women are saying almost the same story leads me to believe something went on all these years.   He's black, he's rich he makes people laugh and for over a decade he was America's Dad. Look at all the stuff coming out about the European guy Jimmy, there were accusations, rumors and it took his death to finally get the investigation going. Just one story http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-abused-schoolchildren-after-1529217    Yea that's what I thought.

My partner and I had just finished for the day when we realized one of our patients had left her wallet in the back of the ambulance. When we looked it belonged to a woman who lived in the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn. She was on dialysis 3 times a week and that week the elevator was broken so we had to do a 18 flight carry down, bring her for treatment and then bring her back for an 18 flight carry up back to her apt. Thank god we only had to 3 times. Since I lived in Brooklyn I called her and said I would drop it off and asked if her son could meet me downstairs by the street. After I gave him the wallet I was doing some paperwork when I heard little pops, then my side window and windshield explodes all over me, I put the ambulance in gear, throw the full lights and sirens switches and peel out of there like I was doing a quarter mile and didn't stop until I was able to check myself out. The Police laughed and said I was just to tempting a target sitting there for just a few minutes to long. Nobody was caught but I never did that job again.   I originally posted this to /r/RealGirls and was asked by a redditer to repost to /r/WeddingsGoneWild a subreddit I didn't know even existed until then. I Karmadecayed it and nothing popped up but I've come to realize that even karmadecay is not always correct. I've been reposted before myself to the tune of 3 hours later with the same pic to the same subreddit so I can understand your frustration but if you want here goes, ATTENTION EVERYBODY IamSexyJesus POSTED THIS PIC IN THIS SUBREDDIT LAST WEEK!    Happy Redditing   I was hoping to find out but didn't want to be accused of click baiting for a hundred comments.   That's what I thought! Maybe they have an excellent venting system?   http://cavemancircus.com/2013/12/18/hong-kongs-poorest-live-crammed-metal-cages/   Just did aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I'm subscribed to another subreddit I didn't know existed before today.   If your on the East Coast check Harrah's Hotel and Casino, they have a beautiful Buffet and they had All You Can Eat Alaskan Crab Legs when the wife and I were there during the summer but bring your own pliers, the plastic ones really did not work very well.   But the food some how tastes just a little bit better, am I right?   You pee, what do you think the robes are for?   It was probably a special, like the All You Can Eat Alaskan King Crab Legs at Harrah's in Atlantic City last summer. The old people were elbowing each other and calling out others trying to cut the line, they had to give out 3 at a time or there might have been a riot!

Thanks, here's an album of how it came out plus a pic of the roasted sweet potato with marshmallow side dish I was quite proud of. http://imgur.com/a/C4Lxx I had to use twine to wrap the stuffed turkey (what a time to run out of kitchen string, 3 am), it was ugly but got the job done.   Hey!   Yes and it's a demanding one too! http://imgur.com/iq9yY72?   Cooked a large turkey with butter and dried fresh herbs under the skin and got a Turkey Breast, deboned it and stuffed it with cornbread stuffing, Serrano ham and fresh mozzarella cheese so I really had two kinds of turkey. Carved the big turkey one whole side and served the stuffed Turkey Roll in slices. The wife asked for the Turkey Roll and happy wife happy life! I'll add a couple of pics later ok?   There's one in the 60's on Lexington An in NYC if anybody has a need for one.   Oh dude, I'm so sorry. Here let me replace it with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlILYDLA7bM   Dude, I got this off the web like 3 weeks ago. Good luck.   I posted the recipe but as I did it without following one I took my time in writing it out so people could follow it. Please check, thank you.   Recipe:       Take remaining Turkey bits and pieces, roast in a 375 degree oven for 35 minutes, remove from oven and cut up into manageable pieces and place in slow cooker. Scrape as much browned bits (fond) from roasting pan as possible and add to slow cooker.       1 medium onion, peel and roughly chop onion and add to turkey       4 cloves garlic, peel and lightly mash garlic and add to turkey       2 boxes of Vegetable Stock + 1 of water, add to turkey (to cover)    Place cover on slow cooker and cook on low for 6 hours then high for 1 hour.    When done strain into colander, picking out removing as much turkey meat as possible, discarding bones and set aside to cool.    For Soup:       3 large Carrots, peeked and cut into thick wedges       6 medium Potatoes, peeled and sliced into large wedges       1 large Onion, peeled and sliced into large wedges    3 cloves Garlic, peeled and slightly mashed       Salt and Pepper to taste       1 1/2 tbl Dried Parsley       1/2 stick Butter       3 Tbl Olive Oil       In a large pot add olive oil and butter and cook on high until hot, add vegetables and let sit until they are browned, then stir, adding a little salt and pepper and dried herbs, cover and let cook for 5 minutes on low heat.      Remove cover, add strained Turkey stock, add more salt and pepper  as needed and cook on medium heat for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Add reserved turkey meat 5 minutes before you serve the soup. I added some chopped broccoli 5 minutes before I served the soup because I had some in the fridge. Enjoy :)   I did karmadecay it and nothing similar popped up, just went to recheck and there it is a few times from a year ago, dammit! Sorry.   Your absolutely right, I should have made that my first point. It's just that I've done catering and it's one of the hardest jobs in the food industry, the pressure and there is just no room for error.

It's the only sure way to see if it's really something you want to do. The bullshit you see on tv sitcoms and most food related shows only touch the surface.

Imagine a cop walking down a street see's two guys pass something to each other, the cop stops them and finds drugs on one and money on the other and since it was on camera it goes against them? I guess then if a cop films a kid tagging a city owned building, instead of the cop maybe giving the kid a warning and taking his paint away he now feels he has to arrest the kid and with the video proof the city then goes after the kids parents for clean up costs because they are responsible for him?   I think Cops was only here for one episode, had a bike thief, a rat and a bat.   Remember mine had a tang to it from the oj and the cloves, I would lower the cloves, peel and chop the oranges, cook the same then reheat at the party and then add the booze. How about Cinnamon Vodka, Spiced Rum or the old favorite Amaretto? I think they would work great.   Nothing pissed me off more than somebody parking in my DRIVEWAY! I have the only house with a garage on the block, it's 5 feet from the street and they have to pass by 8 fake driveways to reach mine. Just ticketed a guy parked there all day yesterday! print a copy of your apts rules for parking spots and what would happen if she parked there again and just slip it under the door of the apt she's visiting or if you don't know it under her wiper on her windshield. If she parks there again after you've been nice then ticket or tow her. I've had tickets given but have not towed anybody yet and in NY once a ticket is issued the tow fee is on them.   I like it wet http://i.imgur.com/ld3rCeM.png   I posted the recipe, sorry for the delay.   It looked like a small bar was just inserted through the rim, not like one of the large boots so the guy was able to remove the lug nuts and then the whole tire.  	197

    I find this usually happens when your zoomed in too much. zoom out a bit and then it should work cause it works for me.    I'm really looking forward to American Sniper are there any movies out right now that are similar to it that I should watch?   holy crap do people these days actually know how to spell? "you actually take the works right out of my mouth" do you even english?      THE NORTH REMEMBERS!    they need to demand that sony sell spiderman back to marvel.       Sony should release it claiming they have changed the ending when actual fact they havent. how would north korea know? unless they had a spy actually go watch the released cut.    Dont keep trying if it keeps declining it could still be charging you for each time you try. Id wait a bit, most likely the servers are getting borked.    Nice set up, like how you have the tv on the wall.       If we dont have a hulk movie by phase 4 im gonna be pissed.          It will easily play it, dont know about ultra tho. I run it on a gtx 660 with medium to high settings at 1080p.       Its one of the best pc ports ever. so yes you should buy it. Plus its not a bad game. even though its like an hour long if your going to play the phantom pain next year youll need to play this.    Nope works for me. I have an I7 4790, GTX 660, 8GB ram.          I got MGSV: GZ and Flight Simulator X.       Bilbo saw a dragon, frodo saw eagles. bilbo wins.       yea not funny at all.       enjoy your downvotes.       i reckon someone already has a copy of it and is sitting on it waiting for the right moment to leak it.    Didnt angels and demons cause a bit of controversy?       Hopefully someone leaks it.    well fuck sony, I hope the hackers screw them up so bad that they have no other choice to sell spiderman back to marvel.       its a good work laptop but its no gaming machine.    Ive enjoyed every minute of this show but im down to the last 3 episodes of season 2 and i really dont want it to end thats how much ive enjoyed it. Im debating whether or not to finish it now or wait for season 3 so i wont have to wait as long.    Nice, This is mine here in New Zealand. Its about 23 outside right now. http://iforce.co.nz/i/yv1r4bep.svc.jpg   because there never was a trailer. it was all rumor. it was never actually officially confirmed.       why? msi is awesome.    I personally will always go with the i7 model as the extra threads for work will come in handy. If you're just playing games then an i5 will be alright but youll find a few years down the line the i5 will begin to bottle neck when compared to the highest i7 at the time because of the extra threads. In some cases there is usually only a $50 difference between an i5 and i7 which is another reason i go for an i7.     did anyone else read that in the style of the CS voice over lol.    most likely testing it.    Apparently they are sold out http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2plz1b/newegg_is_sold_out_of_its_free_3_games_from_the/   usually there is a countdown timer on the steam page of a game thats releasing in a day or so but there is nothing on he ground zeroes page. It just says coming soon. Doesn't that seem a bit strange? or is it just that Konami doesn't know how to use steam?   yea? this was announced ages ago.    are you overclocking? try resetting to stock clocks and see what happens.    haha lol that sure surprised me.    its already the 18th here in New Zealand and im wondering why it hasn't started yet :(   sell the pc for what ever he can get and save up for new rig?   we already have DRM with movies from Itunes you cant play the file outside of Itunes hence its locked to one player. Thats DRM enough imo.    yes we have a special coming next year followed by S4 in 2016 but with Cumberbatch now signed on to play Doctor Strange i fear that we are only going to get less and less Sherlock despite Cumerbatch saying he wants to play him to an old man i fear his schedule just wont allow it which begs the question how much longer can the series keep going?    I agree and disagree. The way light sabers were used in the prequels was definitely one of the few positives in my books. That final duel between Obiwan and Anakin was incredible, it was just so beautifully choreographed it was like watching a well performed ballet. But i also agree that the duel between vader and luke in empire strikes back was amazing to. It all comes down to whether or not you prefer the prequels or original trilogy and clearly your a fan of the original trilogy and i can respect that. I seem to be one of the few fans who like both trilogies.    I'm assuming that's why it says potential. Doesn't necessarily mean it will happen.       love the way that 980 lights up. so awesome.       Bad AutoModerator!    obviously fake since GFWL is no more.    yes those specs are real, and yes the ps4 and xbox one are basically low end pcs that use proprietary hardware and cant be upgraded. Basically they are pcs without all the bells and whistles.    you ether have a shitty isp or you have some serious line issues ether in your house or between you and the exchange. get that shit sorted bro.    man thats to close to the edge.    he said $300 lol not $1000.    Just show them to this. http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide   Needs a bit more cable management when you get the time. But other than that looks good.    no way your building a pc with that you need at least $450 but even thats pushing it.    who has a limit? lol.       I find your lack of taste in movies disturbing.    its a small game bro, its like 2 and half hours long that sounds about right.    1080p easily. 1440p will be pretty decent but you may need to lower some settings. 4k will struggle.    you should be able to point steam to the directory of the second hard drive.    Because i already have everything i want. who knows this feeling? :(   i have $109 to be exact lol    na it sucks.    i got the images from here http://www.pcgamer.com/windows-10-leaked-build-reveals-new-xbox-app/   http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/RnuQlY_Cru8O.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/ERrQ54vc4qxc.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg  what do you guys think of this new xbox app for windows 10? is it a steam like app or just more DRM? i noticed on the bottom left there is a store icon. How cool would it be if we could purchase and play xbox games on pc? it would be a step in the right direction on microsofts part to make a unified experience which is what they hinted at a while ago with that windows 10 announcement that showed a pc, xbox one, tablet etc all lined up against each other. What do you guys think.   say you need to test it to make sure its not DOA.   Its a good game, dont listen to this review.    dude thats not good. Do other temperature reading programs have this issue cause if they do you probably need to reseat your cpu. just sayin.     yea that bit was leaked in the emails. its happening in january.       At least they're patching it. gotta give some credit. They could of chosen to just leave it the way it was but they did not.    The Crew,Fire Works Simulator, Final Fantasy XIII-2.   its actually one of the better COD games.    clearly a problem with your gpu. The game runs perfectly fine for me.       ether the cooler is not mounted properly or you need new thermal paste.    BUT 2 GPU  MUST BE BETTER THAN 1 AM I RITE? :(   LOL! INB4 CONSPIRACY.       What are your thoughts on the pc version so far? i picked it up and im actually enjoying it more than XIII.    Looks correct to me? what cpu do you have? nvm I see your flair, it says you have a i5 3570 which is the correct cpu its showing.    I would of said Aaron Taylor Johnson but hes already quick silver. Most of the good guys are taken already. they would probably have to cast an unknown but someone who could stand toe to toe on screen with the avengers cast.                his facial expressions tho lol   dude nice!    And Im actually enjoying this more than FFXIII, makes you realize how badly written the lightning character actually was and the story is just so much better (especially without lightning) in XIII-2 imo.    Inb4 Bring Back Brody.    Even if its just for a cameo like he bumps into Quinn out on the streets of Pakistan and gives him a piece of advice or something about going rogue. Or he confronts Carrie about a CIA conspiracy or something. But they need to get him involved it would be awesome.    what temps are you getting? sounds like it might have gotten a bit dusty or your power supply isn't coping with the stress.    January 27th.    there was? got a link.    What movies do you consider to be a hidden gem?      haha this is awesome.    basically what the title says. do you think well see more high frame rate movies after the hobbit or does the format die with the release of the last hobbit movie?   Yea I skimmed through it and stopped when i saw pics of the actual script.    Ouch. Hope it turns out as good as Skyfall or at least Casino Royale.    Just scan your computer, thats all you can really do atm. Perhaps change your passwords to all your important accounts just in case.    Correct. ALI213 is the default name a particular pirated version of the game uses.    I almost choked on my own saliva reading this haha.    where have you been? hes talking about all the leaked emails from sony.    Im enjoying it. Havent really had an issue with the micro transactions since i dont use them.    Dude he's been awesome as spidey and it will kill him if this happens. Hes a true fan. They have to keep him.       thats a good thing! people need to realize that adaptations that steer away from their source material is a good thing since not everything translates well into film.    Box and Hardware Pr0n. Nice!    lol dat pirated copy of AC:Unity.    This has never happened to me! off all things that have happened to me no one has ever tried  to scam me on steam. where are these so called scammers? never encountered one at all.    I dont even want to watch it because i know it will just piss me off.       Whats the best flight simulator out right now?   uncharted games usually do end up looking just like the footage in the trailers.       And Oliver stayed dead. Would you guys still watch if Roy took over team arrow?   I just bought the crew and i cant even activate my key cause apparently the servers are down or their are connection issues. Is this happening for anyone else?      Seems to be a common trend these days. the first couple of months of the new year are usually the dumping ground for movies you would think would be better suited for directed to dvd releases. March has gotten better over the last couple of years with movies like the hunger games taking advantage of the less competition during that time but Jan-Feb continue to deliver nothing but crap. Any particular reason for this?         Just got back from seeing the battle of five armies. I need some time to digest what i saw but over all it was really good imo a fitting conclusion to the middle earth saga.   After what happened on yesterdays episode. This now opens the door to a civil war in the MCU with the rise of more Inhumans it gives a reason for stark to get nervous about people with special abilities and to start talking to the government about how to deal with these people.      Can anyone tell me what movies are still canon in the x-men timeline?   For instance mine are the james bond films i always tell my self ill re watch skyfall or quantum of solace this weekend but nope it never happens. Anyone else got a movie their like that with.    I feel like it doesnt really represent the tone of the film all to well i think they should of just cut it and started straight at the marvel logo followed by quills dancing scene as usual. would of been much better imo             But this time have him direct it instead of Blomkamp. Surely Microsoft knows they have a good thing going here with Halo and that people actually want to see this made! the short films Blomkamp did for the halo 3 advertising campaign were amazing so if they could still get Blomkamp involved as producer along side Jackson it would be perfect. If you dont know what im talking about check this out.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejw3xpPIVbQ   I quite often see people complaining about this one. Anyone care to explain?         Cause they are too serious for Collin Firth's taste hehe.    So in just a few days the last hobbit movie finally releases which means Peter Jackson's middle Earth saga will be complete. The hobbit trilogy has had mixed reception compared to LOTR but thinking a head how will the trilogy go down in history? do you think more people might start to appreciate over time? or will people continue despise it?   Gonna buy the game tonight. Any one know where the cheapest place is to buy it?      Cause your cpu and gpu are running hotter than normal. God damn it. Time to invest in better cooling.       Havent played the game since release on pc so decided to try patch 1.3 and I must say even though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out like still being able to glitch in walls and swimming in mid air lol in terms of frame rate and just in general the ability to just play the game without stuttering its a huge improvement. Just thought id add my two cents.   Specs of my rig.   I7 4790 8GB RAM GTX 660 2gb     i mean i thought this would be something that doesnt happen until further down the line like im talking the last season of the show or something, but it looks like they want to get it out of the way. Anyone else think its too soon?         I dont understand why so many people seem to struggle playing him. Just spam q, whats so difficult about that?   So It looks they are going the DOFP route and are going to reset everything in the terminator universe or at least some major events in the universe and then start fresh from when ever the franchise is reset to. Are we ok with this? what if they erase the first 2 movies and essentially make them pointless cause of the reset?      3DM said by the end of this week? any news?         Lets take the hobbit for example, i see nothing wrong with it. ive enjoyed it right from the start and i love what peter jackson has done with middle earth and yet people still complain about silly arguments like too much CGI or he ruined the movie by adding stuff that wasn't in the book. but its not just the hobbit where im seeing this.   The new star wars trailer for instance everyone is complaining about something whether it be the damn light saber or the lense flare near the millennium falcon or the CG in the teaser, yes ive seen people complain about that to. UGH. what is it with people and why cant we just enjoy what we have been given am I missing something here?   it could be a lot worse even if its only from people who have been to press screening reviews.   http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_the_battle_of_the_five_armies/     You know its going to piss of the batman fans.          I thought it was really good even though the premise is kind of stupid i enjoyed it for what it was and it actually kind of worked for me despite it being a silly diluted plot it was still an enjoyable flick imo.       What type of stories would you like to see made in to movies? The obvious one would be an origin of gollum movie since we only catch a glimpse of it in return of the king and hear little tid bits of it through dialog, i think gollum is interesting enough to carry his own movie. Also one issue i can see being a problem is what would be the end game for a MECU? since LOTR is essentially the end any movies would have to take place prior to LOTR. Unless they came up with their own stories on what happens after LOTR but I cant really see what working well. Any ideas?                  Made a poll since im curious to see which version is more popular. Also perhaps explain in the comments what made you swing towards that paticular version. For me it was alpha sapphire because it has lugia and i like lugia more than Ho-Oh :)  http://strawpoll.me/3101987   I just bought alpha sapphire of the eshop. How long should the download take?   If your a gamer then youll know 2014 has been kind of shit for gaming at least imo. So many big titles have been delayed till next year which got me wondering. Why dont we hear about movies getting delayed as much as games? I mean sure we had the amazing spiderman 3 delayed this year to 2018 and as far as i know thats the only one this year. Though to be fair i dont keep up with movie news as much as i do video game news so I may be wrong on that part but if someone could enlighten me as to why movie delays dont seem to be as common id be interested to hear the reason behind it.    Who else agrees?   In case you need your memory refreshed.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqO5wlwQcRI   im interested in movies like The Prestige and Now you see me.    In todays day in age with the likes of itunes and netflix. I feel like we should be at a point now where if we wanted to we could pay the price of a movie ticket and get to watch the movie at home in private the same day its released at the movies but it hasnt happened yet. Im just curious why?    I think my game might have glitched because im pretty sure ive done everything right up until this point. At 5:18 in this walkthrough there is a door that opens so you can get to the second pulse generator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ekz6R_m-SE but the thing is in my game the door is red and refuses to open. ive killed all the flood and covenant but it its not opening. Any ideas.       Id be willing to pay something ridiculous for an epic game like that.   There were rumors about him being involved in the film. Was that his voice? doing the whole "there has been an awakening" dialog? it sounds a hell of a lot like his smaug voice but slightly altered.       I feel like its an appropriate thing to do.    I sated in the other thread that I thought the dark knight was the boring one of the trilogy mostly because of the dry Harvey Dent plot with all the politics while begins and rises are great action films the dark knight seemed more like a political spy thriller rather than a straight up action movie like the other 2 and may have been why i found it boring. Anyone else agree?   That bit of marketing always confuses me and it makes no sense. I mean if they mean that it will be in cinemas exclusively for a while then sure but other wise to me it makes no sense when we know it will be on dvd and bluray and itunes and all that later on so whats the point?   Got my xbox one yesterday and ive got a few downloadable games that im currently downloading would like to check on their status when im out. Is there a way i can check on them when im not home?   Anyone know if this weeks ep will be the last for the year? most of the shows I watch have ended for their fall finale.       Im expecting a bunch of emotional character close ups, maybe one VFX shot and one last shot of something that will make the fans have a WTF moment to build hype for the next year. I heard the last shot of the trailer is meant to be the villain holding vaders helmet or something?   cant afford to go the movies tonight so ill be watching something at home on the internet. Ill watch pretty much watch anything except for horrors and romantic comedies. so fire away.    Why hasnt it been posted yet?   It sucks use Imgur instead.         	200
 That is the first time I've heard of that sensation! It does sound more enjoyable than the spins, though.   Who is your favorite marvel villian? Why is he or she your favorite?   My first time getting high was amazing because I was in a secure, fun environment that contained good friends and plenty of visual and audial stimuli.   Have you ever experienced an 11? I appreciated the picture!   	4
       That's interesting, I recently started playing this game and I've been watching their videos for a long time. So it was cool to find that little Easter egg    There's graffiti in the alley of the safe house from "The Creatures". I don't know if that's always been there, but I know they did that live stream not too long ago.  Nova's and Sp00ns channels are spray painted on the wall saying one of them sucks.

    What's the funniest joke you know?   Hey guys, we're doing a charity today called Replay for Life!  All money donated goes straight to Relay for Life, an organization helping to fight cancer.  We're live streaming our games today, so feel free to check it out, spread the word, and donate, via www.replayforlife.org!   Hello Gabe, Wolpaw, EJ, Ido, and Coomer!  Glad to have you guys here!  I was wondering if you had any tips for wannabe game developers who only have coding experience.  While I can code a game fairly well, I don't know many people who can do the artwork, nor do I know many people who can do the music/sounds, and while I want to get into the industry, it's been a long struggle.  What tips would you have for either meeting people who can do so, or finding ways around it (preferably under a college-student budget)?  On another note, any internships available at Valve, and if so, could I have one? XD         I've gotta say, Github made their generator very creative lol   Hey guys, a quick compo idea I posted a few days ago.  If this is not the right subreddit please just let me know (not on here too often still), otherwise enjoy!  The name of this minicompo is The Github Name Game.  When you create a repository on Github, it generates a random project name as a suggestion.  The idea with this is to create an entire project based around whatever name you get (for example: I got duck-batman XD).  If you're interested, post the entry on my blog post below.  I'll try to keep an eye on this thread (or elsewhere if it get's moved).  No prizes or anything for this as of yet, but even if there are none, it's still a good resume booster I'd say!

 Conscious because they are alive, and instinctively do what is necessary to maintain that life. They are instinctual because everything they do is driven by primal need. Nothing outside of instinctive behavior exists for the animal. There isn't much room for debate here.  I think we are perhaps saying the same thing but just in different words. Yes, the property of free will cannot be taken away from a human being, it is an intrinsic part of it. A property if you will. But what I meant to say is that this free will can be curtailed, limited or impeded (whichever choice of words you prefer). And by this I mean to say exactly your last point: I will to jump in the air and fly, but that is impossible. I "wish" to, but laws do not permit this. This shows that man is subject to a higher law, or Will.. if you will.  I may in fact decide to jump off a cliff in defiance. I am free to do so. But the consequences will likely be fatal because there is a higher Will that will not permit me to do so.  To be quite honest, i forget how we got here. Wait, what were we talking about to begin with? Right, taking away a persons free will (or, as you'd prefer, restraining acts of will, is sometimes the only way to ensure compliance).    Prove the existence of my deity? You presume that I have even the minutest interest in convincing you of a fact, for which you already hold a contrary, rigid, and obstinate opinion about. No sir. That is your issue entirely. I hold no qualms about how you wish to spend your time on this or that. But I gather you will rather converse with other equally ignorant and arrogant religious fanatics, which atheism is only just the converse since you have no proof of your faith either. Spare me, your comment is so clich . It is naive and childish to assume you can cleverly and subtly imply that I do not hold a stronger command of language, logic and reasoning than you do. Not to claim that I do, but next time you wish to give yourself a false air of superiority, at least do so in a novel manner.    I think you are forcing the argument in your last statement. Everyone in jail doesn't wish to be there. Fundamentally, they have surrendered their free will for the duration of their sentence. They must abide by certain rules and regulations. Consider, how can their will be free when it is subject to a very confined set of rules, especially what and when to eat, sleep and where they may or may not go? Your argument implies that slavery also doesn't take away a persons free will. Actually, by your definition, nothing can since unless you are bound and gagged, you can still apply your logic and assert that there is no loss of free will. Do you see what I am getting at?  Secondly, you are right in a certain way in the first part of your comment. All of these creatures do not have the free will that the human spirit is endowed with. However, this is not to mean that they are not conscious, they are not self-conscious. And they operate and instinctively follow laws which indicate how they must exist. So they can never be wrong or bad in that sense. This is why many seeing ones in the past point to observing the animals to discover where and how we err with respect to natural laws.   So do animals have free will? Do viruses and bacteria? Are they morally correct or wrong given your framework?  Morality is not arbitrary, it is fixed. Mans understanding of it is what varies.  People who are unable to coexist with themselves and other creatures in equilibrium do not deserve to chose. They must be checked until they learn to act otherwise. Unless you think correctional facilities do not exist where a person surrenders his free will until he is deemed fit to regain it.   You are right. And you are wrong. Correlation does not imply causality, but since randomness is impossible, we either admit our ignorance, or work with what we can understand at the time. I don't think a Supreme being will have the time to meddle in the affairs of man. He will likely have setup automatic laws that run everything without Him having to interfere with anything except it extraordinary and rare cases.  So you are right in that it is prickly for one to punish and act arbitrarily as is wrongly attributed to Him, but when has man ever had the right conception of anything? I submit that there are immutable and inviolable laws in place that govern everything automatically. Making this world we live in a sophisticated, fully automatic, work of perfection. These laws are observable physically as gravity, attraction, and reciprocity. Of course, the non physical manifestations do nit differ principally, but only in the outer form.   For example, physically you may observe the law of reciprocity when you sow wheat or corn. You end up with a multiplied return or harvest. One grain of wheat yielding multiple grains, and likewise corn. But always of the same nature of the seed that was down. One seed, multiplied harvest. Applied to the non material: each thought, word, or deed is subject to same. Taking deed for example, deeds of a specific nature will always only return same, but in abundance: kindness yields kindness, love, hate, envy, malice, cruelty, lustfulness, jealousy, wickedness, etc. Multiple forms, same perfectly ordered process.  So it is simple and clear that when man reaps whatever harvest, it is always and only that which he himself has placed in the mechanism that is returned to him unfailingly. There is no deviation or change in this, as such a thing would imply imperfection, which is absolutely out of the question. Just like gravity: it is perfectly consistent in its working. You will never find any deviation. In the operation of gravity! It is inviolable, immutable, and perfect in its working. So also are the other laws which rest in, govern, and  sustain everything that exists, and to which all that exist is subject, including man.      I was of the same opinion not too long ago. But if you unassumingly examine yourself, you will find that interacting with superficial people will leave a minute impression on you. And this builds over time.   Perhaps I don't understand your question. But I'll do my best to answer. As I have progressed through life (progression here meaning gotten older, advancing in all else will be a matter of stiff debate) I've found fewer and fewer people who see things the same way. So my circle of friends is very small. I find it highly unbearable being around people who spend time talking about the most inconsequential, superficial things. So yes, I agree. Not very many people. This doesn't bother me. What does is thinking one is a victim of chance or that one has no input on how things play out. Which I believe is not supported by evidence. I believe there are laws that govern every happening. They are the same as the laws that direct the flow of water and air, invisible microwaves etc. It is all a uniform, gigantic mechanism. This is how I see the world. A mighty machine that we understand a bit more about every day. This understanding will be severely checked however, if we are to make assumptions about things being random, and just chance happenings. This is very remindful of how religion chooses to keep power by ensuring its congratulation remains largely, if not entirely, naive...   Excellent point. I apologize since I see no separation between philosophy, science or anything else that is real. They are all derivatives of mathematics anyway and so are subject to the same principles albeit in a different form. Sorry for veering off topic but I quite disagree that a car accident is random. Yes they happen to many people usually out of carelessness or what have you. But that any person x can get crushed under a car does not agree with my logic of causality. In this universe there are causes and effects. I believe nothing exists outside of these two things... At least within our universe anyway. Thanks for the interesting conversation, I will reflect on what you have so kindly shared.   Again cite your facts sir. You are projecting your narrow views as though I should just accept them as facts. You need to prove them first.   I think I can say the same for you. Its usually a tactic used by one who has nothing to offer in form of counter argument. You responded to non of the facta and examples I gave. And instead took the 'high' road.   Thank you. I think the idea that it would be different does give room for exciting what ifs. But the observations I indicate do not exclude the what ifs. There is a myriad of possibility even within the laws that we understand. Consider the many different races even on earth. The diversity of the language. The physical structures, etc. Imagine how much more variation there would be in human forms in a different planet. But they will all have that optimal configuration. Just differently adapted to the environment as you allude to. Like height, size (think giants), speed, agility, flexibility, etc. It is a much richer and actually more practically modeled realm of thinking since we have a working basis and principle upon which our model can be tested, refuted etc.   In reading your response, it sounds like you completely agree with me. But then you default your conclusion to your preconceived idea. The examples of random occurrences which you have cited are actually not random at all. As you rightly said: we just cannot understand the underlying process yet. That is in no way suggestive of it being random. I submit that since we have established this fact in the larger things, it must be the same uniform operating principle in all things. Why? I'm sure you can reason this out logically for yourself. The largest tree follows the same basic process and laws as the minutest multicellular plant, same with animals of which man is a very special of shoot (I say this for the lack of a better word because man is in no wise the same as animal. They merely share the same biological equipment -body). You have no proof to indicate that somehow the process should be different and random with small things. On the contrary we have many observable examples showing the same basic process/laws repeated in all things great and small. I think it is a much more logical conclusion, if even in the absence of case specific evidence, to assume that nothing is excluded from this norm, which we are able to observe in everything we have come to understand so far.    Please cite your morality source. And while you do, I'd like you to acknowledge that it is a subjective definition. Put together and agreed upon by what we can all agree is a poorly advanced and highly ignorant masses (as is demonstrated daily). So, while your argument is solid, it is solidly based on a flawed assumption of what morality is understood to be. I for one do not agree with your interpretation of morality so I can not accept your claim. Perhaps if you base your claim on a more fundamental universally accepted fact, then I may be inclined to follow your reasoning.   Let me ask you, can you think of anyone or group of people, or entire nations that have shown so much incompetence that, for their safety and survival, as well as for those who exist around them, they should be absolutely controlled perhaps 2/3rds of the time? Just think about this very deeply, not superficially and you will find countless examples of such persons or people. After a bit of reflection, you will see that in some not very well executed way, this is how children are raised. This is how the correctional facilities were designed to function. This is what happened in Germany during the world war. This is what needs to happen in the middle east! So yes, while I agree with you that it appears wrong, this thought is only apparent. Look at how peacefully the otherwise unruly guys were able to coexist. Instead of spending their days drinking and harming one another at night, the work together productively. And they even voluntarily submit to this because they see that it is better for them. Your assessment is the common reaction by most people who haven't deeply reflected on the matter.   Please can you cite this assertion? There is nothing random about survival. Only the strong survive. This way, they are able to reproduce and pass on the optimized genetic encoding for the next generation. So that only the strong is propagated in both prey and hunter. The planet did not just assume a temperature, the temperature is formed by the contents of the planet. And therefore adjusts accordingly. As the contents change through optimal driven adaptation, so does the planets conditions (temp, air, etc). Mutation is not random, that is fantasy. All changes are adaptation. Viral and bacterial mutation are never random, they are adaptive. So is all mutation. Again there is no proof of randomness. Even a random number generator is not random since it is an algorithm. In reality there is nothing random. The appearance of randomness is only apparently so because we lack the proper understanding to comprehend the inner working. Think of all the ill-understood processes which science considered random but have since been revised when scientific observation is able to comprehend the process.   Well, the theory lends itself to that primary assumption as well. All life on earth is based on carbon. The question is why? Is it possible for life to be based on anything else? And even if so, i submit that carbon is the optimal configuration (atomically) upon which life can be built. This implies that any and all life, wherever it may be will follow the same exact configuration based on what is optimal. In the same way, requirements for life and sustenance follow the same principle. So that in reality, were you to some how be transported to this alien world, you probably may not even notice because the same things will likely be repeated there as well. Does this make sense? Why do you assume and assert that they will have a different atmosphere? air pressure, and flora etc? The question we should ask is can life be sustained otherwise?       Wait, let me get this straight. So we accept that aliens may or may not exist. But that if they do, they can have these impossible size or characteristics such as odd colors, 4 legs, etc. Much of which I believe is ludicrous by the way. But then this idea of a winged animal able to generate some form of combustion through its airways is outlandish? Let me give examples of animals that should not exist based on your reasoning: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2185313/Monsters-deep-British-filmmaker-wrestles.html These are just a small sample of sea animals. Many of whom will soon become extinct, and closed minded people such as yourself will quickly banish them to the realm of fantasy and fairy-tale.    I am still not past the assumption that they would be any different from the people you see around you. I don't really understand why they have to absolutely look different. I believe we are configured this way because it is optimal for our species.  Based on what we can observe, the laws under which the universe operates, which we are trying to understand through the sciences of physics, chemistry and biology etc, (which are really only observation of what is out there) is present everywhere. All the celestial bodies, of which the earth is one of billions, operate under the same uniform laws.  I believe it is just naive to think that randomness is responsible for anything. There is no randomness observed here on earth (except people and their childish nature) but by and large, everything operates under strict laws. If this is so, then i would expect aliens to look exactly as we do!   I met my wife at a seminar. And she into anime and ask the games I loved as a kid. Seriously though, you will also find the same type of women in the plus size section as you would in any other section, haven't you figured that out yet? Let me help you. Think of all the idiots you've met your entire life (male or female), do they all fall in any one section? There's your answer.   I'm a computer scientist, but it grinds my gears that the term 'singularity' has been given an ill-fitting meaning.   "A gravitational singularity or spacetime singularity is a location where the quantities that are used to measure the gravitational field become infinite in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system. These quantities are the scalar invariant curvatures of spacetime, which includes a measure of the density of matter."  Can we come up with a better term to describe a fully independent form of AI?    Actually, they managed to show one side as being completely wrong ALL the time. And how until the very end, we assumed the same. The humans were wrong ALL the time. ALL of it. So it wasn't the case that both sides were right and wrong. One side was right. One side was always right. And one side was wrong, that side was ALWAYS wrong! I really enjoy your emphasis on the fact that Will consciously attacked weapons and never the humans.   No. I believe they were the ones playing God actually. All the machine was doing was largely undoing the heap of mess humans had created in their self delusion that they were gods..   I couldn't help but notice this too. And to be exact here: being a computer programmer does not in any way give you some 'expert' understanding of this movie or the practical and theoretical aspects of AI. It is a computer 'science' related field and is largely in the realm of research. And from my experience, most, if not all researchers are not programmers. Which isn't to mean that they couldn't unleash beautiful lines of code. There just isn't time to focus on that sort of thing. So AI has little to do with programming and more to do with concepts in logic or machine learning.   It is very interesting your comment: "like minded drones" I think that all successful people are the same. They are like 'like minded drones'. The idea is that people who have found the perfect way of being, will more than likely appear dull, like minded, and as though they were drones. But they only appear that way to those who have yet to achieve the same level.  Food for thought.   That there was only one other upvote on your comment shows how very lost and shallow most people are. This is the deepest movie I have seen this year or perhaps in the past decade. In fact, I believe the depth of this movie goes far beyond your description. You can take this from a religious or spiritual angle as well: Every happening where a prophet, or let us take Christ for example, came to mankind to help them, the end result was always the same. In their superficial 'always-wanting-to-know-better', they rejected such help. Scorned, plotted and had such a one eliminated (usually through suffering and death). Now, play back Transcendence and you will see the same. The ego-maniacal conceit of human beings is laid bare in this movie. Here we have a being who, armed with all the knowledge of how everything works and can fit together, shows them a way that is best for them. But, in their self delusion created by the conceit of thinking oneself of always-knowing-better, they convince themselves that this person is dangerous and that his motives are selfish etc. Imagine the irony that this is in fact a perfect example of humanity today. You will hear superficial claims of wanting peace, harmony, a perfect world. But if you would dare to lead them in such a direction, well, you need only look at history to understand your fate at the hands of humanity. Thanks for the review. I hope my small addition makes sense.   Restrain your tongue half-ling. Nobility demands a bird's eye view. No self-respecting man will hide as a toilet when he can confine himself in the ceiling.   Here is a thought: Nothing in my post here indicated or alluded to anything of 'sexual' intercourse, which is purely a physical affair. It is only hear on earth, on this material plane where sexual intercourse is to be found. It is also on this plane that you will find sexual organs for reproduction. This can not be difficult to understand. So, once again, if you understand that there is no occurrence of this on other parts of creation, then it is logical to conclude that differences arising from activity related to physical activity will not exist either. This does not contradict anything of what I have said. It does however, highlight the need for me to state explicitly that I am referring here to spiritual activity. It is in the nature of this spiritual activity that certain physical changes occur. That is, if a person of female gender distorts herself, then this will have damages that will eventually manifest in some later physical part that renders the person useless both spiritually and physically. Which is an ejection mechanism in creation that you can clearly observe everywhere if you look for it.    Like a plague, this ignorance has spread everywhere with rapidity that barely conceals the motive force behind it: darkness. The idea of equality has been twisted and perverted so that it is as though it stands on its head. Yes, woman is no less valuable than man. On the contrary, she stands higher than man spiritually because in her delicate nature, she forms the bridge through which spiritual currents streaming from on high can be received and dispensed to man. Without which everything must fall to ruin. Or why do you think Lucifer, who once an Arch angel, had a perfect understanding of the laws that govern all happenings in creation. He knew, that in order to cause the fall of the whole, he needed only to cut off man from the Light. And his attack on the human woman, depicted in the Bible, showed precisely how, in so doing man was destined to follow once she, the guardian of the flame, fell.   Male and female are both equal. There is balance in this as in everything in creation. This is expressed in the equal armed Cross, who's beams are of equal length: the vertical representing positive, active, masculine activity, and the horizontal representing negative, passive, feminine activity. Their activities are different. It is not for nothing that their bodies and constituent organs are different anatomically? If two tools differ in appearance, does it not imply then that they are meant for different activity?  This is a delusion created by the vanity that infects the female gender today (and the males too). Yes, wrongly, women have been treated unequally and their work and activity considered unimportant and to be of less value as their male counterpart. But instead of elevating the feminine (passive) activity to one of equal value and importance, female human beings, in the name of "progress", want to take on masculine activities. Can you see the contradistinction between the two? While the latter bears semblance to the goal: equality, it is only apparently so because it leads to a perversion! The former however, is the correct way to restore balance, that is, raising the passive, feminine activity of woman to a level equal in value to that of man.  This clearly does not endorse a mixing of the two. Let us examine an example. Picture to yourself, two knives. One a serrated blade, and the other having a smooth blade. Without debate, we conclude that both are knives and of equal value in the workshop (value meaning they are both useful for the purpose of cutting a piece of material). My first claim is that they are fundamentally different in their structure and construction in such a way as to indicate the nature of their activity. This difference however, gives a clue as to what activity each type of knife is meant for. One for cutting through rough, fibrous densities and the other for more even, finer densities.   We may choose to use either knife for the cutting that material (activity) meant for the other. One will perhaps get away with doing this once or twice without causing any permanent damage. But a continued, persistent abuse in this manner will ultimately damage the knifes edges. The result is that it becomes completely useless for any profitable activity in the workshop. Having lost its smoothness or serrated-ness at the edges, it can now no longer function properly. Unable to cut either smooth or fibrous material, it becomes useless and must be done away with.  Now, picture before your mind's eye countless other examples in creation and you will find no end to the number of such examples that follow the same logical operating principles. Then we can safely assert that this is a law of nature. Whereby we can assert that given any fruit of nature (be it man, beast, or material form - plants, earth, rocks, waters etc), the form (i.e. the manner in which it is constructed, including internal anatomy) distinctly bears witness to the nature of its activity. An activity of which, once changed, will damage this form resulting in the fruit becoming useless and ultimately being done away with.  Such is the nature of creation. Men or women who, in their thinking themselves better, in their ego-maniacal obstinate belief that the laws of creation should bend to their will, believe that the obvious differences in the construction of the body of both sexes is immaterial, and therefore choose to indulge in activity and behavior akin to the opposite sex incessantly, will ultimately damage the bodies entrusted to them. That is, effemination, or masculinization will result in the lose of those qualities, which are characteristic of the particular gender. Resulting in the inability to function properly. These deluded ones become sterile males and barren women. This is natures way of 'doing away with,' because such human beings have become useless for any spiritually profitable purpose in this great workshop of creation!   The enigmatic delay of springs arrival in the United States had astonished the population in general. There were fewer flowers, a lot of snow and heavy showers, unsurprisingly these are the climatic changes affecting the entire planet at the moment, nevertheless what really left a deep scar this spring was the inexplicable tragedy that took place at University of Virginia Technical College, where a young South Korean student, Cho Seung-Hui, in an act of insanity killed 32 people and then shot himself.  In general saddened people are asking why do tragedies of this nature happen at all. Professors, psychologists and authorities are hard struck at making sense of it all, all the same they are only able to console the population with some reassuring words without facing the real cause of this tragic event.  With the passing of time mankind in general has chained itself exclusively to terrestrial concepts of time and space, consequently labeling itself as being materialistic due to its sole dependence on physical and visible evidence, as a direct result of this all thought matter ends up being retained at the lowest sphere of creation, as if there was nothing else other than what is visible to the physical eye. Thus, much of what is essential to a greater understanding of the things that surround us has been placed aside because it has become incomprehensible, as the necessary effort that needs to be made so that these events can be understood cannot be duly processed as should be.  Endowed with a developed brain and with the capacity to form thought processes we have grown accustomed to consider our day to day thoughts as something that belongs to a private leisure zone; free to do as one pleases with no consequences.  What happens when we think? What happens when we nourish thoughts of the same thought species? The thoughts are formed in our brain as a consequence of our inner desires. The brain should always be commanded by the inner desire, but by being disconnected from it, it has consequently developed an independent will of its own that has grown to be more easily subject to external influences.  If a person feels envious and the urge to covet overtakes the thought forms, and the person does not interrupt this negative feeling, soon thoughts of this nature arise in the mind that begin to be attract to other similar thought forms. Consequently it too gets attracted to others similar in nature to it originating from existing thought formations from millions of other people of the same thought pool, and all of this thought activity ends up fortifying ones negative desires of the same though species.  It has already been proved that feelings and thoughts can exercise an influence over other elements including water, thus thought forms are not just limited to having an influence over other humans.  Let us imagine that thoughts are like deposits made into a bank account. That is, they are left by the person in a place where their thought forms accumulate in an unattainable place to the common eye. If they are thoughts of hate and revenge they remain there in the bank account of the depositor, and they are added to a global joint account of hate thoughts independently from where they have been dispatched.  Then some person comes along that has a similar desire and unknowingly wants to cash in a check in his or her possession. That is, it will be a person that has in its inner-self a large reserve of hate, but through neglect, has allowed this sentiment to grow. This would be the same as exposing ones-self to receiving an extraordinary charge of hate deposited by the millions of other people spread out throughout the world in this global joint account.  This may have occurred with the young South Korean Cho Seung-Hui. In a fit of hate he opened the global joint account and received an extraordinary discharge of hate that totally dominated his mind, thus blinding him. In a blind rage of hate he did what he did. Destroying his life both on earth as in the beyond, for as of now his soul will wander aimlessly in a pilgrimage of suffering without being able to find inner peace.  The youth pulled the trigger repeatedly killing many people, but together with him pulling that trigger, was the negative energy of hate thoughts of the millions of scornful people. Evidently he was the responsible person, as he used his freewill, but in the same act there was the co-participation of the hate of millions of people that daily feed this global-hate joint deposit account, and with all certainty they also will be affected by the inexorable reciprocity contained in the laws of Creation, be whoever and wherever they are, as they are connected to the event by invisible threads of destiny, that is, they are identified through the global joint deposit account of life and they will not be able to flee from their responsibility.  Evidently our human civilization, now based on an exacerbated individualism and relationships characterized by the desire of domination, is unexpectedly due to be the sole participant is a series of extremely humiliating situations. The availability of firearms, necessary in this present time for self-defense, also favors the increase in violent deaths, but the greatest problem lies in the existence of dissatisfaction with ones own life and an excess of hate generated by humanity.  Less wars, less crimes and less violence will occur when people begin to police their thoughts more seriously, fortifying those of a beneficial and constructive nature, like that of respect and consideration for ones fellow man, love towards all creatures, and a joyous, peaceful and harmonious coexistence, all inevitably originating out of a conviction of gratitude for the marvelous gift of life we have! This piece was written by BENEDICTO ISMAEL CAMARGO DUTRA.      This reads ancient Hebrew to me. It might as well be written in Martian since it makes no difference: no one on earth understands this nonsense. Lawyers do not count. They are death dealers who's only purpose for existing is to decipher complex incomprehensible laws which THEY wrote and they alone can understand! Okay, rant over.      I understand you perfectly. And my comment stands nonetheless. If you doubt this, then you should try this experiment: In a vacuum, balance a wooden beam of any mass on a point. Then place the spec of dust indicated in your post on the beam and watch what happens. The laws of nature are simple. Even the finest spec of dust has some weight, and is sufficient to cause an imbalance. That we can't measure or perceive what the effect will be doesn't alter the fact that it exists.    And you know this how exactly? It's called balance. The moon is the way it is by reason of design and perfect balance. Changes to its mass, orbit, or anything of the like will surely affect the earth. Or have you read nothing about lunar microwaves (lunar solar radiation) and how it effectively influences climate condition on every part of the earth.    It was worth reading this far after I read your comment. I admire Germanic people. I actually admire all people.  If as people we weren't so superficial, we'd realize that there is so much to admire about the many different races and cultures that occupying ones self with just that will leave no time for such idle talk.  Open your mind's eye and see the beauty in (and of) all the peoples!   	37
 RALLY THE CHAN! WAR IS COMING BROTHERS! Get 2chan on this too.   I meant to say humans lived with dinosaurs.     Seriously, I see it all the time. Every film with cavemen has them riding dinosaurs. In fact, 1 in 4 Americans think that Humans lived with Cavemen.    It's sad how anthropology is so misunderstood and underrated.    What show is this? What episode? What program is that of which this poor fellow had to endure such trauma.   That was...that was...beautiful.   Will you be working with Chuck Norris?   Sounds cool.      Specifically ones in which the coding can be done from the iphone?   I have had difficulty finding a good game hacking subreddit. This subreddit pertains mainly to ethical and sometimes illegal hacking. So can someone direct me to a reddit about game hacking?   That is brilliant.   Specifically.   It's 2001: A Space Odyssey    Thank you, my good sir!   As in how did you create the flags?   How did you do this good sir?   Nice to be alone away from all the "EXTREEME HARDCORE PVP" 9 year olds, huh?   Why not have a nerd server for gmod?     It would be a sandbox server with one of those maps that have been multiplied in size by 4.    If we do decide to take my idea, all I ask is to be co-owner at least.   This is beyond fake.   It kinda reminds me how in real-life corporations evict people and tear down structures for their own mega highways.    How did the ender dragon attack? Did someone spawn it or what?   Is it due to the rules or because of the massive amounts of griefing sparked by Team AVO?   Sandstormed by Darude        1. Play nice. Try not to flame. Let admins defuse the situation.   2. Don't post things that are retarded and unrelated.   3. Post prehistoric content other than dinosaurs from time to time.   4. No religious references. I have nothing against religion. I am quite fascinated by it. But "God/Allah did it 6000 years ago" doesn't satisfy our thirst for prehistoric knowledge.    Is that Tiny Tim?   He was merely upvoting a post. The arrowhead representing said upvote.   ^this   Half life 2    Old minecraft. Especially the community. 2011-2012 was simply amazing because of minecraft. I remember during the winter it was thunder storming and windows were being smashed by hail, and I logged onto a server and I felt instantly comforted.  R.I.P. Classic Minecraft 2011-2012   Because lel   I shed man tears   That's the movie I was originally thinking of! I couldn't remember the name.      Beautiful   Whose is the founding father of nerd.nu? Who is thee who stretches Reddit's empire to minecraft? Lol.  Also, can I contact this person through reddit?   We've heard this story a hundred times. "Scientists discover new alien planet capable of supporting life!" People get hyped. No further research goes into the planet. The hype dies.      Anyone else remember Glise 581 from 2007?   They are planning something. As I said before, they are training on their server and talk of Ddos attacks and hacking an admin account are common.      Because, if you watched the videos I put links to, you'll see their massive numbers. Plus, that was only a small fraction of 4chan. Us Redditors have been a thorn in 4chans side, so some think they plan to launch a campaign. Plus they wouldn't stop at griefing, it would be followed by the hacking of admin accounts and Ddos attacks.   I meant nerd.nu   http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FGH3CiySJ1o  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kQay4_FJU7E  Look at that. I'd say the 4channers are Gods of pvp. They remind me of the Spartans.     So what happens if they raid c.nerd.nu?  It has happened before. Reddit's official server has been raided by griefers originating from 4chan. We, as Redditors, are really a thorn in 4chan's side. So what happens when they come for the server of Reddit: c.nerd.nu?       How did he do it? Can someone list the commands used please?   Can I give a minecraft item (A hoe, specifically) the ability to shoot guardian lasers? If yes, what command can I type in? Also, can I do this on my multiplayer server?    Well, Reddit has had lots of enemies and has had a lot of flame wars. I think it's important to document these flame wars as they were crucial to the history of Reddit, especially the big flame wars which have effected the entire internet, like the feuds with 4chan.   What websites and organizations of people have really just been a thorn in Reddit's side? Ex. 4chan and Team Avo?  	46
 I can't imagine a worse possible team for a WR with "great raw skills, but a lot of learning and developing left to do."   I remember reading somewhere that square planned out IX, X and XI all at the same time. The idea was that IX was kindof a final tribute to the old days, X was like the "This is the direction Final fantasy is now heading in" and XI was their stab at the newly developing MMO market. Their goal was essentially to cover all the bases.   Also tuition is free if your household income is less than 100,000k   I really doubt Cam Newton and (to a lesser extent) Andy Dalton are going to make huge jumps this year, just because they both played so well as rookies last year. But how about the other three quarterbacks drafted in the top-12?  Christian Ponder and Blaine Gabbert had miserably bad QB ratings, but they also were throwing to some of the worst receiving corps in the league, and behind some of the worst offensive lines. Jake Locker, obviously barely played at all. Do you think any of these guys will end up in the "pretty good" group of quarterbacks this year?   Yes yes yes yes yes to all of this, also:  1. I like to read outside when it's warm  2. I really enjoy the sound of rain in the background, and gentle thunder. It's so soothing.   Nah.   http://i.imgur.com/QCiEb.png   Hey now, nobody knows how great Ponder can be yet.   *That's the joke.*   wat.   In another sub? Sure. But not in truereddit. That's kinda the reason this place exists.   24 upvotes? Glad to know this subreddit has gone completely to shit.   Looking for Legal Advice? This subreddit is for discussing developments in the law and jurisprudence. While posts may OCCASIONALLY seek advice about law school or careers, this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice.   To be fair, despite what most armchair critics will say, the tax code NEEDS to be as complex as it is (for the most part), because taxation is a complex subject. The florida criminal code? Not quite so much.   Like... telling people not to go law school? Good thing everyone hates it when people say that.   That's why it's called a stereotype.   He just really wanted to flaunt his knowledge of casino slots.   Unless you're attractive, then it's adorable.    How is a dog sniff not a search? Because there's no reasonable expectation of privacy under that circumstance? Just because society/the Supremes have determined that the fruit of that police action is admissible - regardless of the reason - its still a search.  I saw you say that you're a criminal defense attorney, and I'm just a 2L fresh out of crim pro, so I certainly give deference to your opinion, but...  When we're talking about 4th amendment jurisprudence, the question of what a "search" is for this specific body of law involves an intrusion by a state actor upon a reasonable expectation of privacy. For the aforementioned reasons, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy that is being intruded, thus it is not a search.  Something closer to your hearsay example would be something like a *hot pursuit* exception. In that case it IS a search, but it's still "reasonable" and thus constitutional, but it is a search regardless.    It really isn't. When you wiretap you are listening in on a phone call, if it's done in a telephone booth or a home, then the courts have long recognized that there is a privacy interest that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. Because it intrudes upon that interest, it is now a search.  It's not a matter of what they use to intrude, it's a matter of what they're intruding upon. A dog sniff intrudes upon NOTHING except the fact that there are or aren't drugs in a suitcase. Nothing else about the inside of that suitcase is revealed. Protecting drug possession is not a legitimate interest. Therefore, it is not a search. A wiretap intrudes upon every conversation made over the tapped phone. The intrusion is much much greater because they're intruding upon all conversations made from private places. The courts have never had issue with whether or not there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in making phone calls.   You should actually read *Katz* and *Place* and the the distinction will seem much more clear.   No, that is wrong. Look at [Katz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz_v._United_States) and its progeny, there are factors that go into whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Your second sentence doesn't even make sense because we're not questioning whether the search is "legal," we're questioning whether or not there is a search at all.   A person needs a legitimate interest to have a reasonable expectation of privacy. In less eloquent terms: not having all of your belongings rummaged through by policemen is a legitimate privacy interest.   The only piece of your privacy a dog sniff invades is to the fact that you are carrying drugs or not. The privacy of everything else about that bag is not intruded upon in any way.

So I'm not sure which is really worse.   ITT: redditors don't understand taxes   The court has absolutely not done this. See [Ciraolo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Ciraolo) where they confirmed flyovers where constitutional under the "plain view" doctrine on the theory that passengers flying overhead in a plane could see your backyard. There are a multiplicity of other examples where technology is permissible.    Tried posting in there. Got downvoted anyways :/   I understand the trail you're going down, but I don't think it's the proper analysis to be asking. The standard enunciated in *Katz* is whether or not the privacy expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.   Plain view has long held the standard of "no privacy expectation" because that a ridiculous limit on police powers (think; license plates, hair color etc.). This court hits a weird string with technology because now the police are gathering MOUNTAINS of data that, in pieces, would fall under the plain view exception. The policy the majority is pushing (That was originally stated, as dicta, in Kyllo) that the reasonable expectation is going to shrink as technology expands. But this feels like a stretch of the ruling Kyllo, because the logic isn't quite on point.  I really like this policy, but I don't like it as applied to GPS tracking devices, because this isn't question a question of a deeper intrusion into someone's privacy, but rather a much broader intrusion. And ultimately I don't think this summation of publicly discoverable information should rise to the reasonable expectation standard when taken as a whole.  Again, it's a minority opinion, and I definitely understand why most people disagree with me, but I don't think it's open and shut in either direction by any means.   No, the 4th amendment is a limit on the powers of government action, this has nothing to do with private citizens.   This is a constitutional limit placed on government powers... it's not like any agencies are just *exempt* from this.   I'll be in the deep minority here and kinda disagree with this one.   Sotomayor notes that there is a privacy interest in the sum of ones public movements; which wouldn't be so if there was simply a tail on him for 28 days, and the Kyllo argument feels unconvincing because they're not gaining any insight (his location) through technology that isn't public at any given time (i.e. the infrared heat patterns of a home). It seems like a matter of police efficiency rather than a deeper invasion, and I just don't love the jurisprudence.  That said, having the court actually rule in favor of expanding the 4th amendment is a breath of fresh air, and I do like the policy they're keeping in mind with regards to technology and expanding police power in investigation, so I won't complain.   Okay.    Irrelevant rebuttal is irrelevant.   you should see /r/lawschool :/   That you could mention method actors and think of Johnny Depp over Robert DeNiro is kinda sad as far as movie history goes :/   To be fair, the draft is a much bigger ordeal than the preseason games are.   That's not at all the point he was getting at.    I'm in the puberty phase, and no one where I live is THIS stupid.   You don't know how stupid they are, you know exactly 30 words they've posted on a facebook page, and you probably know their life priorities which are more a product of their upbringing than their intelligence.   Stay smart reddit.   Honestly in this economy, Florida's tax LLM should be crossed off the list as well.   I'm a Christian and I'm studying tax law, so I may know a thing or two about tax exempt entities. These pastors are not acting in affiliation with their churches, but as private individuals with their own right to free speech. There are no legitimate grounds for revoking their exempt status.   There honestly is nothing even remotely true about that sentence.   their wide receiving corps is one of the worst in the league; and it's still miles ahead of their secondary :/   Maybe too late to be noticed but: debt incurred does not count against income, only interest accrued against you on the debt does.

Dwight for the 10-11 season had *at least* a moderately more extensive set of offensive weapons to use. Did you not notice how his ppg went from 18.3 to 22.9 last year?

The absolute worst is when those smaller independent subreddits start using popular advice animals for jokes that concern the sub, and all the sudden they're back on your freaking front page.

I worked there for 3 years and that was my favorite item.  Runner up meal: buy the tenders, ask for bbq and ranch, dip the tenders in both packets one at a time. Glorious.  One that was only open to employees: the maraschino cherries came in giant buckets and were in a cherry juice that was substantively grenadine. Chick fila goes heavy on the syrup for their soft drinks, so the soda fountain sprite + cherry juice made the best shirley temples I've ever had.   Another thing I did (that isn't available to the public), was take the caramel packets that come with the catering fruit trays, and mix in a medium fruit cup thoroughly so it was like a candy soup.   Okay, that was actually kindof gross. But it was awesome.    "When I was going to law school, and I sold my (Chevrolet) Corvair to make first-semester tuition and books for $330, a sizeable portion of the faculty had tenure."  Give me a fucking break.

Meh, I feel like the only way we keep peace with r/atheism is to not give them anything to be mad about. In recent history this sub has turned a lot more to "poking fun," and I don't think it's inherently bad, but I'd rather keep the tension as low as possible.

That gif spelled dammit wrong...   We've just about been "terrifyingly close [...] to complete totalitarian fascism" since the end of the reconstruction era.  The police force has been empirically much more professionalized ever since the Burger court's jurisprudence for criminal procedure and the Miranda warning waiver regime.  The government had much more free access to infringe on our civil liberties during the red scare of the 50's than it does now.  I'm really sorry about your friend, it's incredibly shitty what happened, but CowboyDan is right to point out that it's really not anything new in the broader sense of government power.

Do you think this is could be too archaic or boring of an introduction?      Ever since i've gone to college (and now grad school) 99.5% of the Christians I interact with don't believe in reformed view of predestination.   Considering this is probably the single most frustrating topic between (Protestant) Christians, I'm just curious to see what the make up of r/Christianity is.   I personally am a five-point Calvinist, thanks to the likes of R.C Sproul, John Piper, and a handful of other great writers, but it's not something I've ever been militant about in attitude.  Curious to hear some responses!   Reddit, I'm reposting this from the John Paulson loophole thread because I missed the boat aready  I'm not going to comment on whether or not this type of loophole should be closed, but I think understanding the system a little better could be help put into perspective why he's only paying 15% in taxes:  There are generally two main ways for the government to tax. 1. As personal income- we all understand that there are marginal rates etc. 2. Through a corporate double taxation- this means that the corporation will be taxed on its net income. But remember, corporations are merely a collection of people, the stockholders. So AFTER the corporation is taxed once, the government puts a 15% tax on the distribution of that money to it's owners.  for instance, hypothetically if the corporate rate is 35% and the capitol gains rate is 15%, that means for every dollar a corporation earns only 1(1 - .35)(1 - .15), or 55 cents actually makes it to the owner, so people who make money through corporations would be effectively taxed at 45%  REMEMBER THOUGH, employees (you guys) salaries are deducted from pretax net income, so the money the corporation makes that ends up in your pockets will only be taxed once, at most for 35%.  SO, when a man like John Paulson makes his income, it comes out of the AFTER TAX Net Income of the company, because his earnings are benchmarked by the after tax profits of the corporation, not the PRETAX Net Income of the company like most employees.  It may seem like John Paulson is scamming the government out of money he should be paying in taxes because of a loophole. But remember that the money that he made has already been taxed once at the corporate rate, so the amount of money in taxes that he's paying on his income is NOT the total % that the government has taxed.  That is all.   	107
 What exactly happens ?    Either that or Britain's most pressing crisis is an epidemic of loss of eyesight. Or an inability to count.   Yes, it can indeed be addictive. It has its uses from my experience.   Well perhaps. The problem is that *all* economic forecasts from the IMF or otherwise have a very high error rate.   Hi. I'd just like to thank you for the previous reference (Kliman) that you sent me in response to a post 4 days ago on r/socialism concerning an article about the 'neighbourhood effects' of low wages. I haven't had time to read it all yet, but a brief scan makes me sceptical about their idea. It contradicts too much of the economic data available. In any case I will read it sometime soon even though I am sceptical. I'm not afraid of contrary views. What I appreciate is your efforts to actually present a substantive argument. That can be quite rare on the internet.  Take care,  Burt   Yes indeed. It does bring up a memory of a book I read a long time ago. Its title was 'How to Lie With Statistics'.   Which part ? It covers a lot of ground.   This post seems to have generated a bit of discussion, and I have expressed my opinion about its value below. All that I can add is that despite all the deficiencies pointed out, basically because of the purposes of the business unions and the fact it doesn't result in some huge and immediate eruption of working class self-organization, it is still something very valuable, praiseworthy and worth participating in. Massive changes in consciousness and organization don't happen suddenly. They are *always* prepared by a slow gradual back and forth of working for changes that may seem miniscule from a purist perspective. There is no other way. Yes, it is something to cheer. I'll give an analogy.  It's a football game, and you team has just made a 30 yard punt return. Do you grumble that it should have been 50, 60 yards or a TD ? Do you loudly complain about the intelligence of the quarterback or the running speed of the punt returner. Yes, the coach may be an asshole and incompetent to boot. The team manager may be dipping into the treasury, and the QB may be taking bribes to throw games. All of these problems *can't* be solved immediately with any amount of denunciation. Remember, it's still *your* team, and 30 yards is still worth cheering about.   Some of these are really creative. I wonder who the artists were. There are tags on some but not all.   No, I don't think there is any English translation yet. The book was only released 3 days ago in Paris. Interestingly enough I can't even find the name of the French publisher. I wouldn't be surprised if they were keeping that secret for obvious reasons. So I can't even tell you how to order the French version. A French magazine 'L'Obs' has published excerpts in the last few days - in French of course.   They'd probably find a way to have a monopoly on them.    The article was published in 2008 in 'Applied Animal Behavior Science' **113** 150-165. This journal is moving towards an open access policy, but at the time it wasn't so. It's there but behind a paywall I'm afraid.   I guess it depends on what year you take as a baseline. I think the report refers to the baseline as the last year.   Yes, I see what you mean.    I couldn't find the ad when I looked again, but that's not unexpected. The Daily Kos makes its money via ad revenue rather than subscriptions, and the ads 'rotate'. When I looked I could check out some sort of high end jacket, remove my brown spots, become beautiful again and have my criminal record erased and so on and so on and so on. Given the political views of the Daily Kos I wouldn't be amazed for them to run a Clinton ad. There are probably some politicians that they'd balk at, but those wouldn't try to advertise there anyways (except maybe Rand Paul).  No doubt Clinton has a whole necropolis of skeletons in her closet - besides being a crook - and some of the Democratic Party persuasion might be fully aware of that. A lot of people, however, are loyalists of one party or another under the 'lesser evil' mantra. It's not my view, but it is an arguable point of view.   More than 2,000 actually. He lived in the same 'axial age' that produced western philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and the Buddha in India.   My urban experience has been very much with racoons and deer. While I was growing up in the country I would occasionally spot wolves from a distance. I had 'close up' experience later in life when I nursed the loser in a wolf fight back to health. The first time in both the wolf and I were *very* cautious. Two months later he would jump for joy on seeing me. I used to bring people in to watch (behind two sets of bars) while I would raise his lips and 'twang' his fangs.  You know I've never been able to spot a mountain lion either in the country or in the city where they occasionally wander in. I've even been unrealistic enough to try and track them. To say the least this didn't go far. Bears sometimes wander into other cities, but I have a neurosis about them. No attempts to track them even though it's easier. As for the birds I'm not a great observer, but there are city falcons where I live, and I sometimes see them. Never saw them catching anything however. Eagles *very* occasionally and never in the city.  Another story. I hate crows and love squirrels. I once watched as a crow swooped down and grabbed one of the squirrels I feed. Up into the air, very, very high and then...'drop'. Splat ! I used to run into racoons a lot, but a couple of years ago the city police went around shooting them all in the neighbourhood. They have still to repopulate. The racoons never gave me any problems even though I would sometimes mistake them for a 'very big cat' in the dark. Never went "kitty, kitty, kitty" and tried to touch them. All my fingers are still attached.  Sorry to load old stories on you. It brings back memories.   Actually I'm not a great fan either. There were much more attractive ancient Chinese philosophers. Still, it was a quip rather than a statement of belief. Viva Lao Tzu.   I can appreciate your scepticism, but to be all Chinese about it, "they laughed at Confucius too".   Probably so, and coupon clip to the end of their days. Never, however, underestimate the allure of greed and lust for power. These can override even the most obvious calculations of self-interest.   You are right about that when I think of it. The item I posted was, of course, gung ho on the concept and ignored the complications.   In the end, however, the 'smaller state' rhetoric of various sorts of conservatism rarely becomes reality when they gain power. The role of government and its expenditures continue to expand. It's just that cons spend the money on their own pet projects.   You're welcome.   Yes I see that. I was totally unaware of Lewy's work. He is **not** the demographer described in the UCLA press release. That man's name is 'Patrick Heuveline'. Lewy is mentioned in the Wikipedia article I cited, and, interestingly enough, he was the writer who produced the *lowest* estimate of deaths from American action in Southeast Asia as is referred to above. That seems to fit with the description of his work given above. The Armenian genocide did of course happen as did that of the Roma whatever the man may say. I presume that Turkish government money had a lot to do with his opinions in the Armenian case.   Yes, it is indeed partially a PR campaign, but the nature of what the SEIU and others have chosen for their campaign is such that it has obvious benefits from any success it may gain. Also, don't forget that it is bringing in new people who have enthusiasm that hasn't been dampened by decades of 'business as usual'. This is a great field that shouldn't be ignored.   Yes probably true, but examine the numbers given in paragraph 2 above. Once more take the highest number and subtract that from the lowest estimate for Cambodian deaths. It still leaves 90% of the corpses as the responsibility of the Kymer Rouge.   You're correct. I got my references scrambled. The 1.5 to 3.6 million is from 1954 to 1975. The 1965 date is from a book by Guenter Lewy where he makes an estimate of the deaths in the Indochinese wars of 1,313,000. There are other references in the Wikipedia article to the Indochinese wars and estimates of the deaths in Cambodia by US action.   I don't believe he has investigated that case. Others, however, have done so. There is a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_war_casualties) that presents the various estimates of the *total casualties* of the wars in Southeast Asia. The references are all there if you care to look at the matter more fully. Most of them are internet accessible. The total human cost of the wars were estimated to be from 1.5 to 3.6 million from 1965 when the US first got involved after the defeat of France. This figure includes all military deaths on both 'sides' as well as civilian deaths in Vietnam North and South, Laos and Cambodia. It doesn't include the genocide committed by the Kymer Rouge.  As with *all* estimates of the toll of genocides the figures can only be approximate and the numbers vary. In any case the numbers killed by US bombing in Cambodia prior to the KR takeover range from 40,000 to 150,000. This is horrendous enough, but taking the *highest* estimate of direct US responsibility and comparing it to the *lowest* estimate of KR murders it is *at best* 1/10th of what the KR did to the Cambodian people.  The *total* loss of human life in American wars in Southeast Asia, including both military and civilian deaths, is in the same ballpark as that of the KR murders. In Cambodia itself it was very much smaller.  Here's an interesting side note about the leftist politics of the time. The left in developed countries generally made 'heroic efforts' to avoid saying the truth about the fact that the USA along with China gave at least diplomatic support to the KR (and perhaps more especially in the case of China) during the time of the genocide. It would really spoil the narrative. The exceptions were Moscow line communists and some anarchists.   It really threw the 'left' into a fit when their previous heroes, the Vietnamese communists, invaded Kampuchia after what were insufferable provocations in my opinion including the slaughter of ethnic Vietnamese in Kampuchia. It was Vietnam that ended the genocide.  If you wish to blame the USA for anything blame it for being a mouthpiece of the KR regime at the United Nations. Isn't international politics wonderful ?   As to the original question it seems to me to be chicken and egg. Does reddit make you depressed or do people go to reddit *because* they are depressed. My observations tell me that 'anger' is a lot bigger problem than depression in terms of having a sensible exchange of views.   I do a lot of posting on subs devoted to scientific matters, and the general level of aggression there is several quantum leaps below what you'll find on 'political' sites. No doubt people can get angry at anything, but the political sites have a vastly greater amount of sewage in them.   "Plumbing" ??? This definitely suggests something about (bull)shit. I wonder if the execs were fully cynically aware while making the decision.   Thanks.   Thanks. I'm a subscriber to Science so I can access them. The paper edition hasn't arrived yet. Like most Science articles, however, non-members of the AAAS have no access. Too bad. Open access is becoming more and more common, and hopefully it will someday be the norm.   Myself I'm not too sure. No doubt the manned missions are often undertaken more from reasons of national prestige rather than scientific value. I still, however, think they have made substantial contributions - the ISS at least if not the Moon missions. The ISS has also build a groundwork for the international cooperation that can help in other missions.  So, I partly agree with you but only partly.   It has been repeatedly demonstrated, there is no connection between vaccination and autism (overdiagnosed in my opinion). People search for news that fits their preconceptions. yes, your comparison is quite apt.    Thank you very much for your work. I had a quick look at the paper, and to my mind it is indeed well done. Some of the math is beyond me. I know what a 'Fourier transform' is for instance but damned if I could offer an intelligent opinion on its use. In any case I found what I was looking for. The authors use the 'Pearson correlation coefficient' to look at the correlation between their gravitational mass data from lensing and the actual location of galaxies. Fair enough. I know of the test, but I don't know about its limitations.  Still, like I said, this answers a lot of my questions and reservations.  Just as a side note I've looked at the ArXiv before and I often find myself blocked from complete access. Is it truly open access, and am I missing something in my computer skills ?   Yes, I guess that is sadly true. There are a lot of problems with regulatory agencies, and the problems aren't confined to the USA.   You know I had a look at the map, and from a brief glance it does show such a correlation. My problem is that such a qualitative measure (my eyes) doesn't fully convince me. I tried to get at the original paper to see the 'curve fitting' used, but the dreaded paywall fell down on me. I assume the authors did due diligence on this matter.   The full context of the gender wage gap is discussed in the article ie all the various causes. It is also discussed in numerous other items both academic and official. The sudden knee jerk of a *flood* of angry comments to an article like this suggests a few things as does their persistence. This is obviously a thing that has high emotional content to some redditers, an emotional content that the general population doesn't share.  Terms such as 'gender wage gap', 'gender pay gap' etc are the common terms used in *all* legitimate economic publications. Perhaps they "rant" as well.   As to your claims I see very well how the minds of some work. They (including you) are annoyed and in fact threatened by a presentation of a fact that contradicts their emotional anger/fear. They can hardly deny the facts so they resort to picking out something in the report that happens to be in *all* the educated reports on the matter. In this case it is the multifactorial nature of the *real* and properly named 'gender pay gap'. They think they've made a 'discovery' that allows them to launch an attack. After the attack they will forget about the nuanced nature of the item in question and retreat back to the "there is no gender pay gap" incantation that is so emotionally satisfying.  Fine and good. You can't look at a subject in a rational, dispassionate, **adult** manner. You do know, of course, that people like you have a mirror image 'evil twin' that acts exactly the same except that they switch the angel/demon labels. If you wish to find the "militant feminists" who are "bashing men" you can wander over to a wealth of the SRS reddits where people act like you do except that they have different enemies in a childish 'wargame'.  Your charge of being 'disingenuous' would have to be levied against *all* the economic studies of this matter, things that I read but you don't. Your magical phrase for preventing thought and self justification only works in your mind as the actual literature shows -over and over and over and over.  In any case this conversation is now closed. I had a quick look at your posting history (you are welcome to look at mine), and it seems it doesn't take much to send you into a fury. Please go to the SRS subs and yell at them. You are the 'enemy' they need just as they are the enemy you need.

When military trucks are overloaded with youngsters from all over the country, taken away to uncertain destinations, and when our comrades in jail linger in overcrowded dungeons that the system calls prisons.   10 years later we are happy to state that we are members of an international community, which has not been segmented by the borders, by flags, not even by language. We have been one with Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Iberia, the United States, Ecuador, Venezuela, Indonesia, Palestine, Kurdistan, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Australia, Byelorussia, Egypt, Mexico. Every time we have shown our solidarity, discussing in the open or privately problems of places that may be far away in the map but not from the heart, every time we have acted accordingly to our desire to destroy to rebuild, when we have supported not facts, but for ideas harbouring the passions of millions of people; for those brief moments, as brief as life itself is brief, we have been able to be the entire world, the entire galaxy.   For all this we want to invite you all, wherever you are, to carry any action which you think is suited to honour solidarity with Nico on this 6 of May. We know that you have anger and a deep sense of injustice as well, so we will be very happy to know of different activities, where the yell of Long live Nico! is heard of in different languages, and in different accents.   https://accionlibertariaoyl.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/ll...eira/   Here's the beginning of such a list made up of 'mainstream' news sources from outside the USA. I'll begin with ones that I am fairly familiar with and give a separate list of suggestions for ones I know less about later. The symbol '(E)' after an item means that the source has an online English language section. Most but not all do. Be aware that most of these sources have a two tier system, one free and one paid. Let's start in the Middle East. Begin in the middle ?  [Al Jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com) (E) Fairly well known left leaning service originally in Arabic. Best mainstream source for news from the Islamic world but also quite valuable in other areas.  [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr) Most reputable paper in France. (E)nglish language edition available only by paid subscription. Centrist to moderate leftist outlook.  [AFP](http://www.afp.com) (E) French public news wire. Political views often very dependent on party in power.  [Agencia EFE](http://www.efe.com) (E) Largest Spanish language news service in Spain. Centrist to moderate right.  [El Pais](http://elpais.com) (E) Most popular newspaper in Spain. Conservative to moderate leftist.  [Telesur](http://telesurtv.net) (E) Spanish language service from Latin America. Centrist to leftist. Main value is in stories overlooked in English language media.  [BBC](http://www.bbc.com) (E) The grandmother of international news. British service spanning povs from conservative to leftist. World coverage makes it a very valuable source.  [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com) (E) Left leaning, often quite visibly so, British newspaper. The grandmother of leftist sources in the anglosphere.   [The Economist](http://theeconomist.com) (E) 'Intelligent conservative' or 'liberal' (in a non-American sense) business magazine with extensive coverage of non-economic matters as well. High quality and not ideologically rigid.  [Granma International](http://www.granma.cu) (E) Official Cuban government newswire. Very rigid ideologically but occasionally useful for matters ignored in the American media.  [CBC](www.cbc.ca) (E) Canadian public broadcaster. Moderate conservative to social democratic pov. Much higher quality than usual American sources.  [The Globe and Mail](http://theglobeandmail.com) (E) . Canadian 'national newspaper. Moderate conservative to leftist pov.   [Xinhua](http://www.xinhuanet.com) (E) Official Chinese state news service. Often surprising for content you wouldn't expect from official sources.  [Global Times](http://www.globaltimes.cn) (E) Officially 'approved' news from China. Once more often surprising in content. Less ideologically rigid than Xinhua.  That's about it for sources that I am familiar with. Next installment will be other suggested mass media sources that I am less familiar with. Following that will be anarchist and leftist sources.   Of course it has to do with a pun on 'leftism'. It was right in the title as in 'off topic'. A pun for sure, not a knee slapping, gut bursting rolling on the floor howler of a joke. You know that explaining any joke kills the joke altogether. Now that you've killed the poor bugger I expect you to clean the mess off the floor.   Not every post can be of world shaking importance or deep profundity.    The United States Census where the 78% number comes from are not really concerned about the 'interest' of 'most men' because they know that *most men and women will not have an emotional reaction to their findings*. *Most* meaning well over 90%. Please write letters of complaint to the US Census, the US Department of Commerce, and  the International Labor Organization (who put the US gap at 64%) and tell them how they should abandon economics in favor of somebody's emotions. The wage gap is an obvious and totally well established fact of economics. You may try to explain it away, but you shouldn't try to deny its reality.   Yes, unions have fought hard over the course of decades for 'equal pay for work of equal value', and progress certainly has been made. There is, however, evidence that even 'at the top' that women make less. The gap is narrower the higher you go. In my opinion the great majority of efforts should be concentrated at the lower end of the wage scale. The 78% figure is from the US Census. UN Human Development reports put it at 82% in the USA and 84% worldwide ie the USA is behind the world in terms of pay equity. The ILO, on the other hand, puts the gap at an astounding 64%. The reason for the difference is that the ILO includes part time workers while the Census only measures those with full time employment. The USA is dramatically behind the rest of the world in terms of pay equity for part time workers.   Glad to meet you. I have recently started a new subreddit r/worldanarchism which will hopefully be devoted to *international* ie non_American anarchist news. Please feel free to post anything you might feel relevant at that site. It would be appreciated.   I see you know a lot more about this forum than I do. I wasn't aware that it was *routinely* patrolled by a mass of very angry, very resentful people who have come to place their own personal problems, bad divorce or whatever, onto an abstraction called 'feminism'. It's actually quite sad.  The last time I went through references about the magnitude of the wage gap I think it was either the World Bank or the IMF figures that I found most convincing. I gave a short list of national and international agencies that measure the supposedly imaginary gap in a reply to another post.  The information is all there for people to look at. The trouble is that some people just won't look at it at all. Reality is less important than their need to assign blame. They certainly have a hell of a lot more emotion at stake than I do, and they escalate to anger very easily. Too bad.   Ahem !!! The 78% figure quoted is from the US Census. The estimate vary. The UN Development programme narrows the gap to 82% (US figures, the US lags behind the global average of 84%. On the other hand the International Labor Organization puts the gap at 64%. I'm sure the US Census would appreciate hearing from you on how wrong they are. It could be a matter of national importance.   Actually not at all. I remembered that there are other indexes compiled annually such as the Human Development Index. So I went to look. In the United Nations Development Programme website there is the Gender Inequality Index under the Human Development Reports. See http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-4-gender-inequality-index . The UN's table is **exactly** the sort of thing I was speculating about. It leaves out some the factors I mentioned and includes others that I missed. It's the old **what exists is possible no matter what theory says it isn't**. I've never looked at this particular report before, but its existence says that what I suggested is not just 'possible' but is done on a routine basis.   Wow. Thanks for the photo.   Ah, the faith that moves mountains. Here's a short list of some agencies that regularly track and report on the magnitude of the 'gender pay gap': the US Census, the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund, the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the European Commission (technical advisers to the EU), the US Department of Commerce. The list could be expanded into *many* dozens of items, all of them produced by *real, credible, legitimate economists* who are hired for such work. The number of papers on the subject that appear in peer reviewed economics journals *each year* probably amounts to *thousands* if all languages are surveyed.   The world knows, people who study these things in academic settings know. Business knows. Everyone knows...except for those that deliberately close their eyes for emotional reasons. Please present your stunning discovery that the scientific study of this issue is part of a 'man-hating plot' to the UN General Assembly. The nations of the World await your enlightenment.  All the information is available on the internet. Look it up.   Thanks for the info.   I said it would be difficult to make a single comparable number out of it, but I also said it wasn't impossible. Somewhat but not entirely subjective. The important point is that many of these metrics are covariant.   There's a good history of that available on the internet. See Randall Watters' article [her](http://freeminds.org/psych/propfail.htm)   I know. 'Dogan' isn't common slang anymore. It was when I was young.   Those are dates when the Watchtower Society predicted the second coming previously. Needless to say it didn't happen.   There are other metrics such age of marriage, inheritance rights, divorce laws, female genital mutilation, induced abortions of female fetuses, legal standing in civil suits, different civil laws in other matters, maternal mortality in childbirth, differential spending on gynecology and obstetrics as opposed to other medical fields, differences in status in religious services, etc. that are indicators. It would indeed be difficult to assign weights to the various factors, but I think it is not beyond the realm of possibility.    That's good to see. The only possible solution, other than partition amongst the surrounding countries - with the continued war that would mean - is a federal one. One can only hope the various groups can come to an acceptable agreement. The Swiss in times past proved it isn't impossible.   Are you referring to the dates the JWs predicted the end of the world or some dates on the video ?   No problem. No, not me. I'm an 'ex-Dogan'. I left the RC Church when I was 15, and never looked back. I'm an old fart now with the usual arthritis and reduced eyesight. I have, however, known ex-Jehovahs in my time, and it is indeed a particularly vicious religion. Also, can we say, 'weird'.    The original source of the video was [JWStruggle](http://www.youtube.com/user/JWStruggle) . The producer has several episodes of his trial/interrogation there. I'm afraid, however, that he doesn't seem to have any written summary as far as I can tell. Sorry I couldn't help you more. Have a quick look at the site.   It's a speculation, but a reasonable one when the other factors are excluded as the authors have done.. It certainly doesn't constitute 'proof', if any such proof one way or the other could be offered in a case like this. As I mentioned in a reply to another poster the UN tracks the gap year by year in various countries. Comparing the magnitude with reference to said countries' attitudes towards women would go a long was towards supporting or weakening the authors' explanation.   Yes, it seems to be downvoted. I've been in this argument before. I guess this sub is patrolled by the 'Resentment Patrol'. The gender gap is a well established fact, and every year the United Nations produces a report showing its magnitude in different countries. I think the link is quite well researched and properly balanced. At least somebody agrees with this. Thanks.   I don't believe so, but I'll look.   The one year that the NYC Anarchist Bookfair was most severely disrupted was 2012. I seem to recall a previous incident, but beginning in 2009 (the year when the Crimethink Conference you mention was disrupted) there have been several incidents in several cities. The Crimethink incident was carried out by a group who styled themselves 'Smack A White Boy'. See http://libcom.org/library/smack-a-white-boy-part-two-crimethink-eviction-2009 for a full account. Also various Crimethink statements at the time.   Be aware that the "part 2" bit refers to a previous action earlier in that year. that the  'smacky' group carried out . On March 21, 2009 a commie front (Answer I believe) was having an antiwar march in Washington DC. The 'smackies' conceived the idea of trying to block the march. Their justification - are you ready ? - "to stand in solidarity with the people of Iraq and Palestine". I shit you not. How (trying to) blocking a commie front march in Washington 'helps' the people of Iraq and Palestine' I will leave up to your imagination. No doubt they lined up in their millions to sign a huge thank-you card. To my knowledge the commies simply walked around the small group and nothing spectacular happened. All went well, and the cherry trees blossomed as usual.  Back to Crimethink. The numbers of disrupters reported vary. One Crimethink statement said "about a half dozen". By the Smacky statement they claimed " 8 people", and once more according to them "from 7 different locations". The smackies wanted to make a video of their grand victory, but once more to my knowledge it came to nothing except for the following: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dHcRnOOXEA . It didn't go viral. The group dissolved into the chaotic air of USA anarchism, a tangled forest where many things have been lost forever.   I have further references if you'd like. Now *here's the point that impressed me*. Eight people from *7 locations* ! How well did the disrupters know each other before - *if they knew each other at all beyond the world of email* ? Think about that for awhile.    The updates on the situation in Kurdistan are greatly appreciated. For myself I think that the Kurds in Syria and Turkey have a sufficiently laudable program (and efforts on the ground) to be supported, and their enemies are more than sufficiently evil to make up for any deficiencies the Kurdish polity might have. From what I see in the efforts of the European anarchist and syndicalist groups to offer what help they can I think they have made the right decision, that is support without having any illusions about the 'mixed' character of the part(ies !) in Kurdistan. It seems reasonable to me, and I certainly wouldn't try to sum up such a complex situation in a few sweeping generalizations.   Personally I think the relationship the Spanish CGT has had with the EZLN for quite a few years is something of a model. They offer the support they can without engaging in long distance hero worship, reading things into the Zapatistas that aren't there or (worst of all as I have seen recently) using the Zapatistas as some sort of stick to beat other leftists over the head with for 'thinking unclean thoughts' (colonial maybe ?). On the other hand neither do they hold the EZLN to some artificial standard of purity that is never achieved in the real world.  All that being said I am still not over optimistic about the prospects for the Kurds. This isn't connected to any estimation of the virtues that they have or may not have. It's all about the place in the world and the time in history in which all this is happening. The Kurds are surrounded on all sides by enemies or potential enemies that have significant military strength, Turkey, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, let alone all the weaker players, from Hezbollah, ISIS, other Kurdish factions, other Islamic factions, Syrian 'government', Iraqi 'government' and so on. Then there are the external players from the USA, EU, Russia.  The best that I could envision for the Kurds would be regional autonomy within the boundaries of present states with a greater or lesser amount of autonomy, probably less than that of a Swiss canton. To achieve this the Kurds will inevitably have to compromise, with each other as well as with the neighbours and distant interested parties. The present oil pipelines don't flow through Kurdish Syria, but they *do* flow through Kurdish areas of Turkey. Then there is Iran, a state not known for its willingness to compromise.  With all these shifting interests I also think that the best the Kurds can achieve outside of political autonomy is a more or less mixed economy. I hope that this economy would have a considerable communal and cooperative sector, but it simply won't be anything that Western leftists might dream of. In this case the pipers to be paid have a lot more hardware to use as argument.  Not that compromises, both political and economic, are worthless. I can hope that the political autonomy will be greater rather than lesser and similarly the economic compromises will be more 'to the left' than otherwise, but I certainly don't know and I think nobody can know where the ball will finally stop rolling.    I understand that they have set a few 'end times' before, and it didn't seem to depopulate them when the event never happened. Was the book 'When Prophecy Fails' written with them at least partially in mind ?   As a point of interest regarding the New York Anarchist Bookfair it was disrupted in past years (twice I believe) by a small contingent from 'Sergeant Fury and his PC Commandos'. I'll dig up the years involved.   A Twinkie a day keeps....you from forgetting where you left the Twinkies.   Interesting article. I liked the part where Blackwater has changed its name to 'Academi'. Maybe the mercs are being trained in post-modernist torture methods. One thing I don't remember...how were the murders brought to light and how was the government pressured to prosecute ?   It's working now. A good project even if the report is dated from early February. Still relevant.   Neat. Thanks.   A long and tedious explanation of the background to this post will follow soon. The premises at 33 rue des Vignoles in Paris house the offices of the anarchosyndicalist CNT-f, one of several anarchosyndicalist and revolutionary sysndicalist union confederations in France (the situation is even more complex than in Spain). The premises have been handed down over decades from Spanish exiles who were members of the Spanish CNT.  Spanish anarchist exiles played a prominent part in the Liberation of France. The 'Nueve' referred to above and below were the *first* Free French units to enter Paris on its Liberation, riding on tanks prominatly labeled with names such as 'Durruti' and 'Ascaso' Ever since 2011 there have been efforts on the part of the city of Paris to evict the occupants and a continued struggle to maintain the anarchist presence there.  In the meantime here's the English translation of the post.                        **33 Rue Des Vignoles Has a Future**  That is, in any case, what has been proclaimed by the presence of almost 500 people who came in to support  the Les Pas Sages des Vignoles association this Sunday, March 22.  The future of this place is first that the entities there, artists, Flamenco in France and the CNT, continue their activities now as they have for more than thirty years. This longevity proves that, despite differences, living and working together is possible. This day under the signs of 'Nueve' and 'antifasacist, republican and libertarian Spain' demonstrated it again.  All available premises were opened, members, students of Flamenco in France and CNT militants; the artists have worked hand in hand for the success of this day which concluded with a concert where the cultures of the Balkans, Gipsies and Flamenco were mixed.  In the afternoon the film '*La Nueve or the forgotten victory*' allowed the new Hispanic generations present, the neighbours of the Quarter and everyone to discover an often overlooked part of the history of the Liberation of Paris and also to support the claim brought by the Les Pas Sages de Vignoles association : to keep the present occupants and also devote a space dedicated to what made the history of 33.  These women and men who, from 1936 in Spain until the end of their days in Paris at 33, devoted their lives to liberty. They 'had' been revolutionaries in the Spanish war, members of the French Resistance, soldiers in the Free French Forces, survivors of the Mauthausen Camp, anti-Franco combatants, they were and still are living members of the CNT. A mini-exhibition in the halls gave life to this reality.  The Association Les Pas Sages des Vignoles will continue its efforts to keep the occupants and the opening of a space dedicated to antifascist and libertarian republican Spain at 33 Vignoles.  Finally, we thank all the people who came to support us who came as individuals or as members of the support committee.  For those who want to support us a petition can be signed online at https://www.change.org/p/mairie-de-paris-d%C3%A9fense-du-33-rue-des-vignoles-pour-que-vive-le-paris-populaire      'KSP' ?   Ooops. Looks like the link is broken.   **Second Round: Second Libertarian Spring Day in Havana**  El Taller Libertario Alfredo Lpez, Locacin Cristo Salvador, y El Guardabosques  We are calling the Second Libertarian Spring Day in Havana to be held from May 29 to June 7, 2015. An open space with dynamic, anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist process having forms of sociability and awareness based on horizontality, mutual learning and accountability.  We intend this day to be, as its name suggests, the evocation of a spring shoot of libertarian ideals whose roots, despite all historical adversity, always seek the right keys for a new breath, new routes for further exploration and possibilities for struggle and transformation.  The Conference will be structured along the following lines:  *Practices, resistance, autonomy, self-organization, solidarity, mutuality and networks  *Art and anti-authoritarian creation  *The new scene of interstate relations between Cuba and the United States  *Diversity: racial, sexual, gender, class, territorial, cultural and others  *Environmentalism, technology and action  We hope for your communication and thank you in advance for any help in promoting this event.  Havana, April 12, 2015  For contacts and information: primavera@riseup.net      OK I'll be kind. You've designed a 'nutbot' to supposedly identify nuts, libertarian spammers, and reply incoherently to them. The trouble is that the bot is either barely literate or it drinks on the job. What it does is tag mention of certain names or phrases and makes a silly comeback. What it *isn't* doing properly is to actually see what a post is all about. I went through its first 7 or 8 'hits', and two other posts were misidentified as 'libertarian' when they were the precise opposite. The bot needs a lot of work. Either that or taking the pledge.   Oh, a 'nutbot'. I guess it's fun for somebody who can't accomplish anything real in life.   Fastest keyboard in Dodge City ?   An Addendum: **FAR links/liens/enlaces**  Blog: http://federacionanarquistaderosario.blogspot.ca   Email: federacionanarquistaderosario@riseup.net  Facebook: Search/rechercher/buscar 'Federacion Anarquista de Rosario'   A nit well picked. Tolkien was indeed born RC. His mother converted to Catholicism, and she was determined that her children would be "well Churched". The term 'Anglo-Catholic' spans an expanse of views, all the way from fairly orthodox High Anglicans (Episcopalians in the US) whose theology differs from that of Roman Catholicism in significant ways, through shadings within the Anglican Communion, to independent Churches that are halfway between to the 'Anglican Rite' (a thing that Benedict XVI - fondly known as Pope Rottweiller to some - initiated and is still a matter of debate/negotiation) to full acceptance of the rules and rites of the Latin Rite.   It's a complex matter, and to me it isn't surprising that Tolkien was 'upset' about Lewis only going 'half-way' from Tolkien's point of view. The shades of opinion in what is called 'Anglo-Catholicism' can seem opaque to an outsider. Very much as debates about Christology/The Trinity are to even the vast majority of Christians. Splits in leftist politics often look exactly as strange to non-leftists. Yes, I still think 'Anglo-Catholic' is a good term for Tolkien because he was part of that broad intellectual milieu.   Other than that I am glad you pointed out that the man was indeed born Catholic. His religion was, to him, a much more important thing than any politics, and looking at his life from that point of view can really help dispel some of the misconceptions about his opinions.   Oh shit. I guess the item wasn't as reliable as I thought.   It's an interesting essay (almost a book), and it will take time to read and digest it all. Thanks for the contribution.   That's hardly surprising. Like his fellow fantasy writer C.S. Lewis Tolkien was an 'anglocatholic' with all that implied. All politics aside his loyalty to the Church meant that reports of the early atrocities during the Spanish Revolution impressed him greatly. There's more than one level of irony in this. First of all it was not the 'Communists' who engaged in anti-religious action but rather the anarchists. It was many months before the then miniscule PCE was able to exert any influence other than through their PSOE/PSUC allies. The second irony is that the atrocities were brought to an end in the space of about 2 months... by the anarchists themselves who brought the 'uncontrollable' elements under control. The reports of these events lasted longer than the events themselves. The final irony is that Tolkien' s economic views, basically Catholic 'Distributionism' were closer to anarchism than to any other more popular political trend. History can be, and is, messy.   It sets off my 'ick reflex'. While I'm not a big fan of chicken (I prefer beef) I haven't had great experiences with 'soy anything'. I guess it would depend upon process as you suggest. I gather you don't have extensive experience either. To be honest the sort of place I'd be most likely to meet such a thing would be in a vegan restaurant, and I avoid them like the plague. There are indeed vegetarian dishes that are appealing, but you pretty well have to go to an Indian restaurant to find them.   In a way yes. The researchers in the paper cited plucked hairs a certain distance from each other. What they tried to show was that this action led to the skin cells sensing the 'damage' and sending chemical signals to hair follicles to initiate hair growth. My analogy wasn't really proper. 'Shaving' is more like driving a lawnmower over your garden. Mowing a lawn certainly has effects on subsequent grass growth, though I think it is more a matter of altering the local environment of a grass shoot (more light) than of chemical communication. I might be wrong on this. Digging the whole thing up is like pulling out all the hairs in a given area of the scalp. Thus neither you nor I chose the proper example.   Thank you.   I never thought of that. Possibly yes.   Yes, but this is 'shaving' rather than selective 'plucking'.   Not really. From my reading of this the plucking was quite selective and well spaced. It was more like thinning the plants in a garden rather than ploughing the whole thing down.   The war widened as Coke came in on the American side, and Pepsi declared its allegiance to Russia. The small nation of Burger King was obliterated as the rival armies fought in out on their buns. China seized the opportunity and overran Siberia in a 'take-out' move. Russia struck back with its nuclear Subway fleet. In the end the combatants met for a peace conference at the Pizza Hut. When the armistice treat was finally signed the Taco Bells rang out across the world.   I wonder what the 'imitation chicken' is made of.   I've never heard of 'Lyfe Kitchens'. How is it doing ?   Thanks.   The votes are up and down. The article mentions one other Supreme Court ruling on a piece of Saskatchewan legislation that was taken as a sort of precedent in these cases. I think the answer to your question is that each new piece of legislation has to be challenged separately in court.   I guess I'll have to leave out the non-political magazines and sources as well as the ones that come to my door in physical space. I'll put in a list later today.   It's good to see that you are posting from both sides of this dispute. That is obviously what *should* be done, and it is the kind of openness that I'd like to see a lot more of.   Yes. 'Mostly' is not exactly a precise mathematical term.   It's been many years now, but I can remember the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline hearings. Many of the objections raised then would still be relevant.   The two pipeline proposals discussed in the article are both exclusively in Canadian territory. The article also mentions a non-pipeline proposal, a railroad that terminates in Valdez Alaska, but this isn't the major subject.   It sounds like a Riel idea. I've always wondered how Dumont could stand some of Louis' bizarre ideas.   There has to be a fly in the ointment somewhere in there. I got it. Melting permafrost becomes muskeg. Trying to build pipelines on muskeg is a futile task.    There certainly are a lot of problems. Can you imagine having to deal with a pipeline breakage around the time of spring melt ?   Yeah. I wonder how much (ap)peal they have. That's a bit too slippery to pin down.    It actually is amusing. :)   This had me going for awhile. There actually *is* an old inactive sub called r/banarchism. Plus one called r/The_Banarchist and a user of the same name. The little cult that controls meta relish the attention no matter how much they may say otherwise.   Sorry my mistake. I've made this goof before, but I forgot.   There's a lot of unknowns in trying to decide if these protests are a good idea or not. The worst case scenario, aside from a coup d'tat by the right, would be if Syriza fails in its game of chicken with the Troika but retains a broad base of support amongst the population. Guess who will be looked at as 'traitors' in that case.  There are a lot of things happening in Greece beyond the flashy news of riots. I'm thinking mainly of gradual expansion of the self-managed sector of the economy. Health care collectives/worker coops for instance have grown tremendously. This is hardly due to some thought-out plan by anarchists but rather because of the initiative of ordinary people.  Win or lose against the government the Greek anarchists show little sign of having any plans for either victory or defeat.     Yes, they are used in some schools and wanted by some in many others. The first thing that comes to my mind is that such a measure automatically gives an advantage to teachers in schools that draw from a wealthier demographic in comparison to those teaching in schools where the pupils come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. It can happen that a teacher in a poorer school has done a remarkable job in generally inspiring his or her students, but if compared to his more privileged colleague in a wealthy school he or she may comes off in such a crude metric as 'inferior'. This can happen even if the teacher in a wealthy school is quite slack.   But I don't think it will give you infallibility. Yeah, I know...the title.   Or, from another point of view, be persuaded to give the pursuit of their own interests less importance than the elevation of a new ruling class to power, a class that would 'supposedly' look after their interests for them. Many socialists of Lenin's day saw 'What is to be Done' as not only a naked justification of tyranny but also as a blueprint for how not the workers but rather a class recruited from and directed by the intelligentsia would gain power using the workers as pawns.  The most cogent critic amongst Lenin's contemporaries was perhaps Jan Waclaw Machajski. To my knowledge his 'The Intellectual Worker' is still unavailable in English. His views are, however, well set forth in ['State Socialism'](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jan-waclaw-machajski-state-socialism).   Yes, that's my opinion as well. It leads to a great 'what to do'.   There's a long ideological argument behind that. Many have argued that the people who come to power in a Leninist revolution are generally not from the 'working class' (pretty well universally true) and that they create what is actually a new ruling class over and against the workers whom they claim to be representing. See Milovan Djilas' 'The New Class' amongst many other writings on the subject. If I were a Marxist I'd call this a 'contradiction' between the official ideology and the economic reality.   There is a good collection at the [Marxists.Org](http://www.marxists.org/subject/left-wing) . The site has links to archives of various authors who wrote in that tradition. There used to be a better collection, but it has gone bye-bye because it was on Geocities.   It might be a difficult point in law, but the general argument would be under the heading of "possession of goods obtained by crime". Suppose you are an ordinary citizen who (unknowingly of course) purchases an item from 'Sneaky Steven'. Further suppose that somehow said item was traced to your possession after Sneaky was caught. The law says, and it has justification, that the real owner is the victim of the theft, and the item has to be returned to him or her. Your loss of the purchase money to Sneaky is not considered to be an excuse for you to not return the item.  These sort of cases happen routinely. Cases involving money are less common, but the same principle should apply. Whether the Church is legally *forced* to return the money depends upon two things. One; their legal objections. Note carefully that they hired an attorney to present their case. The second influence is *willingness to prosecute*. Their apparent escape is probably very much due to the latter.  Once more, think of it as if you were the victim of a crime. Fraud is just as criminal as breaking and entering, and the victim should be able to recover the money lost to fraud, even if a third party now possesses it.  As to the fact that the money has already been spent - that would *not* absolve an individual in the same position as the Church. No doubt a deal would be worked out to repay in installments - just as the Church should. They do, after all, have an income. I doubt they are like the birds of the air and the flowers of the field.  Devil's advocates are always welcome. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints relies heavily on them. It's always good to ask questions.  Natural justice I believe it's called.   Well, if I was a contractor hired to install new marble tabletops in the Pastor's house I'd be as pleased as punch.   Freedom to keep stolen money is, of course, 'religious freedom', to some. Didn't the Rabbi in the Gospels have something to say about a golden god ? The only 'freedom' here is 'free' money obtained by the 'freedom' to steal.   It's a bit off the subject, but there's a Far Side cartoon about dogs and coprophagia. It goes like this:  *The panel has a 'kid dog' with tears streaming down his face standing in front of an older dog in a chair with a blanket over his lap (to give the impression of age).*  *The caption reads:  "I'll have you know that your grandfather ate shit, that his father ate shit and his father before him ate shit. There's nothing wrong with eating shit.... and don't ever let any cat tell you otherwise."*  Yep, it's an old dog habit.   No, but it may be a way to get campaign donations from energy companies.   It's an expanding field of research for sure. It's interesting that the work described here doesn't involve modification of the microbiome but rather modification of the body's response to it. Two sides of one coin.   I see no reason to forbid it. Cooking can remove any potential harm. Personally it triggers my 'ick reflex', but I don't think that things that I think are 'icky' should necessarily be banned.   Less 'unified' than a globe-spanning agricultural corporate feudalism by far.   It's a complicated relationship for sure.   Yep, I had a look and it's pretty wild. The Global Times is actually a government approved site. I read it because despite its status a lot of real news is published there. It's not like in the 'bad old days' when the Chinese press was basically a wall of rhetoric.   It's getting harder and harder for the US prison system to obtain the drugs they use. As the article mentions the AMA and the US anaesthetist association have passed resolutions saying it is unethical for their members to supply drugs for executions or for them to participate in them. The pharmaceutical companies themselves have refused to supply the drugs domestically, and they have also taken a position against supplying them from overseas. This is only partly from humanitarian motives. The companies have to be compliant with European law. The 'compounding' mentioned is when a pharmacist takes a chemical and modifies its form ie it is *not* the original drug. The originals are forbidden because of the laws and policies mentioned. Compounded products are only *theoretically* safe and effective. Almost none of the formulations used have ever been tested in a proper trial.  My prediction is that the US prison system will soon start ordering drugs from suppliers in India with all that implies. I'm sure it has been discussed in the proverbial 'back rooms'. The speed bump would be that it would be hard to make a profit with the relatively small amounts that would be ordered, and hence the deal wouldn't be attractive to Indian manufacturers. They presently make good money with antibiotics, but unfortunately not *all* manufacturers in that country have anything like quality control.   That might be the most democratic solution.   The IWA-AIT *was* present in the form of the Spanish CNT. There is a report on the event on their website. I just haven't got around to translating it yet. The meeting, however, was more of an informal gathering rather than one of organizations.   There are more problems with Stanchev's article than just a confusion between anarchists and left communists, but I'll deal with those elsewhere. For now I'll merely add to what you have said.  Saying that the 'anarchist milieu' is "slightly" larger than the left-com one is true understatement. Left communism had its glory days following 1968, and it was incapable of finding any particular field of action that might turn it from an intellectual hobby into a real political force. In other words it missed the bus, and said bus won't be coming by again.   The ICC, for instance, is to all aspects virtually invisible, and it would be impossible to tell if it had 10 or 20 people worldwide. I see their propaganda now and then, mostly in Libcom, but I can't force myself to read more than a paragraph or two at a time. I also know one person who claims to have met an actual ICC member *in the flesh*. The ICC are so irrelevant that these two claims together may make me something of a 'world's expert' on them.  Be that as it may anarchist opinions vary, as they should, about the nature and prospects of the revolution in Kurdistan. There is nothing wrong with looking at what is happening there dispassionately. The Dauv article, of course, crosses the line into sectarian attack, and it also spends an inordinate amount of time on matters that are either irrelevant or make sense only to those conversant with the private language of leftism.  It should be noted that the British Anarchist Federation is part of the [International of Anarchist Federations](http://www.i-f-a.org) that has affiliates across Europe and South America. Anyone can look at their websites to see the general support for the Kurds, support that like that of the AF extends into the real world and out of the politically correct circles of fans of things like ROAR magazine. You have also pointed out the activity of the platformist oriented groups which hasn't been minuscule.   The IWA-AIT doesn't seem to have a generally accepted position on the Kurdistan issue, but they have no generally accepted position on a whole lot of things. Judging from the position of the Spanish CNT they are most definitely 'pro-Kurd', and given the nature of the IWA-AIT I think that pretty well goes for the international sections as well.  The anarchosyndicalist unions outside of the AIT such as the CGT of Spain, the CNT-f of France and the SAC of Sweden have been quite active in promotion of the Kurdish cause, and given that they are larger than the AIT affiliates they have also been able to offer tangible material aid. Other IFA affiliates such as the Fdration anarchiste of France have also been consistent supporters of the Kurds.  In sum the non-English speaking anarchist movement has been consistently and effectively active in support of the revolution in Kurdistan. Many have reservations about the nature of events there and have voiced them, but they are hardly sectarian purists such as those Stanchev pillories. Stanchev's article uses the example of *one* left communist author to attack not just other left communists but also anarchists that he knows full well don't fit into the picture of his strawman. One might wonder about his real purposes, but, as I said, leave that for later.   I guess that's likely. Ah, *politicians*.   You're welcome. I checked, and what I wrote before is basically accurate. There were, however, two fatalities not one. As of now the fire has been classed as accidental.   I'll have to check the reports, but my memory says that the fire began in a residential unit near to the AK Press warehouse. I believe there was one fatality. In other words AK was more of a 'bystander' to this event. The damage to their stock was from smoke and water.  I don't know about the general measures that the landlord (they rent a spot in a complex owned by somebody else) took or didn't take as to fire safety, and the legal responsibility of the landlord is they weren't 'up to code'. In many (most ?) jurisdictions in North America landlords are required to have working fire alarms in their units. There may be places where sprinkler systems are required in commercial units, but I *think* there are not many of those. The premises were mixed commercial/residential. I'll be back to you when I check the details of the event.   Thanks. I missed the man himself in my search. Much appreciated.   I think you're right. My understanding of it is that a mutation in a suppressor gene essentially causes it to make an inoperative product. Perhaps, however, if the mutation weren't in said gene itself but in its allied 'controllers' there may be a possibility. Say that p51 is controlled by a set of promoters, initiators and its own suppressers, and a mutation at a different site "supressed the suppressor(s) of the suppressor". Complicated....yes.    It's true about his previous record, but hopefully, as you say, his present opinion is a bit more stable. I know....stable opinions and principles from a politician ??????   Thanks for the warning. I didn't think of the possibility that someone might try foxglove as a DIY experiment. People do things that are inconceivable to me.   Arnie as Arnie or Arnie as Conan ? I never knew that. Where can I find him here ?  Edit: It's OK. I found the r/arnoldschwartzenegger subreddit. Neat. Next I'll go looking for Conan.   I'm glad you pointed out some of the complications here, but I am puzzled about one thing. I can't think of any situation where licensing is "a tool to keep markets competitive". Maybe it's just too late at night and my mind is in cruise control, but can you give an example ?   Oh shit. Trouble follows me wherever I go. As the 'copyee' I'm not too upset though I am quite puzzled as to the why and how. I post in a great number of different forums, some of them quite far removed from the anarchist ideology and some of them not political at all. Occasionally I may make a mistake and 'double post' in the same forum even though I have a general procedure for trying to avoid this. At other times I am #2 in a given forum (usually on matters scientific or technical), and the moderators of a given board remove the duplicate and inform me of same. No problem from my point of view. Reddit is often inaccurate in informing a poster of duplicate status. Gotta go for Easter dinner so I'll be back on this later. Good luck, and I advise diplomacy.   Yes, but this situation is a bit different. For one he is a Republican. The second point is his fame because of his film career. As you say there are scores of politicians who disagree with such laws, but 'Conan' is more newsworthy than most others.   Why not now ? The guy should have watched himself. The Gayluminaty of Vienna have agents everywhere. ;)   You and me both. Trying to find interesting subreddits on reddit can be, let us say, "interesting". I'd suggest that the moderators take a look at further promotion of this site.   I once read an article that tried to list all the opposition groups in Syria. To say the least there are many. The groups divide along not just religious, ethnic and ideological lines but also along geographic and even personal lines. To make it worse the groups often change their name, ally and un-ally with others. Makes it hard to keep track.   ;) .I guess the old 'da debil made me do it' is out of fashion.   Cosmology...the game ?    That could be amusing.   True, but going from here it comes to the classic conclusion of academic papers..."further research is required".   Yes, like you I see progress, but the trend is not inevitable.   I doubt that that is possible or it just wouldn't be fermentation. Perhaps, however, my imagination is limited. Culture in the presence of carbon dioxide absorbers ? Reutilization of CO2 for other purposes such as organic chemical feedstocks ? Your point is well taken.   Thanks for the contribution. I'd be the last to deny that there are 'problems in the house of labor'. To some extent the unions are already reaching out beyond their membership to other unions, social movements and the public at large. There is still a long way to go. The perceived opposition between 'jobs and the environment' as illustrated by your quotation above is a pretty clear example. Union members have to recognize that they aren't just workers but are also members of the community. Reconciling the two 'goods' is a work that is very much in progress.   Thank you. That saves me some work in regards to the Kurds. As for pure 'humanitarian' donations for those who want to avoid all politics there is the [Syrian Red Crescent](http://sarc.sy). Be aware that I am unfamiliar with this outfit. I hope it isn't like the Red Cross where 1)you have no control over *what* your donation goes to ie not always the particular call you responded to and 2) a far too large amount of revenue goes to 'administration'. there is also the [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](http://www.unocha.org/syria). With this outfit you can be assured that the money donated will go to the cause specified. I don't, however, know about the 'administration overhead'. It's probably less than that of the Red Cross given funding from the UN itself.  I've got to remember to add these pathways to solidarity in future. The donation path is contained in the SFF, but it is hidden in the website.   Thank you. I'll be on alert for that.   Not really. The article mentions the natural disasters, but it is mainly concerned with the structural deficiencies due to (mainly) American influence in that country. The two are not necessarily unconnected. A country's ability to recover from natural disasters depends on the capacity of its infrastructure and organization. Haiti's history has left it dramatically deficient in the sort of 'civil society' organizations that quite frequently help recovery more than either the government or foreign aid NGOs. In connection with the latter there are numerous accounts of how aid 'pledges' are not being fulfilled or of how the money is pissed away or wasted on useless projects once it does arrive.  I can appreciate your feeling that the left, most particularly the American left, overemphasizes the role of American foreign policy and corporations in every single problem anywhere in the world. I put it this way; "Americans are the most patriotic nation on Earth. They are under the illusion that all that is good in the world only exists because of the USA. If Americans "catch leftism" they switch over to blaming the US for everything bad anywhere. This attitude is just as patriotic as the first. All it does is switch the adjectives." In this case, however, throwing rocks at the White House is the proper description to a first approximation.  As a side note of interest anarchists have a dog in this fight. In the past the Haitian union Bataille  Ouvrire has collaborated with anarchosyndicalists and other anarchists. I'm not up to date on what their organization has been doing recently.   Thank you. I've already made the post I wanted stickied. Hopefully it will work with editing. I'll see. You've been a great help.   Stranger things have happened. There are evangelical Christian Churches that are *definitely* on the left on many issues.   I wonder if r/anarchism and r/metanarchism are indeed the top of the mocking list at subs like r/SubRedditDrama ? I've seen it said that the two most popular clowns of stage, screen and politics were u/Laurelai and u/volcanoclosto .    True. There are advantages.   Please see reply to u/audiored   The group that sponsors the [Syria Freedom Forever](http://syriafreedomforever.wordpress.com) page is the [Revolutionary Left Current in Syria](http://revleftcurrentsyria.com). If you look at the link 'Support and Solidarity with the Revolutionary Left Current in Syria' on their page banner. You will see the information for donations to their work in Syria.  In the interests of transparency it should be noted that the Revolutionary Left Current are Trotskyist in orientation. They are, however, very non-sectarian, and given the situation in the many sided Syrian civil war a donation to them is also a donation to others such as the Kurds with whom they are in alliance.  Personally I don't share their political opinions, but I still feel that they are progressive in the context they operate in. There are many sides there, the Assad government, ISIS, the al-Nusra al-Qaeda branch franchise, the Kurds and a plethora of other groups based on ethnicity and/or political positions. Within that fractured 'others' grouping some are quite content to be essentially American puppets while others look towards a more non-aligned and/or socialist future.  The Kurds have mounted a much wider network for international solidarity through their anarchist allies. I will provide links to them as well as non-political relief agencies ( for those who are uncomfortable with *any* political group) later today.      Yes, that's interesting isn't it.   Yes, I'll agree. The goal is clear and not befuddled by other side issues. Like you I think that clarity is important.    I see. I'm not immediately familiar with either the brewing or the wine industry though I am familiar with other parts of agriculture. As a point of interest one side of my family were vintners way back and far, far away, but it is more than a few worlds away. Talk about cows and wheat (or even barley or oats) and I can hold a sensible conversation. I did have an uncle by marriage who worked in a winery (and grew his own grapes from Italy for his own wine in his backyard), but that's about all for an immediate connection.  I thank you very much for your contribution even though I still think that beer and wine are a bit more 'civilized' than bottled water. Nestl has an unadmirable record in many places in the world, not just in California, and I still see the point of the demonstrators.   True. My own personal political beliefs favor the maximum possible amount of decentralization *possible*. The key word is 'possible'. There are difficulties in the application of decentralization, and I think it should be more an often unrealizable ideal rather than an ideological 'demand'. How this works out in the gradual process of social change I can't and I think nobody can give simplistic and dogmatic answers. Practice makes perfect, and it also makes real.  Thanks for your opinions.   Your numbers appear to be correct. The 'water footprint' of brewing is in the ranges you suggest even though 98% of the *total* water accounting is prior to brewing in the cultivation of barley and hops.   That's a good point. My mind got fixated on bottles. As I said I'll look. Thank you.   You might be right. The articles I remember were about crops for human consumption. The alfalfa fields that I am familiar with, however, are not irrigated. It might be different in drier places. More stuff to look up.   That's interesting. I'm going to have to look up the process. All that I know immediately is from 'home-brewing' where basically 1 gallon of water equals one gallon of beer minus minor loss via waste. Working from basic principles there would have to be some very large dump of waste water from causes I am unfamiliar with given that the main process of beer production after fermentation is filtration to improve clarity. Bottle washing ? Hopefully back to you later.   No problem.   All microbiology aside the taste of well water that puts some people off is basically from two chemical factors: hardness and nitrate content. The first is basically harmless, but *I* can tell the taste difference. To me bottled water often tastes 'flat'. Despite all the endless mineral content that is sometimes listed on the label it hardly ever seems 'hard'. Some of this may also be due to the lack of the chlorinated hydrocarbons that often give tap water its taste. One thing that should be noted however. There has been more than one case where so-called 'spring water', 'mineral water', whatever has been nothing more than the tap water of the town where the plant is located.  Your illness was probably due to bacterial or parasitic causes which can be a community-wide problem or just leaky pipes in a neighbourhood or single residence. High nitrate concentrations can lead to diarrhea but rarely to vomiting in my knowledge.   I don't know. It seems like a question that could be answered.   I'd have to consult a time zone map. As of now it's about 16:00 GMT. If you go east 8 times zones then it is indeed tomorrow. I guess that's Beijing time. Yeah, that's right. Noon is quite arbitrary.   The water quality of tap water varies with the location, treatment used and time of year. Personally I grew up in a small 'town' (to overstate the case) where all water was well water. It got stinky at times, but few people got sick from it. I guess we all adjusted. Sometimes that's impossible. I know of one reservation that has had a 'boil water' advisory for upwards of 17 years, and there may be worse cases. Back in the days when I had money to travel one of the first things I'd do when the plane touched down is immediately drink the local water. Sort of get it over with.  In any case one thing I know about the issue from reading about it over the years... there is *no* guarantee that bottled water will be any better than tap water except in regards to the market-sensitive matter of 'taste'. Sometimes it's worse.   I guess, but try to remember that life is not an online game. It's *real*. Please also try and remember that pretty well *all* of the protestors care about the issue, not about theater.   I guess, but try to remember that life is not an online game. It's *real*.   Two peas, same pod.   Well, now that I`ve been mercifully banned from r/anarchism I can speak my mind. As far as 'leftydom' goes I've been around from before the time most of the r/metanarchism cult's *parents* were in diapers. Here's the problem: as I see it *both* the fake anarchists *and* the 'tankies' as you call them have been gradually dumbed down over the last few decades. There is some commonality between the two groups for the simple reason that both have been sinking in both quality and public appeal for a long time.  Commies are, of course, strange, and given their youth they have no memory of what Leninism in power actually was. They mirror the bizarros who want to reanimate fascism, and their is now exchange of personnel between them, the faux-anarchists and the nostalgic fascists. To a large extent the motives behind adherence to any one of these so-called 'options' is the same - identity seeking amongst a large group of empty lost people.  The faux-anarchists look like the 'tankies' because their causes, their convoluted 'theory' and their motivation are the same. A lot of this, at least the crude justification of it, can be blamed on my own generation. Politically correct Maoists gave up on 'The Revolution', went into academic careers and kept their attitudes intact. They taught them to new generations with different targets for totalitarianism but the same methods.  Have hope. Most of these fuckers took the early retirements from academia that they qualified for. Demographics will do what argument cannot.   Yes, I remember reading about water requirements for various crops, and I seem to recall that almonds were the highest.   What it is is getting *exactly* the same physical result without the cost of loss of public sympathy and legal complications. All that is 'lost' by using the tactics they did is some sense of personal superiority. People can live without that.  As an interesting contrast I posted this item elsewhere, and an opponent of the action waded in with a complaint that the police "didn't enforce the law". That person made the same mistake you do only he was on the other side. The police got their job done without loss of public sympathy and with far less complications than adding in with clubs swinging.  The protesters knew their job, and the police knew theirs. Each side acted to get what they wanted with the least cost.  Cost and benefit.    No where near the amount of guns dedicated to protecting the ability of business to exploit their workers. No where near.   That gives all sorts of workers the opportunity to walk out.   Ever read the 'Book of Revelation' ? A lot of people in the first two centuries CE believed that it was indeed a travel guide rather than poetry, and they also took the "this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished" bit elsewhere quite literally.  So...in the interim while waiting for the seven angels, seven trumpets and seven seals and all the other sevens there are other things to do. Think about it.   On occasion their falsehoods actually cross the line into real criminal libel.   I see the article mentions farmworkers and domestic care workers as being left out. There is another category, that of workers in industries where tips are a practice. Most of this is the restaurant industry, but I'm sure they may be others.   Support. This will be nothing if not interesting. But you know Post, in the end you're going to regret this. It will only be fun for a short time. Think ahead, think ahead.  On a side note wasn't the r/postleftanarchism addition voted on months ago and had a yes ?   Busy, busy, busy Mr Rent Check ? Here's wishing you a fat old time.   Actually given the intellectual tools he had he did a fairly good job. A few things should be noted. The first is that his book wasn't just about the fate of state socialist societies. Burnham, like others at the time, saw fascism and American-style corporatism as equally roads that were leading to a 'new mode of production' (Marxist category) with the managers replacing the capitalists as the ruling class.  The second thing to note is that this was a dispute that did indeed begin amongst Trotskyists. There were basically three positions vis-a-vis the so-called 'socialist states'. The orthodox one is the 'deformed workers' state' which saw nothing wrong with a system of nationalized industry and said that the 'proletariat' could exercise ultimate control over such an economy via its political organization(s). The second was the 'state capitalism' position which tried to describe the 'socialist' states as merely another form of capitalism which the workers couldn't control with minor reforms. The final position, Burnham's one, was what is called 'bureaucratic collectivism' which said, as mentioned above, that the managers were a new ruling class and the economies they controlled were fundamentally different from capitalism.  The 'bureaucratic collectivism' position is inherently unstable. It is often a stop-over point to a final destination on either the right, like Burnham, or to the left as in council communism. The internal operations of a Leninist party are simply too obvious and easy to describe as such a new class in embryo to lead to an 'enduring marriage'.  Another thing to be considered is that writers on the 'New Class' seem to be almost always blind to either writers who commented on the subject before. You will find no mention in Burnham of Jan Waclaw Machjiaski and the 'Workers' Conspiracy', despite the fact that this group was well known amongst the Russian revolutionaries. Neither will you find any credit being given to a number of fairly unradical orthodox economists such as Berle and Means who described the process of 'managerialization' in Western 'capitalism' before he did.  Going forward you will find ex-communist dissidents such as Milovan Djilas who wrote his 'The New Class' focused only on East Bloc (and his native Yugoslavia of which he was once vice-president) with no reference to either fascism nor Western corporate structure. This tradition of not giving credit continues today in the writings of the advocates of Parecon who never note the ancestry of their 'coordinator class'.   Burnham's central idea was hardly his alone, and like all the many others who have written on the subject he would have laughed at the idea that the trends he was describing were due to some subjective conscious "wanting" on the part of the socialists. At the time he wrote he was still a good enough Marxist to bring old Karl's opinion on subjective desires and social change to bear on such an opinion. If a landslide in in process it doesn't matter what the boulders want.  I could say more, but deviating a bit from the subject you will find the essence of Burnham's position described quite well in "The Book" supposedly written by the dissident Goldstein in Orwell's 1984.   Yes true. That's a possible explanation as well.   My cynical mind comes up with the idea that some people are only happy when they are fighting.   mBio is the journal of the American Society for Microbiology which, according to their self-description has 30,000 members. You may wish to investigate their organization before any further comments. The point you raise about 'detergents' may be well taken given other information about such things as a pathway to resistance via active export of antimicrobials being promoted due to 'hand sanitizers' in common use. Perhaps you might want to write the journal about your concerns but please remember the following:  *If certain products are 'always' combinations of certain ingredients and if the products in question lead to certain results one might argue about 'which' ingredient is the culprit, but one cannot argue that the effect is not produced unless, of course, the research fails to be replicated.*   The best place to begin is with [Le Monde Libertaire](http://www.monde-libertaire.fr). It's the press organ of the FA (Fdration anarchiste the major grouping of French-speaking anarchists in France, Belgium and Switzerland). Look back to the January issue for the FA's statement and follow the news items for further developments. The anarchosyndicalist CNT-f (Vignolles) and other groups not affiliated to the FA spoke in the same manner.  In Spain the anarchist groups and unions reacted in the same manner. This included the CNT, the CGT, Solidaridad Obrera and the FAI. The most 'heated' item I read was in the pages of Umanita Nova, the organ of the Italian FAI (the *real* one not the shady one).Unfortunately I had to use Google Translate on this, but the blood and thunder came through nonetheless. Nobody can beat the Italians for shear high emotion hatred of religion.  You might also want to look at the website of the [International of Anarchist-Federations](http://i-a-f.org) for links to other groups. I can look up further French links for you if you like.  All the statements and reporting are of a type. They include:  -Clear condemnations of the Charlie Hebdo murderers with *no* hedging or hinting about how somehow the victims "deserved it" because they weren't up to 'anti-isms' of American ~~psychology cult~~ leftism.  -A clear and undisguised statement about how such murderous acts serve the interests of the state and the right by providing justification for further repression.  -A clear explanation of why the anarchists don't wish to participate in many of the 'Je suis Charlie' events because of the use that the state makes of these and the presence of some *very* unsavoury groups in the lineup of these events.  -Warnings of the backlash against European Muslims and statements of solidarity *with the very important provisio that the anarchists will not cease anti-religious propaganda* in relation to Islam and other religions. Nor will they associate with extreme theocratic groups under some pretense of 'solidarity'.  -Statements about the role of Western imperialism in Muslim countries *without trying to lay all the blame on this factor*.  So have a look. In the anglosphere 'PCism' is not the exclusive possession of the anarchists. It infects most of the left to one degree or another, especially in the USA. It's not an affliction that is shared by many in the rest of the world.   Don't forget omega191, the banned account from which the person in question snuck back as volcanoclosto.   Well at least for pharmaceutical companies.   Oppose. Accusations of say 'pedophilia' and rape threats are, of course, serious matters that happen to cross the line into criminal libel if unsubstantiated. Hmmmm. Accusations of doxxing aren't considered an offense outside of reddit where it is the doxxing itself that is considered serious.  In all cases the claims must be substantiated, and truth is a defense. The last item, however, is far more serious than anything covered in internet rules or in the criminal law. To disprove the accusation a person would have to provide evidence that it *isn't* true. In any case being volc is about the worst insult anybody could utter.    It really depends on the character of the recipient.    The first thing that comes to my mind is that the whole effect could possibly be explained by the idea that the rats became 'laid back'. That is they were putting less stress on the bone to be healed.   Thank you. I had a look at the item, and it seems that the lobbying on the part of industry has only been minimally successful. The lobby's target is the Black Congressional Caucus, and they will, of course, look at the matter from the point of view of their interest group. The most likely outcome is likely to be that black legislators will be 'on side' with solar providing it can be demonstrated that the interests of black people are properly protected.  The question is much bigger 'out on the rez', and the general consensus of First Nations is that solar energy is very much in their interests. In many cases the cost advantage of solar is even greater for native communities because of the cost of power transmission to isolated communities. There are cases where native groups oppose certain projects, but they are outweighed by the far more numerous cases where tribes are developing their own solar resources.  I'm not surprised that industry lobbyists will lobby who and where they can. While their arguments are not as dramatically ridiculous as they are in the case of reservations I personally think that the final conclusion of the debate will be that solar energy is of net benefit to black communities as well.  In any case it's very interesting, and I thank you once more for pointing out something that my weak old eyes missed. Gotta get those peepers checked.   If you read any of the Latin languages such as French, Spanish or Italian you can see a vast gulf between the anarchist opinion on the continent and the PC reflex so prevalent in the English language press/web. Anarchism is a well thought out tradition in such places, not dominated by the academy and 'professional leftists'.   I've gone through the article twice, and I can't find any mention of "race". The "poor" are mentioned briefly. What part of the article are you speaking of ?   *Leaving Fantasy Island*  The reason God gave you fingers is so that you could count. I know you'd *like* it to be that min_thamee was banned "4-5 times in the past year", but that's pure imagination. Here's the reality.  On January 29, 2014 min_thamee was banned unilaterally by emma____ when he had the user name of alookyaw. He returned under the new name of min_dami, and eventually he fessed up and asked to be unbanned. This was approved by a majority. The request was made on July 10, 2014. On October 22, 2014 a ban was proposed, relying on obviously false information, and it was carried.  OK, take out those fingers. "*In the last year*" alookya/min_dami/min_thamee was banned a grand total of **one** time. Go back to the textbook, and look it up. Funny thing, *one* is **not** equal to *4-5*. Even if one were to grant that a 'year' is a 'social construction' and has 14 months rather than 12, *two* is still not equal to *4-5*.  The only way you can reach 4-5 is to include the 3 (I think) times somebody posted on meta *complaining* that min_dami hadn't been banned.  As to the three accounts matter the first change is explained above. The second was **publically** announced when min_thamee was under the mistaken impression that changing the account name would lead to a lessening of some of the pressure on him. No such luck. Not a snowball's chance in hell. Still - no sneakiness involved as is plainly shown by the record.   My mistake. "W"s don't do well on my keyboard. Good catch. Actually if you think of the utilities as pirates it makes perfect sense. :)   Just fyi the user in question is 'the man of a thousand faces' aka jaki/stirner/crabs/syndicate_V/ CGU_Bad_For_Business,  etc., etc., etc.. Good old Mr. Rentcheck has been banned more times, under more names, than you have fingers - in a single year. If you want a permanent ban it's already in place many, many times. Good luck.  	199
 A Siren with a blink ability like mages in wow. I think that could be fun if it was on a low cool down or had the potential to be with her skill tree   ATHENAAAA :D PLSSSSSSSSSSS   Could you do a Commandant Steele one? :DDDDDDD   any chance your friend can dupe me a wep and shield???   so you're saying there are more to come?   im on PC unfortunately :(   im on PC and i did them on a lower level character because a high level friend helped me with the prove yourself mission   i'm ok with the grind i just dunno how to get my hands on a modded wep and shield .   A word of warning this is one hell of a grind, there are 3 arenas to beat, each with 20 rounds and each taking about 2 hours to complete, it's not for the faint hearted   yeah sure lets go :D thanks ^^   I decided to get back into BL1 recently and have decided to get all the achievements, just for fun, however my lvl 61 roland save file seems to be corrupt or something, long story short, i leveled a siren, im now level 50 and have lost the will to live.   However to get the achievement for killing Craw im gonna need to be level 61 or have someone carry me, so i was wondering if there are any kind souls out there willing to carry a level 50 noob to help me get the achievement? :P  Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/DustyFrazer/   I want S S munitions to make a return   he asked which bosses could be farmed rapidly. Not what loot they drop...   Henry   we all know this...... doesnt mean the game inst going to ever happen.   "I'm an even better slut when i'm drunk"    What does RNG mean?   Exactly why i dont spec into anarchy. Also cos i love using my infinity WAY too much   i'd rather no teleporting at all, and you have to ride your mount everywhere and face the challenges a long the way, it'd make the game longer and more challenging as well as adding to the RPG elements of the game and taking less away from the immersion    k   Mounts! Instead of the old catch a ride system i feel the ability to mount up at any time just like you can in WoW would be really awesome.  I feel like mounts like these could fit really well into the game and it offers more charater custimization if you give the player access to rare mount skins or just rare mounts etc.   http://www.wowadventurer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ahnqirag.png   These are so awesome! Think i'll have to get the "my siren's name is brick" one :P  	22
 I see your bad sweaters and raise you this: http://imgur.com/cJ3Sc   This is Jefferton's finest family.   Yes, it was staged. We decided to break free of tradition this year with Christmas pictures. To give a sense of before and after: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/12607_447747458619863_115113246_n.jpg -- What fun it was walking around Kmart to get to their photo studio though.      oh, usually saw that. was sorta in my own world after reading this... tnx                                                         Wow--haven't really heard of anyone using Future Point's Starlight anywhere and I talk to quite a few end users. Going to have to do some research and see how they're approaching unstructured data. Just curious (hey, you said you were bored haha), other than the scaling limits you've hit with Starlight or is that all?    Hi, all I meant by vanilla was the raw open source distribution of Apache Hadoop but from what it sounds like that wouldn't be a good fit for you anyway due to some of the overhead and need to just hop in and experiment.       "You need to understand computation" ... thanks for that.  I am talking about cost and feasibility here, not possibility.    Let's you and me revisit this thread in a few years ;)      It's that we reaching the Brick Wall of Moore's Law. There are only so many transistors we can pack on a chip and with those comes some serious power/cooling overhead that negates (by far) any savings on the hardware.   Maybe, but maybe not. There's the Moore's Law issue I cited a moment ago, and the cost of powering a system like this expected to increase. It's not feasible for anyone to own one of these unless you're a research institution (like DOE Nat'l lab--not hospitals). It was a cunning play from IBM to show the applicability of HPC technologies in everyday settings but it's far from practical. Unfortunately too--imagine what would be possible with a HAL treating us! ;)   I am curious about what made you guys choose InfoSphere Streams over vanilla Hadoop (complexity, learning curve, functionality) when from what I can tell this is the same core Hadoop framwork (down to the HDFS)... Just when you get time, know you're looking for an answer but I'm just curious.    I think that Watson's role as an instant "second opinion" from a "doctor" is going to bode well for medicine in general. The issue is that only the most advanced research hospitals (who already have the most outstanding researchers/medical pros) will be able to afford a system like this. Right now the IBM System Z line is more than many universities can afford--getting it into actual hospitals is going to require some hurdling over Moore's law--if you can afford the hardware, the power and cooling for this puppy will kill you. Could be many thousands to run this each month.      And they said R couldn't scale. Bah!   Okay, fair enough. I like yours better.            Perhaps Iceland should understand this issue and offer a more attractive option to conduct business there on site but as it is, it's pretty expensive to do anything. And besides, not sure anyone (even the most hermit-inclined sys admin) wouldn't be willing to move there.                     Yes, imagine that. Doesn't usually happen that way.            Great quote... "data science is a very fuzzy term, but what seems to unite a lot of people is that is theyve come from a lot of different directions and ended up in the same place. It almost feels like this crossroads where a lot of different disciplines actually meet and share and exchange tools and techniques and talk and collaborate."   Thank you for rewriting SnapLogic's PR for the enjoyment of all, PanderDaily. :)   Mortar actually seems like a pretty interesting service. Hadoop as a service itself is going to be the next wave of services in general--all enabled by AWS (because who really uses any other cloud), I just wonder how the message about such companies is going to resonate with actual users. It's hard to wrap a "sell" around that, especially for those who've already dumped a lot of money/time into teaching a team Hadoop or getting hooked in with a distro vendor.           	56

 Thank you. It happened little over a month ago. It took me some time to bring myself to write about it.   I've told a few people I'm close to. Most seemed sympathetic (or at least didn't verbalized their skepticism).    Hi R/Nosleep. I havn't been able to sleep for a while.   Sometimes I stay up late. I love my wife, so much. So so much. But, sometimes I stay up late. My wife goes to bed, and I stay up. Redditing or playing video games, or watching T.V...   I'd fallen asleep on the couch as I often do, and I awoke to my wife standing over me, crying, shaking me awake. I asked her what was wrong, but for a while she didn't speak. She just hugged me and sobbed. I stroked her hair and comforted her.   I wondered if she might have had a dream that I died or something, or if maybe she'd received a text with some tragic news. Finally when she calmed down a little she said "Let's just sit together for a while."   "Do you want to tell me what happened?" I asked. She seemed to think about it, and decide against it. "No. I just want to spend some time with you, for a little while."   "I'm tired." I said, stretching. "Let's get in bed." "No!" she almost seemed to shout. "No. I don't want to go in the bedroom right now." I was concerned, but my wife could be a tad eccentric, sometimes even charmingly child like. Maybe going back in there would remind her of a nightmare she'd had?  We wound up sitting on the couch chatting. About anything and everything under the sun (except for what had upset her). We played portal.   She made coffee, and we snacked on some left overs. We laughed, we reminisced about the early days of our relationship. Before we knew it, it was 7:00am. "I'm too tired, sweetheart, and I'm sure you are too. Let's get some rest so we don't waste our entire Saturday."  "No! We can't! Please!" She cried. "Why!?" I asked "What's the matter?"   "We just can't go in there. Please. If we go in, it'll be over." She said, her eyes welling up with tears.  "What!? What's in the bedroom?" (I was really confused. Had she accidentally broken some heirloom, and she was afraid I'd be upset with her?)   There was a long silenced as she fought back sobs. Then finally...  "My body is in there! I'm dead, Prakash. I saw my dead body, lying on the bed. Once you see it, it'll be over."   This was a bit much. Obviously she'd had some nightmare, that she'd believed was real.   "Oh, sweetheart, no. No...it was just a bad dream. Everything is ok." I hugged her as she sobbed. "Look, you're just sleep deprived. You'll feel better when you wake up. I promise."  She nodded somberly, then walked silently, with me to the bedroom. I gestured to the empty bed, completely devoid of bodies.   "See there? It was a dream. Lay here with me." I flopped onto the bed playfully and then propped myself up on my elbow, to chat until we slept. She laid down next to me and closed her eyes.   "So, what had you dreamt?" I asked. She didn't answer. "Diane?" I asked. "Did you really fall asleep that quickly?" I laughed.    I shook her, and she was stiff. I noticed her lips were a little blue around the edges. Next I noticed she wasn't breathing.   Of course I panicked.   Of course I called 911.   She was only 27 years old. An aneurysm in her sleep. The coroner said she'd been dead for five or six hours before I "found her body".    I miss her so so much. I hope my promise is kept - where ever she is now, where ever she woke up, I hope she feels better.    [Sleep well, everyone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e485v/prakash_must_die/)   I saw her walk *through* a glass window, once. Like, just kind of *phased* through the window above my bed, as though it was open.   I think she can pass through anything light can pass through. If you have wooden shutters, try locking them, or otherwise obscuring points of entry for light.    Holy shit. I'd definitely try to stay on Matt's good side, if I were you.   That is terrifying, do you have someone else you can stay with for a while? Dogs are a great alarm system and source of protection, please get one!   	5
 That is amazingly wonderful. In highschool I never had a boy friend and going to dances was always a thing us friends did in a huge group!!! GGG   This reminded me of my boyfriend, 9 years Army. The love of my life, lost. We will meet once again my love.   If you're worried about anything supernatural, I suggest having a couple cameras set up around the room. And watch carefully and thoroughly.   Would be mine too.   Lol fuck that, normally not one toget into this argument but IPhone is ass and yes, I am using one/own one. Worst phone I've ever owned. Dot cars for apple products in general was given to me. You don't just stop being blind because of apple lol    P.S- extremelyintoxicated right now will regret this later   Congrats! Big step for him. But do not take his showing of no interest personally ever. Although it may be hard to deal with sometimes he will get there eventually. Each child goes at their own pace.   But again congrats!   Not an unpopular opinion. As a waitress/smoker and restaurantuer I cannot stand when people bring their children into our restaurant.   Beyond handsome.   Dope shirt in the bottom picture, how did you stumble into that?    I'm a bartender at two restaurants and nothing kills me more than this gluten free fad. I understand some people really cannot have gluten but the ones that can.....  My new response to people that ask what on our menu is gluten free I now tell them 'Sir/ma'am, anything that had a face.'   Whack   Microwave your spoon and catch your house on fire orrrrrrrr stick the spoon in hot water and not be a dumbass.   Because I had the luxury of being able to go on spring break and to play sports, granted I bought my first car and am still driving it to this day, but my parents had money when I was his age. My parents at this point both have jobs but at their age it's so difficult to find something like he had before making that amount of money. I wanted to help, I want my siblings to have a somewhat 'normal' life like I did. That's why I do what I do. It was my choice. I couldn't stand to see my family suffer anymore.   Without even trying   Amazing!   I grew up with those trees all down my street, I always thought they smelled like cod.   They typically form from ingrown hairs.   WTF SAME! Sylvania!    It is a cyst. I'm not an esthetician or anything but have gone numerous times to get those removed, I stopped going because I love popping things so I do it myself. I pierce the skin with a sewing needle after sanitizing it and it has to go through the layer of skin and the sack the cyst is in. It will hurt. Then squeeze. The process is a little painful and if your not grossed out easily I suggest you do it yourself. Sometimes they just explode when you least expect if so I do it myself so it doesn't happen at the wrong time. Hope that helped a little.    Fello oHIGHo tokerr, hence my user name. Wish we could blow down, that would make me one happy girl!    That's how you should be.       LOL   Calle Ciega is the name of the band.    Yes, I was in Venezuela visiting family and this guy had taken real interest in me. My cousin was freaking out, so excited that this guy was talking to me. Surprisingly he was very fluent in English and that made me really happy. We danced on the beach, had dinner and an amazing time. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next day my cousin told me who he was. Turns out he was in what we here would call a 'boy band.' South Americas Backstreet Boys. Even though I didn't know it at the time afterwards I felt an odd sense of accomplishment. Like "I just did a celebrity." Never saw him again, but did download his album off iTunes.      	26
 There's a whole mass of people who do vlogs just about books and co, why not contact some of them? I'm sure they would love to help promote new writers.   That's half the battle =]  Though editing *is* harder.   You have to want it hard enough =]   I did very little yesterday: it made me want to do more today. After today, I'm feeling pretty awesome about myself, like I want to be this productive everyday! I would pick a productive week over an unproductive week anyday. I get more tired doing nothing.   Wrote over 1k words into my novel.  Finished a long over-due script for an indie game I'm working on.  Read nearly 80 pages of my book (The Silmarillion)   And got to play some Xbox and spend time with my grandma.  How have you spent your sunday, CC'ers?   In order to produce a (just short of) 80k word novel. That is all you need to write. I know people who can spit out 1000 words in an afternoon. If you've ever been discouraged about writing, or how long it would take to write a novel. Bear that in mind.   1500 words a week.   Yep, that's the issue. However at that length there shouldn't be any qualms cutting it in two. Better than removing 50k words of story. No problems or issues making it a two-parter. Just have to rewrite the middle into a semi-ending and then a beginning for the second half. Of course you should still cut. Any extraneous that needs to be cut *needs* to be cut. That's one of the most important things in editing.   That does sound interesting...I would probably read that. I don't see a lot of superhero novels.  Also, why 50k, yikes?   I live in England. Mother's day was months ago. Begone!   There was a moment when I could have got a book for free from Amazon. It had (finally) been delivered that morning, and later on I got a call saying that - to the best of their knowledge - the item hadn't turned up and I could get a refund. I hesitated, but told them the book had arrived. Also, it was a 20 book. I could'a got a 20 book for free.   Editing is the worst. And I thought writing a novel was difficult. Until I had to edit it.  Cut out 18k words. That was damn painful. Tell me about your novel =]   *The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman*  And, *The Goblet of Fire, By Rowling*  I was thirteen when I read both of those. I think TGOF hadn't been out too long, it was before TOOTP came out. I don't quite remember the exact moment where I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I just remember I read those two books at the exact right point in my life and from then on that's what I would do. I would write.  I also wrote a really short story when I was 7. I was with my two sisters and two cousins and they were drawing, but I couldn't draw, I hated it. So I wrote a story instead. I guess I was born to be a writer =]   My uncle - Crash Bandicoot on the PS1. I was so enamoured with that game I don't even know why. I can't remember the point where I thought *"This is the best thing I have ever seen in my short, little life."* I forsook my family while we were visiting my uncle just to play my cousins PS1. After that I had to have my own. It's been a sharp decline ever since.   Thanks. That book itself is actually kinda shit haha. But we learn from our mistakes. And thankyou =]    Will do. Let me just put it into the GDocs =] I'll PM you the link.   Personally I dislike prompts. They're never your own ideas, and they're never as good as anything you could come up with; if not by virtue of being purely *your own.*  Yes, I recommend loose planning. A solid direction to go with enough room for your characters to breathe. However, if your characters go off the rails, follow them, don't ever bring them back. Just follow it through. Eventually it will lead back to a major event. I introduced an entirely new character this way who didn't exist until the moment my other two characters stumbled across him - he just appeared to them and to me - and he was pivotal in the final scenes. It really changed the whole book and for the better just because he was in it.   There was actually a section, I wouldn't mind having someone read over (though it is in the very premature stages of an early first draft). If you're interested...   Is that the sort of stuff you write?   That is true. That's my motto:  *Progress for it's own sake.*  Thanks =]   I don't read Japanese novels I'm afraid. I did read The Buried Giant, by Ishigurio, but that doesn't really count does it? Though it was a decent read.   But they aren't really those kind of spirits. I've tried my best to keep them separate so they are purely my own spirits and they adhere to the fictional rules of a fictional religion I have full control over. It's important to the story. And though I have in some cases constrained myself with my own rules, I need to know how they work, because I have to keep tabs on the effect they have on the characters.   However, Japanese culture and spirits are something really interesting to me and I will look into those two authors, if you have recommendations...   Honestly, inspiration is almost wholly useless. If I'm not inspired at the beginning of a story I won't write it down. Inspiration will take me through maybe 3,000 words. I think in one case it got me to 8,000 before I lost interest in it.   The trick is to write without inspiration or motivation - they're both too fickle to be trusted. Those few ideas you get, see them through to the end. If you don't get a lot of ideas, make the most of the ones you have. Push through them without inspiration. That's the best thing you can do. It's the only way to finish anything really.   Try writing something short. It's a really good skill to get the context of a situation in just that situation alone. If you want to write a certain scene that's more interesting to you, then do it. To conjure up smaller scenes and see if they can come together is basically how everything I write begins. This novel was three small ideas, and then I had a big idea and then I worked the smaller ideas into the big idea and brought them all together. That's just the second stage in the idea process.   For my first novel I didn't organise. I had an idea of the major events and just drove my characters into those events. I didn't like planning because thinking up what happens next is much more exciting, because I know only as much as the characters do what happens. Because of that, and a lack of plan, the novel went off rails and finished at the 125k words mark.   This novel I've planned out, though somewhat loosely, and allocated each part 30k words - 90k altogether, which is a much better place to stop a novel. To organise this I simply wrote down my ideas into a pad. I wrote a short story set in the same universe, revolving around the spirits, and a lot of the religion came from the ideas I got whilst writing that short and that religion was monumental in planning the novel. It was just back and forth a lot on a notepad. Filling in plot-holes, creating character arcs, looking at a wide overview and fixing any issues. Whilst trying to take the characters into the best, and most interesting, places.   No. But a fictional and extinct religion does exist in my book. It plays a super important part. And the rules that governed the religion (and therefore spirits) I had to set up before I could properly work out what happened in the book. Any time I made a step forward with the fictional religion was a huge break-through in the story.  But real religions, no. I wouldn't anything I wrote to be seen as an allegory or a message involving religion, that's not what I write about.   Thanks. That's the sort of thing I'm super relieved to hear. I had a huge moment of doubt a few weeks ago and lost *all* faith in not only the idea but my capabilities as a writer, and I nearly gave up writing for good. So it's great to hear that the idea (at least in it's basic form) isn't a terrible one.   Hey I do! Slowly. I've got a lot going on so progress on the book is super-slow . But I don't think, overall, it's going terribly. There's just a lot of distractions.   I've been wanting to write since I was 13. I finished my first novel...a year and a half ago? ( Ish :/ ). This book in particular was inspired by the worlds of Neil Gaiman, whose bibliography is built on worlds set in our own, but with something else inside of them that tends to remain secret. His books always feel like these worlds are bigger than they seem and we're only granted a small portion of it.   But then I had my own ideas and my own situations and I brought them altogether and hopefully something good will come out of it.   In short, malevolent spirits. It shows the lives of a young boy and girl and how they are affected by, and deal with, the spirits at different times in their lives.   I'm starting to get bored and want to talk to someone about anything. Instigate a conversation I don't mind about what, you choose.   Mate I've got a degree in film and media. That ain't gunna stop me being published.   You have to leave  'Cause if you don't, dear  You'll never see the things you read about in books  You saw the films and you were hooked  But everything you want won't come to you  You realize now that you've gotta go see this through   It was all alphabetical by author's last name, but I bought about 15 books since I set up my bookshelf so now...I need to redo it. And because there's a lot of new books to put in it would probably be easier to take them all down and start again. *sad face*.   Writing my second novel. My sister is (should be) reading and editing the first in the hopes to get it sent to some agencies. In the meanwhile, my new novel is coming along very slowly.   I need to JDATE again before i read TBIFOS I think. Which means I might buy paperback - because I own JDATE on Kindle, which is a sin. I can't own a physica copy of a sequel and not its predecessor.    I have this same problem, it's such a bitch. And it makes deciding what to read next super hard. I try and maintain a system but nope.   But you don't want anyone reading your first draft. You want to make a manuscript as polished as possible before anyone reads it. Just so your feedback isn't just warning you about issues you could already have edited out; that renders the feedback wholly useless. There's different stages, and editing without any external influence is one of them, and followed immediately by getting someone else to read it.    If you can convince someone to read your work and look at it the right way - an overall view rather than a view critical towards style, then you might be ok.       What I meant was it's all part of that saga. They're the three main middle-earth(/Beleriand) novels.   I ordered a book about three hours ago! =]  *The Cement Garden, by Ian Mcewan*. Coming from Waterstones, hopefully early next week.  I have a problem with buying books. I managed to get my backlog down to less than twenty, and now it's rocketed back up :(    It's really become an archetype now that we readers of high-fantasy (mostly) want long series. They prefer reading a longer book.  Publishers prefer series. They're more likely to gain momentum (and therefore money). It's a safe gamble that if a person likes the first book they will read the rest of the series. More money for publishers, more sales for authors.  Also the whole world-building thing everyone else mentioned.   Mostly, I think, because scale and epicness can't be measured in a single novel, or two. Harry Potter uses all 6 books to lead us to the intense finale. Who hasn't enjoyed seeing Westeros unfold tale-by-individual-tale?   And The Hobbit ;)   I'm sorry if that came off harsh, it wasn't meant to. :/ I just read what I put, sorry if it came off wrong. It was meant to be helpful, it sounds harsh.   This just shows that you're writing normally, and, as mentioned, you are taking it seriously. If you weren't questioning yourself, and thinking you were doing badly, you wouldn't be writing properly. That's how it is. You're like me, like a lot of writers. You like having written, but you don't like writing. Your friends sound like they enjoy writing but fuck 'em, everyone writes differently. Everyone writes different things and to get different things out of it. It doesn't matter. Stop talking to them. You're writing and if you're not writing by yourself then you fail at it by default. Writing is inherently lonely, and I'm not saying that to sound angsty, I'm saying it because I know the best way to get anything is done is to not get distracted by, or involve, anyone else.   No one expects your novel to be a grown up. It's a first draft, it is a baby. *Do not ever expect anything else*. You are not a good writer. You write for infants. And you **edit** your book into adulthood. First draft is gunna be crap. Second is only marginally better. I worked on my own novel for an entire year and went through more than ten drafts (I could have shot myself). Parts of it are unrecognizable from the original and that is such a good thing I can't even tell you.   Writing isn't easy, you just gotta sit down and do it, take breaks if you want, though I'm sure you feel they are anti-productive and therefore undesirable. So just write, push through it. If it feels like you're writing shit, that's fine. If it's slightly better - but still shit - that's even more fine. It's gunna be shit until you edit it into oblivion.   Seems like your friend needs to read more. Read more and see how it's done.   The ability to self-evaluate can't be understated. Eventually you're going to want people to read it over and evaluate you work for you. Getting an opinion other than your own is above essential. The thing is a lot of your flaws you might work out naturally. A lot of your writing flaws you might edit out - and that's what editing is for.   Like Stephen King said - "write with the door shut. Edit with the door open."   My advice is to continue working until your manuscript is as perfect as you think it can be. Any weaknesses you feel are in it, address them as best you can. If you don't, any feedback will be just to tell you to fix things you could already have fixed, rather than any issues you actually have in your writing.   Here's the thing, if we advise you to do one, and you try and write it, but aren't convinced you wanna write *that one*, you won't write it.  Write all three. Bring them all together. The last two could stand as a single-plot on their own. If you make the society perhaps dystopic it's not too hard to put in some time-travel there as well.  I'm not going to give you ideas, that's cheating. If you want to write professionally idea generation is a massive part of that. It's not just the genesis of the idea or conjuring up the opening paragraphs. It's coming up with the entire novel and it's a skill that comes with practice.  Of course, if you're not writing professionally ignore my advice. Almost all of my advice tends to be geared towards people who write seriously, rather than just as a hobby.    *The cement garden*? Interesting title. Fucked up, you say? *researches*   *Ian McEwan?!*  *Purchases*  Thanks, stranger =]   I have never seen Pacific Rim. *Sad face.* But I feel like all of these films are being held up to be something they're not. Sometimes I want my characters deep and well rounded, and their plot arcs to be beautifully intricate. Sometimes I wanna see a guy punching bad guys dressed up as a bat and growling.   Here's to hoping. Good luck with your audio/tech thing =]   A lot of people complained about Age of Ultron saying there wasn't enough characterisation, and their motivations were too thin and blah blah. I don't care about characters! I want to see demi-gods punch the living shit out of each other. Same with Jupiter Ascending (from what I saw), it just looked like a gorgeous film where a space-elf beats up people for a woman for who-cares-what-reason.   Yeah, my thing doesn't sound as bad as that. Not even by half. Kudos.   I heard different things about Jupiter Ascending. I don't think it even made it to cinema's in the UK. I'm sure it will appear out of the blue in the stores one day.   I've heard good things about iZombie but I already have so many shows to watch, I can't bear to start a new one.    Any movie recommendations? I'm staring at my dvd's blankly.   Camera-operator for a live shopping channel. I can do it all, but I'm not as confident on one of the camera's, and it's just a *lot* of running around. Which doesn't help when you can't shout and have to stay ridiculously quiet. I've been looking at it from the bright side;*" the new guy can run the entire floor by himself after he's been here for only a few weeks."*   I feel you, being ditched by co-workers. But I work for a live TV channel (it's not as exciting as it sounds). So I had to manage three cameras and a trainee and run the floor by myself. I'm meant to be with two other people but nope, abandoned.      If you could, and were part of a band, what would you name it?   Hey guys, like I said. Any tips or things to bear in mind, or practices just to get better that you think would benefit me. I've been playing for a while, and my friend has given me a bit of instruction, but I'm pretty new, so anything is appreciated. Thanks.   I'm trying to write my novel, and need help procrastinating. I know it sounds anti-helpful but it's not. It's super useful.  So, just start a conversation, talk about anything! =]         You know. I've read LOTR, though a few years ago. Since then I've read a lot of what could be considered 'contemporary fantasy', and even though I absolutely adored them. Tolkien truly was the master.   I used to hate the idea of work. Of getting up and doing the same thing every day of every month of every year without cease. I used to hate it when people said they were looking forward to the weekend because it seemed like such a waste of a life to spend 5 days waiting for the other 2. I had respect for the nine-to-fivers, I never knew how they did it.   I want to be a writer. But now I'm working my 9-5, mon-fri, and I'm one of those people who spend 5 days of the week waiting hopefully for the other two.   I'm actually quite nearly finished this. Overall it has been a very easy read. A decent book complimented by it's fairly short length. If it was any longer, I don't think I would enjoy it as much. It is compact, and that really works in its benefit. It isn't as heavy a book as I thought it would be, or maybe as the author intended it to be, but it has its moments. I've laughed, and some of the one-liners about humanity have hit me. I would recommend.   That is the question of my dinner tonight.  **Edit: I McDonald'ed**   What book, once you finished it, haunted you for weeks afterwards? Hit a chord so deep it never truly left?  Mine was "The Virgin Suicides" by Jeffrey Eugenides. I still think about that from time to time, it never left me.   We got in touch not that long ago, and we haven't seen much of each other. So it's really nice to get back in touch with an old friend I hadn't talked to in 6-7 years. But then he invited me to go rock climbing and, what the hell, I got out of a long term relationship not so long ago, I'm not doing anything with my life. So I'm getting to know him better and hopefully will meet some of the friends he's made. My ex got all our friends in the separation so it's definitely to get out and *meet some new people*.  Also, goddamn. My hands have been ripped to shreds, he had to buy some finger tape because it was so bad. I pretty much can't lift my arms, and I stumbled and had to crawl up the stairs. But I had such a good time.   Ever since I was quite young, about thirteen (possibly much younger), I've made a hot chocolate, snuggled up in bed and read my book. I'm in my mid-twenties now and I still do that whenever possible. That's my usual ritual.  What's yours?   Is really all it took to get over Writer's Block. To find that when I am finally called away that I've written a lot, and I don't want to stop, and I can carry on now for hours. Simple as.  Just something to bear in mind the next time you sit down, but maybe don't want to write just right this moment.   I've got about twenty books to read. And I'm doing the 52 books a year challenge, so I've got to pace my reading.  I've bought video games I haven't played, and some I've barely played.  I've got a novel to write.  I've also got to write part of a script for a video game I'm working on that was due a few weeks ago.  And shows I'd like to watch on Netflix (which don't take precedence but still)  And on top of this I work a steady 9-5.  Any ideas/suggestions for how to slug through all of that? How do you manage to be productive?   My dreams are fire.  That fire is the clarity of my  being, to show me more  than I could ever have been.     I dream, oh how I have.      And the rage, and the passion, and the  Heat, and tongues of that fire  Had licked my conscious desire;  And I knew that in that one, tiny  Infinitesimal, minute moment  I could be more than this.  And yet.  And yet.  Oh, but still  That it were possible to be all   My dreams  Have foreseen.  And not this,   Hollow  Impassioned  Being  Of caged-fire  And dewy eyed   Desire    [Feedback 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/334cum/athena/)  [Feedback 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/335bib/sun/)   Sure, I get up and I drive to work. And I pay a decent portion of my wages to keep my car going, and towards tax and rent.  But when I was a child I never ate ice-cream on my double bed, watching Netflix on my 50" TV. Being an adult...it really ain't that bad.   I'm just curious to hear your stories. How old were you? Did anything bring it on. Just though you'd give it a try? Or were you just touched by God spontaneously and thought 'I will write now'?   Or, generally, in your possession. The book you liked least and hated most.  Mine is probably *Under The Skin, by Michael Faber*. Did not like that book.      I'm tucked up in bed with my new book (The Buried Giant), and don't plan on moving, except for Sunday Lunch - and then it's straight back to my bed and book.  Anyone else got a similar day planned?   So apparently this guy is quite famous, I guess I was too young to remember him. So far though this book is amazing. Will be picking up *'Never Let Me Go'* very soon.   So. We are meeting again,  You. You who still haunt my  Every waking hour  To you I am to blame  For this shell I call home.  For whom I blame for this neglect, destitution.  I am a man.  I am a boy.  I am a human.  I am everything you  Should have known  You would leave me as.  You who are so bitter  So spiteful, you who would  Break skin for the malevolence,  For the colour; blood.  And unto me you left this  Learners scar,   So you could be a poet.  I am a poet,  You are a fool.  You are a child, you are  The neglectful little malignance  That is the abode of my every whim,  You are the little malicious   Greed that left me to thirst  As you fed this fire.  This pen wouldnt fit so   Perfectly  In my teeth if you hadnt  Shown me how to hold it.  You are not a man  You are not a boy  You do not consider yourself human,   You are an object,  Arent you?  To which your derision is   Well with no bottom.  They always seemed justified to treat you   differently.  And you are the bitter   Little worm,  As I am the bitter   Little snake.  As you were so drowned in your self-pity.  I am still wet from your   Macabre, oh-so philosophical   Insights.  Shallow as a piss puddle  If you must.  The puppet on the strings  As you were,  But I see that not.  God I hate you,  I hate  I do not hate those scars  On your arm,  Not so much as  Your fathers disappointment,  But a lesson you taught  Yourself  Well.  How alive we are.  Just you and me.  I am the form you wish you had,  But having said that  There will be more poems  To come.  *  [Feedback 1](http://oc.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/332ql2/a_saturday_coming_down/)  [Feedback 2](http://oc.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/331tsj/ill_be_good/)              Never really listened to any podcasts, but looking to get into some. Maybe just one that I can listen through if it's a decent one. I'm looking for some about literature or writing (in that vein), and am taking recommendations.  Note: I know nothing about podcasts.    It was a pleasure to read a book that felt like a throwback to the days of geniune dystopians: 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit-451. There was a moment when the government seemed infallible. Like being made pretty made sense, but was also humanely wrong; like the wars in 1984, the brainwashing in Brave New World. They were even setting it up like that.   But then no, revolution it is. Same old contemporary YA bs.   Too much to ask for a dystopian like the old classics? Come on, I'm sick of the underdog, one person throwing over an entire government? Sick of it now.   Is that I there is not enough time in a single life to read every book I will inevitably want to read. That I will die unsatisfied, knowing there was a myriad of books I had never gotten to read.   Until then; **READ READ READ**      *(Probably spoilers ahead).*  Well, the entire trilogy. I don't see a lot of people talking about it and thought I would very much enjoy to meet people who liked it as much as me.  So, what are your thoughts on The His Dark Materials Trilogy?   Just an adventure story about a group of kids doing something unbelievable and awesome. COME ON!   Please don't hate me! Just the text get's hidden by that griever on the background, and I can't read a fair portion of text on my screen. It just blends into it. Please change it? =[  But also please don't hate me. *cowers*   How the majority of YA books have to have some reference to 'The Hunger Games'. Fuck off Hunger Games, those books were terrible. What was a fantastic YA trilogy? The Maze Runner. Let me just go over to my copy: *"A must for fans of the Hunger Games"*. The Hunger Games wishes it could be half as good as The Maze Runner. Westerfelds *Uglies*: *Before the Hunger Games there was...*. Because even a book published before THG still has to live up to it.   So it's not so much the books as the covers. I just dislike that a book can't stand on it's own merits, it has to be likened to something else which is, in this case, **vastly inferior**.  (Yeah, ok, I really, **really** hated the last Hunger Games novel.)  But it's true with any trend. Any book that becomes popular others have to try and steal that glory. I just want good books to stand on their own merits and not have to attempt to steal the fame of others. It's cheap.   I'm sure there are more examples but I can't think of 'em right now.  tl;dr: when book covers reference whichever series is the most famous right now. I hate it.     Heard different things about this book. I gather from the reviews that it's like Marmite: you love it or hate it. There is no middle ground.      I loved the Virgin Suicides but haven't heard much about Middlesex, looking to get some insider knowledge on whether it's worth reading, or best to avoid.   It's a difficult thing spending four years on a novel and then, at the end of it, stepping back and realising it's probably, most likely, kinda, just a bit shit.   It is my first novel, and I've spent about a year editing it, but no one else has actually read it, which I know is a huge flaw. But is it worth attempting to publish it if I feel this way. Traditionally publish I mean - sending it out to agencies to seek representation. Worth it just in case? Or not all, shove it in a drawer and forget about it?  I'm not scared of rejection, not at all. That isn't the case. If I decide to at least try, then rejections will just be a part of that, I accept that. It's more about how I feel towards the novel.   Why do you think Neil Gaiman's books are so popular?  His writing style? Content? Imagination? Worlds? What made him so astronomically popular, in your opinion?  And I do just mean his writing, not so much his Twitter or Sandman series. I just mean his novels and short story collections.     Who doesn't love them some classical utopic-dystopia?   "With just a handful of men,  we'll start all over agai-"  *Damn it. Everytime!*   So I'm planning on starting a let's play soon. I can record output from consoles, and record film. What I can't do however is sync up video from a DSLR to video-game footage. Any hints about how to go about doing this?  Note: Recording from consoles, anything used to record from computer can't be used. I have software to record from console, but no way to use an external camera with it.  I don't want to use my webcam, because I have a HD DSLR I would rather use.   I've always shunned books on how to write. My thoughts on this have always been: "A book can't teach me how to write. The only way to get better at writing is by writing. And all the time I've spent reading, I could have spent actually writing."  But I'm starting to think otherwise. Is it ever worth reading a book teaching you how to write? If so, recommend some. I'm really considering it.     [The Old Gods](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16OmmuY5uaQ-rlTq_HWMgLnbbooRE2UAnimgmCujKTD0 authuser=0)  New novel-in-progress. Looking for overall feedback, but also feedback on the style, and the consistency of the style, especially towards the end.  Thanks!  :)   Honestly the damage isn't much greater than my cleaver, but it's a lot slower to swing. It is new, so is it something I have to stick with? or...    Blood-Starved Beast (I was told not to put the name of the bosses in thread titles which sounds fair enough)  I found this guy much easier than Father Gascoigne. Don't know why. Only took me 4 goes, Gascoigne took me a day and a half.   BUT  I was then so busy celebrating my character died of poisoning :(   http://gfycat.com/MistyDeterminedAvians  I much prefer the fights like this one. Much more evenly matched. Beautiful pace.  And I know it kinda looks bad, but I did beat him.   http://gfycat.com/MistyDeterminedAvians  I much prefer the fights like this one. Much more evenly matched. Beautiful pace.   But seriously I hate those things.   I spent two months planning out my entire second novel. And now I'm writing it, about 5k words in, so not a considerable amount, I'm wondering how good the idea is, or perhaps I just don't have faith in my abilities to execute it. How do you have faith in an idea? Or in yourself? I don't want to waste all this time on an idea that *I'm* not even sure is too good, never mind someone else.   Finally defeated Father Gascoigne. Even though he slaughtered countless times (I spent all day on it yesterday) that was still *such* a good fight. So few games get me feeling so tense, sitting up nose to the screen, got his beast form to a slim amount of health, and so *close*. Got him in the end. First time I tried today. Obviously just needed a break.  Now - back to shitting myself exploring previous unexplored territory.    Always throws me off - stupid question, I know. Do you always start speech with a capital letter, even if the speech occurs mid-sentence? For example: *'Whatever you're afraid of,' she said, 'nothing will hurt you.'*  That second half, "nothing will hurt you". Capital or no capital?   So I read somewhere Kirkhammer was awesome. I don't mind wasting the 3k souls. But, it really doesn't seem that great. Sword is too weak, and hammer is too slow. Did I make a bad investment or should I give it a chance?   I have 3k souls that I am super hopeful I can get back to Hunter's Dream. Hopeful, I know. I can either level up (to 20. The gun is more expensive than level) or purchase the pistol. I have the blunderbuss and it would be nice to have a pistol for 1v1, and a blunderbuss for crowd control. Thoughts?   Am I right in thinking the Hunter Garb is better than the Yarnham Hunter Garb? That's what I'm going with. Advise me :(   And you howl wildly and beat your chest with your fist like you've just speared a woolly mammoth single-handedly.  Oh...just me?   Just fighting against him is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever experienced. One of the most frantic and equal and beautifully-paced fights I have ever come across. He may have kicked my ass twice now, but I am actually really ok to die against him. It means I get to go back and do it all over again.  That, Ladies   Gentlemen, is why this game is so, so amazing.   My intention is to write a blog post - or, more likely, a series of blog posts - focusing on writer's block. Breaking it down, understanding what causes it, and, ultimately, how to solve it - in as much as that is possible. I can only rely on my own closed opinion of writer's block to formulate theories, and that won't do. So I'm looking to crowd source opinions and get as much information from as many people as possible. In general, just tell me about your experiences, but I also want to know what you think it is, how you suffer from it, how often, how it affects your work, and what you do to get over it?   So, I assumed that I would get one level per insight. I got insight when I was defeated by the cleric boss, and got two Madman Insight's from the Sewers. My insight level is at 3, does it go down? Am I missing something? It seems like I only need one insight and could infinitely level up from it (providing Blood Echoes)           	112

I haven't seen anyone HATE on it, of course like any war movie it will cause some controversy (remember when The Hurt Locker came out?). But I really don't really care about the controversy, because I always remember this: It's just a movie!!!!

Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader_%282008_film%29  I think this is an incredible film with powerful and convincing performances from all three leads, this film is certainly not for everyone and it raised quite the controversy when it was released but nonetheless critics and people I know really liked this film. So yeah I just wanted to know what people thought of it, please leave your thoughts and opinion(s) in the comments. :)   Yeah that wasn't bad either.   "The chainsaw rises" is actually a fucking awesome title. No shit.   Am I the only one that thinks the 2004 remake was actaully pretty decent? (Please don't down vote, it's just an opinion).      Just wish this post was a little bigger so we get could more interpretations and opinions but thanks anyway!    The quote in my opinion may be referring to Riggan Thomson, take it with whatever weight you want but I think it does.   At the beginning of the film where the drums play away the letters and start to reveal the title of the film it pauses briefly and across the screen you can see the word 'Amor'. Amor, as it turns out, is the ancient Roman God of love (aka Cupid) Amor is also Latin for 'Love'. I did more research and as it turns out Amor is winged and is often depicted as being blind or blindfolded. Now you must also consider the name of the play that the plot (sort of) revolves around. And know a quote from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream:  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste; Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste. And therefore is love said to be a child Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.  IMHO this quote is referring to Riggan Thomson (or is it the other way round?) The director and writer, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, is not directly linking Riggan to Amor (or Cupid) but simply a homage or tip of the hat. As the title of this post suggests I may be onto something here and if I am then I am no where near fully understanding this reference. I thought I might share this with you guys and perhaps discuss even further. :)   In the beginning of the film where the drums reveal the title, it says "amor" very briefly. Amor is latin for 'love', and also Amor is the ancient roman god of love. so you might be onto something.   That rape scene was gratuitous or was is supposed to be?    If you are genuinely interested in his work, I **highly** recommend the documentary 'A Life in Pictures' it is one of my favorite documentaries and I guarantee you will respect this man a whole lot more after watching it.    Thanks for all the downvotes!   Hmmmm.....Black Swan...Mila Kunis...and Natalie Portman....I LIKED that movie.   It's one of those comment threads where the comments just keep getting funnier as you scroll down.   Very well said, you've made a solid point.   Roger Ebert gave it 4/4 stars. What's up with that?   Zac's character in the film represents reality.   Hahahaha, honest to god.      Here you are! Well..not exactly. I suggest you look through these until you find the one you are looking for, hope this helped! http://screenmusings.org/movie/blu-ray/The-Cell/   We should just clear this up: They shouldn't have remade the movie in the first place.   I loved the Neo-Noir element to the nightclub scene, or to the whole movie itself. I hope they keep that up in the sequel.   PG-13? Pffft   Or not.   hahaha this actually made me crack up :D (not being sarcastic)   Why did some people not like Watchmen? I really liked it. (please don't down-vote me guys, it's just an opinion :))   happy?   It must get pretty hot under that helmet.   Sicario may have a chance...   How does he notice the things he notices in film. How indeed.   D:   *Nightcrawler   Into the Wild. I want to do what he does.   We'll see   This film will be epic. Lubezki will be at the top of his game, as will Irritu.   Do you have any idea who it's directed by?   Tom Hardy stealing the movie?? Did you even look at Leo in that photo?   Sneaky Little Fucker ain't he.   I have read the book, and my Stephen King collection is quite expansive. All I was saying is that I learned that he was nominated for a Razzie, I didn't know that before, but know I do.      Now that would just be GIVING it away.   Maybe his new film 'The Visit' is good. But then again, maybe not.   Everybody in the German army has heard of **Hugo Stiglitz**    This album reflects humanity. The good. The bad. And the ambiguity of it. Most of this album is actually a continuous song. Most of it. The songs within this album evoke mostly dark emotions, but they are very relaxing. The lyrics of these songs deal with some very heavy themes. Mostly, like I said, to do with humanity; society. But the themes and ideas displayed in this album is familiar territory for this band. They are certainly not for everyone, they are for me and hopefully for you, too.  [Masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW5iwy69O1U)   Yes! But Oh Well, he was nominated for an academy award.   Anything Roger Deakins.   Just a question but does Micheal Corleone become worse in Part 2? I haven't seen it but I'm just asking.   No country for old men is not on the list. COME ON!   Christian Bale. He's been in two movies that start with 'American' and he's british!   I laughed so hard at that. Holy Shit.   Aaron Sorkin...That guy knows how to write a screenplay alright!   Hahaha yeah he does, maybe it's just the photoshop. I've seen him with it before though   Was the movie any good?   shiit. I'll edit it out.   Can some of you help me out with this post? It would be very very much appreciated! http://redd.it/2u1zle      Ah that one, I got ya.   [Karma Gained.](http://guides.gamepressure.com/fallout3brokensteel/gfx/word/239275203.jpg)   The 57' one?   That's exactly what I'm looking for, Thank you.   Yeah pretty much any movie that's really heavy going in its subject matter or that just deal with some real heavy and dense themes, just mention em' here. Thanks!   He had a serious drug and alcohol problem. They can make the film interesting with that alone. With much character building, good actors, a consistent tone and a solid script, they could pull it off.   What we do in the shadows was pretty good.   Nah dude. Zodiac, now that's the real "Wow".   It is so disappointing that I have to scroll past comments and see racism about a fucking movie.   yeah the bad guys could've been better   End of Watch was fantastic. Come on dude.   **AMEN**   **KEEP IT THAT WAY**   Then go back into hibernation until Infinity War parts 1   2?   As Borat would say: Very Nice!   he used a revolver...   I genuinely think they are very underrated? Why don't you like them?   Who's joking with what?   Yes   Jarhead   American Beauty   That's because of his character, same reason why his character in Nightcrawler hardly blinks.   Jake Gyllenhaal hardly blinks in Nightcrawler (2014)   Oh Hi Mark!   Watch Foxcatcher.   Explain Foxcatcher?   Haha Lol you're getting down-voted. That's almost as funny as Channing Tatum in Jump street. Also, if he has '"flubbed" every role, explain Foxcatcher?   What   Yes of course. It's ultimately a character study.   It's a slow, tension-building film. Everyone needs to know that before going into this film.   Ahhh   I have no doubt about it   Whats happening...how can you read the script?   Someone watched an Honest Trailer.   Not yet! But I have ordered the bluray of it. Something tells me it will top John Wick.   A revenge tale starring Leonardo DiCaprio directed by Irritu with cinematography by Lubezki and co-starring Tom Hardy?    JUST TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE ME THOSE DAMN TICKETS!!   Nic Cage is playing an 'ordinary guy'? What is this?   Best action scene of 2014, hands down.   Doesn't work for me GODDAMMIT   Was just going to say that.   Dude have you seen True Detective?   The desolation of Smaug, the ending was so bad it even ruined the start of BOTFA for me.   This is shaping up to be my most anticipated movie of the next 5 years.   They won't put that in.   The title to this made me lose my shit.   Why did Nick choose to stay with Amy? I am completely stumped on this, can someone please help.   Bland? That's his character, read the fucking book.   Come on people where is Prisoners!   Always good to see a fellow Fincher lover. If you haven't seen Zodiac, I couldn't recommend it high enough.   Can't go wrong with Zodiac!   I got it from Sanity, in Australia.      As a fellow Aussie, did you get those at JB?   Ah.   Can't go wrong with Zodiac!      Anyone who is complex, has depth and is perhaps a bit of an anti-hero, please mention them here.   The book that is seen on his bedside table, can someone tell me what it is if they saw the title or just happen to know the book?   What makes a movie very well directed, what makes a director good or bad?   Please mention any movies that have really underrated cinematography and why you recommend them, thanks!   A dishonored sequel is definitely in the works or it has already been made. Just wondering what is everyone's thoughts and opinions, also what do and don't you want in this sequel?   Please submit your top 10 favorite movies here, I would like to see what I'm missing out on. Here's mine, no order (because it's impossible):  American Beauty, No Country For Old Men, Jarhead, Drive, Pulp Fiction, Seven, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, The Dark Knight, Zodiac, Spirited Away,         	137
 "There are two paths before us: Where the corporations dominate or where the public says enough. I ask for your help so that the nation takes the second path,"  a russ feingold quote, not that anyone will see this as i am 10 hrs late.      GARY FUCKING ANDERSON!  I remember being a little kid and this game seriously wrenching my soul out.  Then to again have my dreams pushed to the brink of reality a decade later and again, now as an adult, having my body shut down from the disappointment that is, the Minnesota Vikings.    Hey everyone.  I currently live and teach in South Korea and the community I live in is kicking off a fund raiser for some schools in Siem Reap, Cambodia.  I first visited Cambodia last summer and walked away awestruck and inspired.  The people of this country have many reasons to be depressed and downtrodden, yet they are not.  A mere 40 years ago Pol Pot's reign of terror and genocide tried to destroy this great country.  So many people are still so affected by this, and yet these people are amazing.  So loving, so friendly, and so much desire to better their country!  Well the fundraiser my community in SK and I are doing is simply a spare change fundraiser in which we handed out Piggy Banks to all interested people, and then told them to bring them back to us on December 16th and also decorate them in an original manner, and we would give prizes away for the best original pigs!  I was wondering if the great people of Reddit would be interested in getting in on this?  Obviously you can't send a Piggy Bank full of change, but people could keep the change in a Piggy Bank, decorate and send pictures?  Or simply just keep some change for a while and donate it.  Figured maybe Reddit wanted to do a little good for some great children and people in an amazing country!  Here are a few websites that talk about the projects I am involved with and also how to help, or how to donate.  Thanks for hearing me out.  If this pig thing is stupid for a real broad internet community, I understand, just was curious if it would work on a wide scale basis.  Cheers!  http://cambodiaeducationfund.tumblr.com/  http://www.abc-rice.com/  http://www.soidngo.org/   Where you are from is a major part of what shapes you as person.  I like America man, and I am proud of that.  I am not necessarily proud of some of the decisions our country has made and especially not proud of our healthcare system in particular.  But I know a lot of great people who would bend over backwards for just about anyone.  These aren't the people that everyone hears about, so it is a shame that the gun-toting obnoxious assholes are all people ever do hear about.  I am proud of the people around me that I saw (don't currently live in America -ironic for me to be defending it and then not living there, I know) who are great people and hardworking and are trying to help our country change for the better. I.E. protests around wall street.    Oh I am not proud of the American Government, heck I am not proud of many of my countrymen/women.  But I am still proud to be American as most Australians are proud to be Australian or Brit is proud to be British.  Its my identity and I wouldn't want to change my roots, I want to be proud of them.    Defending your country is simply being proud of what you are.  Sure, its great to make fun of what you are and where you are from, that is funny.  But when SOMEONE ELSE pokes fun or insults where you are from, it essentially is them poking fun or insulting you.  I am American, and I make fun of some of our ineptitude, but when another insults it I will stand firm and  try and defend it,  I don't think that makes me "butthurt"  I think that makes me someone who is proud of who I am and where I am from. Edit: spelling   it's flannel mother fucker   Getting dongchim'd by a student is one of the most infuriating, awkward, hilarious encounters around.     A couple disappointed Daves....   Has anyone tried this powerful treat?      Yeah this made me laugh really really hard..."pooped a mudslide" might be one of the funnier things I have read.   Oh I totally agree it was very buggy.  But it had such highlights and fun playing time that, to me at least, made up for some really brutal bugs.   That was the name of the company.  It was an MS DOS game.        Am I the only one that things he looks a whole lot like Frylock from AquaTeen?   Like if cursed by some Master Shake shenanigans?    That is real awesome.

 I would think the opposite as soft boiled are generally 'softer', also main concern was the egg white not being strong enough and just breaking when you press.    No offense but I'm sure the people who are working on this are a tad bit more knowledgeable than you.  Yeah, obviously there are hurtles, if there weren't any it would be imminent and not 10 years down the road (projected). You people always pop up, "well... established knowledge dictates that this is impossible, therefore any advancement is not possible." Or maybe you're not one of those.    So you don't know?   Stupid tax. I can understand an old trusting grandma falling for this but like, how do you get suckered into buying something from some random person who pulled up next to you and who wont let you even view the product? I'm a pretty trusting person but errp   Do you know if this works with soft boiled?   I'll just stick to strutin'.   I really don't enjoy riding a bike in Houston. It's fine in neighborhoods and less busy side streets but I just feel extremely vulnerable on a bike with cars (driven by Houstonians) approaching from my blind spot (see: I don't have eyes in the back of my head). I walk anywhere 2 miles or less (walking is under valued in today's society) and taxi anything between 2 and 5 miles, which covers most of my territory.    Do those bigger buses have wifi? That's one thing I wish the normal buses had. Netflix just eats at my data cap too quick when I'm not on wifi.    I fucking love the light rail. Instead of driving to work, I started commuting via bus and rail. Takes a bit longer (30 mins in morning up from 15-20, 45 in the afternoon up from 30) but god damn are my stress levels way way down. I don't call grandma a cunt for driving too slow or get stressed out when I miss a light. It seriously has improved my life in many ways. I'd recommend it for anyone who can, and hope that with the current surge of centralized population growth, the demand and need will be in place for valuable expansion.  Having a car is nice, not relying on a car is much nicer.    I can't forgive you.   Was talking about the first player mentioned, Reggie Bush - played for USC. It's the white and red #5 jersey on the left.    I'm worried about how little ass I'll have after seeing him in 5 days.    I'll be seeing him at Coachella this weekend! Can't fucking wait.        People who like college sports? I dunno.   Maybe in college, which the jersey is from.   No they don't. I get them on average within 10-15 minutes on the weekends. Have never waited an hour. Montrose/Heights/Midtown area.   The difference between Mario Williams and Clowney, is that Mario Williams didn't have the best defensive lineman in the league taking pressure off of him in his first season.   It's pretty irrelevant man. They're the 16th best team in a 16 team playoff.   "Huge playoff push" - yeah, for the 8th seed in the East. They're one and done in the playoffs. That's pretty irrelevant.   Well this was an imgur album which didn't have your blog accompanying it. Just going through the pictures in the album, all you get is the burger name and the episode it's from.   Funny. The two highest payrolls in the NBA this season are irrelevant teams in the worst of the two confrences. 4th highest payroll has the 6th worst record in the league.   http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Vickies-Kettle-Cooked-1-375-Ounce/dp/B000R7RN0G   FYI the cabs have about an hour+ wait on weekends.  No they don't.   Where in your source does it say that Chick Fil A tried to have all the gays in Uganda executed?    It was actually a law passed before the rise of childhood obesity in America. And it really has nothing to do with Kinder eggs, it was a law designed to ban the use of non-food stuffs inside of food products, pretty sure less to do with choking hazard and more to do with contamination.   So in the last picture with the tacos, it looks like you have uncooked sausage or hamburger in there? What is that?   hello?   How would they get across the Atlantic? Their combined naval force is dwarfed by the US' and their combined air force even more so.   Two dozen other countries that still are dwarfed by the military capabilities of the United States. Good luck getting across the Atlantic with the rest of NATO's airforce and navy.   Pretty fucking ignorant about the fact yeah.    Salters gonna salt.   I think eventually Light Rail will replace the HOV lane with an actual HOV.   Gotta walk before you can walk faster.   Salty   At CC..? With a scholarship..?   Hope our impending series is as entertaining as the last time we met in the playoffs!   I know you know I was just letting everyone else know. Ya know?   Your analogy might be good if these companies didn't actually pay fines. But let's make up our own reddit-reality and live there instead.    It's unrealistic. Human error alone makes it unrealistic. Add in environmental elements and yeah. You're being unreasonable and frankly pretty ignorant. But enjoy driving to work today. You're definitely not part of the "problem" you see.    Reddit: oh another thing for us to sound fucking retarded over?   So many disillusioned and uninformed people in this thread. Wow, 1,600 gallons...that's like an Olympic sized swimming pool! No...one of those has 660,000 gallons of water.    You're unintelligent.    Or 1/5 of an oil tanker used to fill up gas stations.    It's not even big.

In my shoddy attempt at defense, I was drunk last night when I made that comment.  What my mother hears: "Spouting racist rhetoric while inviting murder"  :D   My mum was convinced I *would* get raped *just because I moved to NYC*. Not for going out and partying every night, but for living in a city.  While I agree that is valid for a parent to worry about their child's safety, I think it's outlandish to be convinced that you would get raped just because you moved to NYC. That's pretty outlandish, no? Just as a numbers game, the rate of rape per 100,000 people in NYC is 14, while the rate of rape per 100,000 in the US as a whole is almost twice that at 26.9. As far as cities go, NYC is one of the (if not the?) safest, at least in the US. So while it might be *less safe* than where you originate (I'm picturing the town from Hot Fuzz), it's not like you're living in Cairo or Mumbai. If that were the case, I don't think it would be quite so outlandish.  So yeah, we agree, moms worry, it's not wrong for them to worry, I just think the comment I quoted was outlandish.  People worry about a lot of outlandish things, it doesn't mean they're wrong, it just means they worry about unlikely scenarios which they have no control over.    You too pal, you too.   If you can't afford a new phone, don't be an irresponsible drunk and lose it.  Good point! Wow, such generalized insight!  That's pretty much the whole point of a bar. Though it is possible to go to one *and not get smashed*, *the odds of that are pretty slim*.   Smells like you have an alcohol problem.   I don't think you know what "irresponsible"  I think it's irresponsible for you to assume that someone with a fairly obvious grasp of the English language doesn't know what a basic word like irresponsible means.

 He should let Benghazi die like Obama let the American ambassador die   Fair enough.   DRTY Russian   Typical liberal comment: criticize the messenger but never get around to dispute the article with facts.  FAIL     Let's stop the misdirection and answer with a straight up yes or no:  Do you support laws and procedures that allow any eligible voter to vote while ALSO preventing ineligible voters from voting?     Do you have any proof that these pics are of Tea Party rallies? I have a pic below that was taken at an occupy rally. Racist?  http://i.imgur.com/Rq8tHLZ.jpg   Unfortunately, until our election process changes, you can't have both.  Why is that?  Unless you accept and support allowing only eligible voters to vote then you do not care about fair elections and only seek an advantage for the Left. At least be honest that you are only for laws that help get Democrats elected.    The Tea Party is not racist whatsoever.    You are evading and have proven my point that the Left is not interested in fair elections.    All I want is only eligible people voting. No one is turned away who is eligible and no one is allowed who is not eligible. We must have both elements.   Let's see if you are serious about fair elections. Do you support a law that both ensures EVERY eligible voter can vote and that prevents EVERY ineligible voter from voting?   Allowing votes from the disqualified, multiple votes from the same person, and fraudulent voting are just as bad a problem.   We need to ensure that ALL qualified people can vote and ALL fraudulent voting is stopped.  Do you agree?

Typical Liberal: cry, scream, insult, but never, ever, debate with facts.    Don't blame me because you don't understand politics or the parties involved. Go on insulting me if that is what you depend on rather than factual knowledge.   It amazes me how nasty Liberals get when anyone states anything you don't agree with.    This is a great course to learn how to shoot rifles. http://appleseedinfo.org/   http://i.imgur.com/kSj8SMs.jpg?1   The debate is over. I won. You lost. It's that simple. Accept your defeat and move on....   People who resort to insults in any debate or discussion do so because they lack any facts. Thank you for proving me right.   Victory is sweet   Sorry but you are confused. Anti Tea party and anti Fox News? Yup, you are a Democrat   The Tea Party supports three policies: 1. lower taxes, 2. smaller government, 3. less government regulation.  How are any of these policies extreme or far right?   You called the Tea Party extremist. You are either a Leftist or you are politically naive.    Interesting how the Left can never even have a simply political discussion without getting angry. It seems as if the Left is more of a religious movement than a political one. Any dissent will not be tolerated and will be met with anger.      the Tea Party, but they're extremist,  You are losing credibility fast my friend.    It is only anti Left. It is not a hate site. I bet you think the Tea Party is a hate group also...   What is progressivism progressing to? What is their endgame? Progressivism is certainly  not some general desire to improve the country and society. Progressivism  is the endless march towards strict Leftist ideology. Ultimately progressivism will end gun ownership by private citizens.    I was commenting on the endless need of government to constantly  govern. When guns, knives, glass are outlawed the government  will attempt to outlaw cricket bats and golf clubs   When the knives are gone then we can focus on confiscating glass bottles.   It is no more a cesspool than what is seen on Reddit comments. I find it truly fascinating at the worldview and grasp of reality of the Left and the Right. It is as if both sides are living in parallel universes and experiencing different realities. What that means is that one entire half of the US is either dumb, delusional, or in a cult like trance.   It is scary that aside from politics, the very fabric of reality is disputed by the two sides.      Moonbattery.com is anti LIBERAL/PROGRESSIVE. It is not in any way racist, anti gay, anti education, hateful, disgusting, anti poor etc. Simply being against the Left does not equate to being racist and hateful.

People, history, facts, logic, actual effects are irrelevant.    The box she checked stated that mere subjective belief that one was native American was not enough.

DemocRAT Party   Amactu of the red star Dextopron 4 (Hydzxcotic Galaxy) discovered Earth (and the Americas) 3000 Light years ago (3rd lunar cycle)   Give up? I win by default. I guess you don't know anything about socialism.  All anyone needs to know about socialism is that every time it has been tried in history (Soviets, Chinese, Nazis, Fascists, Khmer Rouge, Cuba etc) it has always resulted in genocide and oppression.)  Too bad you want to just stay smug and ignorant of the facts    Considering the intelligence needed for you to make your comment, I believe you actually may be a walrus   I hold out hope that our cocoa fracking efforts pay off soon    You have no clue what socialism is  A socialist is a political and economic movement that favors  public control over the means of production and a planned economy.   Am I wrong?  Well?  Crickets....   Nice job (I mean it) but you are confusing the terms Conservative (capital C) and conservative (lower case C). The two are not the same.  This is also true with Liberals as opposed to liberals  The Tea Party are Conservatives who are interested in being conservative regarding giving power to the government. That does not mean they are conservative in all things social or science.  A Liberal is a Leftist. That is different from a small L liberal who is a person who favors government ensuring the rights of all. JFK was a liberal. Obama is a Liberal        I'm a left-leaning moderate who favors socialistic systems over capitalistic.  Haven't we had enough socialist solutions? Didn't we learn anything from the Soviets? the Maoists? the Khmer Rouge? The Nazis? The Fascists? The Cubans? Those socialist solutions have resulted in the deaths of over 100 million people during the past century.   You really idolize those murderous regimes?    No one has said that modern conservative parties make a platform on racism  I googled "Republicans are racist" and it returned "About 6,940,000 results"    The Republican party typically mimics Christian ideologies on social matters  No one has brought social matters into this discussion.   Fuck science. Fuck fucts, fuck logic! 'Murica!  You simply can't have a civil discussion can you?   How am I anti science? How am I fucking facts or logic? Why the insults?  It's true, America is divided because the Right thinks Liberals are wrong but the Liberals think the Right is evil.         Please explain why there is no dissent within the Left? What policies of the Democrats do you oppose?   You have failed to refute my points. Nice interpretation of American Values. Lol  Why would the Republicans embrace ANY policy that would:  1. Attract a tiny minority of voters (Voters for whom racism is at the very top of their requirements in a candidate)  2. Anger and offend the vast majority of the voting public?  It makes no logical sense to do so. Can you imagine a party adopting a policy of "We are the party of pedophiles"?  The Left has lied about Republicans and their alleged embrace of racism.  Without lies the Left has nothing   I have debated you and you seem more interested in being snarky than debate. Typical liberal avoidance    Maybe you should read the thread first? If you don't understand then ask an adult    Good article. Everyone should read it just to familiarize themselves with the claims on both sides (minus the snarkiness). Then they should think critically and decide on their own what to believe.    Political parties do evolve over time.   What my point is is that Liberals like to view American politics as The Republican Party was "good" when Lincoln was president and the Democrats were less so. At some magical moment, the two parties switched and the Democrats became "good" and the Republicans decided to become evil and embrace racism.  Unfortunately the facts don't prove that wishful thinking.  Both parties have evolved over time. Both parties have embraced bigger government to various extents. Both have evolved in how they view the role of government.  There has never been a magical shift of the parties in terms of "good" and "bad" nor has there been a shift in the parties' overtly racist policies.  The Democrat Party refuted racism in the 60's and 70's. The Republicans never embraced racism as a policy.   Got it? Any more smug snarky retorts?   Atwater said that the GOP offered the Southern Democrats a choice based on the GOP's position on traditional values. He expressly stated that the GOP did NOT have to attract the disaffected Democrats with appeals to racism.  There was no ideological shift.    That is not a "shift" in terms of the GOP embracing racism as the Democrats had done for 150 years prior.  The GOP never embraced racism. The Democrats simply stopped supporting overt racism in the 60's and 70's     Wrong. I have read all of the links provided and commented on them. Several have been good in explaining various flows of each parties' evolving policies and positions.  What those links have failed to do is show a shift of racist policies from the Democrats to the GOP. The Democrats have historically been a party that embraced overt racism for over 150 years. It was only in the 60's and the 70's when the Democrats refuted overt racism.   Simply because the Democrats refuted overt racism in the 60's and 70's does not mean that the GOP embraced racism as a political strategy.     Provide facts. Your opinion and insults offer nothing   Thank you for the links. The Live Science was interesting as it explains a bit about how at the turn of the 20th century and into the FDR administration, both parties embraced bigger government. Certainly the rise of revolutionary Communism after WWI further motivated governments fearful of revolution, to expand government programs.   The article does not explain a switching of racist attitudes (or the switching of party platforms) from the Democrats to the GOP as has been claimed in the comments of the post.   Thank you also for the Hufpo article. It was informative and a good read.  That article showed how both parties evolved politically to match society's evolution regarding social issues during the turn of the 20th century. The article did a good job until it made a jump to the 60's and tried to connect the two periods as being a profound shift in which the Democrat Party refuted racism and the GOP embraced it. In that aspect the article failed.   Interestingly, this article supports the recent evolution of the GOP that once supported bigger government being influenced by the Tea Party to reduce the size of government. Political parties eventually evolve with the will of the voters.    You claimed there was a shift and you failed to provide proof. Unless you provide proof, your opinions are just that    Its pretty common knowledge.  Your link only discusses Barry Goldwater's struggle within his own party.   If your claim is true then there should be ample documentation of this so called switch. Please provide more than simply claim it's common knowledge                  Stop evading and provide evidence, proof, facts....   You can't refute my facts and you are calling me stupid?   I challenge YOU to refute my facts...  Well?  Crickets.........    Did you even read that wikipedia section? It states that there was a migration of Democrat voters to the GOP over several decades.   It does not say that there was a "shift" of  racist attitudes from the Democrats to the GOP.   It does not say that the GOP embraced racism in order to attract racist Southern voters.    Uneducated Liberals claim such a shift but no such shift ever happened. The Left uses that claim to try and disguise their disgusting history of oppressive racism.  If someone wishes to dispute this fact then please provide facts, dates, people involved etc who orchestrated this so called "switch"   The Southern Strategy is often misunderstood. It is based on an interview decades ago by Republican Lee Atwater.   In the interview, Atwater stated that the GOP could use economic issues to attract southern Democrat "Dixiecrat" voters who felt they were being abandoned by the Democrat Party's shift to the Left away from traditional American values.   The interview featured him stating that the GOP could use economic issues not just racist appeals of "nigger nigger". This quote is often edited and claimed to prove that the GOP had a formal strategy of adopting overt racism in order to capture the votes of racist southerners.  If one listens to the interview, they will see that the claim of an embrace of racism by the GOP is not what Attwater is saying.  Demographic studies have shown that there was not a sudden shift of Dixiecrat voter away from the Democrat Party to the GOP after the Civil Rights acts of the 60's. The migration of Democrats to the GOP in the south has been a gradual movement over 30 years. This migration was due to a belief that the Democrat Party was abandoning them by moving to the Left politically and rejecting American values. It was not due to racism.  http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php  The logical question remains: why would a major political party  adopt a policy of racism given that voters for which racism is an important political issue is minute and the the number of voters who would be offended by such a policy is huge?   In other words it is illogical for a political party intent on winning nation elections to embrace any position in which the benefits are tiny and the negatives are huge.   This is a common misconception. Can you provide any evidence of this switch?   http://i.imgur.com/vqbNcIP.jpg   "Snap your little pictures and write your silly reddit posts because frankly sonny, I don't give a shit"   Every single comment you have made regarding my comments has been an evasion just as I have described above. Thank you for proving my point   Liberals down-voting this proves they are simple ideologues with no ability to critically think about anything.     Actually no, but I am a bastard   I have already been diagnosed. You should get diagnosed also   Serious note: You just won't drop this.

Tonight, with that thought in my mind, I will slip into slumber with a smile on my face.     I will keep winning. Thank you   Awww rub a soothing ointment on the place that hurts most.    All I know is that I won. You lost. Have a nice day   We debated. I beat you fair and square. You tried your best. You used every bit of your intellect, education, and wisdom, yet you lost to a superior opponent who happened to be a Tea Party Conservative.  Now follow the Liberal game plan and down vote all of my Karma  BTW don't feel so bad, Liberals by their nature are merely clones who ramble off parroted Leftist views without requiring any original thought or critical thinking. Ever wonder why there is never any diversity of thought within the Left?    You got out thought today by a Tea Party Conservative.  Let that fact sink in....   I win by default. Just remember: Today a Tea Party Conservative out thought and out debated you. HaHa  PS I thought nerds were supposed to be smart? Haha  http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5026/5609957660_bfb9331026_z.jpg    Liberals always shoot the messenger and criticize the news outlet reporting a story but never seem to get around to actually disputing the content of those articles with facts   Refute the article with facts. Just because you dislike the message does not magically convert a national news source into a disreputable one.

HaHa    Racist /s   GAO Report: Obamacare Adds $6.2 Trillion to Long-Term Deficit  http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/341589/gao-report-obamacare-adds-62-trillion-long-term-deficit-andrew-stiles   Liberals always shoot the messenger and criticize the news outlet reporting a story but never seem to get around to actually disputing the content of those articles with facts    Liberals always shoot the messenger and criticize the new outlet reporting stories but never seem to get around to actually disputing the content of those articles with facts     Expansion of the federal government and resulting statutes involving the economy, environment, education, taxation, regulation, etc  The classical socialism model is built on maintaining the productive mechanisms of a capitalist society while weighing it down parasitically until the entire system collapses   The Leftist long march through our culture, government, education system, entertainment. The goal has been to destroy the American culture and replace it with Leftist ideology.      The Koch bros are rich and they use their money to support causes they favor.  They are no different than Billionaires on the Left who donate money to causes they favor.   Do you believe that Soro, Steyer, Gates etc have as much influence on the Left as the Kochs have on the Right?   When she applied for the teaching positions in Texas and at Harvard she was asked about Native American heritage. The question of Native American heritage often comes up in employment.   Because too many whites claim Indian heritage when they are really not Native American, the questionnaires she filled out qualified how that question could be answered.  The questionnaires stated that a subjective belief was not enough to claim Native American heritage. What was needed was acceptance or affiliation with a recognized Indian tribe.  She was not identified by any tribe as a member nor did she maintain any tribal affiliation yet she answered the employment question in the affirmative anyway. She lied  She also lied about her answer and tried to pull a cover up regarding the whole issue.  She lied and plagiarized several recipes in a book called "Powwow Chow"   Her husband, also not an Indian, penned a recipe for that book and he also falsely claimed to be of Indian heritage.   So you see, lying has been a regular aspect of her personality and of her lack of respect for rules     What a nice collection of Leftist fables you have collected.   A few notes:   The Koch bros are not the running the GOP and have NO influence over the Tea Party. They are free to support any policies they wish but that has no bearing on how the Right votes.  What is an "anti atheist law". I am a Conservative and an atheist and I have never herd that term before.  There is no political will in this country to ban or seriously curtail abortions. That is a dead issue that the Left brings up to demonize the GOP.  Reagan's war on drugs? Are you serious? Do you realize that Reagan was president 30 years ago?  Obama supported DOMA as did Hillary Clinton.   Public unions are parasites and Conservatives support any policy that limits or ends them.     But she did lie about her Indian heritage in order to take an affirmative action position away from a real minority.  That has absolutely NOT been debunked. It is a fact   Socialism has failed everywhere it has been tried. Socialism has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century.   It has never worked because inherent in socialism is the coercive and violent threat of government against anyone who resists their control.   Socialism is an ideology. It is not an ala carte menu. It is a mindset, a philosophy that the "haves" are evil and must be sacrificed to the "have nots". Socialism is about exerting control over the population by a cadre of self proclaimed elites.   I do not want any group of so called elites making decisions for me and bossing me around.    The libertarians like her.  Libertarians do not like big government socialists   proof?   Socialism is the step before communism. Socialism can operate parasitically in a Capitalistic system (to a certain extent) whereas Communism sweeps the old Capitalistic system aside.   That graph correlates with the rise in Leftist policies adopted by the US government. Thanks for making my point.   Communism is what comes after socialism has been established (in a capitalist state). Fascism is just another form of socialism featuring extreme nationalism and has nothing to do with Conservatism whatsoever.  This is basic poli sci 101 stuff.     The Scandinavian countries employ many socialistic policies but they are not true socialistic states.   Socialism requires public ownership over the means of production and centralized planning. The Scandinavian countries don't utilize those policies  Now, please comment on all of the socialist states mentioned above that utterly failed into totalitarian violence and decay.   All of the governments listed above were socialist. Communism is a form of socialism. Naziism and Fascism are forms of socialism.  Maybe you should have attended history class when those subjects were discussed  Your credibility is collapsing quickly.....   Warren's policies are as fake as her fake Native American heritage.     As a Conservative, I favor neither corporations nor the government controlling our lives.    The Left has been fighting that scorched earth campaign for a hundred years. Ever mess America faces is directly attributable to the Left's destructive policies     Socialism has always failed where ever it has been tried. Remember the Soviets, Moaists, Khmer Rouge, Nazis, Fascists, Cuba etc etc  There is no such thing as trickle down economics  I assume you mean the GOP's preference for stimulating the economy via tax cuts and decreased regulation expenses.  That economic philosophy has always worked   Vote for her if you want government controlling your life. She is a straight up Leftist and Ideologue. Every single one of her ideas is tired old Leftism and class warfare.     The "Final solution" to animal overpopulation.   http://i.imgur.com/8UFUOXv.png   This policy was implemented by means of deception and counter to the norms of a democratic society governed by law.  For that reason alone it should be dismantled.  You assume that the issue of healthcare is one  which the government needs to control. I reject that premise.   We should return to the previous system and create a system for the truly needy so that they can receive adequate healthcare.  Obamacare is the equivalent of "fixing" housing issues by moving everyone into government housing projects.    1. Get the Continuum transfunctioner  2. Receive oral pleasure  3. A small order of shrimp fried rice     you will see    will get     will decrease      will benefit     population as a whole    money saved collectively    beneficial in an indirect manner   Your points seem more wishful than actual...   That old joke again? Hahahahaha /s   No Republican is anti science   He should use his tickets to buy a continuum transfunctioner     I fail to understand how, in any way, you can intelligently argue that the ACA is worse than our previous system or that it isn't working to achieve its objective, insure more people while increasing competition and lowering costs.  Deductibles are so high that most cannot use insurance for anything other than catastrophic events.  Costs are much higher unless one is very poor and heavily subsidized.      Liberals: your entire world is crumbling. You deserve every crumb.   Ticks?    Let's make the Acheron think we are a whaler. Their greed will be their downfall.    Sounds like it's nappy time at your house.   You have a good strategy. Surprised you even find Liberals who will debate you at all. Most bail out after a snarky statement and a few dumb slogans.  Regarding affirmative action, I will often ask Liberals at what point should AA end? Invariably they always say "never".  The goal is not equality but rather keeping minorities controlled and dependent so that they vote as a block for Democrats.      Can you make a serious comment? What proof do you have that racism is a motivating factor to Conservatives?   As a Conservative, I am against ANY Liberal progressive socialist politician regardless of their race, creed, color, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual preference or any other qualifier.   The claim  that Conservatives are racist is a strategic tool the Left uses to AVOID debating issues and solutions in a meaningful and productive way. By claiming racism, the debate ends, the issues remain undebated, and the Conservative is vilified as a bad person.   How can you even make that claim? Based on what? Dude, where did you pick up your crazy ideas?   The cognitive dissonance on the Left is truly fascinating.  Sort of like children plugging their ears with their fingers so they don't hear that which they dislike.    Moxy, I simply don't know why you are fighting this so hard. It is a proven fact that Hitler and Mussolini were devout socialists as were their respective Nazi and Fascist movements.   We can trade comments til the cows come home but that won't change documented, undisputed, factual history. You simply can't deny it just because you wish it weren't so.    Curious question:What level of education have you achieved? I am assuming a few college classes   You are obviously confused and lumping Marxism, socialism, Naziism etc into a polyglot of isms. Marxism IS a form of socialism as is Naziism but although they share many key points they also differ in important ways.  You really should study the history of socialism in Germany during the turn of the 20th century. It is a fascinating period in which many socialist philosophers explored various types of socialism in search of the best and most equitable form.  With that said, you make the mistake of confusing the meaning of "control over the means of production". That term incorporates actual ownership such as a nationalized industries, coercive control over industries, and it includes crony capitalism in which certain favored corporations are given exclusivity and non favored corporations are excluded.  Hitler was a devout socialist and not an opportunist that simply attached himself to the term. He wrote extensively on the virtues of socialism and  even founded what became the German Socialist Workers Party.  Please expand your scholarly investigations beyond wikipedia. The study of socialism is a fascinating and diverse exploration into human attempts at optimum organizational systems     "six of the seven Italian earthquake experts have been acquitted of all charges"   Nice post. Amazing how fast the roaches scurry for the shadows when a light is flicked on.    It's CNN. Go figure         The Nazis were against Capitalism.  No they were not - that is just an outright untruth.  Really? Let's look at the primary sources, the Program of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi) itself: http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/10/26/appendix-1-nsdap-party-program-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/  A few keys points of that program:  "Point 11 calls for the abolition of all income gained by loaning money at interest.  Point 12 demands the confiscation of all profits earned by German businesses during World War I.  Point 13 demands the nationalization of all corporations.  Point 14 demands profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.  Point 15 demands the generous development of state-run old-age insurance.  Point 16 calls for the immediate socialization of the huge department stores. "     And here is a quote from Adolf Hitler in a speech in 1927: We are socialists, we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance, and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions.  Here is a quote from Josef Goebbels: The worker in a capitalist stateand that is his deepest misfortuneis no longer a living human being, a creator, a maker. He has become a machine. A number, a cog in the machine without sense or understanding. He is alienated from what he produces.[  http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/  These quotes were just what I googled in 10 seconds worth of research.   Your claim that the Nazis were Capitalists or supported Capitalism is thus proven False.   I was being sarcastic. In my experience, people are much more forgiving of slights and insults when they are carrying. I assume it's because such challenges to one's manhood are not really challenges at all. Carrying gives them the power of life and death and it allows them to be a merciful god.    The Nazis were against Capitalism. They "controlled" not owned the means of production.  The Nazis were against the Communists because they viewed them as competitors. Hitler also felt that international Communism contained too many Jews as members. Communism was internationally focused while Naziism was more nationalistic.   Denmark has some socialist policies but it is a different form of socialism than Naziism. Also the Nazis and the Fascists (both socialists) were distinct in that Fascism did not involve the extreme racism and  antisemitism of Naziism.  Naziism and Fascism are often incorrectly lumped together as the same system. They were not. The confusion results from the Soviets lumping the two systems together in propaganda during WWII.    Wikipedia it. Socialism includes several economic/political systems such as Communism, Naziism, Fascism, and even Anarcho Syndicalism etc.  Al have various distinctions but all include non private control over the means of production and a government centric society    The Nazis were socialists. The Tea Party is the opposite of socialism. School much?   12 but I still out debated you with ease.    I live the Tea Party while you merely hear snarky soundbites about it.  I think I will stay in the reality based  community rather than your community based reality.   The Tea Party is a grassroots organization with no central leadership or structure based on the ideas of 1.smaller government, 2. less taxes, and 3. less government regulation.    The Left has created a weird false fantasy that we are just dupes of the Koch bros.    That fantasy is 100% false. The Kochs support Conservative political views and that is fine by me. But they do not control the Tea Party in any way.  The recent midterm election tsunami proves that the political sands are shifting in a monumental way and the Kochs could not be the cause of it.      What a silly and untrue statement. I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative and the Kochs have ZERO influence on my political views whatsoever.   I am not just saying that to be argumentative or contrary. I am being totally honest here. The Kochs exert ZERO influence over the Tea Party and the Conservative wing of the GOP.   I am very active in online and real life Conservative forums and I have NEVER heard of anyone even discussing the Koch bros.    Ooops! Didn't mean to touch a nerve.  At this point I should realize that to some, reddit is their only social outlet and that I have no business making light of that fact. No harm, no foul. Good luck   It just dawned on me...you truly have nothing better to do with your time than to argue about this silliness.   What went wrong man?   My only point was that she only had 90 rounds of ammo for a mission that logic would dictate would require more (multiple hard targets).   Now please tell everyone about how you are a Navy SEAL BUDS instructor and enthrall us with your tales of glory and daring do...    Let me get this straight, you are acting like you have sand in your vagina over a pic of a Navy sailor holding a handful of gummi bears? Dude, go outside, ride a bike, volunteer somewhere, interact with some live humans....   So fast you'll be early for class yesterday   The most likely threats to a docked ship are below the surface, on the surface, and in the air. Not much she can do regarding underwater or aircraft threats. She is likely to have to deal with small boat attacks probably in numbers larger than one. It is highly unlikely that she will be able to deal with such a threat with 60 rounds of 5.56mm and 30 rounds of 9mm.     What about hunting or target shooting?   That doesn't seem to be adequate. I imagine any asymmetric attack would involve multiple targets and require more than +/- 90 rounds to deal with. Sounds like politically correct bs at play...   Just concerned that if you had to deal with an asymmetric threat that you would have more than one or two mags.     Christie and Bush have zero support from the Tea Party. They both have zero chance of being nominated. Walker would be just what this country needs after 8 years of the Obama debacle    Where are your spare mags? Do they only give you one?

Obama   The best thing about Ashland KY is the fact that they have a bridge over the Ohio river into Ohio that allows you to buy beer on Sunday (Kentucky does not sell alcohol in stores on Sunday)   The oil and gas released from fracking is collected via a controlled tube. There are many shale and impermeable rock layers between the oil and gas and the surface and ground water. The fracking process only fracks a few layers leaving most layers intact.   I understand your frustration and need to be snarky but is there a part of you who can simply discuss the factual realities of fracking?  Turn off the religious part of your brain and just weight the facts.   A question for you:  If fracking methods and fossil fuel usage were technologically advanced to the point that we could guarantee that no environmental damage ever occurred, would you  accept fracking and the use of fossil fuels?    It's lubricants that allow the sand to pass within the cracks that the fracking pressure creates. Even if it's plutonium, at that depth (over 1-2 miles from the surface) the chemical is going to stay there.   You obviously are arguing with feelings and not with science. The oil industry has been injecting all types of lubricants, oil, chemicals etc into deep disposal wells for a hundred years with no issues. Why is it so hard for you to grasp the science involved?    Speculation. We don't know what chemicals they use and in what amounts because they have fought and won to keep them secret.  No, we do know exactly what happens to those chemicals because deep well waste injections have been done for a hundred years. The chemicals and the water react with iron ore in the soil and transform into iron oxide, rust essentially. This is chemistry 101 stuff.  You are trying to bring your environmentalism, your religion, your philosophical aversion to fossil fuels into a scientific factual discussion.   Unless you have divested your lifestyle from the benefits of fossil fuels then you are just not being a credible advocate.   Note: I fully embrace the day when we can utilize totally clean energy. That is definitely our goal and or destiny. We simply need to allow the science to develop. Shooting ourselves in the foot by stopping  the use of fossil fuels prematurely is  philosophically satisfying but realistically naive and harmful.   	199

However, the BME program at my school has a habit of kicking out PhD students who are "under qualified," "problematic," or that they "just don't like" making the MS degree relatively worthless here.

If you want to do prosthetics, find a professor at a different university and consider the field that his/her appointment is in (whether it's EE, ME, BME, etc).  The two things you mention are very different, so you may want to decide on smart prosthetics (going to be more EE and ME oriented) or the medical substances (probably more BME or material science engineering).  	13

 Really? That's pretty awesome, is the story punchy and short? Thats what I like to see in an indie game, its certain;y the kind of game I want to make.      Enslaved?   You've reminded me I need to finish Skyward Sword   He had almost a Peanuts-style humour about him, strangely mature and insightful for such a youngling.   I completely forgot this character existed, seems like Tecmo Koei really love Twilight Princess.   already have, it's well made   Yes, but difficulty is usually a detriment to my experience. Let me explain.   I like the idea of high difficulty, but it is rarely used with any great effect and instead of adding to the tone of a game, any sense of tension is deflated by the fact that while you may be vulnerable, your enemies are bullet/hit sponge demi gods.  I like the idea of getting hit once and dying, but I need my enemies to have the same vulnerability, otherwise it's an exercise in grinding and not tension.   So instead, I often play on easy so enemies go down fast but reset to checkpoint if I get hit by a bullet, like a mentally enforced, pretend high tension difficulty mode.  It's annoying, because how hard is it to put in a difficulty mode where almost everything, including you, dies in one hit?    He slaughters those guys in the bar and then uses that conspirator against King Foltest as bait for the striga. In the games Geralt seems like he has more of a warm heart, does his character change in the books, or have the games made Geralt more sympathetic? Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast.

Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast.   Morrowind is pretty great for that candy shop feeling.   I think it's fair for the devs to want to be secretive too though, it's more special if you don't understand the systems of a game when you first play it.   I hope this game isn't being overhyped by people on message boards. It definitely looks like a cool game, but I feel people need to temper expectations, so if it is mindblowing, it will be a nice surprise.   Very cool idea! Hope the world is super reactive.   So in this game, what are the limitations on freedom? I have never played Elite, but can you land on planets or other ships? Can you get out of your ship? Are any space sims like that?  Or is it mostly UI and flight?   I love listening to todd howard talk about game making. Dunno what it is.   https://www.youtube.com/user/PrescriptionPixel is a really cool indie game channel, I would love to know about more like this.  and  https://www.youtube.com/user/SonsOfVidya/ is two down to earth guys whose banter I find really funny and not forced.   I'm curious about relatively new/small gaming channels that people on /r/games think are really good or interesting.  I enjoy TB and Dodger but sometimes it's cool to see some less prominent talent on YouTube.  I'll post a couple I found down below, in the effort of fairness. Hope to see some good suggestions.   https://www.youtube.com/user/PrescriptionPixel is a really cool indie game channel, I would love to know about more like this.  and  https://www.youtube.com/user/SonsOfVidya/ is two down to earth guys whose banter I find really funny and not forced.

Go to developer options and tick "Disable HW overlays". I haven't experienced any redraws after that.               Google's developers took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  or from my perspective, they gave me a couple of weeks to rest  but now they're back and it's time for the app updates to resume. Naturally, it's time to breathe life back into the teardowns, and we're back with a  VERY big one. Google Search v50.2 began rolling out to users yesterday, and we've already seen quite a few HUGE adjustments and improvements. After plenty of digging, a stack of additional changes have surfaced, including one that is already live, and several more just waiting for some finishing touches including the much awaited **Project Food**.               **Disclaimer**: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to launch of a new feature. As with all rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced.          * **'Ok Google Make me a Sandwich'** By far, this is the biggest feature Google has implemented. This is the first step to Google's ambitious 'Project Food'.  Just say the phrase "OK Google, Make me a sandwich" and lo, your sandwich will be made by your mobile! This will, according to Google, go a long way in providing free food to everyone.  * **Excitement for the future** There are subtle hints dropped for us to see that Project Food is about to come. For example, when we saw the code, there was a line which mentioned, "OK Google, make me a burger." This probably means that Project Food will cover a variety of foods, ranging from burgers to sandwiches.  Here is the code we observed      string name="search_pref_header""OK Google, Make me a burger"/string      string name="search_bluetooth_pref_title"Make a burger/string      string name="search_headset_pref_title"BURGER BURGER!/string      string name="search_headsets_confirmation_title"BURGER PROCESSING!/string      string name="search_headsets_confirmation_body"YOUR BURGER IS READY TO EAT!!!!!/string   *  **Wrap-Up** * That's about it for this teardown. It's clear Google is preparing quite a few changes for the coming months, and there's definitely something for everybody on this list. It's only January, and there's already a lot showing up in the Search app, so by the time I/O rolls around, most of this list will probably be live and we'll have a whole new set of foods to eat. I think it's going to be a good year for food junkies.      http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tbkx6/noniphone_users_why_do_your_prefer_your_current/                  ON 30TH JANUARY, A LORD WAS BORN.

 Unless I'm mistaken there is no way to reverse balding and methods to slow it down are pretty ineffective. Why is this? What challenges are impeding a cure for baldness?         I'm interested in a bit of an overview of all major changes in hunting patterns, so feel free to take 'early humans' to mean any period you're most interested in answering for.  Anyway, I'm just curious as to how early humans actually approached a hunt. When did traps become popular? Did humans usually approach hunting in small or large groups? Silently, or did we tend to just bumrush animals with spears and arrows? Was it typical for a human to be able to just spear an animal for a kill with little effort, or would most hunts involve chasing an animal until it was tired, throwing out spears/arrows until it was too exhausted to avoid them.      Having played both LoL and Dota, I'm amazed at how badly LoL players overstate the problems associated with voice chat. These team oriented games benefit greatly from ease of communication, I find it weird to not include it. Does HotS have voice chat?   Have Valve ever made an official statement on Dota 2 achievements?   After reading a TIL today, I just realised how little I know about the Vietnam War. Like, embarrassingly little. Can anyone recommend a good book on the subject as a whole?   Anyone from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government) is valid, however, for the sake of simplifying things, feel free to just use the leaders you're familiar with and see if someone one ups you.  * Round 1: an all out fight in a large, empty arena. No hiding or leaving the arena until everyone has tapped out, been knocked unconscious or been killed.  * Round 2: A large woodland, 5km by 5km. Everyone starts at a random location with no knowledge of the area. Tools are their standard attire (eg. Obama in a suit etc), a hunting rifle with 12 shots, a handgun with a single bullet, a machete and two litres of water. They must hunt each other and survive the elements until only one is standing. Weather conditions are cold, prone to rain. Water and animal life is scarce. There are some bears, but most animal are not aggressive. This is mostly a test of survival skills and hunting ability - both the ability to remain undetected and to detect others.  * Round 3: Each leader gets the powers commonly attributed to them in popular culture and propaganda.   ELI5: What are the major differences between a Prime Minister and a President? Specifically, US and Australia?   And does the same apply to all solar systems? Or was much of the matter created during the early development of the universe?      Is there any way to sort my workshop subscriptions by game?   I've played the game before, but never finished. I'm intending to just go for the main quest this time around and want to do it with mods (which I haven't done before). So, hit me with 5 I should use.      Seems like it's great for developers, but what does it actually mean for me as a consumer?   Is it possible? Anyone have the IP?   It would play more or less exactly the same as Dota, but the characters would be personnel of Russia's Ministry of Finance. You could play as many personalities such as Anton Siluanov, Roman Artyukhin, various secretaries and accountants, and even State Secretary-Deputy Minister of Finance Sergei Shatalov.  I might even include some of the greats from the past such as Yegor Gaidar and Mikhail Zadornov.  If it's a success, I'm also thinking of creating spin-offs such as France's Ministry of Agriculture. Who would pass on a chance to play as Agriculture Minister Dominique Bussereau? Not many I would think.   I'm currently 23, almost 24, and about to finish my Bachelor of Accounting. I feel like my resume is very underwhelming so I want to gain some work experience before beginning my job search. I'm thinking of calling some places up tomorrow, but I feel pretty weird about it. Most of my peers seem to already be 'out' in the world and I've only ever worked casual jobs. When I think of work experience I think of 18 year olds tops. Am I too old to old or is my anxiety unfounded?  Australian if that's at all relevant.   Like, OK, you might leave an chip packet and mountain dew can on your desk when you're in the middle of a session. Maybe you occasionally go back for a second without cleaning up the first and it looks a little messy. But eventually you decide to throw it out... or most people would. How can these people let such small messes become such big messes. It takes zero effort to throw your rubbish in the bin whenever you next get up, but they voluntarily leave it there?  I can't get into the minds of these people, what's the cause of this condition? I can understand massive weight gain because at least it takes effort to lose weight and eat right, but I just can't understand letting something so simple to manage spiral so far out of control.   Just out of curiosity? When I was job hunting I'd often try and apply for jobs same day, which lead me to getting stressed quite a bit if I found a lot I liked in the same day. However, I ironically landed the one job I procrastinated for applying for, which had been open for two weeks. It got me wondering if maybe I didn't need to be so worried with applying ASAP. So, for future reference, how long are jobs typically open for?  I'm Australian if that affects anything.      As in, do you (or have you ever) made it a matter of course to browse through people's pictures, videos, website accounts, etc. when repairing a computer? What's the most interesting thing you've found? Do most people have weird ass porn fetishes?      In the movie Schindler's list, there's a wonderful scene where Schindler is sobbing because he couldn't save more Jews. Is this scene based on reality at all? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0T1od5dUoA   Some of the key characteristics of the Borg is their very stiff movement and a disregard for their environment save for their immediate objectives. While this works well for them when you treat the drones as simple fodder to achieve low key objectives, with most of their strength coming from their advance technology and space warfare, they would still be highly inefficient in ground combat.  I'm not saying they'd be bad, they can hand a large amount of firepower, are probably quite accurate with phasers and have exceptional strength - you wouldn't want a bunch of Borg advancing on your position. But they're still less efficient then they could be - they don't seem to exhibit a lot of fine motor movement which would be handy for navigating a battlefield (trenches, caves, barricades, etc) nor do they run, meaning it would be easy to retreat from them, they could get picked off easily, etc.  **So my question is this:** do the Borg simply not possess the technology to make highly efficient, 'athletic' Borg soldiers? Or is it simply due to the fact that it is not required of them to achieve their goals that making Borg this complex would use more resources than they would gain?   Just a quick one, but which of these three entities would win if they started setting their sights on each other?   So I've rewatched the original movie a couple of times since the reboot has been out, and I noticed a few things over the course of the film that I believe support this hypothesis.  First, before I go into this, you have to keep in mind that Taylor and his crew traveled FORWARD through time for many thousands of years, giving enough time for all the necessary changes to take place. Now, onto the evidence.  Firstly, when Taylor arrives of the Ape planet, he discovers that it is perfectly hospitable. The right makeup in the air, the right distance from the sun, drinkable water, etc. The odds of this happening are actually incredibly slim. Even an amateur astronomer can tell you that. It's not definitive proof, since there could be some fluke that makes an equally habitable planet with the same landscapes and sky as Earth, but it's highly unlikely and is a big hint that this planet may be Earth right off the bat.  Secondly, evolution is a very complex thing, and it is not conceivable to think that by sheer luck, a second planet would evolve humans, apes and horses on it AND that Taylor would happen to land on that planet. This is absurd. The apes and Taylor also share a common language - English. Whatever happened on Earth during these few thousand years to eliminate the humans and cause the apes to become smart was not enough to eliminate written and spoken language. The apes adopted this language as their own, allowing Taylor to communicate with them. Also many of the apes names are also human names, clearly adopted in addition to the English language.  Third; at the end of the movie, Dr. Zaius hints at some sort of catastrophe. Something clearly happened on this planet and could explain its current state - like a war that reduced the humans to small tribes allowing the apes to take over.  Finally, the very last scene shows Taylor confronting the statue of Liberty, an Earth structure. His inititial assumption is that the statue of liberty was blown up and the debris traveled through space. I suggest that the statue has been in this position all along, just decayed with time... **EARTH**   Alright, first things first, I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this subreddit, so if not let me know and I'll delete the post. If anyone knows of a better place, please share. So onto the question...  I've been watching a lot of older sci-fi and it all seems very twist heavy, and it got me thinking, how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema? On one side of the coin - even if you hadn't seen or heard of the twists before, you can still 'see them coming', they all seem kind of obvious. However, today's audiences are probably more trained to that sort of thinking, right? Would older twists have been more likely to take people by surprise, even if they'd seem obvious to movie goers today? Twists still predated movies and television too, so it's not like it was a new concept.  Some specific examples I'm interested in - were most people surprised by the twists in:  * Planet of the Apes * In general, The Twilight Zone * Hitchcock's Psycho * Soylent Green * Invasion of the Body Snatchers (haven't seen original, but I'm referencing the end of the 1978 version where it leads you to believe he is human trying to fit in, but is actually 'snatched') * That one dude being a robot in Alien (forgot his name)      I've been watching a lot of older sci-fi and it all seems very twist heavy, and it got me thinking, how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema?

Basically, not just trivia, but questions about movies in a historical context, from a cinema historian or whatever they'd be called. What's the best subreddit to ask these sorts of questions?  Basically, the r/askhistorians of movies.      Just bumped into a player who is abusing 1v1 mode in order to farm compendium points. He is picking Nature's Prophet, deliberately feeding to end the game prematurely and requeuing. Is there anyone I should report him too and is this a known thing?      The real life counterparts of Donkey Kong and the bosses from his last two games battle it out in a series of 1v1s. These are rough approximations of the animals real life counterparts and some liberties had to be taken (especially with the more fictional bosses from the first game).  **Donkey Kong**  Stronger side of the typical Gorilla. Approximately 200kg, 1.9m tall.  **Opponents:**  * Ba-Boom, a Chacma Baboon, the largest of the baboon species. Around 45kg, about 1.1m tall.  * Bashmaster, a large polar bear, around 650kg size male.  * Pompy, a full grown sea lion, around 300-350kg, about 2.5m long  * Lord Fredrik, a male pacific walrus around 2,00kg  * Mugly, fictional, so let's just say he sort of triceretops like in stature I suppose  * Thugly, we'll say a White Rhinoceros, about 3,500kg and 3.5 long  * Colonel Pluck and his Stompybot 3000. No real world equivalent, so instead it's a man driving a Smart Car (can attempt to run the Gorilla down)  * The ragtag bunch, all the leftovers team up against the gorilla: a mole, a gray owl, a yellow blowfish, a dodo and 3 Japanese Spider Crabs.  **Round 1**  Each boss fights our gorilla. Who wins? Does Donkey Kong sweep the competition in real life, or does he find himself greatly outclasses? Each battle takes place on a plain, open field in daylight. The animals are displaying their fullest aggression.  **Round 2**  Of all the animals that beat the gorilla, who of those would be victorious if they all fought eachother?   So it's been a pretty big secret to who this Batman character really was with many characters discussing the possibilities throughout the movies. But I think I have gathered enough evidence to show that Lucious Fox was indeed Batman the whole time.  1. Lucious had access to all the technology that Batman had used throughout the series as the head of Wayne Enterprises military contracts division. This can be clearly seen from all the scenes in which he is showing off the technology to the Bruce Wayne character. 2. The movie spends a disproportionately large amount of time focusing on Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent for some reason. Why? So it seems more natural to have Lucious Fox on screen. 3. Lucious Fox CLEARLY hints at being Batman in the scene where he is confronted by that accountant dude or whatever. 4. Batman dresses in all black. Lucious Fox is black 5. Why the Bat theme? Bruce Wayne has a fear of bats. Lucious spends a large time around Wayne. Wayne most likely relayed his fear of bats to Lucious 6. There is no other likely contender from the movies main characters (Dent would be too busy during the day to go around at night crime fighting, Alfred is too old, Gordan and Batman are seen on screen at the same time, Bruce Wayne is too busy working out, taking tours of the military contract division, hiding from the public eye and playing with bat themed military gadgets to go around crime fighting) 7. I zoned out of the movies a lot to be honest, which means that there was probably LOTS of evidence I overlooked suggestions Lucious is Batman, which is EVIDENCE IN ITSELF.   Preferably spoiler free? Unfortunately I live in the middle of nowhere and my Internet sucks to much to stream.   [So I posted this the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/29886w/do_i_need_to_apply_new_thermal_paste/) to PCmasterrace. Seemed like I needed to replace my thermal paste, so I did yesterday, but it hasn't seemed to have helped my temperature issues. I'm still hitting the same temperatures. After the paste didn't work the first time, I took it off to check it looked right (it did) and reapplied a second time. So I'm guessing it's not the paste (unless there's a break in period, but I haven't noticed even a slight temperature drop. Paste was Deep Cool Z9).  Is there anything else that might be wrong that I should check? I have a Corsair H50 and it feels like water is still being pumped when I put my finger on the tubes.  What should I check next?   Firstly, I'm not amazingly good with computers. I've installed a new graphics card in the past but that's about it.  Anyway, currently, my CPU's temperature is sitting at about 70-75 degrees celcius when idle and 80+ when gaming. I haven't had any performance issues until today, so I don't know how long its been hitting this temperature for, but it's seems to be causing some issues today.  I cleaned off the fans and checked how fast they were spinning with speedfan (CPU fan 4450 rpm, system fan 1580 rpm). I did a quick google and these speeds seem to be normal. So that leaves me with two possibilities.  The first is that water cooling system. I didn't build this PC, but the person who did told me I shouldn't need to do anything with this maintenance wise since its a closed system. Is this true?  If so, that leaves the heatsink. It's (obviously) very hot to the touch. I'm a little worried about taking it off since I'm worried I'll fuck up my PC, but is this the likely issue? How can I check for certain before I try reapplying paste? And anything I should know before doing so?  Thanks.  (perhaps there is a better subreddit to ask this?)         Just for some fun, what ideas would you like to see for future Steam events? Considering most people are unhappy with the direction Steam's sale events have taken (cash grab instead of achievement hunts) what would you like to see instead?  My idea is probably a little too much effort for how little Valve would get out of it, but it would be cool to see a series of 'Camp Contests' utilising the current team system instead of buying items in the top Valve games.  For example, a Dota 2 could have a special queue open that matches you with people on your Steam team. The winning team contributes 50 points, each tower 10 points and each kill 1 point to your team's summer sale score.  Could do similar with TF2 and CS:GO as well as . In addition to random players on the winning team each day getting their games, top 5 MVP's from each game (any team) could get their wishlist games or something.  Of course, I doubt this would ever happen since it's harder to monetize, but I think it'd be a much more exciting community event instead of this money spending competition.         With only 15 crafted, I wanted to get an idea of their current value. I had a look on Dota2lounge and the steam market and can't find the level 5 treasure or the helmet in either place. It's gotten me curious: do you think some of those 15 that have been crafted so far may never see the light of day? Although Dota 2 has a huge fanbase, there are still people who haven't played it or stopped playing it and may not realise the value of the item they have.   Most people probably already know which hero they want to play when they queue. You don't need to consider allies picks. Can we have a shorter (10-30 second) character select timer and a 30 second pre-start period? Or something along those lines?   It seems a little lacklustre without it.      I never played it online and I really hope SSB WiiU has some proper matchmaking system instead of just queuing you with completely random individuals - that'd just lead to a series of one sided matches.  Even something simple like Mario Kart's system. So did Brawl have a matchmaking/ranking system and if so, was it any good at pairing you with like-skilled individuals?   Is there any reason Sniper got no lines in Love   War?   So I'm not particularly good at Chess, so maybe I'm overlooking something obvious. But, I sometimes like to set up random positions against the Chess.com computer and play against it at max strength and get utterly trounced by it. But today it made a weird move.  I'll start from a few moves in - personally I find context helps, but better players can probably just skip to the next paragraph if you'd rather just jump straight to the point. Basically, starting from [THIS](http://imgur.com/cVLxxma) position (me white, computer black) I took the computer's Queen with the a pawn. It took my castle with the black square bishop and captured that bishop with my knight. Then the computer moved the king to D7 and I captured the second Bishop. It moved the King to C6 leaving us [HERE](http://imgur.com/51se0oN).  Then I realised my Knight was trapped and just moved to capture the black pawn with my knight. [May as well take a pawn if I'm moving my knight](http://imgur.com/doWtvLG). I expected the computer to just recapture with the King, but instead it did moved the rook on a8 to a1. I captured the rook with my remaining rook for a free piece and [THEN it took the knight with the king.](http://imgur.com/tZ4YTIn)  So, basically, why did the computer (set at the strongest difficulty) throw away the rook like that? I'm sure it's something obvious that will make me facepalm.   Just an idea (probably not an original one), but how would you guys feel about seeing complementary item sets for Io and his partners?  For example, CK and Io could each have a "Global Chaos" set for whatever. Io cosmetics are hard, but maybe custom tether animation, Wisp balls that look 'Chaos Knightish' and makes his colour a more darkish red. Maybe CK's set adds some Io elements somehow.  Anyway, when both have their sets equipped, they'd get a more powerful looking tether animation, different relocate symbol and relocate timer and other assorted effects unique to that set.  Could do this with all Io partners.            I'm interested in seeing the group stages, but moreso I want to plan some free time around the games I want to watch live. Does Valve usually release the group stage schedule in advance or will I have to wait til the day?   and if so, does it accommodate for it in anyway? For example, would Bobby Fischer's 1972 rating of 2785 be considered 'better' than a 2785 of today, or could it be fairly said that a rating of 2850-2900 be a more significant accomplishment then Fischer's rating?   And if so, free or paid? Will there be a 'season pass' type deal?   After reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/27hb10/a_game_named_steam_the_game_appeared_on_store_for/), what would you like to see in a Steam 'meta' game?  An actual simulation of using Steam similar to the [Newgrounds sim](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/236362)?  A unique TCG featuring Valve characters and other popular Steam game card sets?  Maybe a mini-game HUB (Chess, Poker, Checkers, and other traditional board and card games complete with ladders and rankings)?  These last two could follow Valve's traditional F2P model and would help tighten the Steam community.  Or is this too much of a cash n' grab? What other ideas could be cool?      Or do I have to use that ugly hat?   Can be TV, movie, album outtake, etc.   That AREN'T developed by Valve.         I remember a match with where Na'vi randomed Zeus (I believe). Does anyone have the link to that and other pro games where there have been random heroes. Has there ever been an entire 5 hero random?         1) Who is the last man standing in an all out brawl?  2) Can the winner of scenario 1 take on the other two if they teamed up?  Let the Bruce Lee circlejerk commence ;)   Is global population likely to have a major effect on the standard of living anytime soon? Is there a tipping point where we won't be able to 'turn back'? Are we simply judging overpopulation by our current infrastructure, but could very easily deal with a much large population by simply building more?  Something I worry that my future grandchildren might have to face, but am admittedly very ignorant on. But seeing that the world population went from 3 billion to 7 billion in just 50 years is both amazing and scary.      I'd love to see a minor content update - anything - to justify Valve slapping that game back on the front page again. It was really fun, but the community is basically non existent at the moment. The game is just sitting there, perfectly playable, free to play, with no one touching it.      And how did his superiors feel about him burning 11(?) of their navy's ships? Frankly I'd be a little pissed. Were they expensive or important ships?      Long story short, trying to upgrade through the store has been a hassle. Several seconds into the install, the Store app just crashes. I can go back to my desktop, but trying to open store again (by moving my mouse to the top left of the screen) just causes the Store to boot from scratch. I literally can't get more than a few seconds into the download. Is there another way to go about this? Like a torrent or disc I can order from Microsoft?

Twitch just loads so slowly for me, it's unwatchable and buffering is unreliable in my experience.   What exactly does Blizzard do during maintenance each week? I'm surprised a company as large and experience as Blizzard needs to effectively cut people off from their games once a week. For me, someone who can only play between certain times, I literally can't play at all on Tuesdays.  Edit: No idea why I'm getting downvoted, I'm genuinely curious as to what the maintenance process is, why it needs to be so regular and why they need to take all games and servers offline at the same time to perform it. I'm not in IT.   Working under a temporal displacement theory that might have lead to it winding up on the set of popular American darams. Didn't notice MH370 in the background of any shots, moving onto Season 2 now. Does anyone want to work on Dexter?   Trying to decide which purchase to finalise on. Does anyone know if all copies of Dark Souls 2 will be linked with Steam, or if there is a specific Steam release with physical copies being a stand alone game?   Why aren't DreamLeague matches being added to the DotaCinema VODs section?   Usually you can access a list of achievements from the store page, but this doesn't seem to be the case with RE4. Anyone know why?   Anyone know if we might get a new album in the next year or two?   Only Sherlock knows of the crime as Moriarty explicitly told him he was planning it, but otherwise knows no details. Instead of solving the crime himself (someone has to make all this delicious honey), he sends notice to the world's best detectives to step in and thwart Moriarty instead. Unfortunately, they too are also busy, and decide to send their sidekicks in their places.  Which sidekick has the best chance of solving the crime?  * John Watson (original Doyle Sherlock canon) * Natalie Teeger (Monk) * Robin (Adam West Batman) * Gus (Psych) * Luke Triton (Professor Layton) * Richard MacDuff (Dirk Gently) * Penny (Inspector Gadget) * Shaggy (without the rest of the gang) * Tin Tin's dog  Round 2: Assuming no one of them was good enough in the first place, they all team up. Do they stand a chance now?  Ignore anachronisms, no one gets technology beyond 1894.   I understand NA won't be getting a CE for the PC, but what about other countries? Specifically Australia?   Which of these two characters is more powerful?         How much additional data is there to download after installing data from the PC version of FFXIV: ARR?   One of the biggest criticisms of WoW is its grind. I have to admit, at the moment, I'm not having too much fun. It seems that everyone I know absolutely adores WoW, but right now, I'm not digging it. Can someone please tell me what I can expect from the game in the long run and where it 'picks up'?  Secondly, right now, I'm currently leveling my first new character. I'm playing the game as the game downloads (it's not even at optimal yet) and I'm experiencing about 200-600 ping. I'm wondering: What is the ping typically like for Australian players? I'm hoping this ping is just due to the client downloading data as I play.   What's the best free resource to learn beginner to advanced excel skills? I have fundamental skills, but I feel like being better with Excel would give me a bit of an edge in the workplace, even if I learn a lot of stuff out of the scope of what I'd usually be doing.   I really like the idea of MMORPGs, but the few I've played have failed to truly engage me. Could someone recommend me something - preferably an upcoming title - that might actually satisfy me.   The ones I put the most time into were:  * Star Trek Online: Loved the space battles and just the general feel of traveling through space. But everything else sucked. Combat felt skill-less, lack of variety in ship parts. Once the space battles began to grow repetitive I found myself completely bored with the game. * Guild Wars 2: Felt very fun and polished at first, but I never quite made it to endgame. It felt incredibly spammy and the classes felt very homogenized. But man, the combat, so spammy. I also disliked how leveling up meant next to nothing and equipment was practically the same for everyone. * World of Warcraft: The big one. I actually just made my first character two days ago. I'm currently level 6 and all I've done is walk around killing x monsters for quest y. Over and over. I understand I'm 10 years late to the party, so I don't blame the game, but playing it for the first time in 2014 it looks bad, it plays bad, the spells feel so unfun and the quests are terrible. I've barely played it so I'm not going to make final judgement on it, but if the quests continue at this pace I can't see myself putting in more than another hour or two.  **Preferred Genres (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.):** Any, but a good ship based Sci-fi would be great  **Pricing Model:** Any  **Favorite Features:** Engaging combat - the more skill based the better, smooth and 'flowing' combat (for comparison, WoW and Star Trek's ground combat feel pretty 'clunky'), good ping on Oceanic servers for Australians a plus  **Combat Type**: Any  **Released or Upcoming:** Either, preferably upcoming   Eve Online seems like the obvious choice, but I'd prefer recommendations other than that. It's on my to do list, but currently I feel like it's too big of a time investment from what I've heard, I just wouldn't have time to properly get into it between work and Uni.   Just upgraded to iOS7 and I want to change the music app back.  Specifically, I dislike having to scroll through every song to find an album I want. I don't understand why they made this change. I tend to have large collections from my favourite artists and like to listen to lots of different albums. For many artists I listen to regularly I have well over 20 albums. Is there any way I can change the app (settings I've overlooked?) so it goes Artist  Album  Song instead of Artist  Album+Songs.   New to this game, just wondering what the general consensus on the state of the game's balance is.  What about specific cards or strategies?   I can't even begin to fathom getting angry over something like this. A different set of words were used to sing a song? Why is this making people upset? What negative consequences do they think will happen? Is the average person actually annoyed, or just vocal minority?      I'm assuming he can't travel forwards based on the fact that if he could, he would already know how humanity turns out.   Go to http://doodleordie.com/ and make an account. Select "Find more rooms" from the room drop down box and join the Star Trek room.  We could use more doodlers.   Throw them at me. I'm going to be on a pretty mediocre laptop for the next few weeks and need something to kill the time. Text based preferred, but if there's something fun non-text based suggest it anyway and I'll see if it runs.   This looks pretty similar to Tribal Wars, a game I used to love a fair bit. However I've heard this is pay to win? Is it true? I don't mind some minor P2W elements as long as I can remain reasonably competitive, but I get no enjoyment out of winning (or losing) based on having spent real money.  TL;DR: How (if at all) P2W is this game?   I know these sorts of topics are starting to become a bit disliked here, but I'm really interested in this one.  It's Geralt from the books. He has been hired to slay the beast and thus gets a reasonable amount of prep time (say a few days)/knows what he's getting into. He has all his swords and any potions from his universe available to him. If the monster has a weak point, he is aware of it. The monster is being introduced into the Witcher universe for this battle so Geralt can only use the resources from that universe to create monster traps or whatever will aid him in the battle.  The battle takes place in an environment that the monster has chosen to settle down in. Ie., if the monster likes swamps, it will naturally habitat a swamp somewhere in the Witcher universe for the fight.  Also use a loose definition of the word 'monster'. Basically just keep human-like species and superheroes out of the mix.  TL;DR: What's the strongest monster a fully prepared Geralt of Rivia can beat.   I'm sure discussing ideas for new Trek series has probably grown long since uninteresting to everyone here, but I'm going to give this discussion a shot anyway!   When would be the best timeframe for a new Trek series to be set? For example, do you think the technological advancements made at the end of Voyager would make a post-Voyager Trek too uninteresting setting? By 2400~, Starfleet has already created technologies that allow a ship to be modified to go toe to toe with multiple Borg ships (keep in mind these are just modifications, so the actual ships from 2400 would be even stronger). Time travel also seems to be ridiculously easy and rampant at this point. Would a series set in this point in time deal with too much 'overpowered' stuff and rely too heavily on introducing ludicrously strong antagonists to compensate? And coming up with reasons why X technology can't be used to solve problem Y?    Could a new Trek series deal with a technological stagnation - or maybe even regression - in a post year 3000 Star Trek (or whenever the Star Trek time travel from Enterprise took place)? Or is this moving too far away from the franchises beginnings?   What about setting a show in the past again (except this time: actually dealing with historical Trek storylines instead of introducing new ones...)? What era would be most suitable for this purpose? Or has all the interesting stuff already been dealt with?   TL;DR: If a new Trek were to be made, when should it be set and why? Keeping in mind this is not for ideas for a new Trek, but rather meant for a discussion of the state of the current Trek universe and what challenges may be present in creating a new Trek, although it's fair if concepts for shows naturally creep in. Just don't give us the script to your pilot ;)   After reading on wiki about [Paul Kern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kern) I am curious about a few things. Firstly, the article is very lackluster. Is this case considered to be genuine, and if so, are there any modern theories as to how he lost the ability to sleep?  Secondly, most theories of sleep treat sleep as a regenerative function (some treat it as a way of conserving energy). If sleep truly is a regenerative function, how is it theoretically possible for Paul Kern to have functioned (he reported feeling not-tired 24/7) without sleep?  Lastly, would it be viable to deliberately damage people's brains in the same fashion to eliminate the human need for sleep? What exactly where the drawbacks in Kern's situation?   I pretty much listen to no hip-hop, but loves these two albums (that, and Gorillaz).   Which Kanye albums are closest to these two and what other albums should I try? I'm not actually a huge fan of rapping, but the music itself is growing on me.   Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway and Archer have been plucked from their respective timeline (their peak in each series to be precise) and forced to face-off in a showdown of 11 events. The winner in each category earns two quatloos, second place one quatloo, and the worst contender loses a quatloo (can go negative). Who places where in each category and who comes out with the most quatloos?  * **ACAMEDIA** * Round 1: Kobayashi Maru test * Round 2: Starfleet grade average (can select own course and electives as per standard Starfleet academic course) * Round 3: Quiz-off: Five player Jeopardy showdown  * **ATHLETICS AND FITNESS** * Round 4: 400 meter dash * Round 5: Tennis doubles playoffs (2nd in command as their partner) * Round 6: Highest climb of Mount Everest before giving up/dying * Round 7: Who survives the longest against a Gorn in a cage match (standard wrestling cage).  * **DIPLOMACY** * Round 8: A series of debates on ethical issues * Round 9: Best handling of an accidental first contact with a primitive civilization (holodeck so each scenario is starts exactly the same)   * **MACKIN' ON SPACE BABES** * Round 10: Who can pick up the most people in one week.  * **BATTLE ROYALE** * Round 11: A series of 1v1 fights. No weapons, fight in standard TOS uniform. Takes place in a boxing arena. No rules, any fighting style, fight until one contender concedes or dies.  Tennis match, debates and battle royale are all round robin format. Everyone challenges everyone else with a point awarded for a win. Most points to least points to determine final winners of that category.  Edit: My Reddit formatting sucks, this will have to do :)   In Call of Cthulhu, he can't outrun a steamship, doesn't have any long range attacks (otherwise he would have blown up the steamship), I'm not sure if his wings are functional and he seems to be limited to physically attacking his targets with his hands and feet. His magic seems to be limited to resurrectiobn.,  I always pictured him as some all powerful reality bender (just based on how people talk about him), but it seems he would lose to any decent military, any moderately high tier superhero in a 1v1, or pretty much any of the major Kaiju, right?  or did I miss something (not at full power?)   Basically, what are the best non-canon Sherlock stories?  Also, bonus question: What's the most ridiculous Sherlock to be published by a serious publisher (not just some X-Men/Sherlock crossover fanfic where Sherlock nails Wolverine or some shit).   Looking for something to read and wondering if there are any good Trek novels. Any recs?   Did anyone find out what he was referencing here? Also, this implies that there actually is an 'official' way Sherlock faked his death, right?  Edit: I'm assuming the airbag explanation was a joke, but assuming it's the real one, I'm still interested to know what the missed clue was.      Are there any missables I should take note of in the Witcher 2? For example, the smithy in Flotsam sells a lot of cool diagrams, are they worth buying up now for later use? Or will I always be able to get the diagrams?  What about missable quest arcs?               No weapons, no armour, etc.  Just an all out brawl.   Basically, which classic rivalry (Sherlock vs Moriarty, The Joker vs Batman, Goku vs Vegeta, etc.) is the most one sided.  Try not to include matchups that are obviously one sided (like comedic relief villains) or small time/one off villains, I'm looking for classic matchups that spread over the life of franchises.   Vulcans, Klingons, Jem'hadar, Humans, Romulans, Cardassians and Gorn.  As I understand, Vulcans are the strongest. Even Vulcans who don't seem to actively engage in physical fitness seem to be very strong. I believe Sisko said a fit Vulcan is three times as strong as a fit human.  Apart from that, I've never quite known where everyone else sits. For example, Romulans are meant to be closely related to Vulcans, but they don't seem to have their intelligence or psychic powers, so is their physical strength at all similar?  Klingons are inconsistent. Some times they're taken down in batches by humans they outnumber, yet they're meant to be a fierce warrior race. On the flipside, there is an episode where B'ellana Torres beats a Vulcan in a fight, despite B'ellena not being 100% Klingon or a combat specialist (and looking much scrawnier than the average Vulcan), while the Vulcan was in a rage. Now he may have just been a particularly weak Vulcan, but he certainly didn't seem to be. Apart from that instance, I've always seen their reputation as warrior having more to do with their relentlessness than their actual strength, with them being roughly on par with humans in all aspects bar durability (redundant organs etc).  Jem'hadar are genetically designed to be a super warrior species, but they don't seem any stronger than humans or Klingons. Meanwhile, Gorn are stronger than humans, but slower, meaning a fight could go either way (maybe if Kirk were a boxer he might have been able to outmaneuver and beat the Gorn down?). Also are they stronger than Vulcans?   Cardassians seem like a wildcard.  Am I on the mark with most of this? Is there an official power ranking index or something (like how Marvel ranks their characters out of 7(?) in categories such as intelligence, strength, powers, etc.)?   Who comes 1st, 2nd and 3rd? Who goes the largest sum in Final Jeopardy?      Excuse me if I'm getting some details wrong, I haven't seen Voyager since it's original run. Anyway... What limits are there on the Q's power? What is the source of their power?  For example, in "Death Wish" we see Quinn actually transport Voyager to the time of the big bang (and, if I recall correctly, they were 'outside' of it witnessing it, which means Q's powers transcend the very reality they were originally a species of), could will people in and out of existence and all other matter of seemingly omnipotent feats.  However, in The Q and the Grey, the Voyager crew use the Q weapons against the Q, implying that the most powerful tools available to the Q are independent of themselves (not innate, like a God) and can be interacted with by any physical being. So this raises a bunch of questions:  1) Do the Q still have innate powers in addition to their weapons? If not, how did Quinn manage to use the Q weapons despite being exiled? If so, how do they compare?  2) Where are these weapons/tools located?  3) Does this extend to all (seemingly) omnipotent Star Trek races?  4) Are the Q physical entities using these weapons from a remote location, or have they 'transcended' beyond physical form? If the latter, how did Q intend to incorporate physical DNA into a non-physical entity.  I'm sure a lot of these questions are unanswerable, but the Q were always one of my favorite species and I hated the treatment they got on Voyager and thought maybe there's some canonical explanations I've overlooked for some of these questions.   I still prefer mouse+keyboard for the most part, but there are a few games where I like to whip out my PS3 control (Dark Souls, Castle Crashers, Batman: Arkham series to name the games from this year) and it would be a nice option to be able to play these on my television.  So basically what should I know before I buy a new TV? Can someone post some estimated minimum specs for running, say, Dark Souls II at max on a 50in?      Wasn't even on the front page yesterday (unless I overlooked it) now it's number 1. I usually only see this sort of surge during tournaments, but there doesn't seem to be one running.   Anything similar to any of his albums, I feel like I've listened to them all 1,000 times and love them all.   Just played my 9th game of online matchmaking, I'm bronze league. Just got placed against a guy who stomped me. I checked his profile after: 1999 career games, has been placed in diamond league repeatedly in the past. I've played against several silver and gold players as well.  Why am I being matched against players like this? What's the point of the leagues if I get matched against players outside of them? The game is a lot of fun, and playing against more experienced players will probably help me learn faster, but doesn't it kind of make a lot of games a complete stomp? Or do I just need to play more to get placed in a more reliable bracket?      I've just started playing, is there a particular order I should learn the races in? I feel the Protoss are probably the easiest, but I find them to be a bit boring, but I don't think my macro is good enough yet to use the Zerg. Humans seem easiest after Protoss.  I'm going to look at some beginner Zerg guides, but should I just stick to getting used to the game through Protoss first? Or is it OK for a beginner to just jump right in to any race?   Particularly want to hear from Uni lecturers/TA's.      Particularly, the thumb pads. I really was never a fan of touchscreen devices because they lack tactile features and feel a tad more unwieldy.         So my brother is overseas at the moment and I wanted to get him some Steam games so we can play together for Christmas. Thing is, I already mailed his physical present to him before I got this idea, and 7 days from XMas is too short notice to get another to him. So I thought of doing it digitally. But instead of buying him a game, I thought I could just gift $50 to spend as he pleases.  Is there an option to just fill someone's Steam wallet with a message like you would get if you sent them a game?   I understand this is an Alpha, so please don't confuse this with complaining - I'm just genuinely curious to know if there's more to the game than I'm seeing.  So far, I've just run around an empty landscape, occasionally bumping into other players who do very little before wandering off. I have played for 40 minutes and have encountered two zombies - both of which just stood still clawing at the air. This was on two different servers. Every house I explore seems completely empty, there is next to nothing to interact with except for looting bodies (which means nothing because there are no zombies to use the loot against) and opening doors.  I understand I have to eat and drink, but I don't really want to play a game that revolves around wandering aimlessly until I'm thirsty.  I thought maybe the zombies would get more aggressive the more I played, but that makes little sense considering I'm playing on shared servers of 40 people.  Are these just garbage servers? Or is this a common first experience with Dayz?  I fully intend to give it another shot tomorrow, but I'm still just not sure what to expect - if anything.         It just seems like a bunch of aimless posts of creepy pictures and 'clever' sayings.                  I'm currently watching G-League on the lowest graphics setting and still getting hiccups. I never have issues with any other video or streaming services, but using Twitch is just aggravating. Even switching graphics quality can take 10 minutes with multiple page refreshers because the damn thing doesn't load half the time.  So are there any alternatives for streams outside the Dota client? Or do casters stream solely through Twitch?   In this position here: http://imgur.com/mROv9I7  is it a good trade to take the Knight and follow up by taking the other pawn? In other words, is it worth trading my Bishop for a pawn and a Knight?  I rarely play Chess, but over the past week I've been getting hooked, and I've been doing that trade as much as possible, because hey, two pieces for one. But I'm still unsure if the Bishop has equal value to a Knight or not, or if that center pawn is really even that big of a deal early on.  Also if there's a better place for Chess noobs to ask questions, mind directing me there?      Hey fitness.  I started running a month and a bit back to get into shape. At first, I would do one hour sessions with great physical difficulty, but no real mental difficulty. However, after the initial 'feel good' of finally getting into exercise wore off, I started to get really bored while running. I used to go just about every day of the week for an hour, now, while I still get out for a run every day, some sessions are as short as 10 minutes. I just start counting the minutes, completely mind numbingly bored. I still look FORWARD to running each day, so my motivation is still there somewhere, it's just when I'm actually on my run that I just want it to end.  Tried listening to music, but I find it gives me headaches having my earphones in for extended periods every damn day, and music isn't really something I can listen to unless I'm in the mood to really get into an album anyway.  tl;dr: Running is boring, how do I keep myself from going braindead through extended sessions.      Alien autopsy videos, personal stories, pictures, etc all welcome.  No need to get into much of a debate over whether this stuff is real or not, I don't believe in any of that stuff myself. I'm just interested in seeing what it took others to be convinced.   Is there any real need for a cover up?   What are the best movies that deal with the possibilities of Alien life? I'm looking for stuff that isn't quite so focused on horror or action, although I wouldn't be against that sort of stuff.  To give an idea, stuff like Contact that deals more with the impact a discovery like that would have on society, or 2001: ASO that keeps the aliens more 'mysterious'. But really, any suggestions are fine. Preferably obscure as I've likely already seen all the bigger stuff.   Does music make it easier to get off?   The slingshot around the sun to travel time trick: seems relatively simple for what it accomplishes. How did this go unabused throughout all of Trek history, especially from TNG onwards where more powerful ships would be able to achieve the feat even easier.   I've read a couple of posts about nerfing Midas considering it's current popularity, but I'd rather not see the item itself get a direct nerf. Instead, how would you feel about the following changes:  * Midas now limited to two per game per team * Store starts with one Midas * A new Midas is made available 8 minutes after the first is purchased the first  The effects of the change: No more Midas gaming. You now have to decide which two of your heroes get the benefit of Midas, encouraging more team decision making. Additionally, the timing of your team's first Midas affects how quickly you can get your second Midas, making first Midas timing more crucial.  What other changes could be made instead? Or is Midas overrated and not actually in need of a nerf (just another fad)?   I just finished reading this post http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=132837823  now I've heard of the Deep Web before, but I always just assumed it was nothing more than a general term for website that were overlooked by search engines due to being low priority, however the post has confused my understanding of it.  So what exactly is the 'deep web' and how can I access it? Also, are the claims about the Deep Web in that post accurate? Especially the stuff about being watched by authorities? It makes it sound like every user of the Deep Web is some shady hacker or nutjob who will just randomly aim to ruin my life for simply browsing the web. Like an Internet Cartel or something...   So, with all the drama of the Netolic league and previous leagues reportedly not fully paying their casters, item creators or rewards to teams (TPL), I got to wondering what kind of quality control Valve has for tournaments.   Ticket sales are obviously a huge source of revenue for tournament organizers, so I imagine a lot of this drama would end if Valve were to be a bit harsher on organizers mishandling tournaments. Does anyone know how easy it is to get a tournament ticket into the Valve store and what kind of regulation they have in place?   Here's an idea: gems that track records for single games instead of cumulative values. Throw a "Most Last Hits" or "Quickest BattleFury" gem on any of Antimage's items and keep track of your records. If you break your record, it could be informed to everyone on the scoreboard at the end of the game. There are, of course, some obvious downsides such as people deliberately drawing games out in order to beat old records, so maybe some care would have to be taken when selecting types of records to track in order to prevent the system being gamed.  For fun, some more examples:  Weaver: Lowest HP on timelapse  Pudge: Best Hook Hit to Miss Ratio (must throw at least 15 hooks in the game), Most Self Denies  Bounty Hunter: Most track gold  General: Most Kills, Assists, Roshan's, wards placed, etc in a single game, quickest time to hit level 25, least kills in a game you won, Most last hits in first x minutes of game, quickest time to take a tower, quickest time to win a game  and so on.   Without spoiling anything other than what I am about to ask, what season do they start appearing on screen? Also do they begin to appear frequently, or is it just the occasional once off? Are the aliens all of the same race?   Currently watching Speed Gaming VS DK Game 2 (slight spoilers) and I'm currently looking at 6 Midas' in the game right now.  Why is a 14 minute Midas on Alchemist acceptable in this patch? Why is  Midas a priority for supports instead of quick Mek's? I understand Midas' being more popular in the current patch because higher passive gold means you can reliably get it sooner and more quickly recover your forgone early game after getting a Midas, but is the passive gold gain really enough to explain getting multiple Midas' on the same team and getting Midas' as late as we're seeing?  Are there other aspects of this patch that benefit mass Midas?   The wiki page mentions that the PC release date was delayed, but the sidebar doesn't distinguish between PC, PS3 and X360 release dates. Does anyone know if they are the same?  	163

  Nope. I have heard of some terrible "get 'em any way you can" anecdotes (such as barring entry onto sports teams until they take a 'special bath'), but always within the context of such practices being morally reprehensible.

Out of the blue, the captain made a startling announcement,  "Folks, it seems as though we are having some engine troubles. Now please remain calm, and we'll have an update in 15 minutes."  Obviously everyone is freaking out. 15 minutes go by. Captain makes another announcement.  "Ok seems as though one of our engines has failed. We are going to make a landing at the nearest airstrip. We'll give you another update in 15 minutes."  People are still freaking out. Another 15 minutes go by. Captain makes his announcement.  "It seems as though the second engine has failed and we're losing altitude quickly. We will be throwing out the luggage to lighten our load. Hopefully this helps our situation."  Utter pandaemonium in the cabin. The captain's voice hushes the people.  "It seems as though we are still quickly losing altitude. We do have emergency parachutes, but only enough for a certain amount of passengers. Now to be fair, we will call upon passengers alphabetically. If your group is not called, then you will receive a parachute. Sound good?"  The passengers begrudgingly agree.  "Now, A, will all the Africans please raise your hand."  No one moves a muscle.  "Ok... B, will all the blacks please raise your hand."  Again, no one moves.  "Fine, C, will all the Coloreds raise your hand."  Still, no body raises their hands.

As a child growing up, it's hard feeling comfortable in your own skin because everyone else around you seems so normal, and ironically being social and making close friendships with other guys, just makes you feel further alienated and alone.  So the conversation, "I can change", "I can get cured", "This is happening for such and such reason", replay over and over again in your young, still developing brain. Then the delusion sets in of, "Well, what if I woke up one morning, and *BAM*, I was only attracted to chicks." It's a sick fantasy I held on to, almost until I came out.  My answer? I would of probably tried to make it national news, and get other people cured as well. Why let others suffer internally if there was a way out?

 Yeah, a little. Like holding pennies in your mouth.   First, the whole Betsy Ross thing...probably false. She didn't design the flag, and certainly didn't sew it in front of the fire at the old home place. (She did sew Navy flags, and she may have had some business is manufacturing flags, but their is no evidece of this, other than anecdotal.)  The first "American" flag was probably the Continental Colours, which flew over Washington's Boston headquaters in the early years of the Revolutionary War. (This version of the flag was the first to be "recognized" as the flag of the United Colonies when on November 16, 1776, the American warship, Andrew Doria, saluted a Dutch fort in the West Indies and was saluted in return.   The first official national flag, also known as the Stars and Stripes, was approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777.  After Vermont and Kentucky were admitted to the Union, two more stripes and two more stars were added to the flag. This is the "Star spangled banner" that Francis Scott Key saw that inspired him to write the song.  In 1818, after five more states had gained admittance, Congress passed legislation fixing the number of stripes at 13 and requiring that the number of stars equal the number of states.  By law, adding PR as a state will require an additional star to the US flag. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States#Future_of_the_flag) are a few of the possible designs for a 51 star flag. (Also a good wiki article on the US flag.)

You didn't let him in on the pregnancy, and you didn't want his input on your abortion...telling him now will result in either a "WTF? Who are you again?" moment, or a great deal of emotional distress. Leave it be.   Hmmm. I need one of these. To teach my dog how to do something. You know, something.    I'm glad you circled it...I was so amazed by the 500% return on penny stocks that I totally didn't notice the FRACKIN' DEMON BABY WITH FOUR EYES!!   New Smyrna is Volusia Co.   Currently ambivilent, but if I found out that any of our local ptp courses were slowing down course development, I would change my mind quicklike.  We've got a nice blend here on the East Coast of Florida...most local courses are freebies (Daytona Beach area). Inland, we've got Bill Frederick's Park...not a traditional ptp, but you have to pay to get in the park, so...it is. But in trade you get two extremely well taken care of courses, an on-site pro shop, plus the park itself is outstanding. (You talk about undesireables...BF Park does keep out the undesireables...no homeless, no school skippin' kids...not a bad trade for the five bucks or less it costs to get in!)  Nearby we also have an Executive DGC. It's true PTP, around 10 bucks if I remember, but again, you get what you pay for. This course is attached to a ball golf course, so with pay you get access to the club house, the bar, you can rent golf carts, they have a beverage cart (BEER GIRL!!!) My only complaint about that course is the lack of improvements...it's still in its "Just opened" state...but still...BEER GIRL!!!.   Done. I hate facebook.   LyinRyan kinda looks like Anthony Hopkins' younger weirder brother.   I'm a big talker, and very opinionated, and suffered from coming off as an aggressive prick for a while. I learned to change. Here's what I did.  -First, tone of voice. There's an in-between being loud and confident and diffident and standoffish. Use a smooth voice, dampen your inflection, ask more questions, and keep your sentences and your point short. Don't interrupt. And listen, and show that you're listening by making eye contact, and nodding where appropriate.  -Second, correcting someone is one of the hardest things to do without seeming like a total ass. I learned to tell when I needed to correct someone, and when I just wanted to. The best way to not come off as a dick when correcting people, is to stop doing it when it's just not that important.  Third, and most important, is body language. Watch what you do with your hands, don't make aggressive movements. Keep your stance open, be aware of what faces that you're making. When you can learn to control the message your body sends, it becomes easy to become an entertaining master of information and knowledge, without people hating you for being smarter than them.   Sister Hazel - All for you...in my ass.   Is that a cow, or Fozzie the Bear?   Let me tell you why you're not:  You're in college right now. You've picked a major, and still find time to be active in sports. Even with that dense schedule, you're maintaining a GPA of almost 3.0. You're so motivated in your physical fitness that you sometimes overextend yourself and make yourself late. Even then, you make time to get to your class, and then when your prof gives you hell for being late, you have enough pride in yourself, even in a class you don't care about, to feel bad for not meeting basic expectations. You're some combination of lucky/skilled/smart enough to have your tuition paid for, along with some living expenses. You have parents that are willing and able to help you with rooming expenses, and prideful enough to feel bad about needing their help. You have tried to lessen their financial burden by taking in roommates when you could. You are going to graduate college soon, and hope to apply to the California Teaching Credential Program. You look forward to having some time to go to work for yourself, and to spend some of your own money to further lessen the burden on your parents (who, by the way, know enough to not let you burden yourself with a student loan, which will follow you for half of forever). Anyways, long story short, you wish that you could be a little more self reliant, and wish that you could show your parents just a little bit more success in return for their investment, and recognize how lucky you are when there are so many around you that don't have it quite so well.  So. First, tell you parents thank you. Heartfelt. Let them know how much their help means to you.  Second, Step up your game just a bit. From what you've said here, you're doing better than a lot of the kids I went to college with.  Third, if you really feel bad about other students not having the tools to succeed, try some volunteer work, change what little bit of the world that you can change, and take joy in that change.  tl;dr Man the fuck up, do a good job, and call your mom.   Nah, the world has enough whiny bass players.   Practice, practice, practice.  Pick a song that you know really well on guitar. Make it easy on yourself, and go with something not hard. Four chords and a chorus, you know. And just practice it, over and over again.  The biggest thing is to train yourself to not quit when you flub. Keep going, play the whole song. Eventually, you will become accustomed to doing both at the same time, and it will become easier for you, but you will have to continue practicing, forever.   Run Ronnie Run is retarded funny. David Cross/Bob Odenkirk and the gang from Mr. Show. Too. Freakin'. Funny.    Though Mandy's bit is just a cameo, but it sums up the plot of the movie fairly well.   [Here ya go, watch this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3JUpQzOek)...from Run Ronnie Run, an awesome movie, in which Mandy has a small, but important, part.   Best way to get over a girl is to get under a new one.     Greetings from the NSB!  Are you familiar with the story of the Tampa Monkey? (Monkey on the loose in the Tampa area for a couple of years now...making WC look a little silly in their attempts to catch).   And better question...how do we learn to live with our animal neighbors? How many of these animals are actually dangerous and how many are being removed for just being a nuisance?   Powder up!   I'm a Florida flinger, so I know something about hotballrash. First, keep 'em dry. Starts out of the shower...don't put your britches on wet balls. Dry 'em first.  Powder up! Especially if you're wearing drawers that rub that upper-thigh area. Bring some powder with you, and address as necessary. And remember...Talcum before it hurts, cornstarch after it's too late! And stay away from that medicinal Gold Bond shit...it's like thousands of angry ice-elves prospecting for gold on your sack. Terrible.  Drawer choice. Believe it or not, throwing down here in the heat, and the humidity, I wear board shorts...with those crazy net underwear sown in...and I never have the sackrash. Never. Might try it out, it's a little uncomfortable for the distance you'll be walking, but that shit keeps the old meat and two veg nice and airy...and airy means dry...and dry balls are happy balls.   There are plenty of recipes out there that you can search up, and I'm sure someone will come along and help you, but let me tell you what I do when I'm heavy a bunch of seasonal fruit.  Make flavored simple syrups. 1 cup of fruit, smashed, pitted, and peeled, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/3 or so cup of water. Cook. Strain. Store cold. Lasts for a couple of weeks. Use it in fruit drinks, cocktails, dessert recipes. If you have a ridiculous amount, put some in ice trays, cover with plastic wrap, and store in the freezer. Use in recipes as needed.  Also, make and freeze mashed fruit. Store in icetrays as above. Throw in fruit recipes.  Happy baking!   Puckered-Ass-Conservative?     Well, he seems pretty angry, and willing to disregard the positive aspects of the United States, but if you rewrote what he said in a way that he didn't seem like he was foaming at the mouth, a lot of what he said would ring true. We Americans, on the whole, are terribly mis- and uninformed about our country and its policies.  The major difference that I have with the poster is that I still believe that America can change...but I have to admit that I am losing hope.   Light is different when there is no atmosphere. Both Earth and Mars have one. The conspiracy that the moon landing was faked has been debunked enough times already.    I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.   I just recently read the wiki article about EHS. I had no idea what to call what was happening in my head. I haven't had any occurances in the past couple years...only thing that I've really done different was that I improved my overall diet (I'm getting older). The last event that I had, I truly thought that I was having a stroke or something. Most times single events last less than a second real time, but are hard to judge "feel-time", but the last one went on for more than that. Very scary.   Have you been officially diagnosed, or is this a self-diagnosis? And how often are these "attacks" happening to you?    Pooping boob-dicks? Meh. But thanks for the new screen name for my next throw away.   I love the Gipsy Kings. Turned on to them from their cover of Hotel California featured on the Big Lebowski soundtrack.    Yoga pants. Oh, and long socks. Freakin' love em.   Is that really that bad? I take my boy out of school on occasion...sometimes for cool sciencey things like the (RIP) shuttle launches, sometimes just to spend some time together.  Then I saw that they were from Live Oak. If that means FL, then never mind, bunch o' inbred meat necks up there.   I would have sworn the answer was going to be "Potato!"   Lock your shit. Besides, it was raining.  Oh yeah, I forgot....  * In the rain.   * Work  * Taco Bell Drive-thru  * Church  * Church, during a wedding  * Church, after a funeral  * Public Library  * Private Library  * Your mom's house  * My car  * Your car  * The mall  * On top of an antenna tower  * Circus  * Carnival ride (Gravitron)  * Waiting in line at the post office  * Star Wars Celebration VI at Disney World  * Hospital  * Mental Hospital  * On a bus.

Cool place, a converted drive in theatre, if you're into that sort of thing.   If she's well-read, she'll know the book, and approve it for you. Tell her one of your parent's recommended it.   Alas, Babylon.  There was a movie made of it, but it's so obscure and terrible that I think you can dodge that one.  It's got adventure. It's a captivating read. And fascinating, when taken in the context of it being written in the 1950's. (1959)  I won't ruin much of it, but it was written during the height of the cold war. Nuclear exchange was starting to be a daily concern between the US and the USSR. The story basically concerns a group of survivors, and the run up to a thermonuclear weapon exchange between two superpowers.   This book is technically classified as a YA (young adult) fiction, but I've read and re-read this book, and it stands up to be good at my (advanced) age.  Easy read for people that don't read recreationally, and for more intelligent people, it provides an insight into the fears that Americans were feeling during the cold war. Even if you don't do the report on it, pick it up and read it. It's good.  [Here's the Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alas,_Babylon)  [And here's the Sparks](http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/alas/)   Absolutely! My SO would love one, and love feedback! In fact, I'm a terrible musician, so I know feedback really well! No, really, I want to help...PM on the way.   BBQ sauce, sub maple syrup for some of the brown sugar.  Glaze smoked sausages on the grill. (Works for just about any meat. Maple glazed chicken breasts are freaky good!)  Sub for honey in just about any recipe.   It was a long wait, say true.    Yeah, of course, but there is no support for that, just acknowledgment of the power of 19.   The bigger issue for me is the rushed feeling of the ending...that nothing was fleshed out; like King woke up one morning and said to himself "OHHH! He'll just have to go through it again! I can finally end this thing!"   I hear you on Mordred: The whole last half of the final book felt rushed to me. It might be the way that I read the series. In order, as they were released. Yes, I waited the decade+ to find out what happened with Blaine.  King talks about how this story insisted itself, addressing it both in the fiction, and in many speaking engagements and TV shows he's done. You can almost tell that the end of the last book is done like yanking a splinter out: you've done all the work, got everything ready, and the only thing left is the one hard yank to get the fucker out. That's what the last book feels like to me.  More specifically, and I may be in the minority here, but I hated the ending. I get it, I get it, he had the horn the second time, there's a chance for redemption, but it doesn't address *why* he has the horn this time, how many times this has happened, and along with feeling rushed, it also feels like cheating. "Ka is a wheel, motherfuckers...HA!"    LPT: Go to the hospital when you get salmonella.   At that point, I really didn't know that others existed...lol. Also, great course. Tom Brown park in Tallahassee. Look it up on dgcoursereview.com. Only a few pics up, but such a great place to play.    I played just one course for about ten of those. Moved, found more courses. Adding two more this upcoming week when I go on vacation.    Love Chunnel.  Punta Gorda.  Taco. Taco Supreme.  Mumble Pants.  Oyster Gulch.  Ham Wallet.  Easy Bake Oven.  Las Cooches, New Mexico.  Banana Box.  Cock Sock.  All You Can Eat Fish Buffet.  Lawrence of A Labia.  Sprunt.   Fifteen years, five different courses, no aces. I feel your pain.  The closest I ever came was the one and only time that I ever played by myself. At the very least my wife comes with me. Short hole, trees to the right, about 141 feet. Beautiful slight S curve and bumps the chains on the way by.  The only thing that I could think was that if I did ace it, who would I tell? There was no one there. Sure, my friends would believe me, but if a disc aces in the park and there's no one there to witness it, did it really *really* happen?   FOH restaurant manager here.  Get an order book and pen. Use them as props when talking to people and not ordering. (Also a great place to put crib notes about daily specials, drink ingredients, prices, etc.)  Never cross your arms or put your hands in your pocket. Never itch. Never touch your face. If the book thing doesn't work for you, cross your hands behind your back.  Got trouble with eye contact? Look at the end of their nose, or their eyebrows. More comfortable for you, barely noticable for them.  Read up on body language...much of what you do tableside is being picked up subconciously by your customers. Confident servers make more money. If you can't be confident, you must learn to fake confidence.  Take care of your hands. Make sure they are clean. Pay attention to your fingernails. Don't wear flashy jewelry, or clanky bracelets. If you have to have a band-aid on, make sure it stays clean, and is either very un-noticeable, or over the top goofy (like disney characters or camo or something) to make it a conversation piece.  Smile, unless your teeth are in bad shape. In that case, grin.  Be aware of your tone when talking to customers. Assume the role of butler. Always say "Yes" never say "Ya". Don't call a group of two women "guys".   Act like you like your job. Leave the stress in the wait station or the kitchen.  Never talk about money (outside of item prices) with a customer. Never tell them how broke you are. And never ever talk about restaurant politics to a customer.  Have fun!   I love the [Where's George](http://www.wheresgeorge.com/) currency tracking project...but I sorta thought I was the only one leaving creative bill notes...:(   Try [votesmart.org](http://votesmart.org/), also check out [this site for current congressional votes](http://congress.org/congressorg/dbq/issuesdbq/votesearch.dbq) and [this site for current Senatorial votes](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm).  The short answer is that it's not made easy for us to know what they are voting for...it's almost like they don't want us to know. Also, if you can find a special interest group that shares your beliefs and interests, visit their page often for info. Single issue sites like NORML.org for marijuana legislation, or Greenpeace for eco issues, etc. Also, I like to visit sites that I don't agree with, just to see what each side is watching or pushing. Lefty sides like moveon.org, and righty sites like The Heritage Foundation, at heritage.org.   Wow. Welcome to American politics.  First, don't believe anything that the candidates tell you. What they are doing this election cycle is nothing more than advertising, and it is just as false and misleading as product/service advertising is.  Second, there are way more than two candidates. Don't believe people when they say that when you vote for a third party candidate that you waste your vote; politicians only care about getting *your* vote (or the vote from the larger group of people that is representational of your beliefs/needs/goals/interests)...if they see that a third party candidate is getting some traction from the voters, they will find out why, craft a deliberately thought out opinion about those matters that drove people to that third candidate, and adopt those beliefs as there own as soon as possible.  Third. Do your research. See how the candidates have voted on issues in the past. Pay attention to how often the candidates change their core message for special interest groups. Google is your friend here...stay away from campaign sites and special interest sites, and try to follow the money whenever you can. Each candidate is deep in the pocket of somebody, try and find out who.  Fourth. Don't believe that any candidate wraps themselves in the ol' red white and blue because they are a patriot...most of them are in it for the money, or for the power, at least at the national level, and most of them owe favors to someone, or ones. When you vote for a candidate, you vote in the favors that he/she owes.  Fifth. Dig deeper. Go to your supervisor of elections site, and request a sample ballot. Each election you vote on many different issues. You may have local, state, or national judges to vote for. You may have local, state, or national laws to vote for. Don't get caught with your pants down. If you don't know about an issue, or a candidate, leave it blank...don't vote for the name you like, or the party you like, just beacuse you're uninformed. Best to leave it blank if you don't know.  Sixth. Go early on election day. Don't cause trouble, stand in line, be prepared to show ID, some states require multiple ID, understand what the rules are before you go. No protesting/stumping for candidates in the polling station. Be quiet, wait your turn, be a good citizen, get your sticker, and get the hell out of the way.  Seventh. It's important enough to say again. RESEARCH. Some can be done from sites you trust. If you go to r/politics, you're going to be bombared with Obamadramarama. If you go to conservative or xtian websites, you're going get the Romneyfication.   MOST OF ALL...(all caps because this is really it) EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE CANDIDATE IS PROBABLY MISINFORMED, AND BELIEVES THAT THEY PERSONALLY WILL BENEFIT FRON THEIR CANDIDATE BEING ELECTED. You should just keep that in mind.  Good luck, and your vote counts, particiapation is important, and the best advice that I would give you is to participate in your *local* elections...you have more access, the issues are smaller and easier to understand, and they hit you directly at home...small town politics are still alive and well in America, and not so corrupted with special interests and massive monetary donations, and you can actually talk to your candidates, look them in the eye, and ask them what are they going to do for you, to make your life better.  Do your best, and remember...this country was founded on people who didn't stick to the rules, decided to make their own, and if we hadn't have won our Revolutionary war, would have been considered terroists as opposed to heroes, and would have been put to death for treason.  tl;dr...I love my country, I just think that we should see other people.   ...aaaannnndd the corn lobby is fighting hard to get HFCS relabeled as "Corn Sugar". Soon after that you can guarantee that their argument will be "Corn sugar is just another natural sugar...you don't require nutrition labels to differeniate between beet sugars and cane sugars, why should corn sugars be any different?"  AND THEY WILL WIN.   I'm working on a gluten-free menu for the restaurant currently. Even the suppliers don't know what's in their products. It's a freakin' nightmare.    Even that may be misleading. Products that contain *any amount* of real blueberries can lable their product "Made with real blueberries". What you won't realize is that by "blueberries" they literally mean that there were two blueberries in the entire batch, and the rest is colored and flavored gelatin or TVP, or some combination of the two.   Whilst smoking with some friends long ago, I had hit that point where I became part of the couch. I was too lazy to lean forward for the pass, so I stuck my shoe out to the dude handing it to me from a nearby chair. I had every intention of just bringing my foot closer to my hand, but apparently decided against it.  I flicked the toe of my shoe up, and that little smoky guy, about half way burned down, did a beautiful flip or forty-two through the air, and I just stuck out my hand, and caught it (just about) perfectly between my index and middle finger.  I was able to hit it, and then I enjoyed the stunned looks on my friends faces for a second or two before I completely lost it, running around the room, high-fiving, and exclaiming "DID YOU SEE THAT SHIT! ERMAGARD! THAT WAS SO FREAKIN' EPIC!!"   It's still hard to tell...the two biggest tells are the trumpet shape and the color. But the shape is shared by safflower...and the certification states that at some point someone went into that factory and saw what they thought was saffron...what's being produced there now could be a mix of true saffron and safflower, or something completely different.   Profit above all else...but most people don't see past the pictures on the front of the box.   I've been working with the Anaphalaxis Network on getting together some alternative menus for our guests with food allergies, and the one thing that I've learned that stands out is that if you are trying to limit or eliminate one macroingredient from your diet, it's damn near impossible. Things are misleading, mislabled, recipes change and the packaging doesn't...these people don't care about their customers, they just care about dollars...just dollars.   I don't regularly work with saffron, but was exposed to it in culinary school...to be honest, I don't remember the taste, other than that it had one, and it was good. What I remember most is the way that the color steeped into warm water; slowly, like tea in slow motion, but with no agitation or stirring, just yellowyorangred slowly swirling out of that little fiber. It was pretty cool.   I'm sure that there is someway around it that makes what they do, if not legal, then not exactly illegal.  I work in the supervisory side of food service nowadays, but I have a fascination with all things food related, specifically labeling, nutrition, and general food safety. The amount of misinformation that is allowed when it comes to food and ingredient identification should be terrifying to anyone who cares about what they eat.   If you can't taste your saffron, it's probably safflower. I don't know much about Costco's brands, but much of what's on the market as saffron nowadays, isn't.  Check out [this article](http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/food-wine/cooks-see-red-over-fake-saffron/story-e6frer56-1225935122839) from two years ago about the influx of fake saffron into the industry.   Also, all of you who just read this, said "Nyan" in your best Japanese accent to find out if this works or not.   Edit: Found [this](http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/animal.html) page of animal sounds in different languages.    Just tell him....most dudes love chicks that have fantastics about Haveing their butthold play/lick.   Step one: Insert penis somewhere tight, preferably moist.  Step two: Thrust.  Step three: Repeat as necessary.  Watch some porn, get some ideas, don't try anything to wacky, and let her take the lead if she will. Good luck, have fun.   Step one: Get a camera.  Step two: Take nakey nakey pics.  Step three: Post on r/gw  Step four: Include message..."I'll be glad to let you take more..."  Step five: Get over it, and enjoy the sweet sweet karma, and the attention from your bf.   ...and it was terrible. Except for Cap'n Lou Albano. He exuded awesome.   Quite a challenge if you don't want to spend money...lol. But a few pro tips from a Floridian that doesn't run his air very much.  Your house will be coolest in the morning. Capture that cool. Block windows with heavy drapes, keeps the sun out. Pay special attention to any windows that get direct sunlight. UV film or mirror film for your windows. If you have AC that's not working at optimum, check your filters, make sure your AC can breathe. To cool down one room, block the AC vents in other rooms by shutting them off, or sealing with plastic and duct tape. Block off any doors with hanging drapes as curtains. Invest in fans. Lots of them. If there is no breeze, don't open your windows. Maximize cross winds in your home. When wind is blowing from the east, open east and west facing windows. Long term, look into a window unit to assist your ailing AC until it can be repaired/replaced.   Who knew?    I'm a self-appointed ambassador of disc golf in my little beach town; I tell anyone and everyone about the sport, and have got dozens of people involved in the sport. (Next goal, a local course!)  Some of the things that people say when I tell them that I play disc golf crack me up.  Had an older lady the other day ask me what the club looked like...  ....the one we hit the "frisbee" with.   ....until I'm done with him.   Find a better guitarist.   Great idea, but I see how this could possibly backfire...   I love this man. Every thing he does just seems to ooze awesome. I wish he was coming closer to my home, but I'm calling the number, and letting him know that I will have booze and karaoke on the day that he's closest to me.  Though I do wonder if this is some sort of Bill prank? Gonna go around town laughing at all the people throwing parties with sheets out front of their house that say Bill Murry can crash here.   Looks interesting. We play Innova almost exclusively, just started checking out some of the other manufacturing companies. I've already got two kind disc golfers sending out discs for us, but I'll PM my addy for you, if you want to still send it...I'm no longer in dire need, though!    I've been furiously clicking away at the up button, but it will only let me orange it once. Trust us, we know how awesome he is...and hopefully we can find a way to reward him!   We actually looked at the Surge when we shopped for her Astra...only mistake that we made was the Astra at 171g was a little heavy for her, but she loved it. (More form than arm, you know.) I'll PM my address, if you can part with that Surge, and I don't think that she's thrown any of the other ones, but if you think that it would benefit a RHBH weak arm, send it on, and gracious appreciation will be yours!   In the spirit of the upcoming Arbitrary Day, I seek the help of my fellow Redditors and Discers.   My wife and I took a couple of friends out to beautiful [Tuscawilla Disc Golf Course](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98) to play a friendly round with a couple of our buddies.  You ever have that game where nothing really goes right? Or left? My wife had that game. And on the signature [hole #7](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=tuscawilla+disc+golf+hole+7 hl=en biw=1024 bih=616 tbm=isch tbnid=ZRm7d6vpuf3NeM: imgrefurl=http://discjag.blogspot.com/2009/07/tuscawilla-park-in-daytona-beach-fl.html docid=YgsrrwZ1FatbeM imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9MfYZehXfoI/SnIQEZEKecI/AAAAAAAAAOU/DNvOdVLAQXo/s400/tuscawilla_hole7_basket.jpg w=400 h=300 ei=Uz38T6aeFYWO8wSms-zcBg zoom=1 iact=hc vpx=282 vpy=114 dur=5281 hovh=194 hovw=259 tx=118 ty=117 sig=111693889434370404481 page=1 tbnh=131 tbnw=175 start=0 ndsp=15 ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:91) my wife put not one, but both of her drivers in the lake. A rare pink pro Beast, and her favorite Millenium Astra.  This park will recover discs, I think, but it could be awhile, months even, before they turn up in the local seller's trailer. (She does have name and number on them.) This leaves my wife without drivers to play...and we play two to three times a week.   So here's my problem...we're so broke lately we can't even pay attention...and I just don't know if I can free up the money to replace those discs. Maybe two weeks from now, I might be able to pick something up in a DX for her, but it will be a bit before I can get her some quality plastics again.  DG is such a great way for us to get out, and our kids love the time spent in the park, and it pains me to see my wife in such foul spirits after losing her two favorite discs, and not be able to do anything about it.  So here's my begging....if any of you have an extra driver laying around, something you're tired of seeing, or just a disc that you feel needs someone who will love it, learn with it, and try to keep it out of lakes, please PM me and let me know you can help.  I would be willing to reimburse shipping, but like I said before, we're way broke and it might be a minute, but I do pay my debts, or if you're interested in trade, my wife is quite the crafty one. (Here's some [bag tags](http://www.reddit.com/tb/vosw5) that we made for our little start up club.)....maybe we could work something out in trade?   At the very least, thanks for taking the time to listen to the lament of amateurs who can't keep their discs out of the water...lol. (I've been in that lake a time or two as well, but on the edge...she sank **both** of them in the middle.)  Happy discing!      Yeah...joking about the pics, it seemed a reddit-y thing to say.   Ceiling fan? Haven't tried that one...hmmm...plans for tonight have changed.   I'm glad you're going to talk to her. My wife is a big fan of note writing, maybe that would be a good way to handle this touchy subject.     You guys are close, go talk to her. Maybe she doesn't understand that not only is that gross and weird, but possibly unhealthy and dangerous.  You also said that she admired your toy, maybe she went out and bought the exact same one?  Either way, passive aggressive isn't going to work for this. Don't just lock it up or something, talk to her.  Oh, and pics, or it didn't happen?   It's a long running joke, because in a way, it's true.  But not inevitable. It comes from familiarity...and the male's desire to conquer as many different women as he can. (Show me the hottest chick on the planet, and I'll show you a dude who's tired of boning her.) There is no challenge, no chase, to having sex with the woman who shares your bed for ten years, twenty years, fifty years.  You can beat it, by staying creative, and making sure that you communicate about sex with your SO. The wife and I have been looking at each other's nakey nakeyness for over a decade, and she still turns me on...because she knows how to; because she knows me.     The baby was fine, believe it or not, injured, but okay. I did hear that one old man passed away from injuries, but all the reports are still saying that no one died.  This was pretty big news in my part of FL. This happened about a half hour north from us, and just two weeks before, [Another Publix got hit by a small airplane](http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/west-volusia/2012/04/03/plane-hits-deland-publix.html), and that one is just a half hour west of us. Bad month for grocery stores.   That doesn't happen here in FL. The old zombies are all out driving around. I work in a touristy area of FL, really hip with the ancient wrinkly ones. In my town, the joke (it's only half a joke) is that you just don't take to the road around 7pm.  That's when happy hour ends, and the old drunk people drive back to their condos.  It's like a Nascar race in slow motion, but with more wrecks.  And people. And Publixes. Can't forget about the Publixes.   Not a waiting room...that's the entrance to a Publix supermarket in Palm Coast, FL.  We're known for our old ladies here in the FLA, and this was another one, who claimed that her accelerator "got stuck" and she couldn't stop as she plowed into the front doors of the joint.  Those people were hurt, but amazing enough, no one died.  [Here's a link to a local news story](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/04/woman-76-crashes-car-into-florida-market-injures-10/)    ....and Blingo was his name-o!   Answer 1: Learn how to come a lot, or become comfortable with other men involved.  Answer 2: My experience is that this is true. My SO and I don't keep score, but we break even. What's important is that it is fun and comfortable. Just make sure to show her how much you enjoy making her cum.   Well...that makes sense.    Awesome. Homemade and crafty stuff is the best!  And, just to note: pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta..   What's black and blue, and doesn't like anal?    The nine year old in my trunk.      There are eight of us playing once a week at our local course. Two of us have lots of experience and know the game well, and the rest have just been introduced to the game and are at varying skill levels, from intermediate to noob.   We want to introduce a little cash into the game. Here's where I need help. What sort of alternate games or scoring can we introduce to keep it fair for everyone?  We already have an ace fund (It's a short course, three holes less than 150') that rolls for the month. The first Thursday of the month we play a regular stroke game, with closest to pin taking the pot. Second Thursday, we play mixed draw doubles, winning team splits pot, and third Thursday we're thinking a handicapped tourney style. Help me out with one more type of disc golf game that doesn't favor the couple of exp players?  tl;dr I like words, don't judge me.   Is there a way that I can set a single cell, or range of cells, to multiply an entered value by x? I'm setting up an inventory sheet for a restaurant and I want to enter cases received, but need the number shown to represent a piece count.  Example: I receiced two cases of meat which contain 32 steaks each. I want the user to be able to enter the value "2" and return the value "64" to the same cell.            Not looking for Me First and The Gimme Gimmes version, I need Whitney's. I keep finding [this tab](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/w/whitney_houston/where_do_broken_hearts_go_tab.htm) on all my go-to tab sites, but I don't even know what that means! Help me, you guys!               So explain to me like I'm five, web_design. I think I have a great idea for a magazine style website. I've done my research, and I believe that there are a group of people out there that are under-represented on the internet, and I want to fill that gap.  Here's the problem.  I'm an idiot.  Not really, but I have no experience in this field, and not many people to talk to. So, before I go out into the development/hosting community with money in my hand, ready to be fleeced, I thought maybe you guys could answer some questions for me? Please?  WEB DESIGN:  I would like this website to contain articles, which I post monthly, and then archive. I would also like this website to have user generated content, like uploaded pics and videos, with commenting available. So...  * As someone with no experience in website design, is an off the shelf product like Dreamweaver or similar even something that I want to mess with? * If not, what should I be looking for from my web designer? Is this something that an amateur could do, or am I heading for one of the bigger design firms? * About what price range should I be expecting to pay for a design service?   WEB HOSTING:  I don't know much about this topic, and have got Google overload from trying to differentiate between all the companies out there. Obviously I want a host that is gonna give me good uptime, and they all claim to have great uptime. So...  * What's the difference from paying 9$ for one company and 23$ for another? * When talking to the hosting company, is the website that I described above considered one site with many pages, or many sites? * What about combo packages? I've seen several of the "brand name" companies offering design and hosting at one price? Good idea, or waste of time built specifically for suckers like me? * Is hosting something that I should be looking for from my designer?  WEBSITE MAINTENANCE:  I want to be able to post articles on a regular basis. Probably four sections, each updated monthly. I want to allow user uploaded content and comments. Again assuming that I don't know anything about how a website works...  * Are things like posting articles, allowing uploaded content, removing comments/uploaded content, etc...something that I should fully expect to be able to do on my own, or is this something that I will have to have help in, either from my designer or host? * What sort of other maintenance should I be expecting to do?    ADVERTISING/REVENUE:  Sure, we all want to make money right? I'd like to have a little revenue coming in.   * This website would be target-specific, so would something generic like Google Adsense work for this idea, or should I be contacting specific webmasters about advertising opportunities?  * Would like to have the ability to sell items related to the website on the site (not the main focus of the project)...cart it up on the page, or link out to some Etsy or Ebay page? * I understand that adding advertising on your site is just cutting and pasting code into your existing page...is this something that I can learn? How quickly, or how difficult for someone with little/no exp? Or is this something I have to have someone else do for me everytime I want to change ads on the site?  One more question about website registration...the name that I want is currently registered with GoDaddy, and not used. Expires in about six months. What happens after that expiration date? Is it open season on the domain name, and I can register it through my choice of domain registrys, or do I have to deal with the GoDaddy folks to try and capture that domain name?   You guys are awesome for even reading this far. I've gotten great help from Reddit in the past for all kinds of other issues, and I have no doubt that someone or ones out there can help me out a little bit. Ease my Google headache a little bit, and let me go into this sounding like I know what the hell I'm talking about.    Because my original santa didn't send anything by the deadline or attempt to message me about sending it late, I was rematched. Right away I received several messages from my rematch santa, and soon after that my gift was marked as shipped. However, the same day my rematch shipped my gift, I received another gift by UPS. It was from Amazon and included a gift note saying *Merry Christmas from Reddit Secret Santa.*   Now, I have confirmed with my rematch santa that these gifts are not from him, and the name on the gift note does not match my original santa's name (as confirmed by kickme444 through private messages). Also, my original santa hasn't marked anything as being shipped.  Santa, if you could come forward and reveal yourself that would sure help me out. I want to confirm this gift as received, however, if it isn't from my original santa, I don't want him/her getting credit for sending a gift they did not send. If it is from them, I don't want them getting banned for not sending a gift.   It is a really great gift, and I want the sender to know that it is GREATLY appreciated! Please come forward, Santa. You can even message me privately if you want. Thanks!     I learned this song in 04, and I don't remember it in D...does anybody know any different?          My buddy and I are getting together a very casual acoustic duo. In addition to several originals, we're trying to get together some good two part guitar, two part vocal songs...and we just can't think of very many to check out. So, wanna help us out? We're both dudes, with a strong mid-range vocal, and decent alto vocal. Guitar skill is medium and advanced, respectively. We're willing to check anything out, and comments with youtube or tab links will be upprecciated!      In response to this [video post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lubn3/cockroach_in_your_ear_nsfl/), I responded with this:   This actually happened to me.  I was staying at a friends house, and woke up with an absolutely horrible *scrabbling* sensation in my ear. I don't remember too much about the next couple of minutes, but my friend tells me that she heard me fumbling about in the bathroom, and came in to find me standing at the sink, amongst a scattering of used qtips, a spilled bottle of hydrogen peroxide, and holding a pair of scissors.  I don't really know what I was going to do with the scissors.  The roach, a little german guy, had climbed down (or had been forced down by my mishandled ministrations) well into my ear canal, and had run into my ear drum.  I wish I could explain what that sounds like. I have been telling this story for over a decade, and I've never been able to accurately explain how *alien*; how perfectly horrible that sound is.  And it was loud.  The bug would be still for a period of time, and then would start moving, and I would fall to the ground, truly writhing on the ground.  The girl lived close to the hospital, and we walked up to the emergency room. It was about 3am at this point, and we had to go to this walk-up window, and explain what was happening before they would let us in.  As I was explaining what had happened to me, that little fucker started doing his laderhosen dance on my eardrum, and I fell to my knees at the window, cracking my chin a good one on the counter on the way down.  When I got back to my feet, the receptionist lady asked me (not kidding)...."Is it really *bugging* you that bad?"  When I find her, I will kill her.  After getting into the ER, the doc came in, and took a look in my ear with the scope thingy. He explained that they were going to have to remove it manually, with forceps.  It took two orderlies and a security guard to hold me down.  The doc stretched my earhole out with some sort of spreader, (that hurt a lot) and went in after the bug. The bug saw him coming, and didn't want anything to do with the shiny metal things coming after it, and tried to go the other way...  **Into my brain.**  The doc finally got hold of the bug, and there was this feeling of *pulling*, and the sound...this horrible *stretching* sound, though that really doesn't do it justice, as the bug fought to remain in the nice new warm home that it had found.  The doc removed the bug from my ear...  *In pieces.*  He didn't want out. At all.  Long story short (too late?), a fairly serious infection that required me to spend a bit of time in the hospital, some minor damage to my ear drum and ear canal, some long term hearing loss...I still am not at 100% in that ear, 90% maybe, but not perfect...and a whole lot of alcoholic counseling over the next couple of years to get over the whole event.  Perfect story for halloween, and every word true. I slept with earplugs for quite a few years afterward...I eventually got over it; no paranoia about bugs, though I don't like to talk about it, and haven't thought of it in years.  Thought reddit might be interested in my story; ask away.            Not a lot like [Crichton's other work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#Works), other than the fact that the book was well researched and well written, [Pirate Latitudes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Latitudes) was discovered after Crichton's death. Wanna talk about this book?                                             It has come to our attention that the usage of *"Cutting the cheese"* as a euphemism for passing gas has declined sharply since the mid '80's. We are now involved in a program to have this phrase revitalized in the American lexicon. To aid in this effort, we have now declared that *"Gutting the fish"* will now be used as a lexicon for the vaginal queef.  Just please note that the following phrases are *still* acceptable when referring to the vaginal queef. (This list is **not** meant to be all-inclusive.)  * Panty Blaster * Blowfish * Vart, Varting * Bi-labial fricative  * Victoria's Secret  Thank you.  Dr. Doofensmirtz  Dept. of Humor               I responded by saying that I was gonna call mine "Inception" because it leaves you confused, and glad that it's over.                  It seems to me from reading all these great posts in this sub, that us CC's essentially fall into two categories...  * Those of us that are tired of the cable monopolies, and are working to find a way to watch televised entertainment on our own terms, and...  * Those of us who have recognized that TV watching is an addiction, and have used cordcutting to control this aspect of our lives.  Where do you fall, and do we deserve two different classifications of cordcutter?                    No earthquakes, no many-headed monsters, nothing. Hmm...   This law was tested in front of the [Supreme Court](http://supreme.justia.com/us/377/402/case.html) in June of 1964, and found to be unconstitutional.   This law was passed shortly after the [Monkey Trial](http://law.jrank.org/pages/2855/John-Thomas-Scopes-Trial-1925-Monkey-Trial-Darrow-Deflates-Bryan.html) where evolutionism was attacked. John Scopes was found to be guilty of violations of [The Butler Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Act), though John Scopes was not fined, and the courts eventually moved to find the Butler Act unconstitutional in 1967.    When my Grandmother died, she willed her property to me. My father was supposed to help out by monitoring the taxes on the land, and basically screwed us by not paying any of it.  Here's the quandry I'm having. My mother in law (a paralegal and "flipper") did some legwork and tells me the property is valued at $9600. (It's 2.4 acres in an undeveloped part of Northern Florida. It has a house on it, but the house is in serious disrepair.) She tells me that the total tax burden is $5400, and that if not paid by the end of the month, it will go to auction.  She offered me this deal. She would write the check for $5400 if I would put her on the deed. When I paid off the loan, she would switch the deed back to my name. Sounded a bit shady to me, and I know she's done some shady things, but she's never done me wrong.  I asked my wife to confirm these things for me, and she got on the horn with the tax office, and is told that we must make a payment of only $655 to pay off the back property taxes (Not paid since 2002) to prevent auction. She was also told that the total value of the property was $14500. The rest of the $5400 is "special assessment taxes" for 911 and such, that haven't ever been paid on the property, but that could be paid in installments.  My questions are...  Is my MIL trying to screw me? I don't know why she would lie to me...  Am I in danger of having the tax certs sold on that property if I don't pay the total tax burden of $5400?  Any help is appreciated. Thanks.    When my Grandmother died, she willed her property to me.

We told her about the $655 being the only thing that I need to pay to keep the property, and she's been freaking out...cajoling us, yelling, harassing phone calls, and screaming fights, telling us the only way is her way, even in the face of contradictory evidence. The only question now is what can I do to get the money together by the end of the month...I've got about half of it, and I'm rolling nickels to try and get the rest of it together! Wish me luck.            Let's discuss. Is this a good day in history that provided closure for the Vietnam era, or was this a cowardly move to forgive men not strong enough to fight?

[Dead at 63](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/05/obit.gerry.rafferty/index.html?hpt=T2)      I was unlucky enough to have to drive 95 north to 10 west in florida on Sunday, the day after all the bowl games here in the great state of Florida, and while driving, a couple of things occured to me.  If you have those really cool blue headlights, you are an asshole. Yes everyone can see you coming, but that's all they can see. You are blinding everyone else. High beams are for deserted country roads with no streetlights. Just because it gets a little misty in the evening in the Florida winter, doesn't mean you have to light the way like Jeebus himself. The left lane is known as the fast lane or hammer lane or passing lane for a reason. If you are in that lane, and people are passing you on the left, you are in the wrong fucking lane. Get over. If you approach a group of cars that are evenly spaced out, traveling safely, with the faster cars on the left, this is not an invitation for you to fulfill your nascar fantasies by zipping in and out of traffic. Slow the hell down, and join the flow. When it rains, slow the hell down. Especially if you are sporting crappy tires in an old beater. I'm talking to you SUV I saw fishtailing its way towards (what I thought would be) certain death, around exit 303 on I10 Try to remember that your car is several thousand pounds of steel, while you (and myself and my family) are just simply several pounds of meat. Safety has come a long way, but meat will still lose to steel at high speeds. And just a note to the SUV with GA tags, and all the Jeebus stickers. The way you were driving on 95 north made me think that you hoped Jeebus would see you safely to your destination. Whipping in and out of lanes, no blinkers; talking on the cellophone, kids in the back. I wished you good luck as you shot by, but I have to tell you, when I saw your SUV had gone off the shoulder and rolled, and all your possessions had been strewn across the highway for the world to see, I could not help but laugh my way to my destination. I was glad to see that you and your family were apparently unhurt, so maybe Jeebus was looking out for your car, but Karma was looking out for the rest of us.  Drive safe, redditors.

Wherever you're going, don't be dying to get there.     Let's get to work on this, reddit.   Instead I found [this](http://www.brunching.com/alanislyrics.html) and [this](http://www.song-lyrics-generator.org.uk/).   Cmon locals...who's going to the St auggie or NSB Beachside show? Any one going to Bear Creek this year?   Get a [taste](http://www.zachdeputy.com/) here if you are not yet familiar with his island-infused, drum n bass, gospel ninja soul music! See you there!    So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"     For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.     The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.     There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.     And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:  "In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"     Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.      Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote. Whether it's for a douchebag or a shit sandwich is yet to be determined.    .    So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"     For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.     The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.     There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.     And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:  "In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"     Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.      Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote. Whether it's for a douchebag or a shit sandwich is yet to be determined.    .   I know there are locals in this tourist heavy town. Let's not be overshadowed by r/orlando anymore!      I am contemplating leaving my steady job with the goal of total entertainment domination of the area in which I live. Karaoke, event DJ, live sound production/recording, and gigging as a one man band...any tips or warnings from those of you making a living in the industry?      Condensation will collect on a surface when it is colder than the air around it, correct? Trying to build a small(ish) collector with an output of around 1/2 oz per hour. Could I use a metal bowl shape to heat up a volume of air using solar heat so that condensation would collect on a small metal plate that is shaded by the bowl? Any ideas/help?    I'll post for a bit tonight, and then tomorrow afternoon when I come out of my anesthetic fog...   I've had this broke-ass tooth for six years, and I'm finally manning up and getting it taken care of. I'll answer questions about my monday-morning-molar-meltdown tonight, and then Monday afternoon when I am able to.         [Here's](http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2010/07/28/a-poignant-way-to-mark-911/) the story from The Independent.   The Dove World Outreach Center? Really? What sort of outreach is this?

We don't get to see or talk to them often. When we decided that we were getting married, we called him and told him that we needed an address to send him an invitation. His response was that he was "not aware that he needed one" and then contact has broken off. Have my wife and I mistakenly broken some sort of taboo? Never had any issue like this with him before, and he didn't come to the wedding, invitation or not.   Can you help? And, if we have done something taboo, how do we apologize?

I drove from Seattle down to Burien, then Kent, to Bellevue then Redmond then Issaquah. There are cops crawling everywhere - city cops, WSP, etc. Multiple cops and tons of pull-overs - What's the deal? Do they try to align when they do their quota hunting?   General impressions of the inspectorate and her as an individual or specific incidents welcome.  Regards,  Another Seattleite      This is even more of a long shot than the guy w/ the hit and run.  Some dick broke into my blue Corolla at a parking lot around this area. There was almost nothing of value in the car, but we'd left house keys in it so those got jacked. Front passenger window is missing also.  It occurred between 3:30 AM and 4:30 AM on 5/17 (probably closer to 3:30 since alarm wasn't blarin when I got to it). So any info from about that time if you were in the area could be helpful.  I'm going to hit the businesses up that operate around there tomorrow as well.   Can we get automod functionality to simply block off posts until accounts have accrued some age. When I look over a page of the sub these days, a disproportionate number of the requests now come from new throwaways, people who aren't even redditors.  When Kirk [put this sub together](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/jm1os/meta_about_the_creation_of_this_subreddit/), the purpose was to **help redditors**. It's quickly devolving into a haven for scammers. My concern isn't just that a bunch of new lenders aren't intelligent enough to read over the side bar - that's always existed, but w/ all the spam (that's effectively what it is) from accounts made within the last day or two, it becomes tedious to even find posts by **actual redditors**  Other subs where goods/capital are exchanged have used automod functionality for a long time to restrict based on objective qualifiers (karma, age, etc.).  And where this may not have been needed in the past, you don't need to look far to see how this sub's devolving.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/25uii2/meta_there_is_a_recent_post_on_another_site/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/25ogrj/meta_uloseritis_go_fuck_yourself/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/25pzi1/unpaid_u_hotelmoscow_100000/  /u/KerrickLong /u/happybadger /u/Sch1308   http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/22dz11/req_350_repay_400_by_may_20th_or_sooner_for_bills/   http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/22kp9y/req_another_320_repay_340_on_51614_great_creddit/                 ###Introduction  If you're thinking about lending, start here:  [/r/Loans Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/wiki/index)  The META posts in particular provide great information. Not all of the information there is entirely current though. This sub has grown a lot since those guides were written and scammers have become a lot more interested in the sub - meaning the average lender shouldn't assume good-will as easily on the part of the borrower.  In the course of lending, I've come up with my own verification strategies and copied some discussed in META tags here by others. I've attempted to consolidate everything having to do with verifying information into a single thread to make it easy to reference.         ###Social Media Verification  If they don't have social media, particularly Facebook, or they do and it's basically never been used, has barely any friends or has a ton of spam-account friends, or seems to have been made overnight, that's a red flag. Facebook is the primary extrinsic way for you to truly verify that they are the person whose photo ID they sent you. Go through the Facebook, make sure it's a couple of years old and the images match the photo ID believably. Have them friend you for the duration of the loan and also have them send you a message. It's vital that they add you themselves, or at least send you a message, since there are people who will add anyone.   ###Personal Image Verification  When you ask for images (proof of employment, drivers license, and so forth) ask for all of the following:  (1) Photo ID Close-up  (2) Proof of Employment Document  (3) Borrower holding photo ID  (4) Borrower holding a notecard w/ their Reddit username and date  (5) Borrower making a unique physical gesture  You obviously need to make sure the photo ID matches the name they're claiming and that the person in the photo ID has an uncanny resemblance to the person holding the ID.  An image of the individual holding a notecard or something to that effect with their username and the date (4) can be combined with also ask the user to make a unique hand gesture or to hold the card in a unique way *that only you* ask *your* borrowers. Having the individual hold a card w/ the date and username provides a physical watermark. This is entirely fool-proof however, as a reused image w/ a notecard can be easily photoshopped. A hand-gesture is much harder to photoshop and if the image clearly shows their arm fully connected to their body and what-have-you, it only gets tougher.  One real concern that's materialized itself is that scammers are able to use images nefariously gathered. By including a hand-gesture that other borrowers and lenders are unaware of, you make it difficult for a would-be scammer to simply pass off an acquired image as one taken at that moment. This is beneficial not just to you, but also to the community. If somebody receives an image from a potential borrower where the borrower is making a gesture that seems strange or of which they didn't even ask, they'll be inclined to inquire about it.   ###PayPal Verification  This has been brought up time and time again. Anybody can make a PayPal account, but by ensuring that you only lend to PayPal verified users, you can rest somewhat assured that PayPal has taken measures to verify their PayPal identity. A 10 year old PayPal Verified account is a lot more likely to be the person they're claiming to be than a one month old unverified account.  The process of ensuring PayPal verification is simple enough. Take the PayPal email address they've provided you and replace the portion with brackets ([email]) in the following URL:  https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=[email]   ###Phone Verification  (1) Once you've gotten their phone number, **have them leave you a voicemail**. If they don't use the phone number they provided you to begin with - that's a big red flag. They provided you with a bad initial phone number for a reason.  (2) Next, check the phone number they've provided you against the following site (or an alternative carrier lookup):  [Free Carrier Lookup](http://www.freecarrierlookup.com/)  Again, if it comes back as a strange carrier or VOIP number, that's another red flag. They're not providing you their physical/regular phone number for a reason.   ###Work Verification  Ask them where they work. Google their workplace, give them a call - ask them if they'd be comfortable with that before you do, if you prefer. It will save you a lot of heartache. I've had a borrower tell me they worked at a particular department store - even sending me paystubs. Their work story seemed strange since their Facebook was indicating a lot of free time. So I decided I'd give them a call at their work place. I came up with a quick story in case anybody asked why I was calling them at work, but I found out it was all for naught. They'd been fired a week ago, their bi-monthly paystub that I would normally take as proof that they're capable of repayment was meaningless.   ###Conclusion  A thorough verification process may mean that you're spending a few extra minutes making sure the information provided to you was legit. If you truly want to help people on this sub, take the necessary steps to ensure you're not just throwing your money into a black-hole. There are two types of people who default, people down on their luck and scammers. There will always be people down on their luck no matter how many verification steps you take. But we can work towards cleaning this place up of scammers - and the only way to do that is to *stop giving them money* even if it's "just a small amount." Best of luck!                                           Does somebody know if there are any established equations or models to predict how snow acts as it plummets towards the Earth? From my understanding, all rain starts off as snow/ice and becomes rain as it falls. My question is what role the mass of the snow/ice, and/or even where it originates in the sky, plays in it's disintegration as it plummets?

The amount however did not clear with the bank and since than he completely ceased communication and he decided to block me on Facebook.

I adopted BitCoin early on and used it (mostly for digital goods). After the insane speculation that's recently hit it, I'm really just holding nowadays. But I do believe BTC has a future where it's primary purpose will return to being a cyber-currency that people use for more than CE.  Anyways, one of the major problems with using BTC has been a lack of protection for your BTC. You don't know how your BTC are being handled by the other party, there are no third party audits or an en-forcible security standard. When companies go under (i.e. Silk Road, GBSE) or when their assets are frozen (MtGox), many people end up losing BTC they left with the host. Likewise, everybody knows about some of the major thefts/scams as well as the purely stupid executive failures.  The idea here is to have a pool of BTC that is used to (a) ensure that businesses that get on board adhere to particular security standards and (b) insure BTC used in transactions with said companies. I don't know if this falls under your typical startup since I want to move in the 501 (3) (c) direction once I can afford modest legal fees (or find a pro-bono lawyer). But that's the gist of it (more details on the site itself - the idea isn't 100% fleshed out yet).  Any help with finding some direction, resources or simple critique much appreciated.      I originally posted this as a [PAID] post but I modified it out of principle since it really isn't fully paid (insignificant as the defaulted amount may be).  Repayment was a bit late and communication was okay. I told the person to forego the interest in lieu of complete repayment of the principle. He was apologetic and has gotten ~97% of the principle back to me a month ago. 3.5% was not returned.   Amount was broken into two repayment dates. Missed 1st due date, missed second due date (to which first payment was rescheduled), missed another rescheduled due date and then completely broke contact. She made it clear that she paid rent with the money she was supposed to give to me the first - had plenty of money for celebrations and what-not but somehow couldn't afford to not steal from me. Not a dime sent in good faith at any point. Not communicative (I needed to proactively chase her down ea time).  The worst part was, I knew exactly how this would go down the same day I sent her the amount. Hours after sending the amount, somebody hit me up that this person approached them for an additional loan AFTER I granted mine, telling them I didnt give them the full amount they asked for (a lie). My spidey sense was going off, but it was too late. The other lender lucked out by not lending to this person.  I got my principle back at least (not from her of course) so that's always good.      http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1m5txi/req_need_a_loan_of_100_bucks_pay_back_130_im_sick/                              I just went through some of the various crowd-funding platforms using BitCoins - there's a ton within the first 3 results pages. But all the links I clicked seem pretty inactive (my point of comparison is KickStarter and IndieGoGo). Has that movement just not caught on as well in the BTC community?  Basically, I'm just wondering what the one or two successful platforms of this nature are - particularly if I am looking to deliver a physical good.  Within the next month, we're plan on launching our company which will sell the physical product for USD but also through BTC. Is there some online registries you guys can point me to as well where I can let people know, y'know, "WE TAKE BTC!!!".   I've known of BTC for a few years, but a front-page article rekindled my interest. Wondering what the best way is to restart (it was just cpu back in the day - do I just want to buy BTC or should I invest in new mining tools)? This has probably been asked a thousand times but I don't see anything too relevant in the first couple pages.   **Information about the Maximum amount people are willing to spend**   Average of Max Spend    $ 5.04    Max of Max Spend    $15.00    Min of Max Spend    $1.00       **Sample Size**  41      **At the Given price, assuming you liked the product, would you be a repeat customer?**  Definitely 11   Neutral 8   No way! 3   Probably 17   Probably not 2      **If you would be a repeat customer, how many units would you expect to buy a month?**  #Units      |     Responses in Range  [1 thru 5]         20   [6 thru 10]         8   [Over 10]           1      **Demographics**   Gender    Female 17   Male 22      **Age Range**   Age Range                |              Respondents in Range  [Between 18 and 26]                  33   [Between 26 and 35]                   3   [Less than 18]                            3   [Over 35] 2     **Results** Based on the results of this preliminary Reddit survey, our product wouldn't be saleable outside of our niche given our tentative price schedule.

This guy was a real character.  - Day 1 We speak. He ups the amount by a 100. I say sure. Interest: 0% - Day 2 Loan sent - Day 16 I reach out about 1st payment, he doesn't provide ETA for a reschedule. - Day 27 Retry. This would've been his final payment date. Provides sob story. Again, I ask for a date. Radio silence - Day 28 Retry, he replies sometime this week. I demand a date. Suggest 100 of 400 by 9/28. He agrees finally. He corrects to 10/5. - Day 33 He says he'll be sending 100 eventually. I tell him that won't work so he says he'll be taking a bank loan and pay me back. I suggest 10/7. - Day 40 I reach out again. I give him an additional 20 days, to which I get (another sob story) "gimme a break".  - Day 42 I'm done.   This was a NO INTEREST loan, a 100% favor that put me out 400 for a couple months. And he's asking me to give him a "break" for not paying over 2 months on a NO INTEREST favor. He posted in /r/trees and his background should've given me an idea, but it was one of my first loans and I didn't realize what d-bags some of these borrowers can be to people lending them a helping hand.   Lesson learned: Once somebody misses the first payment on a partial payment of a large sum  I will contact every single person on their FB from now on. I kept giving the guy the benefit of the doubt since he kept promising payment and I didnt want him to look like a piece of shit with his family/friends, but going forward, thats just not feasible.  On the plus side, I took away so much from this tedious experience that's helped me in more than facet of life to make it worth it.

Something unexpected had come up and we rescheduled a few days out. He was apologetic and offered much more interest to compensate and paid it out even though I declined it. He paid more than a fair amount on the rescheduled date. Great borrower, would def lend again.         http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1mwsam/req_50_for_groceries_until_104_will_pay_back_55/   http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1mkvnr/need_493_to_pay_to_electric_utility_company_today/   http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1lq4ve/req_52_for_an_overdue_fee_at_my_university/      Only paid after extensive collection efforts - several weeks late (with additional interest though). Was unresponsive until the very end when I was ready to open a claim. Supposedly changed phones but I saw him online on Facebook, in addition to reaching out by email, where he ignored me as well. Worst thing was, I stuck my neck out for the guy and even passed his resume around up here. I made sure nobody I contacted on his behalf escalates his resume further the moment he was late on our rescheduled payment. It's one thing to fall on hard times and get in touch - it's another to dick around w/ someone else's cash until you're left with no options.  I lucked out since apparently he had used a friend's account and that friend was not too happy about facing the consequences of this guy's actions. The interest made up for the extensive collection, but I doubt he would've paid if it wasn't his friend's account on the line. Definitely would not lend again.

Missed due date for partial on 9/13 but reached out to me which you would think is a positive. But no. He did not give me an expected date either when he let me know he couldn't make payment. I proceeded to contact him a few days later via all mediums and have not heard back. I can see him online and responding to his friends on Facebook - and he still hasn't blocked me so maybe I will see my money.  I can understand if someone hits hard times, but it's not chill to not communicate when that happens. It's been a week now. If you're reading this /u/DustinCasler, you know what happens next. It's my first default but it still feels sucky, I could've helped somebody who wouldn't be a douche but now my money's tied up for at least a month. :(  Edit: Recouped thru alternate sources. Finally had a chat with a guy after posting this and looks like he was just embarrassed about the whole thing. Advice to other borrowers: You need to communicate, even if you can't pay back, so we (lenders) can decide our next move.      Prompt repayment, before I even woke up in the morning.         Good communication, payment ahead of schedule.      I'm looking for a bot that can detect keywords in titles only and can peruse the entire sub-reddit from today to the earliest archived date. Is this too simple a task for this subreddit?      Good communication, prompt payment  Edit: For Reference:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/1l7f4w/req_30_until_thursday_will_repay_35_can_do_this/   This might be a new problem for loans. I saw somebody on Craigslist buying reddit accounts and thought to myself, "why the hell would you pay for an account on reddit?" I'd be willing to pay a few cents for an account, with several thousand, I could upvote anything I wanted to front page status. But $10-$30 per account? That's weird. And than I stumbled on this section. It'll probably be an easy giveaway when a scammer of that variety pops up (100s of posts a few years ago, lul in activity, 10-20 one word posts presently) but I thought I'd put that out there.  	140
 For me it's AC2/Brotherhood and Revelations. AC3 had some good tunes, however for me AC4 as largely unforgettable as I wasn't big into the sea shanties.    Dat scream....scared the living fuck out of me.   Executor: 1.1 billion credits then gets taken out by a lowly A-class starfighter, classic.   Is this the first time she has been topless in a role?   It was also titled [Star Wars Underworld](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Underworld) it seemed to have a pretty awesome premise.   "Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its [about] a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..." Rick McCallum  Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on.   Just curious OP but what exactly did you find a little offensive in this?   Look i'm sure that the production of ANY tv show is not "lazy" but don't you think in Australia  that all the free to air networks in Australia are over-saturated with reality tv shows? It seems like every network is just chasing after each other when one network has a successful reality show. Just my 2 cents as tv viewer.   Is there a guide for what kind of paper should be used when printing video game covers?   I actually think this would fit Ridley Scott perfectly, combined with a good screenplay of course *cough Prometheius cough*. If the film follows the first game and is set in the 12 century I feel that he could absolutely nail the look and feel of the setting as well as the sci fi elements. For reference I think people should check out the directors cut for Kingdom of Heaven as it is set roughly in the same time period as AC1 and gives a good vision for what he could achieve.   Recognise that yellow anywhere.   Serious question but how are you actually supposed to see out of the back? Does it have a series of cameras or are you just expected to never drive it on public roads and only take it to the track?   OP can you tell me what the pads you have under your wrists are called?   After coming from Titanfall to BF4, I have found myself getting caught on everything.   If they do it I hope they make it as unique as the [Tron Legacy Disney Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBN-Iolxa1o) was!   That's CNN for you.   Cheers mate much appreciated!   Any chance you could upload that tune somewhere for me to have a listen?   I was originally like you and asked myself whether the show would be too childish etc. Then I decided to watch it from season 1 to 6 and honestly it is fantastic. Sure there are a few dud episodes and some story arcs that appeal more to children than adults but the underlying theme of darkness is present throughout the series and man does it get dark especially in the latter seasons. Seriously do yourself a favour and watch it.   Looks kind of like a gigantic space jockey from Prometheus or Alien.   I have the same kit as well it's currently sitting on my shelf! Unfortunately though the stickers have been flaking off for some time now since I neglected it when I was young and I dont know if I would be able to get replacements :(   Apps are basically the same price as their US counterparts. I remember originally IOS apps being more expensive. A 99c app on the US store would cost $1.60, however in the last few years apps have gone down to 99c on the Aus store.    I just really hope they overhaul the entire free running system it just felt so dated and clumsy in AC4. It needs to feel and look more fluid as well as have a better sense of momentum when you are running. Other than that the other main improvements need to come in the form of A.I hopefully now that's only next gen they can improve the A.I due to higher memory.    I think of the ratings as more of a guideline. I was fortunate that my mum or dad didn't care about what I played too much and was able to get away with some pretty gnarly games at a young age. For example I got GTA 3 on PS2 when I was in Year 4 of primary school. I look back on it know as my parents being a bit naive but also as a sign of trust in that they raised me correctly and made me work for these games. I'm not saying that your mum is completely wrong in not getting you the game but I think showing that you can handle mature themes, ideas and concepts which transcend the idea of these artificial ratings, it will go along way with your mum. My 2 cents though I'm sure many people may disagree with me.   I actually quite enjoyed the theatrical version of the film when I saw it, even if I didn't quite understand the plot at times it kept me intrigued. I was curious if anyone has seen the directors cut and if that is the definitive version of the film?   Got 7 noms that year and didn't win a single one.   There was a lot of nice detail in this clip from the coffee swirling around in the cups to that guy lighting a cigarette almost had a very slight inglorious basterds feel to it. Of course the fact that they were speaking German was also a very nice touch.   He kind of looks like a character I would create in Oblivion or Skyrim.   It seems he went full retard.     Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.    I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One.     Even then would that cover the long term sales of lost game/dlc sales for the PS4?   Sorry but even MS will never pay a stupidly high amount for Titanfall 2. The only reason Titanfall 1 was a console exclusive was because a former EA executive thought the Xbox One would dominate this gen. EA are pretty much kicking themselves over this though since the PS4 now has the higher install base. So essentially MS would have to pay the equivalent of what EA are losing in potential PS4 sales and that would simply be too high for MS to pay. MS would most likely want to put that money into their own IP's such as Gears or Halo where they know they will get a substantial profit instead of splitting up the portion of these profits with another company like EA if they made Titanfall 2   While this wasn't the first game that got me into gaming, it was the first one that got me into RPG's.   Happening to me as well, so fucking annoying. When you want to watch a simple youtube video it fucking greys the screen asking if you want to use your G+ account, seriously G+ can fuck right off.    Does some of the score sound like it was taken from The Social Network film?   Looks like a Victoria plate in the pic unfortunately.    It didn't help that they showed all the episodes out of order AND kept having multiple breaks between episodes.   With that topic I would like to point people to the [Angels and Demons Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7YrwBYezWM) which I thought was excellent.    Is it possible to get this as a 1080p wallpaper for my desktop?   I have heard that the majority of the film was cut down and it's easy to tell after viewing the film so I was wondering if anyone here had managed to see the full length version at any press screenings etc? If so did it hold up to the original film?   What about [The E3 2009 AC2 Walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pIw4M4_ufI) this opening section was not even in the game and it looked really nice as well:/   Which game in the series did you feel have the best soundtrack? In my opinion it's easily AC2 and perhaps Brotherhood. Jesper Kyd nailed the atmosphere and mood of the game in his soundtrack!    Otto is Otto backwards, whoa.   Yeah it was such a load of bullshit. Was there any specific reason as to why they just didn't use PSN?   Creating a Konami ID for the beta and then updating the game. Good times.   Man me too I actually put a decent time into the game but I sucked massively also I don't remember how the ranking worked in the game but was it just me or did it take a million years to actually rank up the skills in the game?   I enjoyed the movie for what it was however I did feel they overdid it on the slow mo. I also felt that the computer generated blood took me out of it a bit.    He has the look but I don't think he would be able to pull off the character though. I'd like to be proven otherwise though!   If this does happen I guarantee the ending will not test well and they will change it.    This is gonna be a weird one but for me it was Gattaca. It hit me hard for some reason because when growing up my brother was pretty much better at everything compared to me so the scenes of of Ethan Hawke's character striving to be better really hit home for me.       Do the lights on the case not become distracting when playing the game?   I'm not entirely surprised by this actually I flew back from Hong Kong to Sydney via Qantas airlines and the guy infront asked the steward if he could smoke a cigarette (this being after the countless reminders saying you can't). She gave a stern no and looked confused herself.    So basically a G-Diffuser is the only thing keeping the plane alive.   Odd I have never the old 7 series without the navigation unit inside.    Seems like they had kind of sobered up for the most part before burning the house down.    For those who don't know the original [Alien trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLamj-b0I8) is what the Prometheus trailer was based off.    I was in the exact same situation mate a few days ago. In my opinion its best if you don't lock onto the dragon and get some distance. It basically has a tell for each move its gonna do when it lies down flat it basically means its gonna charge and when it does you can easily manouver around it and get a few hits in on the tail BUT you have to be cautious because you need your stamina to gain distance again when it starts bend over again. It has a move in which it will vomit up all this acid on the ground which can spread in a rather large radius but you as long as you are far away from him you can avoid it although if you get hit it will reduce weapon durability. You can tell when he's gonna do the acid move when he starts do this regurgitating animation from what I can remember.   Basically just don't lock onto him and keep a lot of distance and monitor how he tries to attack you. It takes a while to get his HP down when you're only attacking his back side but it's the safest way imo.    Can the door operate individually to the roof?   I think the [Matrix Opening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIXNpePYzZU) for me has the best WB logo. Just the music, sound effects and green colouring takes me back.    I wwebsite as on the internet when you were a sperm in your daddys balls and before it was the internet   I'm glad that I am not the only one who picked this up! I actually quite like this angle gave a nice soft look to that specific scene.   To be fair you would be surprised as to what the human body can endure in certain circumstances. It's not out of the complete realm of possibility for Shelby to have had a pulse but be completely unconscious.    In Australia it's subtitled as Rise of Electro. The trailers and posters they have in the cinema both have that subtitle.    True that it does seem like a pretty revolutionary car, curious to see if they would make an even faster variant of it, perhaps an i8M or Mi8 if that doesn't sound too silly haha.   My bad completely forgot about that one!    Fantastic tune, cheers mate!   Did this episode remind anyone of The Last of Us? The raiders in the house acted very much like the hunters you face in the game, and when Rick takes down the guy in the bathroom it looked very reminiscent of something you would do in the game.     Now I understand that supercars are a very expensive investment which sees very little return, however the idea of BMW making a supercar which has their performance pedigree gets me wet to say the least. Perhaps something like [this concept](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18xpnwxs9ixyzjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg)    Paris: "Yeah they like totally broke into my house".  Producers: "Thanks Paris we got what we needed to make the film now".   So does Mclaren actually not have a title sponsor for this year? I think the car looks fantastic without a bright contrasting sponsor plastered all over it like last year.    Also right hand drive.    Jiffy! 1:44-1:47 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3PQJ9PHLY   I just love the fact that they actually use the phones properly in the show. They don't super impose some stupid interface that makes silly sounds over the phone to get their point across. Instead you get the real deal. I especially love the graphics they use on screen when the characters text each other.    I've been thinking his name was Beechum the whole time... I am not a smart man.   Apologies if this has been asked before but why didn't Michone take one of the vehicles left over after the Governors raid? She walked past a bright red Jeep that was on the grass in the prison I am assuming worked since it would have been driven there by one of the Governors people.       Ages ago when I was really young we went shopping so my older brother could get some new shoes, his eyes landed on a pair of Diesel brand shoes and my dad just says. "Why don't you buy unleaded?"      Hey guys so basically Netflix seems to lag in the browser mode when it hits HD resolution. It lags on both Firefox and Chrome bear in mind that I am using it through media hint on both browsers since it's not available in Australia. Is there anyway to fix this and also is there anyway to try it on Internet Explorer?   Hey guys so i'm travelling from Sydney, Australia to Hong Kong for four days, just for a bit of a break since I am finished with university and was wondering what are some fun things to check out in the little time I have besides shopping of course :) So any bars etc people recommend?   Cheers!            So I felt that while season 2 was great it came a bit too early. Season 2 felt like series finale material. This is how I would have arranged the seasons.   Start off obviously with Season 1Season 3Season 5Season 4Season 6Season 7Season 2.  Now this is how I felt the order of the show could have gone assuming that certain characters did not die. Obviously Season 8 does not exist in this and you may be able to exclude season 5 from this order as well and pretend it never happened.             I understand the press get to see the game-play etc behind closed doors and then they get to write about it, however to my knowledge have we ever seen game-play videos from a Rockstar game before its release?      When this film came out I was about 11 years old so obviously I wasn't really clued in what people thought about the film. I know this though that when I did see it in the cinemas with my parents, I cried and it is still the only live action film which had genuinely brought a tear to my eye from what I can remember. I obviously didn't get the underlying themes or motifs that the film conveyed at the time but after watching it recently at the ripe age of 21, I gotta say I am quite surprised at how many people dislike it, I didn't really notice how divisive the film was at its release.   So what how do you fine people feel about A.I? Is it a masterpiece or is it one of Spielberg's missteps?         Basically are there any hidden gems around the harbour that not many people know about, maybe some rooftops etc to watch the NYE Fireworks?   edit: unpopulated places to watch NYE Fireworks?      There were rumours that the film was going to be re-released in a limited run to remind the academy that this film exists, so hopefully it happens as I feel that it was really the surprise hit of the year for me, in my opinion.    Hi guys now first and foremost I am not a heavy drinker at all, I am only 21 and studying at university so I only drink heavy on occasion to celebrate or party etc, now I am not looking to make fun or offend anyone here but my main question is why do people turn to alcohol? The reason for this is alcohol in itself tastes pretty nasty in my opinion. As in spirits like Vodka, Whiskey and other hard liquors. Do you guys mix alcohol or just drink beer etc? This is purely out of curiosity I am not looking to berate or offend anyone here. I sincerely hope that those of you who do indeed suffer from an addiction to alcohol that you overcome it!  Edited for grammar.   Here is the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTGC5Ot23KU) for those who are interested or need a refresher. Now this film was pretty much universally panned by critics and viewers alike, I just watched it last night and I am not so sure whether it deserves all the hate it got, granted it is by no means a fantastic film although it does have fantastic cinematography.    So I downloaded Lucid Rounds on the play store for my GNEX and was wondering how to use it, I open the app and it asks to download a zip file however nothing really happens after that. Once the download finishes I click the download in the notification tray and then nothing happens. Do I need a program to unzip it properly?   Do you guys feel that MGS2 is one of the more relevant games for our society/time?. With the underlying themes of digital censorship and the control of information, I feel that this game is even more relevant now than it was back when it released.     So with all the cool themes I am seeing in the /androidthemes subreddit, I was curious as to how you install these themes, sorry for being a complete retard, the most complex thing I have done to my phone is flashing the firmware to Yakju to get OTA updates.    Watched a horror film when I was really young, sometime in the mid 90s (the movie may have been reeleased prior) and it involved this female bride going turning into a monster and killing people. The only scene I vaguely remember was that of the bride walking along the side-walk and she comes across this kid playing a violin and then proceeds to kill him or injure him. Sorry that I cannot remember much of the film at all. It would be of great help to find the title of this film. Thanks.       Thought I would raise the question of films that were critically panned but had great posters. I'll start with Max Payne   http://www.filmgrenade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/max_payne_large_poster_2.jpg   Today I found a peanut butter that had expired at least 4 years ago, it had already been opened, suffice to say the contents were pretty gnarly.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_tYaQVq4o                     So here is my pick for music that I play in EVE Online when I get the chance to play. This song just makes me feel like exploring infinitely which in turn coincides with what I love to do in EVE :D!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwGIogQWa5I  	112

 I will say this for Rand Paul, he's the most entertainingly unpredictable figure in politics today.  One moment he's challenging Obama on [drones](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/05/rand-paul-calls-for-public-release-of-extrajudicial-killing-memos/362058/), next he's [calling out the GOP on voter id](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/rand-paul-gop-voter-id-106543.html) and then he's telling an implausible lie about the [ACA](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rand-pauls-latest-aca-whopper).  Most politicians (or people for that matter) you already know what they're going to say on any subject, but I'll give Rand Paul his due for keeping us guessing.   But there's still time for another resolution to repeal it.  Come on House of Representatives!  Make your opinion known.   It is ludicrous isn't it?  George Will complains that the scientists are corrupted by Federal Funding and never mentions that some of the climate change deniers might just have a financial interest in their point of view.   Sure, but let's also remember that the OWS was a genuine grass roots movement, not an astroturf outside funded movement like the Tea Party.  I'm inclined to think social movements often sputter out a couple of times before they catch fire.  It's not like civil rights movement began the day Rosa Parks decided not to give up her seat on the bus.  If OWS turns out to be a only catalyst, that might be all America is ready for.  I remain optimistic, although I'll admit in part because I can't stand to think of my kids growing up in the world the right wing wants to create.   Well, he's certainly got the [sucking ass to the base](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/11/rubio-climate-change_n_5305082.html) part down.   I wouldn't dismiss OWS so flippantly.  Income inequality was not part of the mainstream conversation before their protests.  Maybe we haven't seen much in results yet, but  the issue isn't readily dismissed anymore.   Can we all just agree that George Will is a tedious old git and ignore him?   Wonder why they limit themselves to criticizing scientists who work in climate change and evolution?  Why not also dispute the findings in particle physics and entomology?   Just red meat for the base.    Maybe not, but they can do a lot of damage while trying.   Even so, 97% of climate scientists agree that the burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of the warming observed in recent decades. Should policy really be based on the minuscule chance that they're wrong?  Nice to see USA Today writing an editorial like this, but why did it take this long for their editorial board to acknowledge the obvious?   Anytime anyone says anything is 'eminently fair', they know it isn't.   We've been down this route before.  The Supreme Court was quite partisan in the decade leading up to the civil war.  Still, I can't help but worry that we'll never make it back to a more co-operative politics.    As he observes, the most radical pro-ALEC governor is Walker, whose tax-cutting and anti-union zeal has propelled him into the race for the GOP Presidential nomination for 2016. His state's economic performance has been dismal, as ALEC's own figures show. Walker predicted that his policies would result in job growth of 250,000; so far he's fallen short by more than 94,000.   And if that's not enough.  What's worst about these ALEC policies, Chinn reports, is that the relentless budget-cutting they require leave crucial state services, particularly education, gasping for breath. That's a formula for long-term decline, not growth.  The Republican party, mean-spirited and short sighted.    You'd think all these Bible loving conservatives would knoq that privatizing tax collections is a [bad idea](http://ancientroadpublications.com/Studies/BiblicalStudies/TaxCollectors.html).   If I had the money, I'd put up a billboard in Waukesha (one of Wisconsin's Republican strongholds) that reads something like.  'Scott Walker has received $47 million from outside interests.  Is he giving them their money's worth?'  or 'Scott Walker has received $47 million dollars from interests outside the state.  And you think he's working for you?'  I am puzzled why the Wisconsin Democrats (or Democrats anywhere for that matter) don't make an issue of how beholden Republican politicians are to their sponsors.  Bought and paid for.     It's it makes no sense, there's a good chance it's the Republican position. Works for most issues.   Rand Paul - boldly challenging the facts!   So does this mean if you watch [Fox News] (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/john-farrell/2010/12/22/university-study-fox-viewers-more-misinformed) you shouldn't vote?   Not to mention the rest of *Lola vs. Powerman* or *Something Else*.  And they were one of the inventors of power pop.    No, I'm talking about the person who downvoted chaim-the-eez for agreeing with you.     Don't let one person's idiocy get you down.    If you want to read a refutation of this article, read the New York Times article it [links to](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/business/economy/making-sense-of-income-inequality.html?_r=1).  Especially the last few paragraphs.   One of the plausible consequences of rising inequality is that it allows the 1 percent to take control of the political system, purchasing the power needed to maintain the status quo. If that is the case  and there is plenty of suggestive evidence of this  the widening of the income gap would prove irreversible. Mr. Jencks describes the state of the debate between friends and foes of inequality in these terms: Can I prove that anything is terrible because of rising inequality? Not by the kind of standards I would require. But can they prove I shouldnt worry? They cant do that either. That, alone, is enough to spur action. Something that looks bad is coming at you, he said. Saying that we shouldnt do anything about it until we know for sure would be a bad response.  That last statement is also a pretty good argument for starting to make the adjustments needed for climate change, starting now.   Unfortunately, it appears that 'Use it or lose it' is starting to apply to voting.   The question isnt whether the federal government should help; the question is how, Mr. Ryan said at the hearing on Wednesday. How do we make sure that every single taxpayer dollar we spend to reduce poverty is actually working?  Do you thing Paul Ryan is equally concerned that 'every dollar' spent on the military or every trickle-down special tax break on investments is 'actually working'?      As dismaying as the prospect of Sarah Palin as Vice President was,  I sometimes think having Paul Ryan next in line for the Presidency was even more frightening.   If you were determined to cast an invalid vote, it would probably be fairly easy to do. But it [simply doesn't happen very often](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/voter-fraud-real-rare/story?id=17213376). Not really much personal advantage to it, and the penalties are harsh.   For all the population, the average is 11%, but in certain sub-groups, the percentage will be higher or lower.    Studies show that as many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have government-issued photo ID. That percentage is even higher for seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students. Many citizens find it hard to get government photo IDs, because the underlying documentation like birth certificates (the ID one needs to get ID) is often difficult or expensive to come by. At the same time, voter ID policies are far more costly to implement than many assume. Instead, Improvements in voting technology and modernization of our voter registration system will both increase efficiency and close the door on mistakes and fraud.  [Source](http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voter-id)    I've always thought Paul Ryan was easy to understand, if you know one fact about him and remember one maxim. Fact) Paul Ryan was voted biggest brown-noser by his high school classmates.  Maxim) Character reveals itself early.   His big job in politics is to write budgets. And his big budget idea is that rich people should pay lower taxes, middle class and working class people should pay more taxes, and poor people should get less food, medicine, and college tuition.  But if he stands around some poor people with a concerned frown on his face, maybe no one will notice what his budget says.   Or don't even bother to read his budget. Paul Ryan's ideas are easy to understand : Government money spent on poor people - Bad.  Lower taxes on the wealthy - Good.     And where does the author back up his claim that the "worst Actors were in the White House, not on Wall Street."?  He lists all the things the Clinton White House did that he doesn't like, but nowhere discusses the  actions of Wall Street and why Clinton's actions were worse. If someone were to tell you that Fords are not as reliable a car as a Volkswagen, and only listed the problems with Fords, would you consider that argument convincing?    Kind of slow on the uptake there, aren't you Top Republicans?   How would the existence of a properly priced subprime market have caused a crash?   Newly released memos from the Clinton presidential library reveal evidence the government had a big hand in the housing crisis. **The worst actors were in the White House, not on Wall Street.**     Let's also blame Clinton for the rating services giving triple AAA ratings to housing backed securities, Greenspan's mistakes, and for the rampant dishonesty among bankers.  Might as well pin everything on him.   I'm a whole lot more concerned about the boys like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Paul Ryan.  These [naughty boys](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/rep-lowey-calls-paul-ryan-naughty-boy) are driving the Republican agenda, but appear to have the emotional maturity of adolescents.   Even the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/375765/rand-pauls-foreign-policy-situation-room-or-dorm-room-rich-lowry) and [Right Turn](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/04/29/dont-be-a-jerk-sen-cruz/) find these 'gentleman' lacking. And Ryan seems to missed some basic rules in his upbringing, [about telling the truth](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/paul-ryans-dishonest-speech/2012/08/30/16bb62d8-f24f-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html).                  [Empire of Liberty](http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Liberty-History-Republic-1789-1815/dp/0199832463) is my choice.   Misinformation about the Founding Fathers intents and America's early years are used to justify all brands of nonsense.  It would be harder to get away with if we all had a basic understanding of our history. Well written book too.  Edit to include the book title, not just the link. And I missed a word in the title 'If you **could** require...'                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	116
 Conquistador. I know what one is now.   the perfect storm.   Heh, thanks. Whether this subreddit takes off or not, I just think it's more relevant now that nin has effectively disbanded and that Trent is having just as much success outside of the nineinchnails box.   That's why I thought a r/trentreznor subreddit would be more suitable.    and if the planets aligned, he could do an AMA.   I think that would be great. I also think that if Trent were a redditor and he saw posts of his new work being submitted in r/nin, it would be a little bit...inappropriate.   But the common denominator is Reznor, and I imagine it would generate a lot more traffic than r/nin.   I just think that other work - for example, How To Destroy Angels - should be seen in a different light other than NIN.      but you get one month freeeeeeeeeeeee.   I read that Big Man With a Gun was a song that Trent had his only TDS regrets about, as it was a jab at American gangster rap.  If he did an AMA I'd like to know what other musical regrets he has, and if Big Man With a Gun is still one of them.    http://imgur.com/tQeuv.jpg   What's the DVD called? I just thought it was part of the viral campaign Trent did for Year Zero. About a minute in I was thinking the sound is really good for somebody filming in the crowd. I nearly didn't watch all of it because I saw that there wasn't enough time in the video for The Wretched to follow The Frail. Glad I did.        Upvote for earballs. Though I thought I was the one who invented that word. Sooo bittersweet.   We didn't know if they'd tell us if they were going to show her pitures, so everytime they said "and this one is from Lucy..." we'd freak out and run into the lounge room, only to be dissappointed.   We sent a couple of pictures (in the same envelope) between 4-6 months ago, and we recieved the response yesterday!    all I can think of is Bill S. Preston, Esq.   she was bouncing off the walls all afternoon, carrying the card around with her for hours. When I found out I could help but say "oh, whaaaaat?!"   I'm down with Walter White's idea of turning mars into a giant gas station.   Snow White! and thanks, these are great.   I was so confused as to what direction Trent would take after releasing The Perfect Drug EP.  This song instantly cleared any misconceptions I had on day minus one.   How could i ever think it's funny how everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now.      I have an imaginary NIN/Trent Reznor EP made up the songs that feature primarily on movie soundtracks (eg Dead Souls, Burn, Driver Down). I always pretend to skip Deep.    Sorry, I somehow forgot to put the quote from the movie as he was looking at the picture. "There are dark magics here...and POWER".    Upvotes to you and your pun.       According to Fox, you should all be scared now.   well played sir, well played.   Can anybody tell what year it was published?   Heh...I'd like to think BreakingBadRules was 6 hours too early.   Now I'm wishing it was a spider monkey.    Rock n'Roll.   I'm sure Chad will know how to hook you up with some trax.     Are you saying that this god is better than the others?

My plans to take over reddit one fake repost at a time have failed.    A fuck fish is very what the fish.   I'm hoping you're about to link me to a "Fish with words" website.       I'm not angry, just disappointed.   I'm curious now, who does own the video?   While hanging christmas decorations.   I thought this is the weird bit:  Wanna start helping and serving Jesus in a practical way? checkout the company of the watch I am wearing in the video! They give 10-25% of all proceeds to non profits and the bands and faces are interchangeable! http://www.cruxwatches.com   An interesting way to sell wrist watches.   more confused than unhappy, and I tried to clarify this with the magician analogy. even though the slo mo is showing me exactly what is happening, I still have no idea how to do what I just saw. I definitely should have put "this confuses the shit out of me but I'm okay with it" as the title. so I don't do anybody's head in.   FILTH!   Upvoted for all the cows.   not annoyed, but amazed. it's like a magician explaining how a trick is just an illusion, but i'm left walking away saying "no, that's fucking magical".      rad recording. sounds better than any other shitty live youtube video.   but not impossible.   Excellent for the discotheques.     	56
    This happened somewhere else, but it doesn't surprise me that similar things have happened in other places.   Yep! http://imgur.com/YS1fU8Y   Right? I loved that dog so much more after I found out that she saved my parent's life. Coincidentally, I married a dog trainer.   I never really found out the whole answer, but I was told that he just hated God and hated the church and wanted to do something about it, so he chose my family as the thing to destroy.   This all took place in the mid 90's when I was about 12. My dad is a Pastor, and we used to live next door to the church in a small town of about a hundred people in the middle of a farming community. One night, I spent the night at my friend's house which was on the same block, about two houses away. I have no idea how, but I ended up sleeping all the way through the night, and when I woke up I was told something about a fire and that we were going to meet my parents at a breakfast for the firefighters. When we drove by the church, the back side of it was burned black through to the frame and there was smoke damage everywhere, not to mention water damage from the firefighting. Again, this was only a couple hundred feet from where my friend lived so I have no idea how I slept through all of it.   There was an investigation as to the cause of the fire, but since it was such a small community with limited resources, the cause was never fully determined. It was just assumed that the fire started in my Dad's office because of his computer and other electronics in there. My grandfather was a firefighter for his whole career and he stopped by and looked at the damage, and in his opinion, he said that there was no way that an electrical short could have caused the kind of fire damage that the building endured. Months go by, things are returning to normal as the church is being rebuilt, and finally it's finished and we start having services in the church again. One day, one of the youth gets up front because he says he has something to say. My spidey-sense is tingling because this isn't normal, his whole family is up there with him and he can't look anyone in the eye. He confesses to burning the church, and my jaw just drops. I can't imagine any other time in my life where I've been as horrifically shocked as I was at that moment. He turns himself into the police, makes his statement, and then does community service at the church. He didn't go to jail because he was a juvenile. I can't remember if he had any kind of detention or not.   Now the scary part. I didn't find out about this until much later, probably when I was 16 or 17 and we had moved away from there. My dad got a call from the police and they said he needed to come in to read the statement that was given by the guy who burned the church. He declined and said that he had already talked to him, and he was ok with it. The police insisted, and told him there was something in the report that he didn't know. My dad went down to the police station, read the report, and found out that the night the church was burned something else had happened. In the middle of the night, while I was over at my friend's house, our family dog started acting weird and insisted to be let outside. My dad got up and let her out and didn't bother waiting for her to want to come back in. After that, both of my parents said my dog was growling and making sounds that they had never heard her make before, like she was trying to keep something out of the yard. Sure enough, on the police report the guy who burned the church said that his intentions were to set my family's house on fire and kill all of us, but he couldn't get in the yard because he was scared of our dog (she was a husky-shepard mix). Another important detail- our house was covered in this foam insulation that would have engulfed the whole house in flames in no time.   Since I wasn't told about it until later in life, it took awhile for it to sink in. Even though I wasn't home at the time, there's still a police report out there that says that someone tried to kill me. I don't know if you ever really get over something like that, but you use it to help you remember that life is precious and to take advantage of every day.   TL;DR Someone tried to burn down my house when I was a kid with my family inside, but was stopped before he got the chance.  (Edit- formatting)   Amateur audio engineering. To have a decent setup you can expect an initial investment of a few thousand dollars which will get you an audio interface, cables, a microphone or two, and a digital audio workstation. That will allow you to record about one instrument at a time. If you want virtual instruments, expect to pay about $500 for a somewhat decent library, and then you need a MIDI keyboard or external controller to play them with. Then if you need effects for processing your signals you pay more, and if you need decent preamps you pay more, better microphones, better interface... and so on. Once you get to a certain point you have to consider having a dedicated space to record, and that means adding acoustic treatment for the room. To have enough equipment to record a 4-5 piece band with professional gear will set you back over $100,000.    No other intro gets me as pumped up to watch 21+ hours of a movie franchise as this one!      I would have a small piece of each planet in my house, and as many pieces from dwarf planets and large asteroids as I could get as well.  	10

 So you would take the new shield even with the really low block rate?   Hey guys, so i've been playing a lightning crusader for a while and im pretty bored with it. I want to switch to fire, but i have +lightning dmg on a bunch of gear, and not many souls to reroll it to fire. So basically what im asking is, what should i look for as a fire crusader? i know i should try and get a cindercoat and maximus, but is there anything i should look for/spend most shards on? Any other advice/tips are welcome :)  heres my profile http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/test_subject5736-1644/hero/44816729      How do you think it compares to this  http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50/#customize  Although im not sure of availability in canada for that one either.    looks awesome, but as far as i can tell it's not available in Canada yet, but im in no rush to buy so i think i'll wait for this one to come out. Thanks a ton  	5
 I appreciate you taking the time to write.  She knows I wouldn't do anything with her friends.  I think it's more that she was really open with her friends (which she usually isn't) and it backfired.  So she's even more closed off now and feels super insecure and judged.  Most of her friends are trying to make her feel better about it all, but the few that she used to trust have ruined it.  I personally talked to each of the ones that were being forward with me and made it clear how I felt and whatnot.  One of them even went so far as to feel my crotch while we were talking and beg to see it.  Needless to say, she was a quick 'unfriend' on Facebook.   My girlfriend told all her friends how well-endowed I am, and now several of them are being creepy, hitting on me, and doing other things which are hurting our relationship.  She's usually very shy, hadn't been with another man before me, and told them during a friend's bachelorette party not thinking my size was that big of a deal.  Some sort of bacherlorette-based Truth or Dare game.     She's really embarrassed now and thinks she's ruined the relationship with me and with her friends and questions her friendship with the girls that have been forward with me.  (I continue to tell her that she did nothing wrong and that the friends that are hitting on me cannot be her close friends if they continue to do this.  You cannot be friends with those you don't trust.)  I can tell it's really affecting her view of our relationship.    Any suggestions on how to reassure her?  She's convinced she's ruined everything and feels really uncomfortable around her friends and doesn't always enjoy being affectionate with me anymore.

 Well, statistically it is not as bad as you think it is.  Here is my very specific example: I used to live in Louisa County, Iowa which is in Tornado Alley.  There was one time in the 14 years I was there that several tornados came through.  0 fatalities.  Here is the hard data: http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Iowa/Louisa/table    The assistant principal at my high school outlawed purses on the basis that carrying them was sexist against boys (although there was no rule that they couldn't.... they would just have to put up with harassment from their male peers....).  So my sister and her friends threaded a string through tampon boxes and wore them as purses while they dragged their car keys behind them on another string.  Believe it or not, the rule against purses stopped being enforced.  This is some cheek, I can't believe it worked.  Back in my day, I just carried a billfold that constantly fell out of my inadequate female pockets.    A toad.  I was camping and I saw this toad hopping towards the fire pit.  I fished him out as quick as I could but his back legs were all melted and he was chirping.  I set him down and stomped him as hard as I could as an act of mercy.  I still feel guilty.    If you wrap your warm soda can in a wet paper towel before you put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, it will be consistently cold rather than that kind-of sort-of cold you get normally.  (Always set a timer on your phone when putting sodas in the freezer, dear ones.)   Sorry for being redundant! :)   I'm sincere but not serious whenever I joke around with my dementia patients in Hospice.  Obviously dementia is not funny, but when we laugh together, it's not so scary for a moment.    This isn't exactly what you're asking, but I think it's pretty funny in retrospect.  My ex-boyfriend let his mother think I took his v-card, so she was pretty much awful to me (the son thief who turned him on to premarital sex).... I'm not sure what she thinks he was doing at college for three years.     TROLL ALERT.... LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  WE HAVE A TROLL.   Edit: This is very ironic... So many people upset about how feminists don't call out extremists in their own group, and yet I'm getting downvoted.  Oh, Reddit, do you really know what you want?    Right, I don't claim to have all the answers.  What I took issue with is the statement (that you did not make) that women only claim feminism when it benefits them.  I don't believe this to be the case.  A lot of "feminist issues" are merely human issues, and, indeed, a lot of men's issues happen to be feminist issues.  You offered an example of when women failed to pull the feminist card so to speak.  I refuted it with a very specific example.  I am not a feminist when it is convenient.  I help where I can.     Well, you're setting a great example for how to take another road.  I'm not on the same page as you are, but you made me stop and examine what it is I believe, and that is a beautiful thing.  Thank you for being respectful and for taking the time to try to enlighten people.  I appreciate you.    I am so sorry for what I'm about to say here, because it's not something that can be proven, it is merely anecdotal, but any man who thinks that a girl need only cry "rape" and ruin his life has very little first hand experience with how things actually work.  I'm sorry to say that when my best friend went to our FEMALE HR director because her boss sent her unsolicited messages on Facebook about his sex dreams about her (he being married and twice her age), her exact words to my male boss was "There was something more going on there, she was pursuing him, I'd bet my life." She was pursuing an overweight, bald man with a wife and three children.  She was asking to be put in a situation where she had no idea what to do and agonized over whether to get help for over a month.  She was forced to remain under this man for almost a year until she was promoted beyond him.  She wasn't raped.  This isn't comparable to a rape.  But think about Brandon Teena.  A female to male transgender person who was raped by two men.  Look into how successful he was when he tried to get help.   This was sheer brilliance.    Edit: Sorry, I thought I was talking to the same person the whole time here.  Shutupharu: I'm glad you're giving me a chance to explain.  Direct combat wasn't something that women were allowed into without fighting for that right.  It's a job with a high probability of fatalities and we fought to do it. :)  Monty 845: I don't think that what you're suggesting is altogether reasonable, you see, I don't want to put my life in peril, but I'm quite sure that if I did, I could apply for a job on an oil rig.  However, I'm sure I wouldn't be physically capable of doing the job.  Do I think that the job should be made easier for me?  Absolutely not.  Full disclosure: I would rather be carried out of a burning building than dragged out by a woman, BUT do I think that a woman shouldn't be turned away without giving her a chance to prove herself?  Absolutely.  You see?  We're not all crazy.    I think it is very admirable that you can view a terrible experience as a positive lesson.  I'm also glad that you were able to come to terms with your rape.  I'm sure you're a vibrant and interesting person who deserves to be happy.  Thank you for existing.    I know you're not going to do this, but I encourage you to look into sexual assault statistics for the U.S. Armed Forces, and then to remember that until very recently, all assaults were to be reported to your direct commanding officer (you know, the person that would be reprimanded for that kind of behavior going on within their contingent).  Before I get accused of being callous of assaults on men, I'm absolutely not.  It breaks my heart that so many of them suffer in silence thanks to the idea that one of the worst things you can be in this society is "a little bitch."   I'm sorry that that happened to you.  Truly.    I am now going to systematically upvote all your comments everywhere to show my sisterly support of you.  Yes really.  Don't thank me, it's not about me.  It's about you.  I only wish I could do more.    Very eloquently put. I dislike the misconception that feminist issues only affect women positively.  Men are nearly twice as likely to commit suicide and that has not a little to do with the myths that men are not allowed to be anything other than hyper-masculine.  I've never seen a feminist cheer when they read a story about a young man being raped by an adult women, that's a feminist issue too.  I sincerely hope that your optimism is borne out.  Thank you for your thoughtful and brave response.    Can I just say I like your swagger?  I'm crying out of one eye now.   Put the bunneh back in the bahx.    Con Air.  SOOOO GOOOD SOOOO BAD.   "Mind your p's and q's" is actually supposed to mean "Mind your pints and quarts," meaning don't get drunk and pick fights with people.  Most folks think it means "Be polite."

I bet your rage doesn't last ten minutes.  This works for heading off a panic attack too.    If you get one from me, I either agree with what you're saying, find you well spoken, was entertained, or appreciate your support.  Getting one seems 100% random.  You never know what redditors will like, it seems.    What are the Basement Jaxx for 300?    "I'm sorry that no one has responded to this question yet. I don't exactly fit the bill for what you're asking, but I am a volunteer who spends about six hours a week as a companion in Hospice. In our training, we are taught to encourage whatever the person is feeling. If they are angry, yeah! You be angry! If they are sad, we are to cry with them. If they can't really communicate, we're to hold their hand and just let them know we're here and we care. We had a speaker come in and share that the four most important things we can say to someone who is dying are "I love you," "Thank you," "I'm sorry," and "I forgive you." This dovetails nicely with what you're asking. The best way to come to terms with your own death is to live a life where if you were killed tomorrow, you wouldn't wish you had said any of these things. Don't wait. Just be brave and live."   Reading an interview with Billy Corgran without making this face: :-/   I upvoted this, but I think you mean staying happily married to someone who is famous.  Why do they even bother getting married?  What is the point, I ask?    The pages of a book! Nothing better. :)   I think that the one thing about it that really got to me was the rage in the rebuttal against people saying they care about the health of people they don't know personally.  I think that all life is precious, and my anxiety tends to focus on death a lot.  One of the ways I struggle is when people don't hide their internal machinery well.  Just as I get nervous around people who work out too much and wear their veins sticking out, I get nervous around obese people because eating is the ultimate proof of mortality.  If you get hungry, you are going to die and that is very sad.  Is it such a bad thing to not want people you know personally to die?  Why wouldn't you believe that I care?  The heart is such an uncomfortable concept even in a healthy person, but the fact that I knew a person who was so morbidly obese their heart failed trying to beat against the back of his ribcage is terrifying for me.  I don't want that for anyone.  (I'm sorry, I know this was 100% weird, but it was also serious.)    Read.  Reading makes you more emphatic, thoughtful, introspective, knowledgable, and kind.  If you simply can't go out and experience things first hand, you can always read about them until you get to that point.     That divorce is a sad thing.  For example, Neil Young and Peggi Young getting divorced after 30 years of marriage.  At first I was like how sad, but now I'm like, you know, Peggi is nearly 70, Neil is obviously cranky (yes brilliant, but c'mon you know he is cranky as fuck), good for her! Go be free!  See new people and do what you want!  GO!    Saxondale.   If you aren't selected for trial, you're on call for two weeks. Hope this helps!    Almost every piece that was featured in the Granta issue "Betrayal" has stuck with me.  It forced me to think about a lot of really uncomfortable things.     I used to have these super graphic violent dreams about animals.  The worst one starts with me coming out of a stall in a mall restroom and there was this overweight lady torturing a dachshund with a taser.  I left the restroom and there where these people all crowded together in a circle.  When I pushed my way in, I saw that they were trying to tear this toucan apart with their hands.  The toucan was jerking his head and making this clicking noise in his throat and he had a tear coming out of one of his eyes.  It fucked me up for a very long time. I can still hear that clicking sound.      Lots of people dip their jelly toast points into a fried egg.  I just make a fried egg and jelly toast sandwich.    Jeremiah Johnson   I don't know about best ever, period, the end, but the best acted scene I've ever seen is Robert Redford at the end of Jeremiah Johnson when Bear Claw observes that the "Winters run long up here."  The sheer amount of pain that man managed to get into a "Yeah," it fucking rends my heart every time.  BRAVO REDFORD, Bra-VO.   This doesn't ruin my day, but it annoys the fuck out of me: If the CEO's phone rings three times with no answer, it rolls to me.  People will wait until it rolls to me and then hang up.  This leaves a stupid missed call icon on my phone that I can only get rid of by calling them back.    You click your username and then pick the downvoted tab.   I don't think so.  Here is why: I once encountered a boy who was not very solicitous or interesting or funny or even a good sport.  He was not conventionally attractive, in fact he was a bit overweight and kind of looked like a penguin.  But when I would sit down next to him, I would get hyper, mega turned on.  I couldn't sleep next to him, I was too aroused.  It had to be pheromones.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had no similar reaction to me.  I think the real question is how much of any of this had to do with the fact that I'd been on hormonal birth control for five years at that point.       Too cold to snow.    The question was "Something that sounded great in theory and was fucking terrible in practice." My response was breastfeeding.  Apparently the plight of new mothers is extremely unpopular.     I just checked the parent company's website and the only thing we're looking for is in Hartford for an engineer.... I pulled up a lot of results by just looking for "call center CT" in Google, I'd do that since I don't know specifically what city you're in. :)   I used to work for an outsourcing call center (this isn't telemarketing, it's mostly utility company customer service), and I can tell you that call centers offer an awful lot of upward mobility.  My former boss only had a GED and he's making well over $60k a year as the call center manager.  He started as an agent on the phones.  I was there for five years, was promoted four times, and was making $20.18/hr when I left.  I wish you good luck, sir! :)  Edit: I should say "Call Center Manager" is a title. It sounds like he was just a general type manager reading it again... He wasn't, he over saw the team of 12 major supervisors and all of their team leads, who were responsible for 300+ employees under them.  He ran the whole center and sometimes more than one location. I figured I should clarify. :)   How would I know? I'm an American!  Good job, media ban! :)   The 9 times tables.  Or any other times table come to that.    He made a blog for the sole purpose of complaining about me, describing our break-up as "harrowing."  I promise I didn't try to push him off a cliff.    No! Who the hell is Russel Williams?  If he's under a media ban, it's working!    Hey, thank you!  I'm not, but I like to write them occasionally.  I'm also fond of this one, although it is not on topic : Cactus in sweater / Never to be cold again / in the starry night   or how about this one about how my mom hates carnies? : Sticky hand pulls me / seeds rattle in sweaty cup / do not talk to them  Obviously I don't take myself very seriously, but my post was supposed to be about how the world calls to you and your family calls to you and you need to remember you belong to both. :)   I'm with you.  I steadfastly believe that folks who don't like eggplant don't know you're supposed to press them.  They're amazing!     I have seen them all, and I don't like any of them.  Apart from uniformly suffering from pacing issues, he just can't seem to help himself when it comes to cheeky jokes within his films.  He just seems so damn pleased with himself!  Also, three of his most famous films completely missed the point of the reference material thanks to his casting choices.  That is very upsetting to me.    Oh, ANYTHING by Stanley Kubrick.    Stars bright over house / Warm light from inside places / They shine for you too   How about the most awkward thing I do on a consistent basis?

I'm going to be telling people about this side-quest where I gain a severed arm as a weapon for the rest of my life.  So far, it's been true.  I'm doing it now.  HagtagGimblesProsthetics.    If by best you mean so bad it's almost good, probably the date-rape montage in Dahmer which featured "More, More, More," as the soundtrack.    Saxondale.   For me, it is explaining something totally implausible by throwing in that there was another dimension at the last possible moment.  I'm looking at you, Clive Barker.    I'm not really sure what you're looking for from me since our experiences are very, very different.  I can't go back in a time machine and make my interactions as a person working for a Fortune 500 subsidiary that happened to use a temp agency any different from what they are.  Our entry level employees are paid $8.50 when they hit the door.  We pay $16.50 an hour to the temp agency for people who temp in those same positions.  Obviously if we can buy out their contract, it's better to do so as soon as possible.  We have to pay that hourly fee while we train them, a time when they are not generating any profit for our company.  I'm sorry you feel you need to argue with me, but maybe the area we live in plays a factor here.     Just look up Luke Magnotta on Wikipedia.  I was serious.    While I appreciate that you have a very strong opinion that is likely rooted in experience, it happens to be at odds with what I've seen.  It's definitely true that places are not obligated to hire on a temp, they're paying a premium for  your work and have already had to eat training costs.  You'd be a much better candidate than a person off the street would be, having come from a temp agency for that reason alone.     1 lunatic 1 icepick is totally real.    100%, although after Stephen Collins, I'm seriously worried it's going to be the next equality frontier.  I can just hear it now.... "I was born this way..." "I don't actually harm children...."   It was yesterday.  I asked for help in building a set-up to play vinyl records within my specific budget.  I'm happy to say I put in an order that night.  Thanks, Reddit!    I am a big advocate of researching cooking techniques before you start, but if it's too late for that, use a cooking thermometer.  Safe internal temps are different for each kind of product.  :)   If you don't have one, as a last resort, pick a really thick item you've cooked, cut into it.  If the juice is clear instead of red, you're good.    My advice is actually to sign on with a temp company.  Temp companies are used to extremely high employee turnover, so they tend to skip doing background checks.  Because a temp agency is supposed to run a background check, the company you are matched with will likely not do one.  This is how my former company ended up with several level 1 sex offenders on the payroll.  Let my disturbing experience be your boon!  Best of luck to you... It's awesome that you're so driven. :)   I think a better question is why is Neil Young still Canadian when he's lived in California the vast majority of his life?  Can you answer this OP?  I'm dead serious.     I know that you guys do media freezes for atrocious crimes.  The average American has no idea who Paul Bernardo is, and definitely have never heard of Luke Magnotta, which is crazy when you think about it.

Before and after I'm married, my name is unique to the entire planet (or at least folks searchable on the internet), meaning if you know my damn name, you can find me.  This has happened.   I thought of a good one... My mom once said to my cousin Jason that he could go into the basement and have Hot Sex with Grandma.  She was down in the basement drinking Hot Sex which I think is sort of like Bailey's.  He turned so red you could've fried an egg on his head.    Hardcore Pawn.

Start knitting.  Go to your local yarn shop and knit.  Blog about knitting.  You will not believe how many cute girls knit these days.  I follow 15 boy knitters on Tumblr just because they are boys who knit. None of them happen to like girls, but you see.... there's a niche here.  You only need google "Ryan Gosling knitting" to see what the hell I'm talking about.   In this blog, he described our break-up as "harrowing."  I mean, at that moment, part of me was like "Don't be so dramatic," but part of me was like "Yesss, he thinks I am Liam Neeson."    I'm walking to a meeting I'm already late for.  I have to present at the meeting, but I'm not prepared and it involves math.  I'm stuck behind someone who is walking very slowly.  They are wearing flip-flops that they are dragging across the floor.  They are also whistling.  While all of this is happening, I'm wearing pantyhose and an ill-fitting outfit.  It's 90 degrees inside with 60% humidity.    How has no one said eggnog?  If you drink a whole carton of eggnog, you will regret it with your body and your soul.  Just ask my husband.

I went back and looked at every letter and e-mail and chat history and birthday card I ever exchanged with him.  Looking at everything in order as a cohesive progression allowed me to come to conclusions I had avoided before.  By the time I was done, I realized I never wanted to be with him at all, I just wanted to be him.  I felt that he was what I could be if I weren't afraid.  He was me without limits.

Backstory aside, let me tell you for future reference, that yes, a teenage girl could absolutely get pregnant the day before her period.

All of our survival instincts are suddenly not allowed.  You can't run away.  As a female, I find police to be terrifying.       Hello; Does anyone know off hand why the Pro-Ject is a better choice and thus higher price than the TEAC?  Thank you for your help! :)    Hello; I'm looking to buy a full set up for about $800, with a bit of wiggle room.  Can you please suggest what would be the best use of my money?  Thank you... this is way overwhelming!   	101
 This is a good idea. I am lvl 30 with 500 something wins(not saying that is good). I have only played 3 ranked games, and I was invited to those games not knowing it was ranked(duo queue). I'm not saying you should be able to make your own avatars but if they did add it in, they should maybe have ranked games be a part of it.   Fiora? Underpowered? I think she can do massive damage and has a pretty low cooldown counter ability. I mean sure you can build armor to make her do less damage (as you can with other melee carries) but I would never call her underpowered. She doesn't need a nerf though, imo.   And Fizz's shark, Malzahar's Voidling, Urf, nidalee (both forms), Sejuani's boar,and Orianna's ball. :)  	3
 Should we spot start Lincecum for Hudson's next start? Best case scenario he just needs rest.    If we're going to be successful in the playoffs, Hudson is going to have to step up. Depending on how tonight goes, I'll either be feeling really good or really bad.   Nasty curveball. I ain't even mad.    Even she's tired of the Jeter circlejerk.    Even though you're right behind us in the WC standings, I can't bring myself to root against you. Hopefully we win the west and you guys can take care of the Dodgers.    Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern.    During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.    Yeah, if you take the trolley it's pretty much an all day endeavour. You'll see more just staying in SD.    Curious what your plans are in Tijuana. I loved going there during college.    Because each of those fouls count as team fouls. Once a team gets 5 team fouls in a quarter, they will shoot free throws on all subsequent fouls, meaning that strategy will almost certainly result in other, better shooters shooting free throws.    Look at those fundamentals!    I thought I was in r/funny and your friend was [the only white person]( http://imgur.com/1939Q6h).   On one hand, I agree with you. NFL players aren't my role models and I don't look to them for moral guidance. On the other hand, I love watching the NFL mishandle these situations at every turn.    They played 4 games at LSU's stadium, 3 at the Alamodome and one at Giants Stadium.    This would have been an absolute heartbreaker to lose considering the Dodgers' result today. Now we're only 2 games back and feeling pretty good. I would much rather be heading to PetCo than Wrigley.    From San Diego or just visiting?    You mean Panda Frien...ooh.    What happens if the Giants either win the division or finish second in the wild card? Do you get a refund?    Dodgers scored a run. Why does that bother me so much?    What a weird week for the Dodgers. Lose 9-0 to us, come back the next day and win 17-0, and now they're losing 15-0 to the Rockies.    M M's with obstacles.    Runer at third. Batter strikes out on a ball in the dirt. Batter heads towards first. Susac throws runner out at first. Runner on third runs home.    This reminds me of one of JD Dorian's fantasies.    What happens in r/timlincecum stays in r/timlincecum.    No, no, it's "revved up like a douche in the middle of the night."    Gutierrez sniffing his hat...   This is awesome. I just drove past Raley Field last night. I would love to go to some games to see some future Giants.    Also, Tony Torcato. That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.    Are the refs just quicker to throw flags this year? It seems like every game I've watched so far has had a lot of penalties. It really takes the life out of the game.    A lot of these penalties are legit, but it sure seems like the refs are quicker to throw flags this year. It really sucks the life out of a game.    That feeling when your outfielder dives for a ball and misses and you have to watch the batter run for days...   You know when you're playing RTTS and the pitcher you just created is getting rocked in his first AA game? That's how I feel right now, but I can't rage quit.    I really doubt it would have been overturned. It was too close.    It's not so bad. You get to win a World Series every couple years ;-)   Ugh...come on.    I think twice. Mixed results.    Gutierrez sniffing his hat...   I would call Bum's performance Kershaw-esque, but Kershaw usually gives up 1.67 runs/game.     Who holds the overall Giants single season strikeout record?    You just took the rivalry too far!    Get some garlic fries. They will turn around even the crappiest of nights.    Can someone summarize the story Vin told about Blanco? I'm up north and watching a different broadcast.    Unclinch!    Keep this troll at 0.    Just put in Brian Wilson already. That's who we really want.    [MRW I just spent a couple minutes in the Dodgers game thread.]( http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/article/100/1000475/hero-showdown-cartman-vs-stewie-20090701022443845-000.jpg)   If you're in nor cal, it's 31. The guide says it's family feud, but it's actually the game.    [Oh, they mad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/2g8ulp/game_chat_912_dodgers_8363_giants_8165_715_pm_pt/ckgvi6a)   YOU GET A DOUBLE! YOU GET A DOUBLE! EVERYONE GETS A DOUBLE!    Why can't I find the game on TV?    That's what happened. Jeff didn't have room for it at his temporary place, so he had Tony hang on to it.    I don't know if my nerves could handle it though.    For a starter to get a win he needs to:  1. Pitch at least 5 innings. 2. Leave the game with the lead. Had Vogey finished the 7th, he would be in line for the win because the Giants scored in the bottom of the inning.  3. His team cannot give up the lead for the rest of the game.    Kid's huffing paint out of that finger.    Nope. Machi will get the win if the score holds.    Unclinch your bums, guys and gals!    [Pagan looking like he stepped right out of a telenovela.](http://i.imgur.com/YxXI9Yh.jpg)   Should have pushed it fair, jerk.    Looks freezing there. For once, I'm glad I'm not in the crowd.    We'll probably have to choose between Vogey and Peavy, which is an easy choice.    The biggest surprise of the address for me was the way the president talked about the Assad regime. He said the regime will never regain the legitimacy that they have lost. I don't necessarily disagree with that, but I'm surprised to hear the president write the regime off as a potential ally against ISIS.  Assad is in control of an entire air force, and what seems to be a more organized military than the rebels. I would not have been shocked to see the US reluctantly side with Assad in exchange for his assistance in going after ISIS. The language the President used tonight rules that possibility out.    The biggest change from what we've already been doing is we are now expanding the air strikes to Syria.   I'm just going on memory, so take this with a grain of salt, but he stated his plan to:   1. Begin air strikes in Syria.  2. Arm the enemies of ISIS, including moderate Syrian rebel groups.  3. Send 400+ more troops to Iraq in non-combat roles.    I'm sorry, but this just isn't correct. Just because they commit horrendous crimes doesn't mean they aren't religious. They certainly don't represent the majority of Muslims, but it's not accurate to say that they aren't religious. I think we can be mature enough to criticize a terrorist group without attacking an entire religion.       It just went final in San Francisco.    Padres now up 6-2 with a runner on 2nd with 1 out.    Joe Panik. So hot right now. Joe Panik.    Padres have runners on the corners with no outs.    Petit pitching like he has somewhere to be after the game.    They can have the MVP, we'll take the division.    I read that they are only ~5 games over .500 in games when Kershaw doesn't pitch. That's the best argument for Kershaw winning the MVP I've heard yet.    A Dodger fan in r/baseball summed up my exact thoughts about LA in a thread last night. They're winning games, but there's something not quite right about them. I think they're vulnerable and I wouldn't be surprised if they struggle in the final 3 weeks.   Panik is a stud.    Loved watching him play at Notre Dame. It's a shame his game didn't carry over into the NBA.    Najera?    Stole this idea from r/baseball.    I'll start. Keon Clark. I just looked him up and last year he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for weapons charges. He also claims to have never played a game sober in his NBA career.    Finally, that city has something to be proud of other than a two ingredient sandwich and a fictional boxer.   I remember when Noah Lowry and Jerome Williams looked like they were both going to be studs for us.    A three quarter triangle? What an idiot.   One more touchdown and the Cowboys will cover the spread. With these refs, I wouldn't be surprised.    Week one and I'm already reminded what annoyed me about the NFL last year: Ticky tack penalties and so many commercials.    Geno is looking LEGIT! Surprise of the day so far.    Especially impressive considering he was batting in the .280s a month ago. He's been on another level lately.    The steak ends at 46 after a 1 out double.    Mark Buehrle's ML record was set in 2009. The previous NL record of 41, which Petit also broke today, was set by Jim Barr in 1972.     I'm watching Parks and Rec and seeing how out of shape Chris Pratt is in season 1. That makes his recent transformation all the more impressive. Do you have a favorite actor/actress body transformation?    I know, I know I hate posts here where OP makes excuses too.  I'm staying at my parents' house for a few months. My dad has a bench. So, I can do bench, DLs, rows. He also has dumbbells and a pullup bar, so I can do dumbbell press and pullups. Everything I need to build a strong upper body is there. The problem is, he doesn't have a way to safely squat. The only thing he has for lower body is a leg extension/leg curl machine attached to the bench.   What kind of results can I expect to my lower body if I combine that with dumbbel lunges? Are there any other lower body exercises I can do with the equipment I have?    It seems like the general consensus around here is that deadlifts are the single best lift you can do. I'm wondering what your body would look like if you only did deadlifts.            I thought it would be a good idea if, once a week, we had a weekly discussion thread where we could discuss anything.  My question to you: What sporting events do you have your eyes on over the MLB all-star break?   I ended the first half of the season with a perfect day, betting on SF, CIN, TB, ATL and LAA. Nothing like having a perfect day and then not having baseball for the next few days.  What's on your mind this week?      I'm reading *The Master and Margarita* right now. I'm only about half way through, but I think Woland should be played by Johnny Depp in a role similar to Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow; obviously intelligent, but a little spacey, although you're never quite sure if it's an act or not.  Ivan would be played by a younger actor. Maybe someone like Heath Ledger.    There was a thread recently about classics that have not aged well and I'm curious about the opposite. What classic books have aged well?      I just read it for the first time and while it was a decent story, it didn't strike me as exceptional in any way. Why is it so famous almost 100 years after it was written?      I just landed this morning and immediately did the Freedom Trail. I'll be here until Thursday night and I'm looking for suggestions from locals for activities to do. I definitely want to catch a game at Fenway either tonight or tomorrow. I also want to go to a brewery. I know Sam Adams is the famous one, but I've heard good things about Harpoon. What else do you recommend I do?      I have always wanted to do this and I'll probably never get a better chance to do it than next month. I had some travel plans with a friend that fell through, so I have a week off work. More importantly, I can fly for free or nearly free through a family member who works for an airline. If you've done it before, what was your experience like? What advice can you share?   Right now I weigh 165 lbs @ 5'10". I included lifts at 3 different weights: 135, 185, 200. Just want to make sure I'm not headed towards a preventable injury. Please take a look and let me know how I can improve.   [135x5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS3TXJAUh7I)    [185x5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpYTfDoNujA)    [200x1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aetzlHmWvUg)   I'm constantly wondering how I'm going to get my next meal. I wake up in the morning and I try to remember how much food is in the house. How much milk do I have and is it enough to make it through the day? When will I find time to go to the store today to get more milk for tomorrow? Did I remember to wash my blender last night? Is today lifting day? I think about how many calories I need to have consumed by the time I leave for work, because I know I will be too tired to cook a big meal when I come home. I don't want to be hungry at work, but I also don't want protein farts. I lay in bed browsing reddit on my phone, but I know I should be eating.  If I start to feel hungry at work, I fret over the gains I'm losing. I count the minutes until I can take my break and find some food. But I only have 15 minutes. I run to Starbucks and hope they have breakfast sandwiches left. That will have to hold me over for the rest of my shift.    I come home feeling tired, but I can't go to bed until I hit my caloric goal. I debate whether I have the energy to cook a full meal or if I should just piece away at some milk and snacks for a bit. I choose the latter. I hit my goal for the day, but at what cost? I now have almost nothing left for the following day. If today was a struggle, tomorrow will only be harder. I look at my shirtless body in the mirror as I brush my teeth. I'm tired and bloated, but goddammit if I don't look bigger.      Pretty dark, but could be funny if done right.         Brothers and sisters in swole, like many of you, I didn't think it could happen to me. I read your stories of swolestation and felt the same rage you felt, but I thought I was safe. Surely those around me appreciate me for my personality, I believed. Yet, yesterday, at my own place of employment no less, I was used like some piece of farm equipment.  I'm relatively new to the Iron Path, but Brodin has been very good to me. I've noticed the stealthy glances of passersby as they 'mire my aesthetics, but I can take that because I also consider myself swole of spirit. But what happened yesterday was more than I can bare.  My work has conducted a food drive over the last two months to collect food for the less fortunate. I was extra motivated, as I saw this as an opportunity to give the aspiring followers of Brodin the fuel they need to make mad gains. Our store was very successful in our efforts and yesterday, we finally delivered the boxes of food to the food closet on the other side of town. There were dozens of boxes, many filled with canned goods.   Without warning or asking me if I wanted to help, my boss informed me yesterday that she "needed my muscles" to help her deliver the food. I was dumbfounded. I've always tried to be the best employee I could be, but suddenly I found myself as nothing more than a tool to help move nonperishable food items. I have never felt so objectified.   I sat in silence next to my boss on the car ride over as I tried my best to contain my tears. When we finally arrived, I did my best to deliver the boxes as quickly as possible so I could return to work and have a good think in the break room. As soon as the last box was set down, the food closet manager said perkily, "We sure are lucky to have you. Otherwise we would have been moving boxes all afternoon." Do you believe the nerve? She didn't even consider the possibility that the previous day was deadlift day and maybe lifting heavy boxes off the ground wasn't ideal for me.   I'm at a loss, reddit. I thought my place of employment was my sanctuary. What should I do?   I'm not the most devout worshipper of Brodin, but I have paid my dues at the Iron Temple regularly this year, and have been blessed with righteous gains. I've been swolested on a couple of occasions, but I forgive those people, for they know not the error of their ways. The pain that their actions caused me was erased after an experience yesterday at work.   An unruly customer, neither swole of body or mind, threatened my boss after she banned him from the store. This was the third time she has had to ask him to leave and each time he has made a scene while exiting. Unfortunately, I was not present to witness the events as they happened that day, but they worried my boss. As the day went on and she resumed normal work activity, she needed to go to her car to get something. Although I was the youngest man working that day, it was me she asked to walk with her for protection. Brodin gave me this opportunity to use my gains for good. I escorted her to and from her car without incident. Although my presence was unnecessary, it felt good to be asked to provide protection.     	108

Can anyone easily explain all this stuff to me or link me to an article that walks you through what each unit contributes? Making a car sound nice is confusing stuff.    Funny that would happen right after "The Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award".    I clicked the picture without looking at the subreddit, and prayed that I was in /r/cringepics.   Is this still a Guy Ritchie thing?   I was at a Chili's (chain restaurant). We had just ordered a desert when the guy in front of us starting violently projectile vomiting all over his table and the aisle and all surrounding tables. Eventually the ambulance showed up and took him away. He never stopped vomiting. Worst part: we were in an alcove and he was blocking the way out, so we were trapped behind him, with our food and table puke-drizzled, for a good 15 minutes.    Yeah she was a bit mental.   Once when I was in middle school, I had an english teacher who was always getting on to me about leaning back in my chair. I didn't purposefully do it, it was just a bad habit. But after like the 5th time she had to tell me not too, she flipped out and threw a mug across the room and yelled at me saying that she wished I would fall over and crack my head open and shatter my skull because that would make me learn my lesson. She ranted on for a good 3 minutes before she just left the classroom. Everyone just kind of sat there and stared at me for a few minutes before we left.   The next day she called me into her office and calmy, but very angrily, asked if I had been going around the school telling everyone that she said she wanted me to get brain damage and die (which she did), and I had to explain to her that considering she yelled at me in front of the entire class for five minutes, there was a good chance that I wasn't the only one that heard her wishes. She started grinding her teeth and shaking and told me to leave, and as soon as the door shut I heard her start hitting her desk and trying to hold in her screams.   Later that year, she tried to get me suspended/expelled for racism and called me in front of the principal and religion teacher and a bunch of other staff to discuss this, and they all realized she was talking out of her ass. I left that school after that year, but turned out she had some mental issues. She was fired the next year for assault with a deadly weapon (not in the classroom or anything). Her mugshot was hilarious. Always wanted to visit her in prison.    Why does this have thousands of downvotes?   What is your first major memory?   That's in all high school classrooms.   He didn't.   I recently worked on a movie he starred in. I wasn't very important at all but he treated me like the director whenever I talked to him. Really nice guy as far as I'm concerned.

Then what's behind the hand on the head?   They switched Skylar's and Walter's hands. Check the lighting.   I saw an outtake from the scene where Mac's dad was talking to Mac and Charlie about filling up their butts with heroin and they couldn't get through it because they were laughing too hard. What other scenes have been hard to get through without cracking up?

That's the movie I thought you were talking about, but Not Rated is VERY different from PG. Not Rated means the it was not taken the MPAA to be rated. That movie would be NC-17.   ...what PG movie has a real blowjob?   Well, he passes here. Still not too happy with it but we'll see.   Great. Now I want a hamburger. Thanks alot, OP.   ...

You should really further explore /r/ASMR   They should have gotten Jonathan Banks (Mike from Breaking Bad) to play Richard.   It wasn't staged.

Spike Lee is a racist, egotistical megadouche. Plain and simple.   Well, sure.   Better late than never.

I did the best I could to remove my internet presence and pretty much became dead to that friend circle.  My breakup wasn't too bad, just generic compatibility issues. No hard feelings.   no it's funny cause he's stuck in the Ecuador embassy in London, so, like, who else is he going to have a press conference with? Drederick Tatum?    No Gavin?! ARGHHHHHH ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  Edit:   satire sat/ noun the use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.   Dead Workers Party? Don't you mean The Shaft?   Strippin is a damn traitor. Ditching his friends and moving to the US. Can't we just ignore this guy?  	76
 Sounds like you need to let go. If she wasn't interested in you in that way, her opinion isn't going to change by you just convincing her. D-Bag move by your buddy though, I think you could use a new friend AND a new love interest.   Who/what is 'itmejp'?   That /r/giants pre-game shot was the essence of rivalry.   Pretend you're with people you ARE comfortable with, whether that's close friends or certain family members. They're probably a bit nervous about hanging with you- be the one that reaches out. Think of it as an opportunity to make a valuable, unique connection.   Does it bother anyone else that there's zero split-screen capability for both campaign AND multiplayer?   Any suggestions to a specific product would be most appreciated.  Thanks!   I did the train show on Friday night had a fantastic time.   So much for having a productive day at the office...   Read samples of each book on Amazon (Google Books most likely has them too). Everyone has a different taste for style of writing, and when it comes to research everyone absorbs material differently. Spend 5-10 minutes on each book and see what sticks.   Better experience with e-ink.   Dune. Can't believe it took me this long to read that brilliance.   It may be my favorite book as well. There's never been something so long that I've become so completely engrossed in. A lot of it has to do with being an American and already being intrigued by Japanese culture- that was the case for me and I'm sure a lot of Clavell lovers.  Just like the protagonist, the reader finds him/herself washed ashore in a strange land with an entirely new lifestyle and mindset that permeate throughout all the inhabitants. And as you read on, these feudal Japanese concepts make more sense, become less foreign, and just like the hero you find yourself falling in love with this way of life.  This is a tremendous adventure book, a tremendous history book, and a tremendous spiritual book. So happy for you to have had the pleasure of reading it.    I used to have the same issue as you, SO frustrating!  I read on a kindle so they track your progress a percentage. In order to read a book in a week's time, I need at least 17% a day. I set a goal every day to reach that amount, and it commits me to the book. Obviously I don't always stick to this but over the past couple years it's worked out well.  If you prefer raw doggin it with real books just make it 30 pages or a chapter, whatever your comfortable with. Best of luck-   From RA Salvatore I'd move to some Raymond E Feist, start with the Riftwar Saga. Robert Jordan's wheel of time is excellent, but very long. A Song of Ice and Fire is the best as far as I'm concerned, but is lacking in a lot of the traditional fantasy elements. For something weird and challenging The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe. David Eddings has written a lot of great fantasy, for him start with Pawn of Prophecy. And of course, Lord of The Rings.   This is probably the best advice I've ever give anyone: Don't see the ball drop. Spend hours in the freezing cold, you can't leave to go to the bathroom, can't leave to get food or drinks, and no room whatsoever.   I want to be in that moment right now.    Might try the Belgariad series by David Eddings. I've read a good bit and fantasy and typically do find romance to be a lacking element. I read a couple books into this series a long time ago and remember there to be some high quality romance written. Might be best to read some more opinions on it as my memory is fairly cloudy about this.  A Song of Ice and Fire also has some great romance now that I think on it.   Look up "sell books" on Yelp in your area   Haha enjoy!   Judge for yourself, but I think without question. Many of the main and most popular characters are female. Here's a pretty humorous quote that gets thrown around a lot- http://imgur.com/nu2Mipb  The books are fantastic. I'd be surprised if you read 30ish pages into the first one without being hooked.   How'd the cops get tipped off?   Packers- Let's be honest they're probably screwed anyway without A-Rod steering the ship. They're gonna have to run it all game, ATL has a soft run defense, ATL's passing attack will be diminished by the weather.  I'd say it benefits the Pack the most because a) They're desperate for a win and b) I don't think they can win this game without this edge.   There's a ton of businesses in this country that give out loans to people like you. Interest rates are more lucrative for them but A LOT of businesses get started this way. If you're in a major city there's certainly some available.  Here is one that I'm familiar with - http://www.nextlevelfunding.com/  Being able to overcome failure is what truly defines a person's character. Sounds like you're quite motivated and I'm sure you have a bright future. Best of luck.   What do those characters translate to?  Great drawing!   I mean this in a nice way, because you seem like a hard worker and a good person, but you're being a 'pussy' in this relationship. You deserve better. She sounds like a bad person. You're young, spend some time apart and meet someone that appreciates you. Are you happy? Because there are women out there that will make you actually happy- toxic relationships don't allow for that.   How much debt do you have exactly? Have you considered community college- why do you think you were unsuccessful at school?  Your first step, without question has to be losing weight. It's something that's entirely in your control and will only open up more options for you down the road, aside from making you feel substantially better about yourself. r/loseit and r/fitness are invaluable resources for this.   Thoroughly enjoyed reading this- you've got a talent for writing sci-fi hope you stick with it!   Sorry for the bad advice! Thanks for informing me, though. Looks like I was completely in the dark on my egg info and need to do more reading up on it.  I still stand by my beans, great inexpensive high protein option.   Have you tried A Song of Ice and Fire?   Might want to cut down on those yolks for starters, that's what going to mainly affect your cholesterol and egg whites will give you plenty of protein.  Beans, lentils, tuna fish, peanut butter, and nuts- all great sources. If you can find some organic low sodium canned beans, they are an excellent healthy and inexpensive option- and pack a great deal of protein.   You haven't really talked about why it is you want to get married so bad. Could you shed some light on this?   Been reading up on Little, Big and have to say I am thoroughly intrigued- I can't believe it received so many awards and I'm not familar with it. Have you read anything else by Wolfe? I was looking into his other pieces and thinking of picking up The Death of Doctor Island.   Dude's practically begging to get his dick grabbed.   Ice skating in Bryant park, walking around Central Park, botanical gardens in the Bronx, there's a lot of great bars with fireplaces that are nice to hang out at, Bryant Park and Union Square will be filled to the brim with small shops that are great to find gifts at.   Shogun and pretty much anything else by James Clavell.   Once those interior D-Linemen started getting injured that run defense was screwed. I remember the Giants went into that week 6 game with arguably the worst rushing offense in the league, Bears made Brandon Jacobs look like AP.   This guy also did a Ted talk I enjoyed, basically the same subject-   Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging via @TEDiSUB http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html   You could use that app in conjunction with r/writingprompts.  It'd be great to have an app that rewarded you with points and had an rpg/experience system.   The Master and the Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov is a weird russian novel. If you're looking for fantasy, The Book of the New Sun series is a tomb but it's a weird challenging-but-rewarding read.  When I was having a tough time I became completely engulfed in Shogun by James Clavell. Very easy to disappear into that book if you need to, I'd recommend this one the most.   Whole Foods has truly conquered this dillema.   I'd say it'll most certainly get better in your calves as long as you continue running. If October was your first half it makes sense for them to not be used to such an undertaking. Hard to give a timetable, but as long as you keep at it they'll become stronger and more durable.   Awesome.   I started trying a few weeks ago and have also been encountering difficulties. What method have you been using primarily?   Yeah but their post-game rates range from $5,000 to $7,500.   Saints- after a loss like that against the Seahawks, Sean 'Vendetta' Payton is gonna show the world what kind of hell his offense can truly raise. Would love to see panthers win this though, that team's been a tremendous story this year.   If he decides to stay after next year, why in the world would he want out of Denver? He's been put into a dream situation- things would not be going as smoothly if he had signed with Arizona or Miami. I also don't see another owner in the nfl that can relate to his quarterback as well as Elway does.   Turns out he wasn't real.   You won't have to read that far, and fortunately for you the movie changed many fundamental aspects of the book so not too much will be ruined. It's a tremendous trilogy, definitely worth reading (Book 2 is my favorite).  Try to just get lost in the book, the world Pullman creates is very intriguing. I've read the first one twice and both times feel as though I'm on my own adventure exploring this strange alternate world that Lyra and her companions occupy.    Off the top of my head:  Science Fiction: Hyperion by Dan Simmons and Dune by Frank Herbert (Both are the first books in a series).  Historical Fiction: Shogun by James Clavell, First Man in Rome by Colleen McCullough, and pretty much anything by Michael Crichton.  Fantasy: Wheel of Time Series and Book of the New Sun  "Classic" Authors: Mark Twain, Dostoyevsky, Dickens, and Kafka (These are the ones I'm personally most familiar with, obviously there's many more of excellent quality out there).  EDIT: I realized these are just books that I personally liked. There's tons of lists out there by people more well-read, just google it up. This list from Esquire pointed me in a great direction a while ago: http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/80-books#slide-1   Anyone else peer down at their legs in shame after watching this?   I always felt that students were turned off to literature courses due to the intimidating length of so many of these books. Someone who's never read 400+ page book recreationally is going to avoid one of these courses at all costs- and rightly so! That kind of inexperience would make reading one of those take up way too much time. This doesn't lessen the content in any way, if anything you dig more out of the text by having a smaller area of study.   This was a huge help for me as far as personal finance:  http://www.amazon.com/Get-Financial-Life-Personal-Twenties-ebook/dp/B001UP63MS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1386187208 sr=8-3 keywords=personal+finance   Are they looking for something different, exciting? Then absolutely.  The main issue with SNM is a lot of the situations are going to make you uncomfortable, and your experience is going to be entirely a product of what kind of attitude you have.  Yes it's going to get weird, that's what make's it such a unique experience. If it's not embraced though, I can see them having a bad time.   Thanks!  I've been considering Jailbreaking my iPad for a while and this re-lit the fire a bit. I'll have to do some research on how this would be handled.   Magnifies how awful the film was for not portraying any of this to a casual audience.   This seems to have been an impactful injury this season. I haven't really been following this team, has this played a serious role in their offense struggles this year? How has his replacement performed?   Depends, what part of the city you gonna be in?  If you're gonna be near midtown I'd recommend The Football Factory (33rd St between Broadway and 5th).   If you think this person would enjoy Historical Fiction, two books I can't recommend enough are:  The First Man in Rome by Colleen Mccullough  and  Shogun by James Clavell   I'm new to using Mods such as this- Is this something that can be used on a Jail-broken Tablet or is this PC-exclusive?   Some of the best Sci-Fi ever written.   American Psycho. A tremendous satire on the Wall Street/Yuppie culture that permeated the elite class of new york city in the 1980s....and some of the most disturbing passages you will ever read. If you've got a weak stomache, the last 1/3 of this book should be avoided.   Something that helped me tremendously was Sperm Wars by Robin Baker. Keep in mind this is written by a biologist, but it teaches you how men/women are innately wired and why we act the way we do. In my opinion profoundly more helpful than a lot of these typical dating/pick up artist guides.  http://www.amazon.com/Sperm-Wars-Infidelity-Conflict-Bedroom-ebook/dp/B0046A8SEU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1386179569 sr=8-1 keywords=sperm+wars    For something more on the traditional side, I'd recommend anything by Raymond E. Feist. Best to start with the Riftwar Saga and the book Magician.  For something more challenging/pretty weird, I'd recommend The Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe.   I'm not sure if there's a website/database that has the information- couldnt find it on my own. Anyone have thoughts? Main concern is this Brown/Patriots game coming up. Have a feeling Amendola is going to catch a big nut on Sunday.  Thoughts?  	64

 oh my   I make them at home! 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream + milk (add as much or as little depending on thickness of milkshake desired *I add 1/2 cup) + about 1/8tsp of peppermint extract.  You can add green food coloring if you'd like.   I'm embarassed to admit that I've fallen asleep like this before...   Gambling, especially in Vegas.  Slot machines..no desire to play them at all.

Sorry to hear about your breakup :( I don't have a lot of advice on this topic since I don't know you or your situation, but I know that you'll be ok.  It probably sucks big time right now... but watch some good movies, eat some good food, and just treat yourself like a king while you ride this whole thing out :D   I do some light cleaning around the kitchen while I wait for the microwave to finish heating up my food.  Hot food and less mess in the kitchen... Win!   I think she seems really nice, really pretty, has a great body, but she seems like a bit of a fame whore and she really can't sing.

I use Stevia in my tea and coffee so I don't have to worry about sugar either.    Agreed :)  But it also depends on how you ask the question... so there's a big difference between " HEY! YOU GOTTA BF?GF????" and " So are you dating anyone currently?".. all about delivery.   Avocado + soy sauce + fresh minced garlic... or if you want something sweet... avocado + sugar + milk .. blended with ice.. AMAZING!   Bacon anyone?

I'm complimented that they'd like it..but should I be watermarking my photos so that i get a little extra traffic?  What are your opinions?   Hi guys!  When I launched my photoblog, I had a few extra categories which I deleted within a few days.  Now that it's been almost 2 months since my wordpress blog has been up, google search and  webmasters tools are still showing those deleted categories.  I've submitted my sitemap since the initial category deletion, but it hasn't worked.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!   I posted it as soon as he left... so at the time it did just happen lol.   The UPS guy just stared at me, I smiled having no idea his name was Neil...  Then after i signed for the package, he asks me for my dog's name and explains why he was confused.  Then I just went.. "oh..

 and the US had to promise not to draft them into the war under that citizenship      It is fabric, weather is was made for a man or woman doesn't matter. shine on you crazy diamond.    How many people have you slept with ?    I drink a lot of water before bed, that way if I wake up even a bit my "I really have to pee" response kicks in and I am out of the bed and into the bathroom. edit typo   I think about it the same way i think about drinking, most people can do it in moderation and it isn't a big deal some people have an addiction that they may need to seek help for but in either case it is not my place to judge someone. My old roommate is an amazing person , she is also a self described food addict. She developed type 2 diabetes at 19, and that wasn't enough to make her change her eating and exercise habits. She is a RN now still obese still eats fast food 4 times a week. Part of her really wants to change , but for whatever reason she's not ready to take the steps needed. I still love her dearly and I want her to make changes and would be happy to help her do that but I know she has to be ready or it will never work.   Where are you standing on the scale? Standing to the back of the scale makes you lighter and the front heavier. If you are female it could also have to do with your cycle, and water retention. I would also look into your portions I worked out for 4 times a week for 3 months and didn't drop an ounce until I started counting calories, Myfitnesspal.com is a great place to start.Also sometimes it helped me to put the scale away for a while and only weigh every 2 weeks or so. Best of luck keep at it!   I teach US history to high school students, I want to start the beginning of each class this month with some interesting stories about African American Heros. I want to expose them to people they may  have never heard of though. So let me know who you wished you had learned about in High School.    I once had a man come up to me and tell me he liked my jeans, to which I replied oh thanks they are lucky brand, to which he replied I meant your phenotype. I then laughed and he said hot and smart, now you have to let me buy you a drink. More of a pick up line than a compliment but it worked we dated for three years.   I became a vegetarian when I was 12, I am now in my late 20s, I still weigh the same as I did in college. I have great blood pressure, and my resting heart beat is 55 bpm. Also I have noticed that I am aging better than many of my meat eating friends. It is better for the planet , and budget friendly. So for me it works if you are thinking about making the switch try cutting one thing out at a time, and adding to the list. Example this week I wont eat beef next week no beef or pork .    Man in a well tailored suit bonus points for a suspenders   Hey I used to work at a crisis hotline, and it sounds like your brother is taking some positive steps, he is talking about it and he is open to getting help.  So now it sounds like we need to make him a safety plan.  Step one :ask him if he has a plan to kill himself  if he does remove the means, get rid of pills guns razors whatever he has been thinking about using Step two : Ask him what has helped him in the past when things have been though , talking to people ,writing everything down, running, everyone has their own ways to deal with stress what are his encourage him to try some of those things Step Three : Ease the Pain, ask him if there is anything that helps him take his mind off of his problems even if it is only for a little while. Something that could give him a break from everything that is going on. (taking a bath, watching a movie reading a book whatever works for him) Step four: get him around people even if it isn't friends studies have shown that just going to public places can ease suicidal thoughts Step five : keep him away from drugs or booze, theses things increase the likely hood someone will attempt . Step six: Who are his trusted listeners , it sounds like you are one of them but are there other people he feels like he can talk to about what is going on ? sometimes just talking about it can help even if nothing gets solved. Listen to what he says, depressed people sometimes just want to vent what is going on and may not want a solution instead of offering ways to fix the problem ask the questions above and let him come up with his answers , he will be more likely to follow the plan if he comes up with it.  Hopefully this will keep him safe until he can get professional help. You could also incorporate a crisis hotline or the ER into his safety plan as back ups. Hope this is helpful for you and I'll keep your brother in my thoughts  Also he may not have an answer to all the questions and thats ok, the idea is to get him thinking about how he is going to get through the next few days.    1 It will seem really overrated in the beginning.  2.Do it with someone you love the first time and there is a good chance you wont regret it. 3.Once you start having sex there is no going back.  4. Don't let anyone pressure you into it, it is your choice how you use your body and who you use it with (this doesn't just go for your first time it goes for every time)   Assuming that there is a genetic component to homosexuality (which science is making a strong case for), It probably wont die out in a generation or two because like with any genetic trait their are many straight people who may not be gay themselves but may carry the gene. Much in the same way that two brown eyed parents can have a blue eyed child. On the other side of this is the fact that many gay couples do have children and use their own genetic information to do so, and just use a donor for the seamen or the egg (depending on which one they need).    My boyfriend drooled on my pillow and when we woke up i said "ewww you drooled all by my face " and he said laughing "it just means that I love you" which is how he told me he loved me for the first time. So if you want to distract a lady friend from your drool just drop the L-bomb   what's on the list?   I looked for the things that I got excited about, and for the things that pulled at my heart strings. that brought me to the idea that I wanted to help people  then I had to figure out what kind of job I could get helping people. I had always had an ability to break things down simply, so I would become a teacher. I tell me high school seniors to think about what they love and what they are good at and try to find a job that uses their talents       Well you can make the argument that he wasn't the first president, because we declared independence in 1776 and Washington didn't take office until 1789, so there was a 15 year period where other people ran the country. these men (all 8 of them) were presidents of congress because the position of president of the executive branch wasn't created until the Constitution was written. source http://www.fourwinds10.net/siterun_data/government/us_constitution/news.php?q=1244133512   I had a high school students ask if the United States was part of the United Kingdom, the class fell apart laughing. I didn't want the kid to not ever ask a question again , so I said well not anymore but it started out that way, so I can see where that could be confusing everyone stopped laughing and the kid still ask questions.   I have dyslexia and instead of learning how to sound things out and turn letters into words I learned to sight read,I know what the word looks like to me. New words are difficult because I can't really read them, often i'll ask someone to read it to me and then I can typically remember. so maybe instead of trying to teach them the sounds of the letter you could try teaching them whole words. Remember what this word sounds and looks like. I guess this would depend on the case though, when I work with special education students I try to see what strengths they have and then use them to compensate for their weakness.    I think he was being chased for smoking on school property    Network like crazy, go to every job fair you can, check out the chamber of commerce meetings, and see what job connections your professors have.The longer I am in the professional world the more I agree with the statement "it isn't what you know , but who you know." Also be punctual and play nice with others, being late and not getting along with co-workers are the main reasons people get fired.   I once saw a police officer chasing a student the kid was wearing a backpack and when the officer grabbed it the kid just threw his arms back and slipped out of the backpack. Then the weight of the back pack knocked the policeman off balance and he fell into the street. Everyone who was watching cheered.   When some coughs or sneezes and then 20 min later they are on their death bed.   Once when I was young my parents had some friends over, around 830 my sister and I went to bed I woke up around 11 because I heard my parents laughing really hard I went to the stairs banister (where I could see them and they couldn't see me). They were smoking what I thought at the time were cigarettes with little scissors. It wasn't until I got to college that I realized that they were smoking joints with hemostats.   I wish I could take homeless people to my house on cold nights let them shower, feed them dinner and sleep over. I worry about them when it is cold outside.   spelling      The Miseducation of Lauren Hill - Lauren Hill    What do you call a bear with no teeth?

I am surprised at how getting older doesn't make me sad, I am happier at 27 than I ever was at 21. With every birthday I just feel like I am turning into the person I was meant to be.   I am just taking a guess here but many people brink a Christmas tree into their house which has a somewhat minty smell so maybe the association happened that way. My other theory would be that peppermint sticks were white and red which were also Christmas colors so people bought them for decoration. However it would be hard to say if peppermint was white and red before the association , or because of the association.   	35
 Hey I had one of these once, used it at BK and the cashier just looked at it for about 10 seconds!    Put a mustache on it   Norwich is great for exploring! We have tons of stuff!   It sounds like someone who isn't into bisexual girls. I mean take what you want from it, but it's me. My profile said something similar to "I'm intimidated by bisexual girls." I got rid of it, but I never once said I'm not scared of anyone who has had homosexual relationships. Me saying I'm intimidated is my way of saying I would be nervous to be with a girl who has been with other girls. If you want to be uptight and get offended by this then so be it. Saying that just because I have my profile set to straight girls only is a sign I may have other "illogical beliefs" is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while. Why don't you bring this up with okcupid who has that setting allowed? Do something constructive with how you feel instead of targeting one person. That's the problem with a lot of people these days. So many would rather harass someone over something silly than actually do something about it.    Sounds good, I'll take care of it. Thank you!   Nothing, honestly. It's just I don't know how I would feel dating a bisexual girl. It certainly isn't homophobic, but if you feel like it is then that's fine.    Well if someone was reading my profile first before going into the detail section I would think they would remember I'm in college.   I'll take it. Thank you!    Thanks. I deleted a few pictures and and I'll try to get more real pictures.   College student working part time. Sorry.      Nice!   drannen126   Plague Inc   Kobe Port Wines at the bottom   As long as it isn't a black light, no secrets will be revealed!    I get severe goosebumps whenever I see a trailer for this movie!    What sort of beautiful display can you make out of butt plugs?    I always say sorry and laugh when I do this   Shit happens.    I feel good when something on WTF makes me want to vomit.    Damn it... You're right! Success comes from mistakes though, and I am excited for these new successes!    So happy this guy never left! Shabazz you're a UCONN hero, win or lose!    Haha I really hope that we are relevant. With MCW and a healthy Noel(fingers crossed) all we need is a legit scorer and we should be relevant!

I would guess it sort of depends on where you live and what your career is in.    I think you mean Kabletown.   Wow. I never noticed that they're the same person. What a world!   So I notice that a lot of girls say don't send me a message saying just "Hey", give it some effort. Every single first message I have received from a girl has been a simple "Hey" or a variation of hey such as "Hey cutie" or "Hi". What's up with this double standard? Why can girls say hey, but males get shunned for saying hey?   Good man. Good luck tonight and here's an up vote to you having a wonderful life with her!

Also that's an anchorman quote... I feel like it's amazing.   I've had this account for awhile now. This is account number two actually. My username is drannen126, I'm just looking for some constructive feedback! Thanks!   Yeah true. I might as well make some banter when I see her randomly. It's the thought of talking to a person I don't know. Once I do it I'm fine.    Well... you know... that would involve me...  having confidence... which I don't have.   Just take it super slow this time of year. I try not to get involved with people in December, January and February. I just don't like the idea of spending money on a person I haven't been together with for a decent amount of time.   I'll still chat people up during these months, but I'll take it slow and just keep my options open. Don't totally become a hermit. Just be that neighbor who talks about the weather when you're both picking up your newspaper.    Oh, I will.    I'm glad I saw this thread. I work next to a Target and there is this girl I see on OKCupid and she also works at Target. I'm nervous to message her because I go to Target almost everyday and I want to avoid being awkward. Screw it. I might go and message her now!   I saw this while taking a dump before a class at my college.     	45
 Nope :(   Guys this has been bothering me for a while. I was watching The Usual Suspects and Kevin Pollock reminded me of this actor. He is short (I think), white, has curly hair and I think a receding hairline. For some reason I associate him with a cigar, Joe Pesci and an Academy Award. I think he is smiling wide in his IMDB page. Please please help me out :)   Edit: GUYS GUYS GUYS: IT IS GARY SINISE (LT.DAN) I LOVE YOU ALL!  	2
 Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I have some vinyls I've gotten from my grandmother and would love to listen to them, but I don't own a record player. I don't even know where to start and what to look for. Can someone help me find a good starter record player for under $150?   Okay, so I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hwb6k/what_are_some_good_movies_to_show_to_a_group_of/) a few days ago looking for help figuring out what movie to watch on our movie night.   After looking at the comments, and comparing them to the movies I actually own, I've put together a list of seven movies. However, I can't decide which to watch. In the original post, I talked about what my friends liked. "They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room."  The List: Pulp Fiction, Event Horizon, Fight Club, Children of Men, Dredd, Crank, and Se7en.  So which of these would be the best crowd pleaser? The one everyone would be most likely to enjoy? Which is the easiest to get into, no matter what kinds of movies you like?         Looking for a great sci-fi horror movie to watch. I love sci-fi but I also want to be horrified, terrified, grossed out, etc  Any ideas?   So me and some friends are doing a movie night Friday and I'm trying to figure out what to show.   A little info on my friends. They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room.   Also I'd prefer something that didn't come out in the last two years. Thanks guys!   [Link to movie](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Idiots_and_Angels/70119917?trkid=2361637)  I watched this not knowing what to expect and was immediately drawn in by its animation style. Tells a very interesting story about a selfish morally corrupted man who one day wakes up with wings on his back. I was really amazed by not only the animation but also how it tells this story with no dialogue. It even gets a little Cronenberg-y at some parts. Definitely give it a watch.     Lets fantasize for a minute here. Lets say that there is no way it will be bad. That they will get everything right and it will do justice to the original show. That it will without a doubt be great.   And I'm not talking about a remake of a show. I'm talking about a sort of continuation of the show. I'm talking about something like the Rugrats Movie, Simpsons Movie, Serenity, and Arrested Development.   So what tv shows would you like to see get a movie?   I mean he's so good with creature effects and Pacific Rim sort of reminds me of Power Rangers in a way. Just a thought.    For example, I hope Aaron Paul makes the jump to film because he's a great actor that should get more roles.    Saw White House Down then I went to a casino and I was wondering what games have levels that take place at a casino or the White House?   I really love the Mardi Gras level in Hitman Blood Money. It was probably the first time I saw that many NPCs in one level.   What are some really good flying games for this current generation of consoles?   [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQcCHVYRXHo)  First time posting here. My friend and I decided to challenge ourselves and see what we could come up with in only 24 hours. Would love some feedback. We loved our idea so much that we'd like to make a full length film of it some day so, criticisms, tips, and suggestions are more than welcomed!   I'm really interested in seeing this but I can't find out where it's being released at. On my local theaters website they have a list of movies they'll be showing up to middle August but Only God Forgives isn't listed so I'm assuming my local theater isn't showing it.   Anyone know where it'll be?      I'm not talking about a movie being turned into a stage play. What I mean is, what if the movie was shot as a musical.    I have some khakis that need altering.    I love Nine Inch Nails and think they're great, but even if they weren't great, Nine Inch Nails is such a cool name.      Also what items are they?            So my friend got me into World of Tanks and while we were setting it up we started talking about the voice chat in the game, or any pc game in general, and thought it be cool to have some sort of voice modulator software, where whenever we talk, people hear like a delocated, super low voice. For example, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=YlxxxXz4T-s#t=16s)  So my question is, is there any software that can do this?  Again, if this isn't the right place, please tell me where I can ask this, thanks, guys!   Loved Just Cause 2 and was wondering if anyone's said anything about it at E3 this year.   [Picture](http://imgur.com/yrLLfCQ)  My friend is moving away this week and I wanted to give her a photo of all of us. The problem is that it was taken on an iphone so it's super fuzzy and grainy and the quality isn't that great.  Could someone improve the coloring to make it less yellow and more "natural" looking? Also is it possible to make it clearer or less grainy? Just an overall better looking picture?  I really appreciate any help. We just want our friend to have a nice picture of all of us all.  Edit: Thank you /u/screwball2 and /u/braceyourself87 these are great! I really appreciate it!   I'm talking about some not so well known directors that have only done a few movies, or they can even be well known directors that make movies every so often.  My pick is Gaspar Noe. Dude makes great movies, but he's only done a few and hasn't made one since 2009.   Me and some friends are going to have a movie night tonight. We want to see something sick and disturbing. Almost all of us, including me, are very squeamish so we thought it'd be fun to be grossed out.  I wanna know what the most disturbing, gruesome and grisly gore you've seen in a movie is. I'm not talking about someone getting shot and blood sprays out. I'm talking head crushing, bone breaking, gut spilling out sort of things.   What scene of violence or gore in a movie has made you cringe the hardest?   I watched Kill List recently and really liked it. I liked how it starts off pretty standard but as the movie progresses, things start getting darker, stranger, and more evil.  Are there any other good movies that start off pretty standard, but throughout the course of the movie things just get darker, more evil, more insane, stranger, and just all out worse?   Like the protagonist is totally sane at the start, but throughout the movie he experiences things that get increasingly unsettling, violent, dark, and evil and by the time the movie is over he is a different, emotionally and mentally broken man. Anything like that?  Edit: Requiem for a Dream is a good example of what I'm talking about.   I'm looking for some good mature adult graphic novels. But not mature as in violent or gory. Mature as in language and subject matter. Basically an R rated comedy in graphic novel form. Something funny, but also very adult and mature. Anything that fits the bill?   I can't remember the title. It was something along the lines of "Getting drunk in front of the movie theater" or something like that? It was about a young adult girl? I read a little bit of this novel a while ago and liked it but don't remember what it was called.    I'm looking for some graphic novels to read that are realistic. As in, they're about real, normal people. Not super heroes. Not zombies. Not monsters. Just regular average Joes or average Janes.   One of my favorite graphic novels is Daytripper. It's about a guy and his life from his childhood all the way to his adulthood. No superheros or supernatural stuff. Just a guy and his experiences in life.  Or some good heist graphic novels, or cop novels, detective novels, war novels, or even just novels about a person or group of people. Basically graphic novels about people who aren't superhuman. They're just like you and me.  As much as I think superheros are cool, I'm just fascinated with human drama. Human interactions. Human problems.  I hope I explained well enough. If you need more details and information about what I'm looking for, just let me know.   What are some great graphic novels that aren't well known?      Also, what would you do?  I choose link karma instead of comment karma or combining the two because it'd get ridiculously high.  Mine is 1961, so I guess it'd be interesting.   It was a post withe the title "Whoever wins this game..." or something like that. It was about a game that drops you into google streetview and you have to make your way to an airport. Tried looking for it but it seems like the post just disappeared. Anyone know where it is or what game it was?   When people talk about funniest movies, they tend to talk about movies made in the 20th century. So what do you think are the funniest movies of the 21st century?   I'm getting sick of long hair and since it's summer I'm thinking of getting a haircut. But I don't know where to go. I know MHA says to stay away from places like Super Cuts. So where should I go? Salon? Barber? Hair studio? What kind of place is best to get a good stylish and fashionable haircut?      It can be a character, too. Just any famous person or character.   I was looking for a vinyl of The Fragile and someone mention they heard there was going to be a repress of it? Is this true? If it is, when? And if it is, does this mean I can finally get The Fragile vinyl at a reasonable price?   I was looking for a vinyl of The Fragile and someone mention they heard there was going to be a repress of it? Is this true? If it is, when? And if it is, does this mean I can finally get The Fragile vinyl at a reasonable price?   I'm working on losing weight. I have a diet set up and I'm starting to run. However, I know that weight lifting is an important part of losing weight and getting in shape. So my question is: As someone who can't afford a gym membership or weights, what is a good substitute for weights? A box of books? What DIY stuff can I bench press or curl?   Basically what mom and/or dad from a movie or tv show would be cool to have? Why? You can mix and match mom and dads from any movie or tv show to make awesome combinations of parents if you want.    Everybody's bashing the new Xbox talking about, "Oh it looks like a VCR! Hurhur!" But I actually think its kind of sexy. I like the simple sleek design of it. It seems like its built for efficiency. And besides, when it comes down to it, the look of the console is near the bottom of the list of things that matter.   What do you consider a must see movie simply because of what they achieve or do on a technical level(music, camera work, sound, cgi, effects, cinematography, etc.)? Regardless of how good you think the movie actually is in terms of acting or writing or story.   For example, Enter the Void is a movie many would consider bad or boring and not that great. However, I think it's a must see purely because of what they achieve with the camera work and cinematography.  Also, Avatar. Many like it, but there are also many who don't think it's that great and has a bland story and average acting, but I also consider it a must see because of its groundbreaking effects.  So what movies do you think are must sees from a technical standpoint?   So yeah. People tell me it's great, but have never told me why. All they say is, "It's great man. Just give it a shot." "What's great about it?" "Just watch it."  So no one as ever really argued for it or given me reasons why I'd like it. I like fantasy stuff. And I appreciate a great story with great characters. But I have a hard time looking past the fact that it's animated and about kids.  But like I said, no one has ever given me reasons why I should watch it and what makes it great. I want to check it out, and I'm open minded,  but I can't convince myself because I know nothing about it. So, change my view.   So I've been trying to convince my mother to watch this show for a while now. I know she'd love it because she loves these types of shows. But she won't give it a chance because it's animated and that automatically makes it a "little kids show." So can you guys help me develop an argument to convince her to at least give it a shot? How did you convince someone you know to watch it?   Disturbing or terrifying videos/audio recordings are welcomed too. Basically things that just don't sit right with you and you find unsettling.   As someone with social anxiety who's also super shy, this situation makes me want to die.   I have social anxiety and this situation makes me want to die.       It takes me about three months for my facial hair to resemble anything close to a beard. Is there any way to speed this process up? Rogaine on my face? Anything?            Basically a subreddit where people post awesome fan made trailers and mashups. Combining other trailers. Also creating tv show intro mashups.   I hate Betty White. But it's not her fault. It's everyone else's fault. She so overrated. Everyone's like "OMG Betty White is the funniest person! She's the greatest! She's so much win! I love her so much!" Honestly she's just humorous. Don't get me wrong, she's a kind person. But I absolutely hate that everyone goes nuts for Betty White. It seems like whenever she's in a movie or show, it's only so the producers can be like, "Look we have Betty White! We're relevant!"   She's everywhere just for the sake of being everywhere. And her show Off Their Rockers is kind of bad. I guess I don't hate Betty White. She nice and fine. I just hate the absolute over hype about her.    Okay so I saw this anime movie a long time ago and I've never seen it again. I have no idea what it was called or what it was about. In fact I didn't even see all of it. I only watched one part and have been wanting to see it ever since.  The scene I saw involved a man and a little girl. There was also a cyborg like woman attacking them. This was in like the near future I believe. So the cyborg woman attacks the man with some sort of hand blade thing. I think. But the man holds up his hand and the blade goes through his hand and stops right at his eye. It was also raining I believe. And this took place within a skyscraper I believe. Please identify this! It's been haunting me for years!   I've played a lot of Skyrim. I've seen almost all it has to offer. It's really starting to bore me. What are some ways or challenges I can do to make it interesting again?  Edit: I'm on 360.   I'm 19. One friend who works all the time and when he's not working, he's with his girlfriend. So I never hang out with him.   Weekends suck because I always spend them alone.   I mean, I have many "friends" but we never hang out. I only have one real friend. I always invite people to stuff but they rarely accept.   I'm a nice, funny, caring guy. What's wrong? I just want to enjoy my life because I don't know how long I'll be alive, but its hard to enjoy life alone.  I have some friends who frequent Reddit. A few know my username. So if anyone who knows me sees this, don't let me know that you've seen this.   Thanks for listening, everyone.       What song do you think has the best singing you've ever heard?   Saw this movie a while ago. Can't remember title for the life of me.                   Didn't know where else to put this. I just want to see it get made. The creator has said that The Jungle Movie, the next and final HA! movie, was suppose to be the last movie. It would've answered all sorts of things like what happened to Arnolds parents, what happens between him and Helga amongst wrapping up  the stories of all the other kids. [Here's an interesting article](http://tendraheyarnold.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/confirmed-notes-about-the-jungle-movie/) where Craig Bartlett, the creator, talks about the unmade movie and what would've been in it.   It saddens me that this might never be made. I just need closure!   So what movies have made you cry just out of the sheer beauty of it? I watched To the Wonder tonight and there was one part where I started crying because of how sweet and beautiful it was and all I said was, "It's so beautiful!" as I was crying.         My friend asked me if I knew anyone who could photoshop. I don't so I came to you guys. [Here is the pic](http://i.imgur.com/X6vv7ju.jpg) he wants edited. [Here is what he wants edited onto his glasses](http://i.imgur.com/wVvYJtW.jpg) as if it were reflected onto his glasses. Sort of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/pfxg80W.jpg) for example. Thank you so much for your time!         First off I wanna say that I don't hate this movie. In fact, I really liked it a lot. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I think it might have been too over hyped.  Before it came out I saw some reviews that said this movie was incredible and it was the bloodiest movie ever made. Now while it WAS bloody, I felt only one scene was super bloody. I was expecting every death to be crazy amounts of blood everywhere. Also, the trailers were absolutely incredible and did and amazing job of hyping me up. And finally the poster. The poster said "The most terrifying movie you will ever experience." That tagline made me believe I was about to see a remarkable piece of horror.  And the movie wasn't really that scary, it was more just violent. I was expecting to not be able to look at any of the deaths, but it was actually pretty easy to watch. I felt more grossed out watching the original Evil Dead. Now, again, I still really liked and enjoyed this movie, but did the marketing over hype this movie? Or was this all my fault because I set my expectations so high?    Going camping in a week. I wanna put together a playlist of some good camp fire music. You know some good accoustic stuff. Stuff that sort of have the feel of someone sitting at a camp fire with a guitar playing. Maybe not just accoustic. Maybe some nice mellow stuff. So what do you guys think should be on this playlist?  What I have on the playlist so far to give you guys an idea  Over the rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo'e  Guaranteed and Society - Eddie Vedder   Going camping in a week. I wanna put together a playlist of some good camp fire music. You know some good accoustic stuff. Stuff that sort of have the feel of someone sitting at a camp fire with a guitar playing. Maybe not just accoustic. Maybe some nice mellow stuff.  So what do you guys think should be on this playlist?  Edit: What I have on the playlist so far to give you guys an idea  Over the rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo'e  Guaranteed and Society - Eddie Vedder   Are there any fictional movies like Samsara in terms of cinematography? It's one of the most breath takingly beautiful movies I've ever seen and I'm curious if there are any other movies that aren't documentaries that have similar cinematography or even similar thematic elements.    Who decides what commercial to show and when? How do they decide this? Is it random or on a playlist? How do commercials come on automatically?                            So I have a lot of money and I wanted to spice my game up by giving my character an overhaul in terms of his looks. The problem is I don't know what to change and how to make him look. I need inspiration. You think you can post a screenshot of your character? Show your character off! Maybe one of your awesome characters will inspire my new character. I'm just not really creative and my character's super generic. Thanks!            Okay so I watched 500 Days of Summer and it kind of reminded me of Blue Valentine in that it was sort of a story about the rise and fall of a relationship told in a nonlinear fashion. I want to see some more movies like this.  So, are there any good movies about the rise and fall of a relationship? Movies where you see the beginning and end of a relationship? It can be about the relationship between husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, between friends, parent and child, etc., any relationship told in either nonlinear or linear fashion. It just really fascinates me to see how a relationship progresses from two people getting to know one another, to loving each other, then to see it start to crumble and eventually fall. Blue Valentine is one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of the saddest I've ever seen. Thanks!   So I want to get Operation Flashpoint but don't know which one to get. So simply, which is better(mechanics, gameplay, graphics, difficulty, fun, etc.)?   First off, sorry if this post doesn't belong here. If it doesn't, please let me know where to put it, thanks!  I can't decide which show to watch so I came to ask you guys. Basically, which show should I watch? Which is more worth my time watching? Thanks! Note: I haven't seen any of these shows before.  * Arrested Development  * Lost  * Mad Men  * The Killing  * Archer  * Twin Peaks  * Hell on Wheels  * House of Cards  * Bob's Burgers  * Parks and Recreation  * It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia   * Louie  * Alias   I'm new here and just wanted to say hi.      Okay so I've only played like three quarters of Mass Effect 1 and stopped because my game was messing up so I never went back. Recently I've been wanting to play a Mass Effect game. The only thing stopping me is the fact that I'm like two and a half games behind and don't have that kind of time to play both Mass Effect 2 and 3 on top of finishing the first one.  I listen to a couple of gaming podcasts so I kind of know what happens in all of the Mass Effect games and kind of know what's going on. So I want to get Mass Effect 3. My question is: Is it a good idea to jump in the third one without finishing the first and not playing the second? Will I know what's going on or get lost? Also, should I get ME3 or ME2? I've heard from almost everyone that ME2 is better, but I'll only have time to play one of them so I figured I'd get ME3 because it's the last one. Basically, which one will give me the better experience(better mechanics, story, fun, stuff to do, etc.)?      [How does these kinds optical illusions work](http://media.log-in.ru/i/3dstereo_2.jpg)? How are they made? I don't get it.   What's your favorite song that was written specifically for a movie?  Mine's probably Down to Earth from Wall-e. Yours doesn't have to be a Disney song, though.            So I was driving and some nut turned in front of me and scared me to death. My heart skipped a beat. Then I thought, what happens in your body when that happens? What causes it? What's going on?      Like, if I saw a man who weighed 125 lbs I would think that he looked gross and unhealthy and like a skeleton. However, when you see a woman who weighs 125 lbs she looks healthy and normal? Why do women look different than men who weigh the same?    I've been out of high school for almost two years contemplating what to do in terms of education. I've always known what I wanted to do: Film. So after tons of reading and thinking I've decided that I want to be a professor of film. And in my free time I'd work on my film. So my question is what classes did you take to be a professor of your chosen subject? How long did it take?   So this documentary is fantastic. It's basically interviews with big filmmakers about digital vs film. Really interesting! Definitely worth your time.   [Here's the link for it on Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Side_by_Side/70239473?trkid=2361637)   Also, who are some actors/actresses that don't deserve all the work they get and should be getting less roles?  My pick for actor that should get more roles: Jared Leto. He's good in everything he's in, but I don't see him enough. Runner up: Ben Foster  My pick for actor who shouldn't be getting as many roles as they do: Adam Sandler. He's a funny guy with good acting chops, but he hasn't made a quality movie in a long time.       First off i want to say that if this isn't a good place to post this please tell me a good place to post it. So I play Skyrim on the Xbox and I've put a ton of time into it and have a high ranking character, but eventually I want to get a pc. I wanna add mods to it. However I don't want to have to start from scratch. So my question is, is there any possible way to move my character profile from my Xbox to my pc? Could I import my save somehow or somehow create a fake save? Anything I can do?      I've applied at nearly 100 places within the last 4 months. I've been unemployed for about 8 months. I'm about to go to college and need a job, but haven't been able to get one for 8 months despite the fact I apply to multiple places a week. I mean, I don't even get a call. I never hear from the job, so I have no closure about if they even saw my application or not.   This upsets me because I've been searching for 8 months, however I have friends and family members that got jobs after looking for only a couple of weeks. And we have the same amount of qualifications. What gives? How come the people who actually need and want a job and have been looking forever seem to stay unemployed? And the people who don't need a job, but want one just so they'll have money to buy material objects they don't need seem to get jobs easy? This blows.   First off I want to say that I'm not sure if this post belongs here, and if it doesn't, please let me know where it goes, thanks.  So I got a speeding ticket today. Why does this piss me off? Because I've only sped twice in my life counting today. Both times I've gotten a ticket. And both times unintentional. I know a bunch of friends and family that speed on purpose all the time and never once have they gotten pulled over! Why me? This blows!   Also, I was ONE mile away from my house!   Hey guys. I'm pretty new here and have some experience with guns but I have a question. I just bought a used leather holster. It was made for a S W 659 but it will hold any pistol of the same size because it's not specifically molded for the S W. So what are some other pistols the same size and dimensions as the S W 659? Thanks for the help!      What are some movies where a person or group of people travel across a country (any country) and they experience the various natural wonders and beauties of mother nature as well as various cultures. And even meet some strange people along the way? Something in the vein of Into the Wild or Wild America? Not a documentary though. An actual movie.   I'm looking for movies that are epic, but not epic as in huge. I mean epic as in the movie spans across a vast amount of years. Something in the vein of Bicentennial Man. Or maybe Forrest Gump?   What line or quote from any movie or tv show is your favorite? Feel free to post links to videos or pics of the quote.   What exactly are electronic cigarettes and what makes the different and healthier than regular cigarettes?   There was a game I played a lot in either the late 90s or early 00s. It was an internet based game on a website. I mostly played it in the computer lab. It had to do with a fox I think? It had multiple levels. Each level was a different puzzle I think? One of the levels had you bouncing a bubble with another bubble. You had to keep the bubble in the air and it couldn't touch the ground. Again, it has to do with a fox. I think it might have had the word "fox" in the title or url. Please help!   What scene from a movie was serious or not meant to be funny but had you laughing hard?   I saw the Fast and Furious 6 trailer during the super bowl and it got me thinking. I remember the first Fast and Furious way back when it was just a small crime movie about an undercover cop in the street racing world of a California city. Now it's evolved into international heist/race action thriller taking place in world locations with huge action. Not that I'm complaining, I just find it interesting how this franchise started as one thing and has changed into something else entirely different.   So, what other movie franchises or tv shows have started as one thing and turned into something else entirely? For better or worse?   **EDIT:** I'm no talking about what franchises stated off good and ended up bad. I'm basically saying what franchises or shows have basically changed genres. Example: The Fast and Furious used to be a small crime movie and is now an over the top international action movie.    Hey I'm new here, but I love writing. Was wondering what you thought of my short story. Give me some constructive criticism. [It's called NDE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hU0t4aEFRc3pWTVk/edit) It's a working title.   Hey guys I'm new here and also started collecting last summer, so I thought I'd post some pics of my collection so far.  1. Memphis/TN/USA  2. August 4  3. Anything mind-bending  4. Probably Charlie's Angels  5. Mission Impossible 2  6. In the Name of the King  7. Either Christopher Nolan, Terrence Malick, or Zack Snyder  8. The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection  9. Kill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair  10. Alphabetical  11. IMDB?  I'm planning on adding to my collection frequently, but here's what I have so far.  [My collection so far.](http://imgur.com/a/6DTiI)    I saw the Impossible and it's one of the best movies not only of the year, but in a while. It has incredible effects, acting, and directing. So why is it basically non existent at all these award shows and top ten lists? How come this fantastic film is getting no nominations at practically any award shows and getting hardly any recognition from critics and columnists? I've seen tons of websites and magazines talk about what they think are the best films, but no one mentions the Impossible. What gives?   Out of all the years the Oscars has been around, what do you think is the biggest snub in Oscar history?   I saw Zero Dark Thirty on Friday and I was thinking this is such an American movie. But, is it the most American movie? Probably not, but what do you guys think is the most American movie ever made?   Also, if you had to pick a movie to represent America and what America is, what would it be? Like what movie embodies best what America is? Like, if you gave an American film to a foreign person in order to show them what America is really like and what we're all about, what film would that be?   Pretty self explanatory. I would love to see a sequel or prequel to the Iron Giant. So, Reddit, what is your pick? Also, what would it be about?   Also, what would they be? They can be anything. Your relative, sibling, friend, your dentist, your teacher, local cop, weather man for your local news station, etc., etc.. They can be anything! Anything!   Guys, we've already seen posts about what were the best movies of 2012 and the best cinematography and best performances of 2012. But what do you guys think are the best scores of 2012? Or best soundtracks or best original songs of 2012? I really loved the scores for Samsara and Dredd because they really captured the mood and feeling of those films. But what do you guys think are the best?   Hey I'm looking for a show. It was a Japanese game show that came on G4 and I loved it. It was a show that had a ton of extremely difficult obstacle courses. One of them was had people unicycling along super thin platforms and hopping upstairs. That's the only obstacle course I can remember right now. Please help!   Hey guys. Recently I've had an urge to play a game with good tactical multiplayer. Something along the lines of Spec Ops from Call of Duty(best example I could think of). I want something they relies heavily on tactics, communication, and teamwork in order to win/complete objectives. It can be co-op, online or offline, doesn't matter. Or even player vs player/team vs team. I don't really care what genre it is either so long as it's good tactical multiplayer/co-op. Thanks, guys!  Edit: Preferably console games. I don't have a decent pc.         Hey guys and gals. I was playing spec ops: the line and noticed in the settings that you could change the filter on the game to change the look of it. This reminded me of red dead redemption. In RDR, you could change the brightness and contrast and make it as vibrant and colorful as you want, or as desaturated as you want. You could even make it black and white if you so desired. I thought this was an awesome feature as it allowed you to tailor your game to the look and feel that YOU wanted. So my question is are there any other games for consoles that allow you to change/adjust the color/contrast/look of the game?    Hey everyone! Listen, I'm pretty new to photography so I need some help looking for a good wide angle lens. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i. My budget is preferably no more than $150 and the most I'll absolutely go is $200. Also, how reliable is ebay for buying lenses? Thanks for all the help!   I was wondering if you guys can suggest a movie that will make me cry. I'm a guy and I've seen a lot of movies, but none have made me cry. I hear people all the time talking about a movie they saw that made them cry, and I want to experience that. I want to see a movie that affects me so much on a personal/mental/emotional level that it makes me cry. I don't really know why I want to experience this other than the fact that I haven't ever experienced it. There are a few movies though that have brought me close to tears such as Requiem for a Dream and Lion King. I would say it takes a lot to make me cry. I mean I cried when my golden retriever died and I cried when my grandparents died, but that's basically it. A friends son past away recently and I didn't even cry (I don't mean that in a proud way). I mean sure I was sad, but I didn't cry. So I think it has to affect me on a personal level. So can you guys suggest a movie so incredibly sad and depressing that if it doesn't make me cry then there's something wrong with me?   So I'm having family photos done tomorrow at around noon. It's going to be outdoors. I live in Tennessee. What should I wear? I'm going to go shopping today. I'm looking for some jeans and a shirt and possibly a jacket. So, generally speaking, what colors/patterns should I get? What kind of jeans/shirt should I get? If I got a jacket of some sort, what kind should I get? It's a pretty casual shoot. I really want to look nice because these will be the last photos of us for a good while. Thanks guys!   So I want to start off by saying I'm sorry if this isn't a good place to post this, but it seems like it belongs here. Also, I'd like to say that yes, Nathan Fillion would be the perfect Nathan Drake, but I think we can agree that it won't happen unfortunately. Now, the person I think should play Nathan Drake is Bradley Cooper. Hear me out. The guy is a pretty solid actor. He can be funny and he can be serious. He also has the physique to be able to handle a role like this. The guy's got star power! This is just my opinion, but what do you guys think? Every time this topic comes up, Brad Cooper's name isn't even mentioned.       Okay so you know how at the end when Joe sees Sara get shot and the screen's all gold, and Joe says he saw everything, a mother die for her son, a man kill for his wife yadda yadda yadda. Then he says something about how the loop is closed or something like that. I think it should have ended there implying that he caused Cid to be the man he grows up to be, and the events in the movie will repeat itself forever, therefore creating an endless "loop". I think that's how it should have ended. I think it would have created a bigger impression and been a better ending. But this is all just my opinion.   I don't know if this goes here, but here I go. I want to know why so many pc users relentlessly hate on Apple products. I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything. I want to have a serious discussion about this because I am genuinely curious. Like when my friend (who hates Apple and loves pc and Android) comes over and I say my iphone or macbook is acting up, he says it's "because Apple made it." I've asked him what his problem with Apple is before and he has never given me an answer other than "because Apple sucks." In fact, most of my pc friends react this way. So in an attempt to get valid reasons why people who use pc and Android tend to hate Apple, I've come to you guys for answers. Again, I'm not trying to start a flame war. I just want some insight on this issue.    I saw a movie either in the late 90s or early 00s where a guy transformed into a woman (I think only at night?). I think when he was a woman he had black hair, but I'm not sure. I remember one scene where he was a woman and some guy (with glasses?) was trying to sleep with him/her. Again I'm not 100% certain on some of these details.      I ask this because in order to make one, they will have to reboot Batman again. Plus they will have to reboot Superman again because this new Man of Steel (based on the trailer) will be like Batman and won't allow a way for other DC heroes to exist in its world. In my opinion, I would rather have a great Batman series, Superman series, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, etc. if it meant that there wouldn't be a Justice League movie rather than have crappy movies of these super heroes just so a JL movie can happen. So how badly do you guys want a JL movie? Bad enough to have crappy super hero movies just to have your JL movie? Or would you rather continue having great super hero movies if it meant there would be no JL movie?       Hi, I'm new to Reddit and relatively new to photography. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and would like to start taking pictures of things like insects, plants, eyes, and other small things. What kind of lens should I get? What should I look for? Like I said, I'm relatively new to photography so I don't know a lot of the terminology, so could you please answer as if you were talking to an amateur. Also, if you could maybe suggest some lenses, that would be helpful, too. Thanks you guys for any help you can give! Also, any tips for macro photography would be nice! Not necessary, just nice!     	153
 It's so important, since using an AHA (a weak, non AB one, but a gycolic acid nonetheless), I have had so many new freckles along my cheekbones despite only skipping sunscreen on somedays when I go out for just 30 mins  Ideally, you should be wearing sunscreen everytime you step outdoors to protect your skin   I have been considering buying the Mizon Snail Ampoule and Recovery Cream to improve my acne scarring. I have very pink scars on my forehead and hyperpigmentation that I'd like to improve and so wanted to ask if anyone has seen improvements after using snail products?    Also, any other snail products would be greatly welcomed, its just the Mizon ones are available in the UK (where I'm based)   Ahh thank you!!! I didn't think to look in other subreddits *shakes head*   Has anyone in the UK bought things from RoseRoseShop or any other Korean websites and avoided customs?  I really want to buy a few products to get a full routine going but I hate dealing with Customs, VAT and processing fees upon arrival.   There are a few Sasa stores dotted around the city that stock some Missha from what I remember, they also have loads of sheet masks.  There is also a 'drugstore' called Watsons that sell sheet masks as well as generic stuff i.e. Maybelline etc. but I only go their for their own sheet masks. When I go to Beijing, I normally buy packs of sheet masks e.g. My beauty diary and they're about 40-50, which is about GP 5-6 so that works out to be super cheap for me. Watson's also have their own brand of sheet masks that I quite like, especially the Birds Nest ones. Watson's often give free samples at the check out too!!   If you're going to be around the Sanlitun area both Watson's and Sasa are in the area.   If you have anything else to ask about Beijing, please do, I was born there, raised in London and spend at least a month there every year.   How does the Skinfood salmon concealer work for you? I have the worst dark circles anyone has ever seen...   Have fun in Barca!!!   Thank you thank you!! Should I just use the BHA or AHA just in the evenings? I think if I used it twice a day, it would be a bit too much. I'll probably go with the Mizon snail repair cream, it seems to be quite popular, thank you again!!!   Thank you thank you!! I'll definitely step up the oil cleansing to a bit of Castor oil. Thanks again!!!   Could anyone help me with starting a routine please? I've been reading around this subreddit for a while now and still feel unsure about what to use.   I just turned 18 and have combo skin- T-zone gets oily overnight (not so much during the day) but the rest of my face is pretty normal.   I do tend to get acne on my forehead and recently, get painful pimples toward my hairline.  I also tend to have a lot of blocked pores on my forehead and this can sometimes lead to squeezing *sorry sorry, it's awful I know* so I'd love to use something to target the blocked pores and blackheads around my nose and also to lift some freckles along my cheekbone.   **AM**:     I don't wash my face with a cleanser in the morning, just cold water, and since doing this, have seen a positive improvement in frequency of blemishes.  - Mario Badescu Special Cucumber lotion (rec by a online sales staff but have seen no difference)   - Mario Badescu Glycolic toner -nice but doesn't do a terrible lot   - Instanaturals Vitamin C serum   - Kiehls Dark Spot corrector: have not seen any difference   - Kiehls Oil-free daily moisturiser   - Lancme SPF: would like to change to an Asian suncreen maybe the Biore aqua, this pills when I rub my face, especially when I';m exercising.     **PM**   Nothing really changes except I use the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit Cleanser and Coconut oil to oil pull and:    - Rosehip oil to massage the acne scars   - 3x week I use a facemask, varying from Origins's clay mask, Origin's hydrating mask, and the many sheet masks I bring back from China     All in all, I'd really appreciate it if you guys could recommend some AHA and BHA toners to clean the pores and make my skin glow and some brightening products e.g. serums or essences to lift some of my freckles and acne scarring, and maybe a cheap essence to use with the DIY sheetmasks that brightens and/or hydrates.     I currently live in the UK but have family in China who can send some products over too and I will be going to Seoul in October, so any UK sellers not listed on the list in the sidebar would also be lovely!!!   Thank you!!!!   Pearl Cream- its a very rich moisturiser that has been around for decades. Has a slight scent but in winter, I apply it to any dry patches and massage with rosehip oil and they're gone.         I found this article on on how Swedish fathers were able to spend more time with their children due to Sweden's generous parental leave. My favourite photograph is the one of the father painting his daughter's nails whilst holding his other baby      I hope someone goes and buys all of these in one go...   Diner scene in Reservoir Dogs, a big group of breakfast food (my favourite type)      What do you do during long times of solitude, or if you're waiting e.g. when waiting for transport, or walking long distances by yourself? Do you find listening to music etc . soothing during these normally mundane times?   Update: Success!! Went on a few, first few, the T bar ended up being flung whilst getting off but then it was all good. Except when there were gale force gusts and my leg cramped up trying to stay on.   I did wonder how else you'd stay on by yourself, I suppose this way makes it easier for me to jolt myself off as well...   If I am unfortunate enough, I shall follow in your ways and perhaps even point out someone else   I'm going skiing on Tuesday but just found out that the runs I will be going on will mostly be T-bar lists. Just wondering if anyone has any advice for loading and unloading? I can work a Poma fine, is it similar except just slide the bar behind you instead of straddling it?  	22
 **Harper Lees recipe for cracklin cornbread**  First, catch your pig. Then ship it to the abattoir nearest you. Bake what they send back. Remove the solid fat and throw the rest away. Fry fat, drain off liquid grease, and combine the residue (called cracklings) with: 1  cups water-ground white meal 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 egg 1 cup milk Bake in very hot oven until brown (about 15 minutes). Result: one pan crackling bread serving 6. Total cost: about $250, depending upon size of pig. Some historians say this recipe alone fell the Confederacy.

 Blacks and Obama love welfare.   Bet trayvon was a stupid little shit like this. He hit the wrong guy I guess.   Oh what a fucking surprise, they are all black.   Black girls have so many kids.   Damn she was hot and I would fuck her. Welp take me to jail I must be a sick pedo.   Of course he is a nigger   He needs to go on ninja warrior and destroy that warp wall.   Lets go kill some zombies now!   Mel Gibson would be intrigued.   Send it to Korea, they will make good use of him.   Well drive a truck then. my pops makes decent pay doing that, and they're hiring tons of people last time I checked.   Amen!   Fuck you, You cnt live on 8.25/hr without some type of food stamps or government help.   Walter white as a boy  	14

Love it. Find smart and weird people.   Language is the greatest invention of mankind but it is also our biggest brainwasher. I like to close my eyes and think of ideas, abstract concepts,and thought experiments through visualization. It uses a different part of the brain than language  This overcomes the limations and creative blocks that language puts my the mind under. I invented several ideas with  this method. Tesla use to do this. Would be neat , but not sure how possible, if in the future visualization could be incorporated into language.      Forgot what we where talking about.  Where you talking about bypassing laguage or entering black hole to another universe in the next couple hundred years?   Have an abstract idea how this could be done.   That is near black hole not in black hole. LoL. Do you think black holes could be connected to other universes. Known Quantum math doesn't work in Black holes so I am asking questions just to ask questions. Have any crazy ideas.    I know stupid question but a least I understand topic a little.   Thank you link. I will check  it out.    Good response. I should have made question with out serious.  I think maybe our universe it connected to a black hole of parent universe. Not sure. Just crazy idea   Who is Jayden? New to reddit. Is this inside joke.   I think science is wrong. It is not cause and effect but causes and effects. Science is the best we have but don't sell me that the cause and effect solution 100% reflects the real world. I call science a "good enough" tool. Correlation is not causation.   Language is flawed.   Is there time in a black hole?     Good answer. Just making sure you where not a fundamentalist.   I am 99% sure of many things but am not 100% sure of anything.   Is that your opinion you seem so sure you are correct. Half my mind says yes the other half no      I think the way to fix our campaign finance laws is for there to be a law that states only a US citizen can give money for the campaign of his/her district. Why should someone like Donald Trump, the Koch brothers, or George Soros be able to give to a represative of Montana. Also, these donations should be made Public record. No donations from international organizations like corporations or unions allowed.     On behalf of the President of the United States and a grateful nation...     Let out the inner animal.

This increases white blood cells in area of infection.    Cool, thought this was my idea. If we could only get another visionary President like Kennedy we could make this happen. Thank you for link. Going to check it out.   As long as this country had mandatory exercise and heathy eating.   When the law is lawless you have a civic duty to humanity to break it.    Yep. You understand the idea.    Good one. LOL   Well said. New to reddit. People seem smart here. I think I might have found a new addiction.   Show zero fear. Then calmly say, " Go ahead, but you will spend the rest of you life in prison if you go ahead with this". Most killers are physchopaths and enjoy inflicting pain on emotional people. You have to show no emotion and remind him what will happen to him if he goes ahead.    I would say odd are that this is not true but this idea would not go against quantum physics.    I would say most likely no also but I had a crazy dream where in my dream I thought this was true. In my dream, I realized that the moment of the big bang was the moment of formation of the black hole of parent universe.    Crazy talk or possible?   In the future, 3D printing will be useful in making  space structures in orbit around the earth. Printing a bridge is a cool first step toward using 3D printers for use in building structures in orbit, the moon, and mars.   How can it be a "leaked" document. I think this language is a little over the top. The term "leaked" is primary used  to describe documents that are given to the public that contain things that organizations or governments want to keep secret. Not the church's pre-mature release of doctrine, policy, or future speechs talking points.    It is about truth in advertising and freedom of choice. I don't care what the expert opinion is on GMO's.  Many health related issues that where considered fact in the past  are now called into question. Also, the genes of humanity are not monolithic. Some people have rare adverse reactions too things of which the reason is not currently understood. For this reason, labeling and having GMO free places too eat like Chipotle is a good thing.      I wonder if a food company could breed these ants, grind them up,   extract the chemical that produces this smell, and then use it as a food additive. Never know, someone might convince high society it is the new status symbol food additive.    Many people say " I don't do anything wrong so why should I care". There was a film about east germany when it was communist. In the movie, one of the local party bosses had the hots for the wife of one of the films characters . He told the secret service to spy on him to find some "dirt" on him so he could lock him up and have his way with his wife. He couldn't find anything so he used the private information of his phone conversations to frame him.  " Power corrupts" and " absolute power corrupts absolutely ". So get a warrent unless you want to live in a police state. If you don't think this couldn't happen in the United States your fooling yourself. Would you like all your phone calls keep in a central database where even your local sheriff could listen to them. This is where this is heading in the future if not stopped.

 Journalists won't take pictures because they know they will be retaliated against if they do; in this report he said they might delay airing the report for their safety. I would be surprised if he's ever let in Gaza again.   So HOW should they do it instead?   Wary. They'll turn back to anti-semitism as soon as their preachers have a change of heart.   If true, this would give an almost 1:1 militant to civilian ratio, which is in line with previous conflicts in the Gaza strip. The Gaza Health ministry run by Hamas say that there has been 1,900 dead, of which 80% or so are civilians.      He meant 96% of West Bank civilians, under areas A and B.   Because, legally, as soon as the charge is brought Israel can counter charge the PA with much worse.   To add a bit too this, the "character" of God in both Islam and Judaism are almost the same, so much so that it is universally agreed within Judaism that Muslims worship the same God. It's a debate whether Christians are polytheistic or not.   It's a midrash that Muhammed took and incorporated into the Qur'an.   To add to Lazer_Taxon, the evangelicals in America are the greatest "bloc" support of Israel -- but only because they believe it will hasten the second coming. As soon as their preachers switch back to anti-Semitism, 15% of America will go back to hating Jews again.   A quote without a source! Might it be pulled out of your ass?   It is no no longer a war crime if it is used as a military site, which is what Hamas is doing to this hospital. So Israel is going to bomb one building, not the whole thing, once all the civilians leave.   maddoweis.net  Nice joke, hilarious!   Older people saw the international Palestinian terrorism during the cold war, and educatikn teaches you is not as simple as casualty numbers.   To get a different perspective about the letter, read this:  http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2 x_outlet=118 x_article=2219  I'm going to try to re-translate the letter myself and see if it comes out differently.   http://www.reddit.com/domain/aljazeera.com/   Kidnap. If they're not allowing Red Cross visits or abiding by the Geneva Conventions, it's kidnapping.   The attack came less than 2 hours into the "ceasefire."   Please change "they" to "Hamas", you don't know how stupid some people are.  Edit: People upvoted my comment, I guess that works just as well.   Soldiers are captured if they are allowed visits by the Red Cross and the captors follow the other Geneva Conventions related to POW's. Hamas doesn't, so the soldier is kidnapped.    THe army went in the day that Hamas militants first attacked from one of these tunnels. Unless you think Israel controls Hamas...   The tunnels going into Israel cannot be used to transfer goods, they are only to attack Israel.   http://this-is-not-jewish.tumblr.com/post/34344324495/how-to-criticize-israel-without-being-anti-semitic   There are actually a lot of reports that ground troops are really frustrated that, though they are finding lots of tunnels and booby-trapped houses, they can't get the people shooting at them.   Wow, great rebuttal. I'm impressed.   Not quite yet. It will if Israel decides to go further.   For the 10th time, [Haaretz live blog at 7:45pm.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945) I couldn't submit it because as a live blog it was already submitted.   Correct me if I'm wrong  You are wrong. All of the tunnels that Israel is destroying now are ones leading into Israel to conduct terrorist attacks. The IDF only put boots on the ground in Gaza after the attack from one such tunnel.   ...what? Because this is true.   Um, no?  This is the "Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War."  This specific section is "Wounded and sick IV. Discontinuance of protection of **hospitals**" [emphasis added]  If you want to prove your point, find a general article, or at least one that doesn't mention that it's specifically for hospitals       Yet they didnt do it last time they had chance, nor ever before.  When was this time? They've only attacked sporadically from tunnels after it was clear that the IDF is going to destroy them so Hamas won't be able to use them in the future.   The tunnels were stupidly not taken as a big danger by the government until now. If one attack happened from a tunnel and casualties resulted, Israel would immediately invade Gaza and destroy them. They could only be used once/in one military operation.  They dont need 10 people kidnapped, they can get the equal attention by a single guy or a couple.  No, they need as much people killed and kidnapped as possible, for popularity, money, and exchanges.    Unfortunately, there will be no journalists in the area because it's an active military zone and ground fighting. No confirmation from other completely unbiased sources will have to wait.   If Israel is destroying everyone and everything, they're doing a horrible job at it. I'm sure that given 3000 bombs the US could level Gaza within a few hours.   And everything else is just a claim by Hamas. Do you actually expect journalists to report every detail about military operations from an active military zone?   http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter4_rule14   So if I shoot at you many times but either miss or hit your bulletproof vest, you'll just sit there and take it?   Good, now you're reading! Not quite enough though. This is only regarding hospitals, **not UN shelters.** Find another article to support your claim. In addition, the only time Israel has deliberately bombed hospitals is with imminent military activity or large stores of weapons and warnings.   Purpose? To massacre and kidnap Israeli civilians. This achieves many of their goals at once.   No, the censor doesn't provide false info. Does the IDF itself? Very possibly, many militaries do.   It was formed specifically for Palestinians because of the creation of tons of Palestinian refugees when the ~~general assembly granted Israel the land~~ war broke out between Israel and the surrounding Arab countries, including Palestinians. There would have been no refugee problem without the war.  And really, the ones in the West Bank and Gaza (especially the latter) should not be called refugees.   1. No other population has refugee status transferred to children.  2. Those under the control of the PA and hamas are free to move around in their territory, they don't have to stay in refugee camps. But it presents a better image to the world and continues their claim, so they stay.   Haaretz specifically mentions it, and I've linked to it a bunch of times here.   No, initially it was reporting (and still is) 70-80% civilian casualties,  "among them" women and children. Easy to be misled though, with how it's reported. Currently, [by the washington post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/gaza-counter/), about 1/10 are women and 1/5 are children under 18. Women make up 50% of the populace, while children make up around 50-60%  Your source is the top end, the UN is reporting 3:1 or 4:1, and the IDF is saying between 1:1 and 2:1. But for now, these high numbers will be used to bash Israel as much as possible while the reports in 3 months will be brushed under the rug.   I'm saying that there is one refugee organization for the Palestinians and one for everyone else. It's not racist, but it is a double standard.   Eh, state actors are still expected to minimize casualties if possible.   The journalists know the full news, even if they can't publish it. Again, they wouldn't publish something false deliberately.   85% is a 1:5.5 ratio, and I'm sure it will go down right after the fighting is over and Hamas announces their martyrs. It doesn't change the fact that lots of civilians are suffering though.   Oh, Israel has done a lot wrong. There just happens to be (or was) an Israeli peace movement, but not a Palestinian one. It sucks.   "Terrorism" or not, they are still a military target. And rockets are purposefully attacking civilians with the purpose of committing genocide, even if they suck at it.   Because logistically, it's impossible to bring stuff in and out more than once without Israel noticing.   Reading comprehension alert:  the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.  these are neither "small arms and ammunition" nor have they been "taken from combatants."    Saving your comment!   The first rockets and war with Gaza (2006) was before the blockade took effect. Lifting it now would only cause a free flow of weapons into the strip.   They are currently hiding in the network of tunnels built instead of  hospitals and bomb shelters. So brave.   He has reported for The Jerusalem Report, the Forward, the Wall Street Journal and WRNI among others  Nice selection bias. Most Israelis serve in the IDF that doesn't mean anything.     Great response :P   Ok, provide proof if you think otherwise.   So what should Israel do instead?   What do you mean, stupid? During a lull in the fighting when Israel is not  expecting it, possibly during a holiday, they break out of 8-10 tunnels near towns. Then they murder and kidnap as many people as possible before escaping.   If there is military activity in the area, it becomes a legitimate military target even if it is a declared safe zone. It then comes down to the amount of civilian casualties vs. military benefit like any other target. Doesn't make it a war crime to do so unless the civilian casualties are extremely excessive.   The first two were written before the full news came out, as did Haaretz. Haaretz then published an update after the full information was cleared for publishing.   Again, this is less than a mile from the boarder with Gaza and is constantly monitored. The only reason that they weren't discovered until now is because they are closed at the top until the militants attack. Why wouldn't they just use the Egypt ones they have? Why use thousands of tons of concrete for these and not the ones into Egypt?   The 8:1 ratio.   That's because it's an organization with helps refugees -- but only Palestinian ones.   Haaretz has it too, is that any better for you? It is still coming from the IDF in the end.  I think Israel has made numerous mistakes for this assault, and I'm still waiting for an explanation of the bombing/shelling of the market and school today. That doesn't mean that Israel is committing genocide or deliberately killing civilians.   Just think about the logistics of transferring goods into Israel, to the border which Israel is constantly watching, and then bringing those goods into the tunnels and out the other side. You really think this was ever done?   How many months did it take to build this tunnel while it was being used? You think the UN employees didn't know about it?   Cite the 8:1 source, which means only 1 out of every 9 people killed is civilian. The most I've seen (out of the Hamas run health agency!) is 4:1, and sometime 3:1. They've claimed similar numbers before, but when the dust has settled down it usually comes to around a 1:1 ratio, and I am expecting the same to happen this time.   I would love to be paid for this! I would be making so much money right now. :P   [It also has lots of credible journalists.   ](http://www.timesofisrael.com/about/)    where, link? You're claiming two things in this thread and citing no proof.   Do you have a link to the last? Hebrew is fine.   Not yet. I bet Hamas' plan was to attack from all of them at once, but they didn't get the opportunity before the fighting started.   Read Haaretz every day and then say that no one ever criticizes the IDF.   The tunnels into Egypt are for smuggling, but it's not like Hamas can transfer goods into tunnels in Israeli territory. Why do you think they're building tunnels into Israel, [most of them near civilian towns](http://i0.wp.com/www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IDF-map-of-TerrorTunnels.jpg?fit=485%2C485)?   No Israeli newspaper will deliberately print false information. [The US had a censorship office during WWII as well.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Censorship)   Haaretz current live blog at 7:45   http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945   Well, the post is gone now and it wouldn't allow me to comment *shrug*  Unfortunately, no international news source is publishing info like this as fast or as thoroughly as Israeli news sources are. It would be nice if CNN or other international publications produced the detailed reporting that ToI and haaretz is doing, but they don't have the audience for it.  The IDF might be wrong, but there is no source for this outside the IDF anyway, and any news organization would have to source them. That doesn't answer why you think ToI is run by the IDF.   Because the UN workers live in a culture where they are under threat by Hamas and it's much easier to look the other way than than speak out, especially when you came to help Palestinians anyway and your boss is doing the same.   This Israeli censor doesn't provide false information, only prohibits some news to be released for a time.   Because you can call a building empty, but if Israel tries to bomb it as a legitimate military target than civilians in the two other buildings can be hurt/killed.   And what about haaretz?  http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 at 7:45   Building underground is easier than building above ground, really? I guess we're just really inefficient then, and we should all live in hobbit holes!  Plus, there is still quite a lot of empty land is gaza to build on, just look at google maps.   It comes from an IDF general stating what 800,000 tons of concrete could build; that is just math. Why do you think that ToI is any more "run by high ranking IDF members" than any other Israeli news site.  Edit: ~~Since you deleted your comment downthread~~ since your comment was deleted...  OP here, not a shill. I am Israeli, and started posting when I began to be disturbed by all the shit that gets posted here. I'm actually a leftist and would gladly vote for Meretz if I trusted Palestinian people/leadership, but like 95%+ of Israeli Jews I support this operation. I will need to look at what is said about the shelling of the school and market today, as well as some other things that happened;  like the "IDF bombing" of the school a few days ago which turned out to be an Islamic Jihad misfired rocket. I can't say anything about that now though, or I would contribute to the "Israel is a genocidal baby murderer" meme here. People can't seem to understand that it is neither in Israel's strategic interest, not do they want to, kill civilians.               I hears reports of at least 13 Hamas members captured or surrendering. Is this possibly one of the goals of the ground invasion, maybe for intelligence purposes, or just a fluke? I don't remember any reports of captures members in 2006 or 2008.                        I've been fasting since early this morning; no food and no water. Since starvation mode is activated when you eat too little, I'm wondering exactly when it starts? I would really like some free energy right now. Anyone have tips to make it begin? I'm starting to feel weak...  Edit: oy, Poe's law. In case people didn't get it, this is satire. I am really fasting though. Thankfully it ends soon after sundown.   A UN agency recently announced that around 75% the Palestinian casualties in Gaza. Is this correct, or is it just the UN again? If it is true, why is it higher than the 1:1 ratio in the previous two Gaza operations?      Jesus very obviously did not fulfill the important messianic prophecies which people associate with the Messianic age. [\(A small list.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/wiki/jesus) The usual counterargument is that Jesus will return and and fulfill all of them in the second coming. But if I don't believe in Jesus in the first place, why should I assume this? The Messiah will be the person who brings in the Messianic age -- if he dies before doing so, then he cannot be the Messiah ([see Bak Kokhva an example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)).  So can you prove from the Tanach (Old Testament) that the Messiah will either die before fulfilling the prophecies or come back to Earth after dying? I reject the validity of the New Testament, so unless you want to try to prove that first, it won't be very productive to argue from there.     I know this thread has probably been posted many times in the past, but I have two specific questions I don't have answers to.  1. Why do Muslims think that the text of the Tanach (the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) was corrupted? I know that there is a su'rah (is that the right term?) claiming such, it would be nice if someone could quote it. But I would also like to know how parts are determined to be corrupted and how it happened. Is it just assumed to be the stuff that contradicts the Qu'ran? [I had a small discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cik3of9) with /u/possiblea2m about it, but he couldn't follow up on the final answer he gave me, so I clarification on that would be nice as well.  2. Do all Muslims believe that the current Jews are not related to B'nai Yisrael? I was told a such by /u/Redhawk1000 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cijzcnq), but he didn't finish answering my questions. If yes, why? When did the split/loss occur? If no, why is are the quotes wrong? (I have very limited background in Arabic, so please provide translation if you can. Interlinear/transliteration is even better.)  Oh and one minor question I recently thought of. Do the Qu'ran record any prophets in the line of Ishmael (edit: besides Muhammed)? I haven't seen any referenced, but that doesn't mean there aren't.  Thanks in advance for answering! Feel free to ask me any questions about Judaism as well.      /May you find peace.   My computer is a Dell Inspiron 1440, running windows 7. My computer was slowing down after longer periods of use (over an hour), especially while playing games. I asked here on the live chat what I could do to improve performance and was given various good suggestions. Now, I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about software if not hardware (I know, I know, I lot of people say this, but I have a little experience programming), so my computer was already clean of malware and I had been disabling unneeded programs running in the background. After trying some of the minor suggestions, I decided to clean the fan when I downloaded Coretemp and realized my computer could run up to 190 degrees F even when only using internet and video chat when in a 70 degree room. After seeing this, I decided to clean the out the fan and make sure nothing was wrong with parts of the computer.  I watched a video on how to disassemble the parts, and it was a great learning experience! Unfortunately, in order to access the fan, I had to take out the motherboard as well instead of just the keyboard and outer case. The fan was indeed dusty, though not quite as bad as other pictures I looked at online. I cleaned the fan using a small vacuum and cloth, cleaned the motherboard of dust with compressed air, and wiped down the non-electrical parts of the computer. I made sure I was very careful, remembered where all the parts and wires connected, and kept track of all the screws and various other parts while taking the laptop apart and putting it back together. The only part I know I might have made a mistake on is the order of the two large chips in the bottom of the computer (Maybe the RAM? I don't know what they're called...taken out at 1:05 on this video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulecDVBnDwc. Would switching them actually change anything?)  Now my computer turns on, but the screen stays off and after about a minute it starts beeping 4 times in a row every 5 seconds. What could I have done wrong, and what are my options now? I did a full backup right before disassembling, so worst come to worst I guess I'll have bring it to a repair shop and they could fix it and wipe it. Any advice for me, r/techsupport?    A common argument I've seen for the validity of Jesus as the Messiah is that he was unique in certain respects. Usually, the twin claims are that he committed no sin and that he performed many miracles, including raising himself from the dead. Putting aside the former claim, (because of the unverifiable nature and that there is no reason for a Messiah to be sinless), why do the miracles make Jesus unique. The Bible clearly states in Deuteronomy 18 to be vigilant against false prophets who will turn people away from the proper worship of God. These prophets will "perform signs and wonders" to prove themselves, and God tells the people not to trust just because they perform miracles.  So why are Jesus' wonders used so often as proof of his status as the Messiah/divine? And are there any other reasons to believe that Jesus was a unique human?  We can also discuss the sinless claim if someone brings a verse to show the Messiah must fulfill that requirement. Please don't bring into the argument that he was God as well, because not only is that impossible to argue about, it doesn't answer my question.         Can anyone explain to me what exactly is the reason that minhag is taken so seriously in the orthodox world? I've heard people talk about minhag like they do about kashrut. Some really weird practices are justified as minhag, sometimes so much so that people refuse to change them. Why is it taken so seriously both culturally and halachically?   I went to Orthodox day school, so feel free to give me sources.      Is there any knowledge of specifically how parasites control the behavior of their hosts? What parts of the brain do they affect? Do they block or add neurotransmitters? Does the method change among species? For example, I know some wasps use venom, but fungi or bacteria probably use different means. Links or books to read further on this topic are also greatly appreciated. Thanks!   I recently bought Awakening, and absolutely loved it. I owned Path of Radiance and played it when I was younger multiple times. Then I bought Radiant Dawn some years ago and played once, and now I'm playing it again when I rediscovered FE with Awakening. Once I'm done with RD, what game(s) in the series should I play next, and how can I get it? I have a 3DS, a DS, and a Wii, and a computer (:P). Thanks!   I was a really big Pokemon fan when I was younger. I played the first and second generations to death, starting multiple games over again so I could experience the thrill of training my pokemon from scratch and beating all the gyms for the first time. I then tried my hand at emerald for a it after it came out, but for some reason I couldn't really enjoy it and stopped after a while. I did the same for Pokemon black, and even almost made it up to the Elite Four, but I didn't understand a lot of the new pokemon, moves, or any of the background stuff.   I just got a 3DS and a copy of Pokemon X for my birthday, and I want to play and understand, and enjoy it! I'm really excited about the new generation since it seems really immersive. I'm not really interested in the competitive scene nor spending hundreds of hours breeding the best pokemon, but I do want to know how to better train the ones I catch!   So what's new? What are EV's, how do battles with multiple pokemon flow, did B-down to catch a pokemon ever actually work (I'm still going to use it anyways!), etc. Educate me, please!  	109

This accusation coming from Wendy got me thinking, what if Kendal isn't innocent and was telling (partially) the truth? This is by far the most diskish move by Raylan and he's willing to put a manipulated boy (guilty or not) 40 years in prison just to get his chance at his big brother. And if he didn't do it? "Well, that makes it worse".            Let's say I use Arc with 40% chance of shock (10% from gem + 10% from quality + 20% from passive nodes). If I link Chain to it, I hit more enemies, and have better chance to trigger shock. However, Chain also reduces the damage considerably. If I understand this correctly, shock has a minimum duration that is derived from damage. So less damage means less duration, and if the duration is below the required minimum, shock won't trigger.   Can anybody shed a light on this subject?                        Here's a starting list by [NME](http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/10-stinky-songs-that-ruin-classic-albums):  1.

I usually hate this kind of television, telling us how great government is and how people with opposite views learn to come and work together. However, this show arguably provides the best criticism today on government and politics in their current form.  Nobody on the show cares about the public, and everybody's working out of self-preservation, narrow political interests, ego and selfishness.   Bills, projects, acts, executive orders and such, are all introduced, executed, canceled, supported or opposed based on the political points, and almost never on 'what is right for the people'. It shows how people with political power can crash regular people and businesses standing in their way.  The writing is almost always cynic. Phrases like 'I have no ulterior motive here' are always there to hide something else.   There's also some nice criticism on representative democracy. Season 1/2 **spoiler**: When the congressman sworn to VP (replacing the existing one), he looks at the camera and say: 'One heartbeat away from the presidency, and not a single vote cast in my name. Democracy is so overrated.'  Another nice touch is that the anti-hero is a democrat. So most of the people who abuses power and deceives are from the left.  Anyway, besides the criminal aspect of the story (which I think can be regarded as fiction and not a true demonstration of politicians) the entire system is pained in very unflattering colors.                     http://i.imgur.com/V8s0yVa.gif         Here's something the bugs my mind.

That's it. Hope you found it helpful.                  I see that many are asking about ways to evaluate items and decide which to keep and which to vendor. So I'm sharing my personal Excel spreadsheet. It's fast and gives a good snapshot about any Rare item.  First, here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/l3grWX6.png). And here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/3aXcp) with more examples (but I'm going to use the first screenshot in my explanation below)  To use the excel, simply copy the item data in the game (Hover item, click Ctrl+C), then go to the spreadsheet and click the button. No need to paste, that's what the button does. ___ **Here's what you get**  ___  ~~ The left table is straight forward and contains all the information about the item.  ~~ The top-right table displays all the mods.   * The rank column shows how the **minimum** range of the roll is ranked within the possible rolls. In the example above, *74% increased Energy Shield* is rank #3, because according to [poemods](http://www.poemods.com/index.php?item_type=helmet)   [PoE mods compendium](http://poetools.com/mods-compendium/), the possible rolls for % increase ES in helmet are:  iLvl|range|description --|--|-- 72 | 101 to 120 |(Unconquerable) 60 | 83 to 100 |(Dauntless) 44 | 65 to 82 |(Fearless) 30 | 47 to 64 |(Resolute) 18 | 29 to 46 |(Strong-Willed) 3 | 11 to 28 |(Protective)  So this roll is ranked #3 on the list. Obviously you want to see ranks 1 or 2.  * You can also notice that 2 mods are shaded. those are the 'sought-after' mods. It's not easy to compile a full list, so I did it just the basics:  If the mod contains: | with value above: --|-- any Resistance |20 all Elemental Resistance| 10 maximum Life| 60 maximum Mana| 40 increased Energy Shield| 60 increased Armour| 60 increased Evasion Rating| 60 Movement Speed| 20 increased Rarity| 15 increased Quantity| 15 + to Gems level| 1 + to Dex/Str/Int| 30 increased Spell Damage| 20  *If you have some knowledge in Excel, you'll be able to update this list, extend it and modify it to your needs*  ~~ The middle right table displays the basic properties of the items.  * Here you'll see two ranks. The first is the rank of the item in the entire category, based on [the official list by GGG](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data). So in the example above, this helmet is #21 on the list (where #1, [Lion Pelt](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Lion_Pelt), is the best white helmet in the game).  * The second rank is how the item is within its armour specific category. Since the helmet in the example is ES, you want to know how it is ranked within the pure ES category (where [Hubris Circlet](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Hubris_Circlet) is considered the #1 helmet). In this example, the helmet is just the 4th best so don't bother with it.  **You want to see items ranked #1 or #2**  *Note: the second rank is only valid to armour. Weapons have just a single category (ranks within wand, staff, 2H axe, etc.)*  ~~ Finally, the bottom right table displays the Armour/Attack values and the implicit mods (Armour, Evasion, ES, Phy Damage, Ele Damage, etc)  * For Armour, the following rolls will get marked:  Armour Stats | Level 1 | Level 2  --|--|-- Evasion Rating |800 |1000 Armour |800 |1000 Energy Shield |160 |200  **You want to look at those marked level 2**  ____  **So what items should you keep?** ____  You want to keep items that have:  1. 2-3 desirable mods 2. Rolls are ranked #1 3. Item is ranked 1-2 within its category 4. The basic stats of the items are level 2 (end game)  About pricing (Domination): Don't get your hopes up. Items usually go for 1 chaos top (rarely 2-3, unless you got some exceptional luck with 4-5 desirable mods, no stupid mods, and high level). Especially if you found them in maps level 72 or less. My recommendation: if an item is in your stash for more than a week, lower the price to 1 alch, if it doesn't go, vendor it and move on. **Good items disappear almost instantly**, so if it's not selling, don't wait.  ____  **Batch Mode (!)** ____  If you got this far you probably be happy to know that the spreadsheet supports batch evaluation. Here's how you do it.   1. Install [this AHK script](http://pastebin.com/W76rk74T).  2. Copy the first item as usual (Ctrl+C)  3. Now go over the rest of the items and click Ctrl+Shift+C. If the item is rare, the data will be added to the clipboard (and not replace it)  4. After you copied up to 10 items, go to the spreadsheet and click the button  5. Now you can use the [up/down arrows](http://i.imgur.com/RZiQ8L0.png) to circle quickly through the items  ____  **Download** ____  You can get it from my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kd9sbxj9zt8xanv/Path%20of%20Exile%20-%20Item%20Eval%20v1.0.xlsm).  Final notes:  * Please don't expect something perfect. It's meant for personal use.  * Some less common mods are not mapped.  * Some mods are overlapping (1H/2H/etc). So you might see double readings.  * I mostly concentrated on Armour and not Weapons.  * You gonna need Excel 2010, macro enabled (click enable content when prompted).  * If it's not working for you, or if you have questions on how to expend it and add different values, feel free to pm me.                                                      100% to cast supported skill after X seconds of player's sleep [Level 1: 21 seconds of sleep, Level 20: 1 second of sleep].

 Japes? lolwhat?   Even though he is seated a good distance from the marrying families, Bern Cinder met Lorella Royce's eyes through the thick crowd and thought he glimpsed a smile.   I would like sigil #7 please! Oh, and this is my first roleplay ever :P   wooooooooooooooooops. Correcting.   **House Cinder has been considered outlaws in the Vale for hundreds of years. Decendants of** the first men and named after the volcanic caves that has been the center of a fortified hill by the Cinders since the time of the dragons. Some say the volcanic rockfomations (which has give the house it's name) surrounding the cave were created by a stray dragon.  House Cinder were awarded **Strongsong** recently for their **unexpected loyalty** to the Lords of the Vale in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Lord Cinder managed to still the warrior's want for the spoils of war when the still outlawed mountain clans rode to war with Lord Ormund Baratheon. Lord Cinder knew war was coming to The Vale. It was just a matter of time.   **The current Lord Cinder**, **"Burk"** recieved the hand of Marinera Corbray. The youngest daughter of Ser Arman Corbray who is 8th in the line of succession to Hearts Home. Together they have recieved two sons aged 13 and a daughter of 7,  House Cinder's **military forces** consists of 2000 fierce and utterly fearless warriors wielding two-handed weapons. 100 mounted noblemen and 900 archers/crossbowmen  Staying true to the vows made to the Lords of the Vale would grant rewards to the those who were patient.   With the last hobbit movie out I'm putting a request out there. A loyal Tolkien-fan with love for the LotR movies and sharp film editing-skills should cut The Hobbit trilogy into a single movie with a max length of three hours. Are there any aspiring editors out there?   With the last hobbit movie out I'm putting a request out there.   A loyal Tolkien-fan with love for the LotR movies and sharp film editing-skills should cut The Hobbit trilogy into a single movie with a max length of three hours.   Are there any aspiring editors out there?    Tinfoil? Check It has begun. The **government** has begun. Starting with kids. They will make them feel it is alright that someone is watching you, making sure you behave.   Going on an assignment for Tommen. Goes on a killingspree.    I'd say wait if you are an honest man. It has released in some countries (here in Sweden), and english is soon to come. They are good though. Really good. I can really praise the comic too. Really well done.   Now that. Is what I call a final stop for this particular train. Spring 2016, here we come.   I'm surprised no one have asked grrm on his blog.    If this is a cheap trick to score sales for The World of Ice and Fire.... Nerdrage is going to happen. We do not have the patience for this kind of shenanigans. The book is nowhere to be seen and millions of people are waiting eagerly.  But my hype is active so long as George doesn't make a firm statement on the notablog.   12th day will be The World of Ice and Fire promotion. I am so sure of it. So sure. (fingers crossed)   I think the Bronze sword points a little to some kind of forgotten blood sacrifice done by the first men.      It means Winds of Winter confirmed! What would you expect the odds to be for a sneak release 3 days before christmas? Huh!? Huh?!   Maybe **We do not sow"** should be "We **could** not sow"   Of course I have talked about it with his parents. I thought it would be an interesting topic to talk about though. And so it has proved to be!     I was thinking **Princeless** would be too. If anyone here has a daughter they want to introduce to comics, that would certainly be something to look at. The theme fits well with today's gender equality-discussions.    Am I missing something here or do you not know about the HBO show?  Wait, what? No of course, but I don't think that the universe is at all near to be fully capitalized. Just you wait Wheemix. Just you wait.   Beautifully put, and I must say I agree. When this saga is finished (touch wood) I believe it will expand and be regarded as probably the greatest fantasy series ever written.   **And the movie-franchise will be crazy.** I expect there to be a bidding war over this series, and it will be big. We might even se a red wedding.   Is it just me or is it justifiable to pirate the books to get digital copies when you already bought the books? I would say is. Pirates must not discuss it here, but we can upvote.    You make really good arguments.. Is it known if there is a really easy way to gain access to all the avalible comics of Dunk   Egg?  A Physical copy is a better gift, but they do have two ipads, so a digital copy could make due..    Yes, **I have realized I at least have to re-read them and see in what context and with which words the adultery is described.**   I myself discarded that as trying to make some extra bucks because they only just mentioned it when they released the new edition.  It was obviously not supposed to be a part of the story when it was written in the 1980's. Ten years before GRRM even knew that Jon Snow know nothing.   With risk of playing the proud uncle. He's really smart and clearly interested in fantasy. He has read and listened to both Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and the Harry Potter-series. Narnia too if I am not mistaken.  Thank god his father is a true nerd.   This is so helpful! It's the mixture of those three that makes me doubt if it's a good idea. I', fairly certain he will love the story nevertheless.   Thank you so much for your helpful post! The Graphics Novels would be perfect (great adaption btw) aside from the fact that his English is not that good.  **Perfect moment to brag about Swedish english!**  He can understand spoken english fairly well, but written it's a different matter. The book contains all three novellas though, so I might have to re-read them. Which is not a hard task really.   It sure is a tale that resembles Westeros a great deal what I have heard. And Old Nan's hints about Ice Dragons makes it so much more difficult to decide.  But, since it was written ten years prior to **The Song** I take it as a standalone universe, even though they obviously have common themes.   Yeah it was the violence I felt unsure about. There are some nasty duels. I think I might have to read it again to make sure about the most gruesome parts.  The Ice Dragon is not Westeros though. Right? And I think it is for younger audiences even thoough he is not to old for it. (doubt even I am to old for it) ^^   **A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the perfect steppingstone to introduce young readers to the universe?**  I just visited my local bookstore and after I had drooled over "The World of Ice and Fire" for a minute I noticed this book:  http://s.cdon.com/media-dynamic/images/product/book/book/image0/riddaren_av_de_sju_konungarikena-martin_george_r_r-27265257-2403511085-frntl.jpg  This is the Swedish version of "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms". And I now recall GRRM stating that the book might get an early release for some countries.  **I got an idea that it could be a great gift for my nephew.** But before even asking my sister if it's ok I wanted to ask here if you think the novellas are ok for a 10 year old child to read. He probably have more hours on **Skyrim** than I have, which certainly contains a great deal of violent.  It was a long time ago since I read the Dunk and Egg stories, so I just wonder if anyone here knows if there it contains scenes that might not be ok for a child to read?  **I thought it might be ok, since there are no sex-scenes in these stories what I can recall. Yet. And the story has a protagonist about the same age as my nephew.**  Would love for someone with a good memory to help me out.   **This could be the perfect gateway-drug for kids today to grow up with George R R Martin's universe, and if they are lucky A Dream of Spring might release just in time for their graduation**    Arya in the Mercy chapter was a highlight for me. I have longed for a more grown up Arya who uses her sexuality to lure her prey.   Boy, would that be just after world peace on my list!   I noticed a funny post on twitter by GRRM, and not wanting to be too creepy , I thought some speculations are welcome this cold november. Shall we throw in some wild guesses for when this gigant will arrive?  -- https://twitter.com/GRRMspeaking/status/536334974916759553  -- http://imgur.com/NODLlgW   I also noticed his freshly **(?)** updated tour dates on his website which shows a lot of booked events almost once a month. I thought he said he was sitting down not making tours to make more time for writing? -- http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/  **I think tWoW will release winter 2016** (secretly hoping for summer 2015)  feel free to rate this to the bottom of the internet if this is to much      Episode 7: **"Edd, fetch me a block"**  That is all I need.    **I suggest rereading.** If you are a show watcher mainly and havn't heard of the theories around R+L=J you should definitely read the first book again.  You will have missed too much cut material around what happend in Robert's Rebellion.  Audiobooks are great as well. Roy Dotrice is a king.    I'd like The Hedge Knight and the rest of the novellas about Dunk to be a miniseries like HBO.  Robert's Rebellion would be so exciting as a feature film. Barely any recasting. **Charles Dance** returns for coninving Tywin?   Yes he is. And this is my theory.  Bran will be able to weirwood.Net-warg Duncan the Tall because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight). This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in "The Sworn Sword" that read something like this: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?". It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly without thinking. And also fits in to some great lesson given to Bran by Bloodraven. Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of Summerhall.   Arya Stark or just Arya would be pretty mind blowing. She hasn't been referred to as that in the chaptertitles since I don't know when.  It would be time to go home when her name pops up.   Dunk and Egg. Try the graphic novel version. It's refreshing.   Naah. There were like 24 Brandons with some Bolton rebellions along the way. Rest assured I think the current Bran of Winterfell will learn a lot about his family's history in **the next books.....**   The Walk of Shame.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r  One theory is that Hr. Brother to Baldr. Baldr is immortal except for his weakness to mistletoe.  Baldr was tricked by Loki to kill Baldr with an mistletoe arrow.  This could mean Bran safe in the cave where magic protects him from the magic of the Others represents Baldr and Hr is Hodor tricked by another part to kill Bran.     I heard something Kristian said a while back, and that it was him taking a break from the show this year. Have that been changed to Bran not being in it at all?  That sucks then! Heard something about **flashbacks** a week ago.   Leto would be the best. Honestly. He's my mancrush.   So, we basically have confirmation that Dany will get het whole A Dance with Dragons storyline. (maybe a chapter or so less)  But where will the other characters end up? **I thought I would fill up this OP with the best theories.**   * **Tyrion** - Ends up practically where book 5 ends. fAegon and JonCon is cut, meeting Ser Jorag and possibly meeting Dany. * **Bran** -  Confirmed to be stalled one season to catch up with the book with character progress possibly happening behind the scenes. * **Arya** She should begin her training this season if she is gonna go back to Westeros at the end of season 6. Maybe reaching the Mercy-chapter by the end of this season. * **Sansa** Filler material. Hopefully gathering the support of the knights of the Vale. * **Cersei (Whole Kings Landing plotline)** - Maybe as far as the Trial by Combat. Possibly a Maggy the Frog flashback. * **Jaime** (We know he's going to Dorne, so this covers that plot. Hope for some Bronn development) * **Brienne** (  Pod) IF they have not cut out Lady Stoneheart completely, she will surface in the last episodes of season 5, threatening to hang Brienne and Pod. if LSH is cut. Your guess is as good as mine what Brienne will do. * **Jon (The whole North plotline)** - Is elected LC, stabbed and possibly ressurected by end of this season. **GOD. I can't wait for unsullied to get this cliffhanger episode** * **Sam** If they go with him leaving he probably will be meeting Arya in Braavos before season 5 is over at least, then onwards south. * **Iron Islands** - Chances are this story will be cut save for Ashas involvement in the North.  Any strong feelings on how they will end next season? I managed to predict season 4 mostly, with some things they cut out and such.    Hopefully another 50 years.   The Girl in the Fireplace is a good choice. Especially if he's in to history.   Trevligt :) Yeah I feel they catched most themes very well and I'm glad they didn't change any of the names.  Will probably watch every episode once they're all out.   Well yes of course, but they have sure taken some inspiration from the movie as well. That is clear and something I am happy about. Watched that film once a day as a kid! :)   **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**, the japanese Anime, co-produced by Studio Ghibli have aired a few episodes. Based on the swedish movie **"Ronja Rvardotter"** And the book by the same name written by **Astrid Lindgren** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren  I really like it so far. It is fairly true to it's swedish inspiration, something that surprised me. My favourite scene is in the second episode. But I like the original swedish version of that scene far better. link to the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdAkrQFO-xQ  Have you watched the Anime yet? It is avalible with english sub to stream on some shady streaming-sites and it should not be too hard to find.      Please, a link. I am to lazy to find it myself.   It's pretty cheap on Ebay!   I challenge everyone to team up with a buddy and beat 07:07 minutes boss attack mode!  If you beat my thirteen-yearold selves best time I give you a cookie!     My favourite game Spawn seems not to be supporting VGA if the indicator is the icon at the back of the case.. :( Might invest in an adapter and scaler if I get money for it. Seems kind of expensive.   How much difference does the VGA adapter make quality-wise? Considering I have a 92" projectorscreen I could use some better quality.   **Anyone else remember this awesome game?** Well, it's not that awesome now when I come back to it. But as a ten year old, this was the coolest thing I played. Nostalgia is a powerful feeling and this will always be one of my favourite games.  I just played a game of Spawn with my sister, and when playing boss mode I came across the best multiplayer time with my cousin.   We beat the game in 7 minutes (!) Me and my sis managed in about 25 minutes. Does me an my cousin have some kind of **world record** or something? It's crazy fast.  Pic or it didn't happend: http://i.imgur.com/SGWhyy7.jpg   **Anyone else want to share their record time on multiplayer bossmode?**    Probably Elio Garcia who posted it and it will probably have to do with the eminent release of TWOIAF.   I don't think **GRRM** uses twitter. He made Elio set up the account because there were so many fakes with his name.   Did everyone notice when he almost spoiled something?  When talking about Aegon the Conqueror and the dragons subjecting the people of Westeros, and with the dragons gone, ultimately they didn't feel the Targaryens had any power over them anymore.  "Of course Dany...." and then he turned in his seat and changed subject.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r  Balder is Bran. Enough said. Whole book spoiled.   It was late, I quit when I got into a circularized orbit.   Here is a pic from when I came in to a second aerobreaking http://imgur.com/sWqeZS1     I am currently burning my 15-minute node to eject Kerbin and decided to share it here.  http://imgur.com/a/icDTj#1  I really **hope** the launch system can lift off from Eve. I will probably have to land on the highest mountain for sure though..  I am bringing (except for the gigant launch system I am pulling) a Science Lab, A lander for Gilly, and a small lander for Eve (with two impact probes).  This ship makes me realize I really need to upgrade my computer.  I can basically hear my processor **screaming**.   (Spoilers All)  This is my most tinfoil-branded theory. But hey! **That's what we do.**  **Bran** will be able to weirwood.Net-warg **Duncan the Tall** because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight). This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in **"The Sworn Sword"** that read something like this: **"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".**  It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly, childish and without thinking soemtimes. And it also fits in to some great lesson that will be given to Bran by **Bloodraven.** Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of **Summerhall.**  I know its pretty crazy. But I have wondered why GRRM began writing about **Dunk and Egg** in the first place. They are obviously important to the story. And since he began around the release of **A Clash of Kings** he probably already had Bran's fate decided since long ago.      **Bran** will be able to weirwood.Net-warg **Duncan the Tall** because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).  This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in "The Sworn Sword" that read something like this: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".  It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly without thinking. And also fits in to some great lesson given to Bran by Bloodraven. Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of Summerhall.   The most interesting shit about that chapter is her killing Raff the Sweetling on her own initative, and at the end the text refers to her as "ARYA".  As opposed to her being refered to as "Mercy" for the entire chapter prior to that. I interpret is an a transition where she is beginning to go back to her original identity.   Incestanity and Cersei's fucked up raising of him.   McConaughey - http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/13800000/Matthew-McConaughey-in-Sahara-matthew-mcconaughey-13861986-1067-800.jpg   10 000 ships I seem to recall right? Just had to (a)   I only know I like season 4 the most. It's like an origin story when they open up the new firm!   That's really cool!    I'm certainly no pro. But don't you need some regular rockets for when you have escaped the atmo? :)  I am nowhere near trying to take off Eve myself. Just got back from Duna in one piece!   It looks amazing! The perfect circles of moons and planets would be a little stretched though. Probably something you can oversee :)   The Arryns are Andals? No? But maybe you mean the mountain clans? Totallty first men-descendants.   You can totallty fly up there with a dragon, though :) It would be cool to have a Harrenhal 2.0. With Littlefinger roasting juicy mutton chop.   His own squire named Payne? (pain)? Assigned to him before the siege he is afraid to die in.  I think it would be that, but I'm not sure.   Also, **I know how to do it myself**. But after hundreds of takeoffs and rendevouzs I am sick of it. The fun part is constructing large interplanetary vehicles and stuff.   Considering this post is at the top of Reddit, and it is such a valid request, I would see it as a terrible sign if CA doesn't take the advice and release a demo of some sort.   **They won't get a preorder from me if they don't release a preview! And I know friends who feel the same.**  They aren't very careful with their reputation.   I had to go on 9gag and 4Chan. And now I'm probably gonna cry myself to sleep.   Exactly. Probably the best movie ever to show someone unfamiliar with anime.  And one more thing. Studio Ghibli's movies always has this realistic feeling. People act like normal people would, living ordinary lives. Nothing has this unrealistic flawlessness that comes to mind when you think of Disney's films. (oh I do have some Disney favourites, fear you not)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9WEyuMq0Yk  Roger Ebert nailed it.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/?ref_=nv_sr_1  Halfway in I was completely sure it had to be based on a true story. It had so much emotions and experiences that would be completely alien to someone who hadn't lived through these events. I love books and films based on true stories,  and decided to look it up when the the movie would end.  **And then the ending came.** I think I cried halfway through the credits, and then I looked up the book and the true story. (semi autobiography) It is written as a tribute and an apology.  And apparently the ending is shown exactly like it happend IRL.  The most powerful movie I have seen this year.  **If you havn't seen this film. Do it.**   The Stories of Dunk and Egg is the story where Bran gets to live his dream of being a knight. Warging Hodor's great grandfather, meeting Bloodraven in his physical prime. The Sworn Sword: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?" Remember where you heard it first.   * Tyrion claiming Casterly Rock.   * Daenerys saving the world, in some manner.  * Arya getting to cross off some names on her list. And preferably some Bolton and a certain Frey.   The Stories of Dunk and Egg is the story where Bran gets to live his dream of being a knight. Warging Hodor's great grandfather, meeting Bloodraven in his physical prime.  The Sworn Sword: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?"   Remember where you heard it first.   Yeah  Focus on the ones that is NOT "test this" or "test that".      I reinstalled everything with MechJeb as the only mod.   NOW IT WORKS  Time to see if my old savefile will work, watch a lot of docking tutorials on MechJeb rendevouzing and docking! :)  Thank you all for you help. This is what internet is all about.     I'm gonna try a fresh install install tomorrow, really gotta go sleep.  Thank you for your help! I will get back when I have reinstalled everything.   Yeah I tried them, but it won't execute them either. :(   It's too large to host at pastebin.

I posted a thread, but didn't get a sollution, so here goes.  Installed MechJeb for the first time. But it doesnt execute maneuver nodes. It gets to the target altitude, firing stages and doing gravity turns.  But when it get out of the atmosphere, nothing more happens.  http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt picture is past the node and on the way down.   No it doesn't make any corrections after leaving the atmosphere and change to "Autopilot Status: Coasting to circularization burn".   Just goes past and downward after that.   I had a complete ship with batteries and solar panels, but when it didn't work the first time I made a new save file in sandbox to see if it was a technology problem. Didn't put that much effort into the test rocket.   The speed was probably due to "limit to terminal velocity".  Added stuff electrical stuff, and changed the turn shape a little.  New picture shows altitude at 62 000 km. past the node at 75 000 and now descending. Still not working. :(  http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt   It will be remembered, but if he doesn't finish it, it will not be a good thing to remember.   If he finish it, R+L=J and he connects all the dots and make the ending really epic I think it will be as big as Lord of the Rings.   Yeah, after the first try I thought it would be the electrical. But after 10 tries I am pretty sure it's not that...  http://imgur.com/pf2aLfG   SOLVED!    I'm tired of launcing and rendevouzing so I just installed Mechjeb. Got it to work, it is great at getting in the air.  Although it won't work entirely. It creates a node at apoapsis, but just goes right past it without buring.   Autopilot Status: "Coasting to circularization burn". and it says so until the shit hits the fan (ground).  I have RCS, 3 kerbals and a little fuel left in my mainsail and a third stage ready. I don't get it because it manage to drop first stage, do the gravitational turn and set the manuever node at set orbit altitude. But it won't execute the node.  Anyone have any ideas? This is so frustrating!   I read Arya, Jon, Daenarys and Tyrion chapterwise from book 3 - 5. It's awesome to do when you already read them a couple of times.    Catched that last week during my re-listening :)  People who discredit R+L=J are just.... well. Stupid.   I **hate** being one of those persons posting a thread with the name of the next book in the title. But I have no choice.  Just read an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor) where he said: "**We** have a season off and we have a year's hiatus, solely because I imagine our storyline is up to the end of the books,"   The whole interview here: https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/24890664/actor-kristian-nairn-reveals-the-other-side-of-hodor-on-game-of-thrones-themed-dj-tour/  As he said "**We** have a season off" I guess that means his gang. That be Hodor, Bran and Meera. Oh, and Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers ofc.  They totally have rushed Bran's storyline and I would never have suspected they would pause his story for a whole season, that seem really weird considering the huge twist at the end.  if they now feel they should take a break with Bran for a season because there is no more book material. Is that an indication that **The Winds Of Winter** could well be released 2015? Maybe in time for season 5 to end, or worst case before season 6 airs?  If there were no chance George would have the book out before season 6 is well under way I see no reason what so ever to delay Bran's storyline at all. Just make him a flashback-machine.  I take delaying of story as a good sign. That should mean they feel **hope.** And that is good enough for me.  However I am glad. I don't want weirwoodspoilers in the show. And I am sure we will get clarifications from D D what the holdup is all about soon enough.         Theory about the powers of the Weirwood trees and Bran's extreme warg abilities.  Spoilers D E  I read The Sworn Sword on the plane just before, and smiled a lot when I read the part where Dunk defies his former liege and sends his soon to be slaughtered smallfolk home.  The reason for my smile was Dunks monolouge after his outburst:  "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior"  "Was there a god of fools?"  "not the warrior" felt a little out of place, and got me thinking towards the old gods.   We do know about someone who can control people. And we know someone who wants to be a Knight more than anyone.   This could well be wishful thinking and another crackpot theory. BUT IF Bran theoretically could Warg someone in the past (weirwood magic seems pretty craycray you got to admit) do you have a better candidate than Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall?  I bet we will know if it's the jetlag, or if I'm on to something in Winds of Winter and or The Shewolves Of Winterfell.   In any case, I think Dunk and Egg is really important to the story of the novels. He began writing the novellas between agot and acok I believe.   My first ever Post on reddit BTW!   	105

I remember being so stressed about him winning too.  I was sweating at the voting center wondering how many dumb fucks around me were going to vote for him.     I ate up all the predictions and was distraught hahah.  Maybe others were too and that's why they went out and voted.     Puts shaving cream on pie....     Wait what?

Dick Cheney's little Halliburton/KBR all killing our troops with open burnpits where they burned plastics, tires, metal, DU, medical waste, chemical barrels....  The did it upwind from the where everyone slept.    24 hours a day there was this thick black smoke, making people cough up blood.  Some got cancer and some died of neurological problems.  Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of us breathed that shit every day.     There is a lawsuit against them right now for that shit.   Just google Halliburton KBR open burn pits Iraq.      Everything dick cheney touches becomes black and evil like him.      At the time all the polls were reporting a big defeat for obama.

If you get into nova settings (which just change settings in the stock developer menu) you can change the speed at which it runs.     I run with no eye candy, which just turns all the animation and transition scales to 0 in the dev menu.     There is no cool graphical changes but it is very poppy.      That's just my experience.  Sorry it doesn't work for you.     Are you into modding and roming?     My nexus 5 is great batt life for me but I have heard of others having problems. Usually those people are just running stock.  Nexus is great for having fun flashing...  Just kinda boring outside of trying out the latest CM rom.       sitting here turning it off and on I can see a HUGE difference.     Like a couple of seconds. (timer says 1.6 sec)  Both my exynos and snapdragon respond the same.     I regret nothing.  I made my choices and took the risks.  The government should say thank you by fixing me up.   They will... just have to slap them around a bit first.      To speed up the task switcher .     Go to settingsapplication manager.    Swipe over until you reach the "All" list.    Scroll down until you see an app called "talkback".    Turn that app off.     It won't entirely eliminate the lag but it will half it.        Also, roll the nova launcher.  You'll still have touchwiz features but without the slow jerky touchwiz launcher.      Bro... this isn't XDA, most people here barely even know what root is.   Much less how to get a custom recovery (if their bootloader is unlocked *cough usa phones cough*) and flash a kernel.   Oh bull. Both my Exynos and my Snapdragon ran like shit after LP.  I factory reset one time after that upgrade and it's been great after that.    I don't even wipe between rom flashes.  I just dirty flash and it still runs great.    Everyone has to do ONE little factory reset after a major update and they act like their phones never work.   Get a grip people.    Blame the userbase.  Everyone was screaming and crying about getting Lollipop that samsung released 5.0.1... when it should have told everyone fuck you, wait, and delivered 5.1.1.     This phone deserves nothing less than that.     I'd say no if you're on the Note 3 or S5.    Don't get me wrong the note 4 is AMAZING... but the difference between the note 3 and 4 isn't THAT amazing.    Now the difference between 4 and 5 [rumor].... that's worth waiting for.      Holy S__T! Is there any way we can make this kid stop trying to make nickle sized blackholes????    How many of those people, after spending the money, felt jipped?     This and honest this.    People with weak hardware can stay on WoW..... but computers and games have passed outdated WoW by.    Make wow 2.   Give us a 3D globe map that navigates like google earth.

Yeah nothing keeps you in the starting area.   Although I think I did level up from exploration xp on the way there.     Which made me ahead of my friend.

Have a nice day and thanks for the debate.      ur wrong   NU UH UR WRONG   hu uh ur a liar   NO U    NO U!!!!        How likely would the delegates go against the results of the vote?      Revenge is just harming another to make yourself feel better.   So no I don't see any difference of harming another for satisfaction against harming another for satisfaction.     If it was about justice you'd just put him down pain free with argon and nitrogen gas.     You haven't yet expained why torture should be a requirement leading up to his death.     Which means this isn't about his death or justice.   This is only about his torture.  And why would someone want to see another be tortured?   For personal satisfaction..... harming another to satisfy internal emotional desires.     It is EXACTLY the same.     Good day, crazy.  I'm turning off inbox replies now.      How's it feel to to dishonestly obfuscate in order to defend being a psychopath?        Have fun being a psychopath.  Get help.  I'm serious as a heart attack when I tell you that.   Please.... seek.....help.      Yes.  A quiet, painless death.  Argon and Nitrogen.   Doesn't take long and then its over.  The person being executed doesn't even feel like they are dying.    Justice served.  Bury him at sea.       That's an excellent point!   Just one question though..... what?    http://i.imgur.com/BQG1bIw.png   Or the nitrogen argon gas... quick... painless.... he doesn't even realize he's going.    Then it's over.  Justice is served.... and no one is getting sick thrills off continued brutalization of another.      LOL Have you been on reddit lately?  It's always one extreme or the other... no one ever has any middle ground opinion.    So when someone comes out and says it, it's nice to hear.  I know I'm not in some sort of singular existence... but there are so many here that are all "booo fucking hooo death penalty is always bad" and the others that wanna kill people for lesser crimes.    SO... yeah... its nice to hear it every now and again.        I'm saying it doesn't fucking matter.   Because the person doing the  act is getting the personal satisfaction they desire from it.     Money doesn't make it worse or better.  You're already as evil as you can get by sucking enjoyment from the pain of another.  Nice try on the obfuscation though... it was a really big stretch there, Armstrong.      Brutally harming another for personal satisfaction.   Nope they are both the same.   Have fun at the doctor, nutso.     Oh so money, not personal satisfaction makes it worse..... duh okay.    Have fun being just as sadistic as him.  I don't know how you can find help for that.  See a doctor.      I love all the comments where people want to do all this fucked up shit to the man.     So you're exactly like him then?  You just do sadistic fucked up stuff because they deserve it or you need to satiate some personal need for satisfaction?     Edit: Too many strings of the exact same debate so I'll just put what I said here.  I'm done now thanks for the debates.     Revenge is just harming another to make yourself feel better. So no I don't see any difference of harming another for satisfaction against harming another for satisfaction. If it was about justice you'd just put him down pain free with argon and nitrogen gas. You haven't yet expained why torture should be a requirement leading up to his death. Which means this isn't about his death or justice. This is only about his torture. And why would someone want to see another be tortured? For personal satisfaction..... harming another to satisfy internal emotional desires. It is EXACTLY the same.   As long as we continue to enforce our laws, by utilizing the same behaviors as the criminals themselves, we will see nothing other than the continued perpetuation of these types of events within our society.     We must rise above our gnashing teeth and primitive selves if we are ever to make progress as a civilized people.     Edit2: The arguments that "they deserve it" or "they are a monster" or "it is justified" are the same arguments that the government used to defend it's torture practices.  Looking at ISIS we can definitely say that those practices made life MORE violent for us.... not less.    By allowing this sort of brutalization you say to the government that it is justified to use whatever means it desires to assert it's will.  And thus you have a society feeling more like it's them vs the government.  And most certainly the government will feel the same and will respond accordingly to protect itself.    "Escalation of the situation" from the top down is what's destroying our society.  It permeates itself in our cops and criminals, in our political debates and our legislation.    This shit's got to stop.      How's it feel to think exactly like the man you're killing?      Finally!  Someone who is like me.   I'm not against the death penalty.   I'm against killing innocent people.  And we keep managing to kill innocent people using the death penalty.   So lets stop doing that until we can figure out how to institute a system where ZERO innocent people get executed.     What is that game... five nights at freddy or something... I can't see these character without thinking of that.         I mentioned on air that my dual band antenna came down in a storm and I couldn't fix it because my hand was disabled.    Went to bed.... woke up the next day to a brand new antenna all set up in the backyard.     I still don't know who did it.  No note... nothing.    money.   China already shares a massive border with a US ally that has nuclear weapons... not sure what your point is.     I loved Cheers at the time.  But I go back to watch it now and I hate it.

Tried all the different pills.  Nothing worked except Gabapentin and even then... not really.     Other solutions are nerve blocks... those are temporary, risky, and I don't care to have more needles shoved in there.    The solution is to remove my useless finger, and the muscle groups that are causing the pain.   I'm not using them... get rid of it so the pain goes away.     I'll still have phantom limb... but all the other more terrible side of this pain will go away.      [not at the theater.](http://the-gadgeteer.com/2014/01/20/amc-movie-theater-calls-fbi-to-arrest-a-google-glass-user/)   yeah but how much longer??????????????????????????????????/   damn not ANOTHER pair of ruined undies!    When something is so sad that you can only laugh.   WTF I hate that.     North Korea is still around because it makes communism look bad. And the USA likes that because as long as communism looks bad, China is de-legitimized.     puh... "minerals"   we got minerals every where else.    They got oil?     We can easily shoot down korean technology missles.   So I think I wouldn't worry about that.    Their artillery is very visible to satellites. And any type of fortified bunker they have our bunker busters can easily penetrate.  We can launch from ships, from planes, from stealth bombers.     Our missle defense systems are a lot more advanced than we let on.     I'm sure South Korea has developed plans to minimize civilian deaths after living under the threat of attack all these years.  No doubt alarm signals.     So I think it would be over very very fast.    It's not like fighting scattered terrorists.  Against a nationstate our military will dominate.                        I gotta say this place is dangerous as hell for motorcycles.   It is anarchy on the pothole filled roads out here and the massive yellow Bachelor Bus owns every bit of it.      Thankfully, my accident today was just minor and DID NOT involve a Bachelor Bus passing a tricycle cab around a blind curve.     Instead I got T-boned.   Fucked my leg up a bit and bent my foot peg flat.   I really really don't understand how I did not drop the bike.    He decided the man stopping at the intersection of two highways had no good reason to do so.   Instead of considering the possiblity that the other vehicle may have stopped for oncoming traffic, the driver passes around him and shoots on into the street.     I saw him shoot out at the last second.  I really did not want to get hit at an angle... especially with an oncoming truck that was overloaded with Copra.   I preferred going onto his hood instead of over it and onto the pavement.  Luckily I was rewarded with neither after jerking the bike into position.   I really don't know if that was the right move or not as I've only been riding on road for a year.   But it worked out.     My back tire got busted from the lateral push on it...   I just have a bruise on my leg that hurts a bit when I walk.    No bones broken, but metal part on the bike crushed.   Not sure how my leg isn't broken... or how I kept the bike up.    But his front bumper got completely torn off.   Good that fucking retard.   Idiot then tried to fit the bumper in his back seat and couldn't figure out why the doors wouldn't close with it in there.   After threatening to call the cops and cursing his dumb pinoy ass out, he decided that throwing the bumper in his open trunk and speeding away was a good solution to his problem.     I got the footrest peg sort of straightened out, but it'll never be the same.      My poor little shitty Yamaha SZ.....    After being forged in the fires of Anarchy and shitty road conditions, riding in the USA is gonna be a cakewalk.    Hope I don't get complacent.      That fuckers car got fucked up  Good for him.... dumb piece of shit.       All gear, all the time for me......  I'm gonna get the hard shin guards now.       [The 22nd amendment is worded that someone cannot be ELECTED to the presidency twice.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)   But can they ascend to the presidency.     For example, if Obama was elected to the House of Representatives, and voted as Speaker of the House, and then both the president and VP are killed....    Would he still be within the confines of the constitution.     (it should be noted this is NOT wishful thinking.)     I've been living in very poor rural area of the Philippines for over a year.   No mirrors here and no need for one because you're just gonna be dirty, hot, and sweaty.    Then I saw one in town.  Heart jumped when I saw my dad.  Damn, tropical sun ages the he'll out of you!   Ugh...   Public schools failed me by teaching incorrect comma usage as correct.   They neglected the semicolon;  is it a period, comma, or period/comma hybrid?   The Harvard comma; I've been taught is correct, incorrect, or doesn't matter.     In public school I was literally told that parentheses are just the evolution of commas.     Two spaces after period?  "Only when handwriting."   ..................... sigh.    Numbers :Was told only write it out if there is already a digit in the sentence.        And of course when I took grammar in college the professor just said he didn't care about grammar because no one knew how to do it.    After 3 weeks of learning nothing I just Clept the course credit.   No I STILL don't know, but have the credit that says I do, and that generally makes me a useless human being.  Because of this I am now against clept.    Oh and I get corrected by grammar Nazis all the time but a lot of times they are wrong too so it doesn't help.    Is there like a free online course somewhere that can help me???   I'm an approaching middle age and haven't the slightest clue.    I thought the strand was dead outside of the root and therefore incapable of change.         Gimme a break... Gimme a break...  Break me off a piece of that kit Kat bar.     Can I keep bob4 modem on Kitkat or just dump it too?        For all you heavy multitasking and speed users out there.    I should clarify romantic songs.     ++So I chose to use Chrome instead of the built-in browser.  The built in browser has full screen.  AFAIK chrome does not have a fullscreen setting... at least not one I can find.     Well I really regret my decision now because the screen is now burned where the status bar is.    I am now using the stock browser... especially on white screen you can see the "off white" of the main screen with a crisp very white bar where the black status bar is.  But the effect is very visible in landscape like while watching a movie or playing a game.....  I've tried several apps that claim this can be undone.  But none have worked and probably never will.  I spend many many many hours a day reading the Internet.  So the burn is likely permanent.    And of course I'm Knox 0x1.   Word to the wise... use fullscreen browsers if you are extremely heavy user like I am.     Edit:  here is pic.  Also why would you down vote this?  I clearly stated this is entirely my own fault and did not act like the phone is the problem.  http://i.imgur.com/H4HYvnp.jpg            This story is a bit long so you may want to grab a snack and a drink.     We will call her Jenny for this.      When I first met Jenny, she was my girlfriends best friend.  My girlfriend accused me of having sex with Jenny, and broke it off.    I DID NOT have sex with her.  I was struggling with my own sexuality at the time.  I had not been having sex with my girlfriend for some time.  My girlfriend made this accusation upon returning from traveling to Alabama with her ex boyfriend.  I'm not stupid; they fucked.  And more power to them... I certainly wasn't doing it and had to think about dicks to even try.   Yep... I'm gay I remember realizing.   I remember telling myself, Fuck it who cares just be gay, dude.   Anyway.  Jenny and I became good friends after this ordeal.   When I met Jenny she seemed mature beyond her years but that maturity came with a child like innocence.   Sometimes objects would entrance her.  She would examine it closely and pick out the smallest details and appreciate their beauty.  All this while having reddit open, and learning about particle physics at the same time.   Oh and don't forget the octopus hat.     I loved her so deeply.  In a non-romantic way.     Jenny had problems in her past.  Her family was not very supportive of her.  I think they just didn't know what to do.   Jenny dropped out of highschool,after an off the record meeting with the school counselor; in which she was advised that she should do so.   The school didn't know what to do with her either.  Later I encouraged her to get her GED (good enough diploma) so that she could at least get into a local college. In order to take her, I got fired from my job for calling in sick and not providing a requested Doctors note.  Fuck that job anyway, this shit was important.      Jenny was highly, highly intelligent.  She could figure anything out. She absorbed all available data that she could.  Johnny Five seriously yo.       Jenny had problems socializing with others.  She liked big gatherings of people, but preferred to stay off to the side and observe while talking with the one or two people she felt comfortable with.      After a while Jenny lost her job.  She was fired for poor customer service.   After that we did not have enough money to pay the bills.   And I detected agitation... or an increasing anxiety in her.   I knew she needed a doctor, but we had no insurance.        So I said to Jenny, Why don't we just get married at the courthouse.  I'll join them military and you'll get medical insurance.     And she agreed.   So that is what we did.      At first it was great.  Jenny was excited about us moving.  Which was surprising to me because she did not like changes to her environment.   But she was okay with this.      Then, I got deployed.... while I was away, Jenny began reading the news about the war.  Her agitation increased because she was completely dependent on me.   What would she do if I died?  Where would she work if she couldn't talk to people?      And the news kept getting worse.  She kept reading all the links on reddit about government programs spying on us citizens.  About how people could hack into kinect and listen to what you're saying and watch you.   About how the government could tap into your cellphone and listen to the mic anytime it wanted.....     Deeper and deeper into anxiety she sank.   Her ability to absorb data was astounding.  She would literally have hundreds of tabs open on her browser; and know what each tab contained.   So all this dark bad news she absorbed.      When I got back, I discovered half completed wall paint projects all over the house.  I discovered unwashed gagging stink in the sink, of old ramen noodles, while the rest of the house was immaculately clean.    The military medically retired me for the injuries I sustained from my time in Iraq.   She continued to refuse to see a doctor.   But after 2 years of random raging emotional meltdowns, she finally agreed to go.  Oh my goodness the meltdowns.  Her screaming and raging about how I shouldn't have a smartphone.  The government is listening.    She would bury her cellphone under blankets and insisted that we have double firewalls on the internet.   Oh and she smashed up the kinect and the entire Xbox after reading hackers could see you.      The psychologist did some aptitude tests and other tests.  The psychologist called me in to discuss the findings.   Jenny was in the highest percentile for intelligence.  She should have been inventing fusion reactors....    But Jenny was also autistic.  Used to be called Asberger's syndrome but doctor said that was not a real thing and its just called Autism.        The only experience I had with autism was meeting the cousin of a friend of mine.... this kid was in his own world and didn't talk.   But the doctor explained Jenny was had a high functioning autism.      Around this time, I was to the point in my recovery that I wanted to use my 911 GI Bill to go to school.     Jenny had revealed that she just wanted a house in the mountains somewhere with no internet and lots of books.   The psychologist agreed that this might be the best thing for Jenny as her anxiety was virtually uncontrollable.   Jenny refused any type of medication.      OK so I will go get that house in the mountains for you.   I needed to go to school and I wanted to work in ecology for national parks which are being overrun with invasive species of plants.  So I found a school that was perfect for me in Washington State.    The psychologist explained that Jenny needed to learn how to be independent.  I agreed.  So I was given the okay by the doctor that Jenny would be fine if I left to go to school on the other side of the country.   The doctor said she would monitor Jenny closely, and have social workers check in on her at home.     So I went.  I was gone for about one month.   The day before school was to start, Jenny had a massive meltdown.  Screaming over the phone at me how I abandoned her.   This hurt so bad.  I was doing this so that I could obtain the income to move her to the place she wanted in the mountains.  She kept screaming, FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!   And then she hung up the phone.   She had done this many many times before.  Often not speaking to me or answering my calls for days aftwards.    So I called the doctor and asked her to check in on Jenny.  The doctor said she would go visit in two days because she was out of the state.  The social worker was not answering her phone either.        So I went to the orientation at the school the next morning.   Jenny was still mad;  not answering her phone.     While washing my face in the bathroom I remember thinking, What if she killed herself?     And then to my horror I said aloud, That would be a relief.   Then I cried for 20 minutes for having thought that.   I loved Jenny so much.  I just wanted her to be happy.  To recapture that innocence and wonder she had.   To live life without mistreatment from others.  I remember going and sitting outside her job at the mall and watch as the customers would abuse her.      There was just something about the way she acted that invited people to scream at her and be rude.  I interfered with one telling the customer to back off.   Security then said I had to leave the mall and banned me.   Fuck them, those motherfucking asshat security fucks with their plastic badges and stupid hats they wear indoors.  That fat fuck couldn't see I was defending a family member against an aggressor.   Dumb fat fuck, with the front of his mall cop uniform untucked because his belly was jiggling below it like it was jello.       I had to leave home because the orientation day was going to start.   So I went to school and tried calling every chance I got.   No answer.    But she's done this before.  I kept telling myself she would be okay.      But that evening, I could not take it anymore.   So I called the police and asked if they would go check on her.      The cop arrived at the house and called me on the phone.  He said there was no answer but he could see the rice cooker light on through the window and the car was still there.      I told him to bust the glass on the door and enter the house.   He said okay and that he would call me back.      Five minutes passed.   A goddamn eternity it was.   I called the cops phone.   No answer.      Ten minutes passed.   Fucking cop won't answer the phone.       Twenty minutes passed.   Surely its something really bad he found if he's not calling or answering his phone.       So I call the neighbor.   Neighbor says that I better talk to the cop but its not good.       With that information I tell myself.  Jenny is dead.      Finally the cop calls.  He says,  I'm sorry sir I have to inform you that your wife is dead.   She hung herself.  The body is cold so we did not try CPR.  An ambulance is on its way.   We then hung up.        I couldn't believe it.   I blamed myself for saying what I did that morning.  I thought somehow that is what caused this.      Even though we were not sexually involved, we were still married and therefore partnered in nearly everything.  She was my best friend.  She was just an innocent bunny.      I dropped from school, returned home to clean out the house.   And I saw it.... the hole in the wall above the closet.   And then I realized why I could not find my German Shepherd Dog's leash.      Jenny hung herself with it.  And then I wept some more for about an hour.  Walking around the now empty house.  I was abandoning it.  I could not live there but could not afford to pay the mortgage and rent on a different place at the same time.   So I let it foreclose.      But anyway.  I remember walking around in circles, in her bedroom, weeping and looking at the hole in the wall.    I just wanted Jenny back.  Sometimes almost believed that any second she'll come walking in while talking way too loud about some kitten picture she saw on reddit or showing me yet another printout of Einstein's face that she photoshopped onto a kitten.      I cried like I never cried before. I was  slobbery, snot drenched, hot weeping mess.    And then suddenly it stopped.  And I was no longer sad but instead mad at Jenny.      And I'm still angry.  It was just such a waste.  She was so damn smart.  Should have been giving gifts to all humanity with her scientific discoveries.   And she just quit life like that.   She didn't give a fuck about how anyone else would feel about her suicide and just left.   No note or anything left behind.      What in the FUCK Jenny???????   And for 2 years I haven't told anyone about this anger or shown it.  I just say that I am glad she is not suffering anymore.  And I hope she's chilling with Einstein right now.   My life has moved on, I am now using my pension to do humanitarian work in the Philippines.  But dammit I'm still so mad at her.   I wish I could feel something other than anger.  Because I loved her and now she's gone.  She just fucking quit and left.     So that's it.  Its off my chest I guess.   Not really.  I'll just bottle this back up and bury it inside like I always do.  I'll just press on with life and keep my anger a secret from everyone else.   And in private I'll say my usual, God fucking dammit Jenny.  What the fuck?    My prayer.      TLDR:Please go fuck yourself, Lazy.   :p.  I asked nicely...   Edit:  what's with all the fucking hate mail?  I followed the doctors advice.  I also sacrificed my life to take care of someone who's family abandoned her.  I'm no saint... but at least I made sure she was fed, warm, and dry.  I gave her everything she ever asked for and more.    If you don't have the fucking balls to say shit here for public scrutiny then you're just a chicken shit pansy.  Grow some balls.  (Wait no those are weak)  grow a vagina and then shove a watermelon out of it. Now you're a man.     Wait.... what?  Lol.    Edit2:  writing this was incredibly therapeutic.  It's like something has been squeezing my heart and it just let go.  I cried for the first time since i was in the bedroom looking at the hole above the closet.  I will choose to be thankful for all the octopus hat wearing Einstein as a kitten moments.  I'm still not fully okay. .. probably never will be.  But at least the heart squeezing is gone.  Thanks reddit.          Furthermore, the magic full bars spot changes slightly throughout the day. The magic spot is always in the same spot is was at that time day previous.  So if it's afternoon, the magic spot is different than it was in the morning but the same spot it was the afternoon previously.    At night the bars are full in every spot.  So maybe interference from the sun?  I know that increased sunspot activity caused problems with some communications.   But it can enhance some .. my dad used to get on shortwave and talk to people in other countries during increased sunspot activity.  He explained that this caused an increase of ionization of the ionosphere which he used to bounce his signal.   Edit:  why would you down vote this question?            Ok so this happened over 20 years ago when I was in high school.    I was a tad small for my age, not entirely bullied but physically I was inferior to all the other boys my age.  This would change later but I was a bit of a late bloomer.  Certainly, the size issue was a problem a few times in my New Orleans highschool.   I was one of the few white kids in the school.  So I always had to prove myself to earn respect.   And you did not want to find yourself without respect there.     Biology class was about to begin so a couple of friends and I stop off in the bathroom.  The science hall shared this restroom with the special education department.    In the restroom was a boy with down syndrome.  He had taken his pants entirely off, along with his underwear, to pee in the urinal.    So my giggling friends dare me, "dude dude take his pants yo".  I immediately declined saying no way.     Then they threaten me and say they will tell the whole school I'm a bitch and hang signs around the school saying the same thing.    So reluctantly I agree to take his pants.   So I scoop up his pants and underwear and run straight out the bathroom and around to the exit door.  I threw his pants in the trashcan outside.     Then I return to high fives and way-to-goes from my friends.   After all the laughter and celebration, I notice a teacher is agitated outside the bathroom.    She yells inside, "Fake Name, it's time for class come out of there this instant!"    Out comes this crying and moaning kid with a too short t shirt on, face smeared with tears, and nothing on from above his belly button down.  The entire body of students in the hallway laugh... at...him...   I was so ashamed.   I could not sleep that night.  The next day, an announcement was made asking for information in who stole his pants.    None of my friends ratted me out.    I knew the right thing to do was to turn myself in and attempt to redeem myself through apology and punishment.     But I thought that would make me even more popular for what I had done, because the news would spread who did it....  This was just a justification or rationalization for me being too afraid to get in trouble.    Now, over 20 years later, I still feel just as guilty as I did that first night.  Solid in my guilt with the knowledge I was given an opportunity to turn myself in and make it right.  And I did not.  And I wonder if that scarred this kid for life.  If he ever recovered.  By his tears he clearly understood that someone was being cruel, for no good reason at all.     TIFU??   No.  Today I became a real piece of shit.                     This could be made to work with Sigourney Weaver's age.  Because when she has an evil role she is one evil bitch and plays it well.   An older Ripley gets called to advise a team of people who need to stop an Alien invasion, led by an escaped Ripley/Alien hybrid that has been building her brood for decades.   Good ripley dies or bad ripley dies?   I'm sure this is adverse to the spirit of how reddit is intended to work; but I almost never sort subreddits by new.  Whenever I do, it feels like I am going through the pile of junk mail on Monday To find the damn letter I'm waiting for.     So I focus only Hot or Rising.   I will express my gratitude to those of you who do spend time upvoting on New items.  I often imagine you guys, down there in the dark filth, with a brassy saxophone playing and covered in pig shit; Madly shoveling through the piles of crap that just keep on pouring in...  For comments however, I love to sort new. I often find lots of good stuff there.      I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines until 2016.  There is absolutely nothing to do here except watch shitty bootleg movies.   In town there are several stores that sell DVDs such as "The Bruce Willis Collection".  The DVD, (that says Blu-ray at the top) will have 6 to 12 movies on it.     These movies are always low quality of varying degrees.  Sometimes, I can make the pictures look a little better by playing with different interlacing; depending on the nature of the picture.  However, conditions can change between chapters; and I find myself clumsily picking different interlacing.     So maybe someone can guide this ignorant fool.  Forgive me if I use wrong terminology while I attempt to describe.    I need to know which interlacing is best for   1. When the edges are fuzzy.  (Yes I know about the sharpen edges settings and also the ones Nvidia ctrl panel)  sharpen edges can really fuck you when then image is blocky.     2. When the image is blocky   3.  When the image Is noisy   4. Grainy images (like noisy but more like sand than snow)  5. Random pixelization. (Not like big stationary blocky but small random blocks that move with the image)    I realize there will not be a magic wand that is going to magically turn this shit into 2K definition, but perhaps soothe the God Damn thing would be nice.  Edit: Please don't respond with "Google it".  Im on a 2x connect and reddit is one of the only websites I can get to load (thank fucking Christ almighty for that).      This can include anything from clothing to habits/behaviors.    Don't just be like "when her pussy smells bad" be real because your sweaty nuts aren't all roses at the end of the day either.   Try and include day to day stuff.         	106
 I would recommend that links to the actual leaks here not be included. Discussion is what is really desired (at least for me), but the links allow them grounds to delete the links in their subs to this one. Anyone can do a google search and find them quite easily without too much instruction.  I agree 100%.   The response I posted in the other thread:  I do understand the sentiment even though I suspect it's a bit hypocritical. I doubt that out of all of the mods over at /r/gameofthrones, none has watched the leaked episodes... Well, it's a moot point.   I guess there's just one thing to do:**Whenever you see anyone over in /r/gameofthrones (or any other sub) ask about a place to discuss the leaked episodes, send them a PM to inform them of this subreddit.**   That way only people *overtly* looking for a discussion are told of this place and the mods over at /r/gameofthrones can rest assured that this sub is only "advertised" to people who want to take part in the discussion.

Yeah, me too...   Do that.   I understand and respect their decision to not allow any discussion of the leaked episodes on /r/gameofthrones but at the same I would like them to acknowledge that people *will* watch them and *will* want to discuss them afterwards, to pretend anything else would be naive.   Why not give viewers a sub where they can do just that? It would drastically cut down on spoilers in /r/gameofthrones and it would give subscribers a clear decision: Want to watch the leaked episodes and discuss them afterwards? Head over to /r/piratesofthrones. Want to watch the episodes as they air and remain spoiler-free? Stay in /r/gameofthrones!   By the same logic they could ban ASOIAF wikis. I don't think they should have to keep their subscribers safe from spoilers *outside of their own sub*...   Some one mentioned /r/piratesofthrones in a comment in the "Episode leaks, Spoilers and Piracy" sticky thread.  I responded to them with this:  I wouldn't be surprised if your post were deleted - it's what happened to the only other post I saw mentioning another such subreddit. I would be interested in the mods' reasoning behind this. I understand and support their decision to keep /r/gameofthrones as spoiler-free as possible but it seems like sending people to another sub for the discussion of the leaked episodes could only help that goal!  A couple of minutes later both our posts had been deleted. No explanation by the mods. The only explanation I can come up with is that the mod team doesn't want people to fuck off to other subs but that would be incredibly petty...  Thoughts?   Right you are. Thanks for refreshing my memory!   It's been so very long since I read the books so I'd appreciate it if someone could refresh my memory:  Is that how Mance dies in the books? This scene seemed very unfamiliar to me. Also, it seems like they completely changed Tyrion's story line or am I remembering that wrong? Was Varys with him in the books?   I wouldn't be surprised if your post were deleted - it's what happened to the only other post I saw mentioning another such subreddit.   I would be interested in the mods' reasoning behind this. I understand and support their decision to keep /r/gameofthrones as spoiler-free as possible but it seems like sending people to another sub for the discussion of the leaked episodes could only help that goal!   I agree - sex is an important aspect of a romantic relationship and you're not helping anyone by staying in a relationship with someone who won't/can't fulfill you sexually.    Good idea, a separate subreddit will help keep /r/GameOfThrones as spoiler-free as possible!  Upvoted for visibility.   Serious question:  I understand that the uploader blurred the watermark but wouldn't HBO alter something (e.g. a tiny blip in a random frame) unique to each screener so that if it leaks they could find the guilty party?  	13

 Chris Wilson head shape is quite cool.   Cuddle time with girls.   No omat vanhemmat kysy ett olenko homo kun kannatan ja kyseess on kutein opettaja pariskunta...   why?   Yhdyn sinuun, mutta en silleen homosti.  Vhn tuntuu silt ett edes kaikki kannattajat eivt ole ihan tysin ymmrtneet esityst. Mik on taas johtanut surkean hupaisaan argumentointiin ja vristnyt varsinkin vastapuolen nkemyksi.   This not NSFW?   So you are student? I think getting education is always good life-choise!   Huumori tuppaa vhn menett tarkotuksensa siin vaiheessa kun sit toistetaan.   On ollut muutenkin vhn mautonta viher-vassari toimintaa. Kaikki asiaa vastustaneet ovat ollut idiootteja ja homofobistisia. Sen sijaan ett oltaisiin kuunneltu vastapuolta, jotka ovat mys ihmisi. Esimerkiksi Niinistll olisi ehk ollut hieman koko kansaa mielyttvmpi nkkulma asiaan. Nyt vaan pit toivoa ett tm ei kostaannu tulevalla soinin ja sipiln valtakaudella.  Mutta enemmn hvett median puolesta. Se on puskenut asiaa lpi vain yhdest nkkulmasta. Voiko mediaan jatkossa enn luottaa missn asiassa? Mit asiaa ajetaan seuraavaksi vain yhdest nkkulmasta?  Edit: Miksei kukaan ole esim tehnyt huumoria Sipiln homo vastaisuudesta?   Alkaa olee jo vhn aikansa elnytt huumoria.   Psiks levitt vaseliinia? Meil ainakin tykttiin hierasta vhn vaseliinia ennen marsseja ja mukavempaahan se oli kun kaveri pisti.   It is not writen in the law yet. There is still posibility next parlament will stop it and there is really high chance next parlament is really conservative.   Muistuttaa vhn Tom of Finlandia, enn puuttuu nahkavetimet ja viikset.

 Best looking vehicle with a Subaru badge on it. I've got to go back to [this] (http://www.motorstown.com/imgs/18020-subaru-svx-2.html) in order to recall any other Subaru as visually stunning.    You should drop Mendenhall. There has got to be another way to fill that roster spot with someone that doesn't register 0 each week. Time to start scoring some points, man.   Being that you're in Chicago after all [unlawful intent can be presumed] (http://thefiringline.com/library/blades/knifelaws.html)   Not the most exciting roster spot to add, but consider the Cardinals D/ST. They shut down Vick and the Eagles weapons last week, and are going up against a struggling Miami offense.   Livable wages   fair medical benefits would be the first of a number of reasons. Unionized commercial food workers can make around $16-17 per hour for the jobs that Walmart workers get paid $9-10 an hour for.    The ice rink at Millennium Park would be a great option in late November. Zoo Lights in Lincoln Park = free. Ride the Ferris Wheel if the two of you aren't afraid to shiver a little.     Perhaps the Gangster Disciples near Division   Pulaski should consider moving to a more friendly community. So many of their neighbors are of the insane/maniacal variety.   Any game that the Hogs play against the Wolves will either be televised on Comcast or MY50 for Chicago locals. The way AHL's scheduling is structured that's probably 8-10 games this season   Sometimes stickers come in cow shapes and chicken shapes too. That's protein for ya!    Perhaps Cutler could be more of a said bitch if he went to play for the Wings and remained a mediocre defenseman on their squad until he is 67 years old.   This has got to be one of the lesser liked Illinois or Cook County cops. They gave him a 2004 Malibu!   Inappropriate. There is no way that the Pentagon is that close to New York!    James's turn:        C   O   C   K           H    No brainer. Forte   Spiller/Martin could all start ahead of a wildly unpredictable Johnson.   I find it more offensive that the Canucks are #3. First, their logo can simply be classified as stupid. Additionally, the huge VANCOUVER letters are obnoxious. Lastly, they borrowed the color scheme from the 1990s Seahawks. #3? Seriously?   For most of the mid 90s until about 2006 these jerseys were about the only thing the Hawks had going for them.    What did the 911 call sound like?    It's a bit crazy. I've thought about proposing some trades for depth. Trading away the guys that you drafted early makes no sense though. Why pick a RB/WR1 and not show the confidence to keep him on your roster?   Looked at the title too fast and thought "He bought steak at Giordano's!?" ...but hopefully this helps the owners get it together.    Guy is alone because of the Detroit Vipers jersey.   How the hell is Jamaal Charles on waivers in your league? Seems like you're dominating a league of inexperienced players. Have fun winning.   Change Portage Park to Polish Park.    Svengoolie was at his best in those years that it aired @ 11pm on WCIU!   Saddest moment in Berwyn history: http://chicagoist.com/2008/05/03/berwyn_spindle_1.php   Gone are the days when the Wolves were the only independent club in the IHL; I miss that. It's partly said "business" and partly the growing emphasis on the AHL being a developmental league. It seems that the number of veterans a club is allowed keeps shrinking.   But with an impending lockout there is a great deal to be excited about this October! The roster will be stacked, and Wendell has brought Haydar and Sterling back together too.      I second this. The wolves are more of their own entity than most AHL teams.   As far as the Ice Hogs go... thanks for Andrew Shaw. Nothing else positive to say about that organization.   Terrible luck!   If you go to Velasquez   Sons they can replace a catalytic converter way cheaper than most. It was 2006, but I got one for $90 parts and labor.    Even funnier is the ad box on the tribune's page:   "Single? Meet local older women for free!"    AHL gets no coverage in the states either. Chicago Wolves are the only team that televises all of their games, and it's local coverage only.    Way too much credit being given to Americans with this. This is assuming that they know of at least 10 countries in this region and can identify their shapes.   AHL during the last lockout was damn good. Guys like Vanek   Cammelleri ,that normally would have made NHL squads, played and tore things up. I remember watching my Wolves get destroyed in the finals by a team that featured Patrick Sharp, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Umberger, Nittamayki, and more.    Since it is a 2-way deal they should be able to.   The circumstances were different in 2004-2005, but young NHL players like E.Staal and Spezza went down to the AHL after playing full seasons in the NHL.   Not over Sproles. Even though Sproles may get less than 10 carries, he has the potential to grab ~8 passes and rack up big yardage. Gerhart my get the same amount of touches, but his ceiling isn't nearly as high.    For a 10 team league this is terrible depth at RB.    Satisfyingly evil-looking.    Is it? Shouldn't it be "woman's best friend." Not "women's" Nobody is saying "men's best friend."   So I'll refine my question and eliminate the loaded term "genocide."   What is the proper historical legacy of Japanese war crimes (and crimes against humanity) that included: mass killings, human experimentation, biological warfare, and undeniable torture during the time period I mentioned?   This must be your life...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfTI4JE2m40  "What?... You said "fantasy."   This is really informative. I have found historian, Herbert Klein's book on the Atlantic Slave Trade very eye-opening in many respects to slavery's practice on an international level.   http://historyandvarioustopics.blogspot.com/2011/07/book-review-atlantic-slave-trade-1999-h.html   Sometimes referred to as the "Asian Holocaust," some historians cite a number of ~30 million Chinese, Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese dead a the hands of Japan during this time period.   http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia     What other city is this killer-friendly. At least Detroit is showing it can be an attractive place for at least one group of people.   "The Great Encounter of China and the West" D.E. Mungello.   Not a female, but I'm going to guess that women hate denim shorts the most. (on men)  Weirdly enough there are tons of denim shorts on women out there, why does this make sense?    I've been a good sport and worn all of the clothes that my girlfriend buys me. Even purple shirts but I will absolutely draw the line at pink!   This is staggering stuff: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia  How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.    No way! I've never under-appreciated this dude since I learned about him in sixth grade.   We've literally taken a crap on his legacy... Well, I guess that was point of his invention.     Rosalind Franklin... but that may be too easy as well because of all the posthumous recognition.   I'll go with significant, not necessarily great, Robert Oppenheimer.    Anything about 9/11   OR   when James Dobson insisted that Spongebob is making kids gay.   Did she take your reputation into consideration when she cheated on you?   You have no moral responsibility to respect the confidentiality of someone who showed absolutely no respect to you.    It has been a long journey for this guy since playing in Texas trailer-parks.   Now he's playing for ~$10million (American); so much to like about this guy's style of play. He ought to be a great fit.     You must have been that girl from Venezuela.   The dude's aura communicates so well.   Morrow   Hartnell are actually pretty clear to spot.   Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts.   Shooter gets 5 seconds to take the ball ~40 yards   crack one on goal. Goalies can charge shooters, sit back, or get caught in no-man's land. Equally intense to the hockey shootout. Check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEnwi7otu0    Uh. I think you mean that Chicago is like Toronto except Chicago has 10 times as many murders. But, otherwise a Canadian ought to love it here. Be smart and bring your own maple syrup.     interested. what time on sunday 9/2?   I would be interested for sure.   My '02 had problems with the Pass-Lock Security system that also made the ignition lock up   refuse to start.

However, being that he is outside the trapezoid/ goalie zone, the rules should allow for him to be bodychecked within the rules of checking any other puck-handling skater. I know my grandpa would love to see this, he suggests this every time he sees the damn trapezoid on tv.   Had to have been a Catholic/parochial school; being that it is evil to waste I was forced to eat the white, slime-based coleslaw by a nun. Not to mention the sandwich my brother's teacher fished out of the garbage for him.      	61
    Just yesterday I have seen this quote being credited to Anne Frank!   Yes, Gitanjali is absolutely *the* place to start Tagore.   They're really worthy.. especially Kindle Paperwhite, which has an inbuilt light as well... Amazon has provided many many classics in Kindle format for free.. That's really something worth mentioning and worth respecting.. It has an AMAZING and flaunty life.. And the best part (although not accurately a moral point) about Kindle is you don't have to really *buy* the books in Kindle editions.. You can just download those ebooks in *.mobi* format from torrents.. I mean, come on, we all download stuff from internet!   A couple of years ago, I was introduced to the real beauty of words through *Gitanjali* by Tagore. (And that day I understood what kind of Literary art forms are awarded Nobels in Literature)  Have you people read that book..? If so, how you liked it??   very fuckin funny!!   Oh fuuuuuuckkk!!! It's awesome :D :D :D   Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca from *Angels and Demons* by Dan Brown   **STEPHEN KING IS A GREAT WRITER.**    it relates to the themes of finding beauty and meaning in the dull American suburbs.   Does Beauty mean trying to work out and develop body so that he can fuck his daughter's classmate??  (Although, I liked the part when he doesn't fuck her at the end..)      Too good!!   Yeah great thought definitely.. The actual source was Thoreau's very influential essay **Walking**.      Well, that's a very good TIL stuff! Thanks..   I guess, that's because they're too busy trying to be funny in their comments in order to get up-voted.    care to explain, anybody??   no words!!   Oh wow.. you gave there a whole new website for quoted pictures.... lovely!!!    Awesome!! JUst outstanding...   thank you so much for posting this here.. awesome post!!   this quote is directly going to my twitter right now....   Something!!   "He didnt like what he had seen so far of moneys influence, and who could blame him? So far as he could see, money corrupted whatever it touched. Money kept his mother waiting for buses that never came and prevented him from attending schools that could have brought out the best in him. Money put people on different levels, in a way he found unnatural.  And money caused people to forget the right reasons for doing a thing." ~Michael Lewis, NEXT   [These](http://www.rstudio.com/faq-items/connect-rstudio-oracle-database/) might help. Sorry, if they don't.   [This](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf) is the tutorial that I was following.. and 3rd chapter knocked me down.  Any help would be much appreciated.     Interesting. The quote, and its author, Friedrich Nietzsche, both are interesting.    I put quotation marks around the word finished because I've discovered that finishing a fiction writing project is not like finishing a cheeseburger. I've had to come to a point where I am at some acceptable equilibrium between "I want this to be perfect" and "I can't fucking look at this thing again  Very well put.. Might as well start a new sub with the name r/AspiringWriterProblems   *Hey, I mean it, ah!*   Since my childhood, something about sky always interested me.. The mystery in there, in the eternal space has kept me enchanted and left me wondering about what dwells there and beyond. Now, once and for all, I want to take interest in Astronomy.. please suggest me where to start. (by the way, I'm 25 and from India)      Well, that's a pretty fucked up attitude for a growing future citizen of this world!    That's shit sad.. really.    Isn't it great to be a nerd!! Using the mind, keeping it focused for something worthy... I can only feel sorry for those who thinks bullying them is fun!!    So can they be just beaten up by other kids??.. Is *that* a good social acumen for them??   In what ways?      See this is what reasoning sometimes does.. ruins the feel out of it.. Anyways, we won't do any *bioluminescence* for whatever worthy we want to burn in our lives.. so we can be fine with the quote!      In such case, the best part would be to rather talk.. Speak in English with someone who is good at it and ask them to correct you whenever you err. As this goes on, you will not only become good at grammar but also the correctness in grammar will become a part of your sub-conscious; and with this, you will even realize and catch errors (if any) in something that you read or write..   When I was learning English language in my school days, we were not allowed to speak in any regional language(I'm from India). So, that is how I learned English, by talking it and correcting it whenever I erred.  Listen to audio books as well.. It will be very helpful!  Good Luck :)   * **On Writing** by Stephen King  * **The Elements of Style** by William Strunk  are the most famous of all...     I too am an aspiring writer from a country where English is not the official language, India.. Luckily enough, I was able to pursue all my education in English medium all along..   Ok, now coming to the *Writing* part. To write a well is an art. And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..*  As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level..  *Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it. Once you start doing this regularly, you will not only feel like writing more of them, but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully.. That's how you start recognizing the preciousness of the **art** that you possess.  And once you do that, you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style, flow and simplicity in putting the words together.. When you're well into such process, you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing.  This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing.  *Note*: Read more. Once when you start reading quotes from the books, and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence, sit back and think what would've resulted somebody in writing such a sentence.. and then try to read the book which the quote came from... This way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me, you will desire to create such onces youself.  Even after doing all this, if your skill or ability as a writer doesn't change or advance, tell me, I will give you my address.. you can come and kill me!   If you're a girl, gift me this and I will marry you :D   Awesome!!!! :D   I didn't had to read *Harry Potter* when I was a teenager, but I did.. So when I had faced ethical problems later in my years, where I could've reacted unethically, I opted not to be so. I was good, because I chose to be. Reading those books taught me to be that way.  That's what this quote means.. *It says that something from the books you read will surely stick within your heart and will determine the way you will walk in the path of life when faced with adversities!*    Always liked this quote!!   Yeah.. the conflict itself loses sense without the Time thing!!       How much creativity was lost to WW2?  An interesting and thoughtful point, indeed!   World is a small place, pal!   Alongside loving books, I'm also an avid lover of book covers... If any of you have any favourite book covers or collected albums of them, plz do share them here. I really really want to look at the best bookcovers in the world!!  Thanks :)   Watching movies is fine... but I seriously think you should read books... any normal person who can't go out for a couple of years would sit and watch movies, because it is *easy*...   **Don't be easy!**  Read books... and if you can do that you'll be proud of these two years more than any couple of years in your entire life... and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/) is where you would want to go if you pick up the habit.  (I'm not suggesting you to not watch movies at all, of course you should... all I meant was when you look back, I don't want you to have only *watching movies* as a significant pastime, that is all).  All the best, pal!    Every five years, like clockwork, I think of what an asshole I was five years ago  This is so cool one.. and  Before I do anything, I ask myself "would an idiot do that?" If they would, then I do not do that thing. -Dwight  This one too!!   Well, there is always a search engine these days, isn't there, pal!   That's the beauty of it!!   Some places on the internet this quote was widely attributed to Will Smith.   Very funny!!   Something!   This quote, even in the least bit, doesn't talk about fishing literally... So, you're peace from Fishing isn't going to be touched by this quote.. Chill :)   It is a metaphor that says people live all their lives doing things they are not even conscious about, they just survive and pass days in their lifetime... and then finally after their time is done, they go away without knowing what they lived for all this time..      Oh.. OK.. I was just tying that in Reddit.. didn't do so in R itself. But thanks anyways.. Didn't knew this before :)   I'm a very newbie to R. I just found out that there are numerous datasets inbuilt into R's *datasets* package.  but when I tried to access them, I don't see anything. For ex: when I type  data(Nile) //I have this 'Nile' dataset in the package  The data present inside it is not being visible. The prompt just goes to next line, and nothing happens. But in online examples they got the data when they typed a datasets name like: data(phones)  Any idea why am I not getting the data?   I like the way you presented it... like in UNIX :)   Oh How much I love this kind of posts!!!   **Walden** by *Henry David Thoreau.*  Period.   Your life is more wonderful than you're capable of comprehending.  Awesomely put.. Thanks for the post!   The Twins - that's what their biography should be titled!   Seriously!   Self-control Leonardo level... #RESPECT   by John Green..   **I request people to post the name of the writer who wrote the quote.**    awesome!   18!   Hey this is cool....!!   Deep!   Too deep.... depressingly deep, but at one corner, inspiring. Thank you so much for posting it.   I think I read the book in a hurry... But yeah lots of great quotes..   Nailed it, dude!   Life is weird. You go from being strangers. To being friends. To being more than friends. To being practically strangers again.  This is very nice.   That's a very thoughtful sentence!!   Good guy M..   Stabbing sharp! I think it's really unfair to post such a great quote without crediting its writer.. So, I just found out that it is written by **Naeem Callaway.**   Just what I need... that too from my favourite non-ficition author!!   Funny.. but makes sense!   Deep!   Philip is one of a kind!!   Can somebody explain this??   If it smells like shit everywhere you go, you better check your shoes.   Very nice..  honey why is this whiskey bottle half empty? because you are a pessimist  Well, that's being too frank to your face. Awesome ofcourse!  Very nice list, friend! Thank you.. You should make more of these...    Dont mistake my kindness for weakness. I am kind to everyone, but when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you are going to remember about me. - Al Capone  This is way powerful... Awesome!      I was actually thinking to do this specially for Gone Girl.. I was spellbound by Trent   Ross for their work in *The Social Network* and I'm also enjoying *Gone Girl* now...    8tracks  Never heard of this.. Will surely try.. Sounds interesting what you did.   Wow.. what a post... I really do... Moreover, I imagine and hum in my mind some Hollywood OSTs when reading some of the most important and influencing aspects in a story... It feels seriously enriching experience....   I recently finished reading Michael Crichton's PREY.. and the closing line was deeply provoking:  "*They didn't understand what they were doing.*  I'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race."    I felt interested in asking you people about such touching closing lines from other books.. Let's post/share such lines. Thanks!   I've very recently starting my career with first job by working with Informatica ETL processes.. I'm keenly interested in Data Science.. So, I want to ask you if there a way for me to eventually make a switch into Data Science? What is the necessary skill set that I would need to do so, and is working in Informatica tool going to be of any help to me in the journey towards being a Data Scientist??         1984. It is said to be a timeless classic book in English Literature..  I started it some time long ago, nearly more than a month ago and am still not able to finish it. For me it is surely not a page turner. I'm just keeping up with it still because I feel bad when I start a book and decide not to finish it, so am just trying to read it page by page and find out if I can realize why it is such a classic.  There are many instances in the plot that seemed really senseless.. Winston, Julia and O'Brien... there is no proper relation between how they develop their opinions and feelings that they have for one another.. Why Julia loves Winston and a lot more such loose ends..  Can somebody please tell me why this 1984 is a classic??   A dystopian time period... people living by a set of strange rules and practices... the protagonist character also lives as one among them all.... and then eventually he starts thinking differently... and then a girl character enters the story and that stirs him for even more revolutionary ideas and actions that protest against those time period socially accepted customs...   I have observed the same plot line in very well known classics Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and also a novella Anthem (by Ayn Rand)...   Now, why is that??          Truth be told, I'm heavily influenced by Inception film.. Ever since then, I am interested in lucid dreaming concepts.. I've tried to come up with interesting story lines... but whenever I start writing something.. After some time, inevitably I ask myself "How is this different from Inception, anyways?? Why would people want to read this when they've already seen all this in Inception?"  So I want to ask you people: Is it really possible to write a lucid-dreams fiction, whose concepts would appear new, while most of it is already covered in the Inception film in a very grand manner???  Please help me...         For me, it's every line from *The Social Network*. Every freakin' line, I tell you!  If I've to be really precise, I would pick:   "It's raining."  "I'm sorry."  "It just started raining."   I'm an aspiring writer, and I thought myself to be a fine amateur at Writing. But just today I came across [Medium](http://medium.com) and it was great, but the content I saw there overwhelmed me. Honestly and shamelessly saying, friends, looking at what and how good people are writing there, I found myself being far far from their quality. I'm deeply depressed from all the content I saw there and am feeling very underconfident about my Writing skills. Can somebody please help me?? Thank you!   Whenever I come across some books that have started a new sub-genre kind of thing in themselves (eg: Cyberpunk, Quantum Fiction and etc..) I feel very motivated.. I'm an aspiring writer and I want to write very different books that would completely stand out from the mainstream conventions of sci-fi or any categorizations of literature..   Any tips on how to invent a new genre/sub-genre in Writing??    I'm reading **The Undercover Economist** by Tim Harford.. I'm a novice to economics, but am interested in learning it. So I picked up this book and am reaching its end right now. But there are many things in that book that left me in dark, many concepts seemed very unclear to me, especially the concepts like how game theory is used in auctions and lot more such things from that book. I understood some concepts very well and now am looking at those things differently in everyday reality. So, I want to also get the gist  of those concepts that I didn't understand clearly when I read them from the book. Can somebody please provide me with a link that has a detailed chapter vise summary of the book or any of your personal analyses of them?? It would be of *GREAT* help if you people can do that for me. Thank you!   All mylife I've been great at nothing, only good and ok at a few things. I'm very much fed up with such life style. I want to know how can i remove this mediocrity from my life forever. Tell me what kind of things I would need to do en route this path. (By the way, my ambition in life is to become a *great* writer! )   The way the character Jordan Belfort talks in the movie is simply outstanding and really captivating.. the confidence in his words, his body language, his aggression, the articulation -- all in all his way of speech is everything that a person with "I-want-to-win-the-world" attitude needs!  I'm really impressed by all that.. I want to talk like him... How do I do that?? Any ideas and suggestions?? (By the way, I'm an Indian!)   Ive finished 100 days of abstinence and there is a specific viewpoint of mine that I want to portray today to the members of this brotherhood about the subject at hand, *the addiction.*  Along this time, Ive only, or at least mostly, seen people referring to masturbation as a completely negative thing in their lives and it ruining their vital time. People say its a demon that stops ones development in life and so should be killed. *I dont agree.* It should not be ended; it should rather be fought and conquered but never despised and killed, never; because the real meaning of victory is not killing but conquering. After all, what would we, the powerful Humans, the soldiers who man the eternal Universe residing within each of us, do if there is no worthy opponent, if there is nothing standing between us and the ambitions we carry in our hearts? You can trek to the heights and watch the horizons only when there are mountains present in your way and blocking the view. So, I say your addiction (to masturbation or anything else) is not a prison that locks you up but a gym that strengthens you; and of course strength is only enjoyable when it is tested, not when it is rested. So it tests you, it weakens you, it hits you in the face, it hits you in the heart, it provokes you to fight back, and in the process it makes you stronger, it makes you brave, it makes you familiar to the hurdles again and again in the form of ups and downs, crests and troughs, so that when you encounter greater ones ahead in your life, you dont fear them anymore. Addiction can be an ocean of pleasure; you either learn to swim it and enjoy the dive, or fall straight in and drown away into its depth; choice is yours; and in both the above cases, ocean is not to the blame. A gymnasium is presented to you but working out in there is solely your duty. Don't offend your addictions, overrun them.  After 100 days of staying away from PMO, especially masturbation, this is all Ive realized about it. I wont hate it, I cant hate it; because it gave me intense pleasure since my puberty and I cant deny that. So, I stopped seeing it as an enemy, I never saw it as an enemy, I only saw it as a competitor, as an opponent, who irks me to dare win against it.   I started my abstinence not at all because I was an addict of masturbation, but because its very valuable and enjoyable to me and I wanted to sacrifice such blissful pleasure for a goal that I took up in my life, like leaving the joy and comfort of home and going to the war to achieve my goal. That day was the start, and today it is 100 days; and this is just the beginning.   *Thank you all, for your unstopping support to many brothers like me here, justifying the name, a brotherhood!*   Last year I had A lot of free time.. so I managed to read some 35 books in that year.. that's the biggest number ever for me, till date. Now I'm into my first job theses days. Moved into a new city and new time shcedules and stuff liek that... But these days, after entering into the actual career I'm observing that I'm not reading like before at all... I'm unable to enjoy the reading like before, too. My reading list has increased massively. I love to read, I bought more 20 books from a bookslae and lot of ebook downloads for my Kindle, but besides all this I'm not understadning these new changes in my reading habit and how to cope up with it.. Any suggestons and views??   I see only boys making posts and replying the threads over here. I am wondering if this page is having only male members.. and eventually that made me question myself if we, the MEN, are the weakest Human species when it comes to lust related activities, which is why we needed a whole internet community here to abstain ourselves from PMO!!  Do girls ever, like *EVER*, suffer this PMO related things like us, at all??   Recently there was a conservation going on with my friend about porn and masturbation and I mentioned to him that I took break from all those things.   Friend: Why don't you masturbate?  Me: Just like that, took a break for a while.  Friend: Whatever happens won't you masturbate?  Me: No. I won't.  Friend: What if a very sexy girl comes to you? You won't fuck her?   Me: No.  Friend: Won't you even masturbate thinking about her?  Me: No.  Friend: Why? Don't you have a dick??  Me: *I do. And I also have dignity in my dick.*     I felt very good about myself after I said.   I've always had this doubt inside my mind and now I started watching Carl Sagan's **Cosmos** hence this rose again in me. Now I can't stop asking this to the world, once and for all:  When we talk about the Cosmic entities such Planets, Solar Systems, Stars, Galaxies and etc, we talk in light years.. We, the human beings never even have set foot on the farthest planet even in our own solar system, but we diligently talk of numerous Galaxies apart from our own as if we have a crystal clear knowledge of them.   When we haven't been to any of the other planets or to any farther than our own solar system, how the hell can we say that we are this much far this this galaxy and that much far from that galaxy??   Not just that, anything and everything that is being told about the cosmic universe by our science, how can we be so sure about it all?? For example, in the Cosmos TV Series, *Ryan Nebula* is said to be **ONLY** 1500 Light Years away from Earth.. How on earth can we even envision, sitting here on this planet, about something that requires one to travel for 1500 years at the speed of light??   How in the world do we know all these things? I beg for the answers!!     I'm a blogger and book reader.. For some of my future ventures I need an extensive knowledge of various systems, including how the society works, how an organization works, how corporate works and stuff like that.. So,  I want to start observing them and learn from them. But there is so much that happens around them all that I often get lost in thinking what to observe and take into account.   Can somebody pleaes suggest what kind of observations of the world or a system are vital for understanding those systems in depth?   Although all sci-fi movies aren't good, their sound tracks can sometimes be captivating. I'm collecting such grand and enigmatic tracks from sci-fi movies. Please give out the names of those movies that you've felt as having great sci-fi tracks.  My personal favourites: TRON Legacy, Oblivion, Inception...    Although all sci-fi movies aren't good, their sound tracks can sometimes be captivating. I'm collecting such grand and enigmatic tracks from sci-fi movies. Please give out the names of those movies that you've felt as having great sci-fi tracks.  My personal favourites: TRON Legacy, Oblivion, Inception...   I love to read books.. and then one day, just like that, I also discovered erotica (erotic stories) and started to love the kinky ones..!! I would even go further and say that I was once addicted to them than to the actual porn..   Now, I'm into NoFapping.. I'm on my 70+ days without fapping. But recently, as I started exploring Reddit, I found those subreddits that are very closely related to the kind of erotica I used to read.. and was kinda into them for a couple of days on the weekend.. I broswed through lot of captioned pictures on reddit and some real life stories...  I realized this is wrong too and am again trying to keep myself away from them like I did when started NoFapping a couple of months ago, although I didn't reset my badge right now because I **did not** masturbate at all!!  So, plz tell me does reading erotica, watching related captioned pictures and feeling aroused comes under Porn??   I love to read a lot and I also chose to do so in my life because my future dreams are related to me reading varaciously. But I don't read so fast like many poeple and that makes me low sometimes.. Any of you with similar issues, friends?  I would like to be helped with some suggesstions too!!   I very recently bought 'Mein Kampf' by Adolf Hitler, published by Wilco Classics. It was a leather bound edition for a very less price, for just Rs.275 (less than $6). I was impressed by the hard binding, quality of the paper and the print. Out of curiosity I then browsed for other books from Wilco. Fortunately, I found lot of other books, all leather bound/hard cover editions and at prices even lesser than the one I mentioned above.  But to my surprise, none of the books are rated/reviewed (in Amazon). This made me wonder whether these books from Wilco Classic Library are of people's interest or not.  What do you people think of them?? Are there any particular disadvantages if one collects Wilco Classic editions??   I see a number beside people's posts and comments in this NoFap section.. Can somebody tell what that represents?? In case it is the number of days the subscriber is away from fapping, is there any way that I can start the number from 60 plus, because i've been away masturbating since a couple of months.. To look at the number of days is kinda inspiring and encouraging to continue that way!!      	122
                                                             i saw an article the other day but i thought it was a hoax but today RebelScum.com has another article confirming the find from another reader. I'm still on the fence about the validity of these findings. Have cancelled figures complete w/ cardbacks ever made it the sales floor before? And they're selling them at 20$ a pop.     Following our earlier story, Brendan sent in detailed [images](http://www.rebelscum.com/2015/Found-In-The-Wild.jpg) of the Legacy Collection Droid Factory figures he found at retail. Looking at the date stamp on the card backs, these figures were produced on October 10th, 2012. They were found for $19.99 each at a Go! Calendars outlet in Pooler, GA, which is promising for everyone in the U.S. interested in finding these figures since it is a nationwide chain.   1st report: http://www.rebelscum.com/story/front/Hasbro_Canceled_Legacy_Collection_Droid_Factory_Figures_Found_At_Retail_164232.asp  2nd report: http://www.rebelscum.com/story/front/Hasbro_Legacy_Collection_Droid_Factory_Gallery_And_Additional_Information_164240.asp   thoughts? speculations?                                       :) but at the same time i realize Obama has committed the same heinous atrocities and travesties and is guilty of war crimes too and then I'm just sad all over again :(  ;_;                                                                                                                     A subreddit dedicated to [Digital Art](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2009/353/a/c/ac3c0310ef7845fcf0eef1cb8e82e06b.jpg) of Astronauts.

 It's just holy water to test if they are demons. Someone there watches too much Supernatural.   I'm almost 50 and I still try to grab a little feeding when I can. Which might explain why I keep getting called into HR.   Which was the bad part, the chicken or the cuffs? And which came first?   Yeah, the right is so obsessed with Obama he is in their mind on every single thing in the world. Ebola? Obama's fault. Some folks in a place where there is a lot of turmoil kill some people? Obama is to blame and congress must investigate like 15 times.  Bush and 9/11 and anthrax? "Why don't you leave bush alone? America is at war, you can't criticize our president during a tragedy! Benghazi!"   The GOP is an apocalyptic cult, so they will follow to be sure. They will gladly throw US troops into a war and take US dollars to give to Israel (so much for bootstraps/etc) because they think god will pat them on the head and give them some virgins or something in the next life.  Cons - don't trust them. They put religion and money ahead of country and family.   It has less of a zing, like budweiser in plastic vs bottles. But, damnit, I like to have a choice!   Another responsible gun owner....   They ate a pancakes family? Did they have blueberry eyes and strawberry noses?   LOL. Ole Dick played the "The liberal media is complaining about us because we are republicans".   Suck it up, dick. I will say I am happy that he is just doing playboy interviews now and not screwing up the country and shooting people.   So now I have to pee in glass bottles when I am there? I dunno, never liked the flavor of plastic compared to glass.   Were they around and active before we invaded Iraq to save the US from certain invasion from Iraq?  Was there even Al Qaeda in Iraq before that?  Ah...Iraq. The right waves flags and crosses and talks about how the Americans who died there as though they died or were injured to save us all....and yet the only thing they died for was bush's  and the right's personal desire for war.  Go America!   So what does it mean that Obama handily won, twice?  Oh - that they approved of his job and the ACA. Got it. Thanks :)   I'll bet the right isn't too happy about this. Whether it is blacks/gays serving their country or being allowed to marry they are convinced that America is failing because we don't have a military and marriages like they envision in their heads.  I am sure they are praying right now for god to whip up a hurricane to punish some people over this.   So gays won't be able to convert kids anymore in schools by promising them free ipods with Judy Garland songs?   He had some stormtroopers try to rob a bank for him but they ended up being the gang who couldn't shoot straight.   Is he related to Dirty Harry?   /r/gonewild  Hasn't affected me in any negative way.   Well, maybe she was just testing her thesis :)   Yep, I was right :) A conservative. Soooo easy to spot on here. You need a hug.   A river full of unicorns and rainbows? Oh...let me guess. You are a conservative aren't you :)   Why not look at your own link's title?  Or do you just like to make up things in hopes of getting attention?   Wait, what 'facts'? That Obama watch it all happen? That he ordered troops to stand down?  This has been investigated more than 9/11/2001 and the Anthrax mailings combined. And at every turn the RW BS has proven to be...wrong.   The press: "Hey, can your HR dept, which has nothing else to do, go grab this personal information from a file and hand it to us? What is taking you so long? Why won't you just give us what we want now?? It has nothing to do with politics. Drop what you are doing and pay attention to us."   Romney soon to be 0-2 against black men.   Hopefully Holyfield will only use 47% of his power when punching him.  But I can see the right spinning this now "Black man attacks Romney!" and then tying it to Ferguson protests.   From the report: "The Islamic Republic of Iran is an ongoing threat to US national interests because of its support to the Asad regime in Syria".  The 'terrorism' section is one page long and isn't broken down by country.  So not sure, overall, what the big deal is.   So - what do you want Obama to do? Ignore how the court ruled??  It's settled and the FR has been updated to reflect the facts - some I know cons don't like. Maybe you would like him to say "Hey, I am the king and don't care how the courts ruled on this issue! And let's not update things to reflect reality to please the right."  Ok..whatever floats your outrage boat.   It's not about feelings, it's about facts. The court ruled in bush's favor, that changed the nature of foia and this is simply an extension of that. By updating the FR they will probably not avoid headaches but will be ensuring the public has the facts as it relates to those regulations as the court has ruled. It's pretty simple and basic - unless you think Obama should act all king like and ignore the court ruling?   So you are against updating the federal register to reflect the reality from the bush court case? Ok....whatever.   I support them on this. The court battle started under bush played out that way and all the Obama Admin is doing is updating the Fed. Register to reflect reality.     Sure - as soon as republicans stop being mad about people needing help and maximizing their kitchen with food to survive.  Why is it no one on the right gets upset when companies use the law/resources to their advantage but call people lazy bums when they tap resources to survive?   That has to be a tough competition to judge. It's like having a barrel full of idiots swimming in ignorance and trying to decide which one to grab and declare as the best swimmer.  Gotta love republicans. Love spending money on 'defense' but when it comes to things that actually are harming our citizens - from climate to lack of health care, etc, they balk.   And he starts off with a Hitler reference.  Fear mongering, it's what the cons are good at. Scare people into spending more on defense, screw up diplomacy, hype terrorism and china/russia, and then start some wars.   We've had two Iraq wars and one in Afghanistan to make us safer - apparently they didn't do that because we are now less safe than ever. So, let's spend more money!  Reminds me of education. Every election pols tell us it is broken, elect them and they will fix. I am almost 50 and they say the same thing every time. Apparently they all suck because every election they tell us it is still broken.   There are some things I don't think Obama is criticized enough for this - this is one of them. Other things though can get downright silly :)   Things were better under Clinton, and Obama, than ever under Bush.  Of course some folks like em some wars and tax cuts to pay to for the wars (how tax cuts pay for them is beyond me, apparently if you cut a billion in taxes it makes a trillion using some voodoo magic)   Like I have said before, the right can't admit when it is wrong and it just makes up stuff to scare the weak minded.  Obama WILL take all your guns, he will crash the stock market, he will destroy america, open the borders, make it illegal for your kids to do chores (2012), he hates israel and will destroy (in 2008 people claimed he didn't even say the word 'Israel' in the debates), he ignored ebola and it killed us all....  They haven't been correct about anything. But they still keep making up stuff and never, ever, admit they were wrong about other things.   Can Rahm beat Jesus? If he does, look for a Mel Gibson film to cover the details. (ok, going back to my corner now)   The right was recently all bent about "White Students Not Allowed To Attend Black Lives Matter Event At Illinois High School, Sparks Controversy "  There can be stories every single day about any other race running into issues because of their race and the right just passes them right on by. They don't claim it is wrong, they don't care one wit. The second a white person runs into some bigotry (or a Christian vs a muslim/hindu/etc) the right suddenly 'cares'.  Then they claim "Look, some others do it as well! So why complain when whites do it? Huh? Go on, explain why my being racist is bad but when someone else does it no one pays attention? It happened once, just look at that high school!"  Yeah...no one takes the right serious on race matters anymore.    When you are dealing with the right, just ignore facts and go with 'belief'. "God controls the heavens and weather!"  The people most skeptical of climate change are the people who most believe in sky fairies.  Funny how that works.     Wait, what, really?  Hey, the people behind this (the ambassador) said a lot I agree on when it comes to Iran.   Look at the evidence. A biased person from a biased source has said something with no proof to back it up. Back it up.  Conservatives are just upset Obama beat them. Twice. So they make up things because everything they have said to date hasn't come to pass. All they have to go on now is hearsay.   Did Obama, for example, take people's guns away? Nope. But they said he WOULD. Not that he could. That he would. And the right believed that, without any facts, because....well, hell I don't even know why.  Every prediction from the right about Obama has been wrong, but people put them out there as fact because they want to believe.     This is how we should handle elections.   Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Obama is gonna take all your guns, make it illegal for kids to do chores, open the borders, make the US a caliphate, ignore ebola while it kills us all, crash the stock market, send gas to 10/gal, etc.  We get it. The right lives in a fantasy land.   Off topic - your comment reminds of that scene in "It's a wonderful life" where George Bailey averted a run and had two dollars left and put them in a basket and commented that he hoped they would be fruitful and multiply :)   When I take calls from my X about her new hubby and take her out for something to eat and to talk to comfort her.   Record heat in Southern CA.  Here is how republicans view the world: "I looked out my window, and it was snowing, so warming is a lie because out my window is he whole world. Git r done!"   The AG's job is to enforce the law, it's congress's job to change it.   And yes, I do remember that. And what has been the result? People getting pissed off and pushing harder for it to be legalized.   *Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.*   I think the point is - when haven't we handed them money? And I read both articles (the NYT one was better IMHO). We have become so used to the US just tossing around cash to everyone but the poor and needy here no one even blinks anymore unless they can make a political point out of it.     I think I confuse her in my old age with Loretta Lynn a lot.  Overall: Obama nominated her, she won't serve very long, and I don't see that her impact will be all that much given the scope of the job and the short term she will be serving. If congress approves her and Obama is for her than what I think of her isn't relevant at all to anyone.   I am pro MJ but short of some national legislation making it legal I don't see her views on it impacting much. It's not like cheech or chong were nominated. If her job is to uphold the law as it is written her views on it all won't matter a lot anyway - though she could divert resources.   What does one expect a person to say when applying for a job "I think your rules suck and I won't endorse them or enforce them"?   No, would rather they actually vote - it's kind of the job we pay them to do. Whether or not they confirm is up to them. They questioned her, have the information they need, now do your job.     Her merits aren't what the discussion is about - bringing her nomination to a vote is. They can do it, they just don't want to because they are pouting.   Still haven't found anything?  Here's a start: http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/US-releases-450-million-of-frozen-Iranian-funds-citing-compliance-to-nuclear-deal-349830  You know, honoring deals that were made, etc. You can dig more from there. But I am guessing if Obama didn't release those funds the right would call him a liar, king, etc.  Maybe you could find the actual deal. How it was made, who made it, signed it, etc - that is,  if the issue is something you are actually interested in instead of just an unintelligent attack.   *The administration that Biden is part of has instead been releasing $490 million a month to Iran.*  Now, why don't you go and fact check that, as I did some time ago, and see what comes up. Go on. I'll wait a minute.   That guy in the background with the hat on and gray shirt looks like Binny from supernatural (and is that lady wearing an orange hooter's shirt?).   http://31.media.tumblr.com/10e6a2ef0ba94a994884afcc25897cfe/tumblr_mwcda44wqk1qdcaeco2_500.gif  Anyway, open carry doesn't bug me. But since this is from dead bart I will check elsewhere to get the real facts.    I can be understanding here towards cops. They see it as tool to aid them in serving and protecting. I can't blame them for wanting to do their jobs better.  On the other side of the equation is concern about government employees having data that isn't relevant to any particular crime but could be misused many ways.   Now, given that there are trust issues between citizens and government I can sympathize with the citizens here more than I can with cops (who often have their own trust issues with citizens).  My solution? Set up a framework of standards. From how data is stored to it's retention period. Shorten the normal retention period but allow a longer one - one where after the short term the data is encrypted and requires, essentially, a 'key party' to access it and the signature of a judge.   After the longer period data is purged and it is certified that data was purged and any data that is used in a criminal case that happens to have not been purged (accident/willfully) will be tainted.  Lastly, make sure there are stiff penalties should these procedures not be followed. Both criminal and civil.   Actually, I have no problem with them at all. Or gun ownership. But thanks for playing :)   Just buy some damn ear muffs and you won't hear them. Sheesh, why does everything have to be so complicated?   Do a little digging. Note a few things, the original source for example. Also note the name of the ambassador and look at the group he belongs to (and what they say about Iran). What you will find is one quick blurb made on a radio show (Mark Levin), never substantiated, verified, looked into, anywhere.   So some guy, on a nutball radio show, claims secret meetings took place - and the guy making the claim is from PJ Media...Yeah. OK. I put stock in that....   Good thing he didn't have his hands in his pockets, they would have beaten him for having a concealed weapon, or shot him if they thought his thumb was cocked back and ready to go pew pew pew.   Not Obama - that has been debunked. But cons will believe anything if you say it about Obama.   He went for a walk over to Palin's back porch for a cup of tea. You 'betcha!   What whiners. The money would come from restitution funds. And turtle man is just trying to hold the nomination hostage (sort of like the iranians held Americans hostage back in the 70's...hmm, letters to Iran and holding up a bill on human trafficking. Alex jones should put the two together).  If you believe in a bill put it to a vote and quit playing games, and don't make excuses for holding up this AG nomination longer than any in the last 30 years.   This investigation has taken longer than than 9/11/2001 and been investigated more that it and Anthrax combined.  And all their fishing trip has done so far is make fools of conservatives who ran about making up all kinds of wild accusations.   Conservatives to scientists: "God controls the weather, it's why he sends hurricanes to punish people who are for gay marriage. All we have to do is pray and sweet baby jeebus will save us. Of course, if all you godless libs would read the good book, you would see climate issues are a sign from god and a punishment on you all. Git r done!"  And that, my friends, is the republican position on science.   That when they lift the veil they will see Hillary underneath it. And I would pay well to see their faces when that happens :)   Did you even read the article? What is it you 'believe' that folks will find? Want me to help you out? I can.   LOL...Oh, ok. So the State Dept is 'Challenging' Hillary on this?  Right. Really, does anyone take fox serious anymore when they write such headlines? Oh, don't answer that - we know the right won't look past the headline much.   *She said the department only started automatically archiving emails for other senior officials in February.* - note, "senior officials" - which isn't even defined by anyone. Google it. There are 9 of them.   Why didn't fox make note of that? I mean, it is basic fact checking.      No, they aren't. They are looking into a tax exempt group that may have violated conditions of funding. But fox knows the right won't think for themselves so they make up headlines.  Back in 2008 Obama was gonna take all the guns away according to the right. Has that happened or were they just making up shit like now? I'll let the facts answer that :)   Republicans will oppose this. The idea of not being able to control a woman and her personal choices upsets them deeply.  What they would like to see is the child born, hungry and homeless and in this case motherless so they can practice their own brand of Christianity and tell the kid he is a lazy bum, worthless, and no way they will support him/her getting foodstamps or a free lunch at school.  That is hard to do when someone is pregnant, so force them to have the kid so you can belittle them later. Oh, and discourage birth control, health care for the baby and pregnant woman (she should work harder if she wants care - what do you think we are, barbarians like in those other countries where people have single payer???)  But don't worry - the republicans are on the way to save the save day and force women to carry their babies to term. Git r done republicans.   Well, we changed it up a bit. On the gun thing:  We will announce that all gun owners can get a free bible and ammo when they bring their guns to a jesus station to be blessed by a rabbi. And for each gun they bring in to be cleaned, for free, they get a copy of the quran with Obama's face on the cover to burn (we will have a fire going with free smore's and such).  We will also be offering a free entry for each gun to a raffle. Grand prize is a 50 cal machine gun signed by reagan that was used to kill muslims after 9/11. Many won't be able to resist. And when they show up, Obama will personally take their guns (don't tell them, the place is already surrounded by isis folks to protect him).  Gonna be a hoot! See you there!   You give /politics too much credit. At my age I have spent a lot more time doing other things. Like working with conservative/republicans in the 80's/90's, being involved in a lot of religious groups (baptists/lutherans/pentecostals/etc) and a good amount of time studying eschatology and politics in general.  It is the right who insists we are a 'christian country' and that if we ally ourselves with Israel we will get god's blessing.   You don't have to believe me. That is fine. Spend just a few hours if you like examining the links between religion, israel, republicans, fundies, and the push for war and come to your own conclusions. I offer only my many years of personal experience as evidence because I really don't believe if I gave you a slew of links/info you would care anyway.   The republicans won't listen. They want with Iran and they want Iran to pursue a nuke so they can have their war. Their minds are on Israel and the Apocalypse. Their bible, like the quran for fundie muslims, is their guide. Not science, not diplomacy, not common sense.  You can't rationalize with a fundie because their minds are based on beliefs and nothing else. The right prays for jesus to come back and kill everyone who hasn't converted. They believe their meal ticket to paradise is Israel...because 'god'. They don't want 72 virgins, but they do want a wedding feast in heaven.  The most dangerous people in the world are fundies, and we have a government full of them.   So... did he listen to the people when they said they wanted Obama? Twice? If so I am sure he has been supportive of his presidency. Cause, you know, he's a voter-listener.     You can't order the Noblesse Oblige anymore - labor costs were too high so they took it off the menu and replaced it with grilled cheese since it has a better profit margin ;)   Every single time the min wage comes up people claim it will destroy america and cause businesses to close. We still have a glut of food joints and such places. A big mac costs more now than ever, and they are still selling.  Yet people don't seem to complain when investors want to cut costs and raise prices to get more of a return on their investment. Workers are investors (in time/labor) but when they ask for more return people get all upset.   As usual, a blog post with no intelligent thought which appeals to people who can't handle much more than that.  How about they take on things like this: Why Are GOP Hopefuls Speaking At An Event With An 'Ex-Terrorist' Who Allegedly Threw Jews Off Buildings?  http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/why-are-gop-hopefuls-speaking-event-ex-terrorist-who-allegedly-threw-jews-buildings   I heard they were doing that so they have more room for fema trailers when they start operation rushhannity and round up all the republicans and take their guns. Shortly after Obama will declare the US a caliphate and attack Israel to bring on the apocalypse. Hillary will be the camp's commandant.   Or something like that.   Mr Paul? Have a seat over there.   She didn't break the rules, all emails to others there are obviously recorded. SO: She could have used both state dept email and her own email for her personal emailing. Which would put us in the same boat now. Except some really want her personal emails.   Why, does he need a job or something? Maybe someone wants him to close down the US government and outsource it, seems to be his thing.    You mean by not screwing up the US and keeping our soldiers out of stupid wars? I'd rather have another clinton, the worst that could happen is sex and the best is no wars and booming economy.   Let me guess. Conservatives, fundies, republicans? Yep.  Well, I suppose when you believe god punishes America because of gay people the whole thing might make sense to you. Thankfully America is getting more diverse, less isis...errr fundie christian like, and more open minded.   You can't stop progress now anymore that you could in the 60's, but the same people are using the same arguments now.   Even the people she sent them to?   See also 1:23 in for more specific information and the actual quote around then and it's real context.  http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/webcast/cjs-subcommittee-hearing-fy16-budget-fbi-us-marshals-service-dea-atf   Not really. Go to the link. Check the link they give. Watch the actual hearing.  One area of interest is at 1:14. Section relevant to this article is around 50 min in.  Might give people a different view on it all.   Spend money to help the poor and needy? Nope. Spend it to investigate hillary and benghazi? Hell yeah!   If hillary wasn't running they wouldn't care one wit. If she decides not to I will laugh :)   I will add to that (but without the god part for now).  Here is what the right believes:  All humans can be wealthy They can all own businesses  Of course, if that were true there would be no one to actually work.  "Look at me! I own a bank...but there is no one to work here, do IT, cash checks, etc"  Or "I own this large freighter and can pilot it and maintain it myself, and load it!"  Basically, they live in a fantasy world where workers aren't needed and hence have no rights.  Somehow, someway, I think maybe they think god and his angels will just do the actual work because they don't actually believe anyone has to work for anyone else, ever, anywhere. And if they do it is just because they aren't smart enough to own their own company.    *On Monday, Republican state lawmakers proposed a constitutional amendment that would block California's publicly funded colleges and universities from banning the American flag*  Ah, smaller government. Of course republicans like the flag. What else would they wave during their wars and drape over the coffins of those they sent to die in them?  How many 'died for our freedom' in Iraq? Cause, last time I checked, Iraq wasn't a threat to our freedom.   Flags, crosses, bibles, and war. It is like the republicans are constantly trying to sell us a movie trailer.   Well, it all depends you see.  If the economy is bad, it's Obama's fault. If it is good - well congress makes the law. If spending is up and debt is up, well, Obama did that with his super magical presidential powers. If it is better, only congress can do that.  So the only thing that really matters is - do you hate the person in office or do you like them?   Well, fundies (conservatives), believe that gay marriage will cause god to send hurricanes and such.   Apparently god doesn't care about cheating, lying, killing, corruption, screwing the poor and sick, etc. That stuff is just fine and dandy. But gays? Whew boy - that will bring punishment.  Fundies are a big part of why I am now an atheist and a liberal leaning person (Independent, but I won't vote for another republican so long as I live).   Ahhh, conservatives. They were upset when interracial marriage was allowed but 'traditional marriage' survived. Now that gays can marry they want to tell state employees "If you don't like having to do your job we will help you, because we know how hard it is on you to sign some papers".  Yeah. Ok. Maybe someday they will grow up and join the rest of the 21st century.   Well. Election isn't for another, what, 20 months, and she hasn't even announced yet. So...not sure anyone cares :) Heck, does she even have a job right now??  If it comes down to clinton vs bush I will look at the last two in office with that name and compare. Which one did better?   Good. I wonder how many hours of her phone calls weren't taped and we will never hear? People get all goofy about email - but phone and private conversations they just shrug off.  Maybe this will trigger a new patriot act if bush wins - where we will require all email, phone, and personal face to face conversations be recorded so everyone can view them.  Finally, the republicans will be happy - but, of course, they will still be investigating benghazi no matter what.   A crappy pic, was expecting it be some congressman.   Or is a trollportation device?   This makes me want to go to church. Do they use holy rollers to paint with?   Is there a pic of the poopatrator?   Is it a contest when you pay to enter, or gambling? :)   So? By the rules she could have a private account for emails. She is under no obligation to share her personal emails anymore than anyone else is required to tape all their phone calls for anyone (or record their personal conversations).  The right is doing all it can to bury good economic news. Obama must have them scared, their hopes for america to fall under his presidency has failed. All they have left are emails and benghazi.....   Is there anything they don't blame Obama for? Oh yeah - the economy improving.   No, it's just more ranting from some guy whose first name is the last name of his favorite author.   Judge made the right choice.  "The judge said if you allow one type of display, then you will have to allow all types."   What a whiner. People are still upset Obama beat them twice and there isn't a day that goes by they don't find some reason to try to convince us all that he is evil and America will turn out like it did under bush (wars, death, recession, less freedoms, etc). They have ratcheted up the rhetoric now that there is more good economic news.   Man, that fox station did a poor job of reporting. The Beast refers to trains in Mexico and the protest is in mexico and about mexico. The government down there has gotten more involved in the last year with the issue of immigrants going through mexico and chasing them off trains/etc.   http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/central-american-migrants-and-la-bestia-route-dangers-and-government-responses     I think someone needs a hug and to watch some My Little Pony.   Ah, leave it to the daily caller. When it's white people involved they suddenly care about rights. Black folks in ferguson/etc? They basically call then whiners and denied racism ever played a factor in that city in anything. Beat protestors, don't allow them to stand still, etc? Go for it. But a school punishing kids for racism? Why...the horror!   Is that anything like summoning a demon?   Wait...what? He had a 'watch' where he was supposed to be doing...well, what exactly?   I love how the right gives Obama super powers. "He will ban all guns!" How? Can he do that? "Uh...no but he will!"  "Poll says race relations deteriorate, Obama to blame! Story up next on Fox."    Is the economy better now than 2008? Stocks up. Unemployment down. Profits up. If this were a republican president the right would have bands playing in the street and trumpets blaring all over the place.   But now they have a sad. They wanted to see America get worse. They made all kinds of terrible predictions about what would happen. All your guns would be taken. Stocks would crash. America would crumble and lose it's freedoms. Etc.  You would think people would be happy we aren't struggling like in 2001-2008, bogged down with 100,000+ troops in wars, economy tanking, etc.  Naw. Some just like to whine.   "Hey, I don't like gays so I don't want to do the job I was hired for. That's ok right?"  gop: "Sure thing!"   2012: When U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration resigned his position early this morning, he said in an emailed statement, differences with Washington regarding my leadership style and certain priorities lead me to believe that it's now time to leave."   LOL. The closest they get is a letting in 1984 by ten dems - and what was it the right was saying about it then?  * ''This letter,'' Mr. Gingrich wrote, ''clearly violates the constitutional separation of powers. It's at best unwise, and at worst illegal.'' Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who helped draft the letter to Mr. Ortega, calls Representative Gingrich's attack ''frankly ludicrous.'' *  So...I guess they feel the same now??   But...but, Obama is a socialist dictator king and he already banned all the guns, why would he stop now at his moment of glory? It is not like him at all. Fox news must investigate this and explain why their portrayal of him as a dictator was off a bit....   An old story from 2014 with no link to the actual law. Ok....   I remember a lot of things. 30 million spent to investigate lewinsky/clinton. 15 mil for 9/11/2001. Anthrax? Don't recall that terror being investigated by congress. What was the stated goal of the benghazi investigation (it WAS investigated and a report released - and it debunked the right wing bs)?  Now, let's go back to the 9/11 investigation. How do we know everything was released? We don't. You never can. By the rw logic that investigation should still be going on today (at least until we can get the results some want).     They don't want her Benghazi emails (what could they prove anyway??) what they want, and what gowdy is now going for, is ALL of her emails so that they (republicans) can view them and leak anything they can find not related to benghazi to try to embarrass her.  She turned them over and gowdy is now saying he doesn't believe the state dept turned over all of the benghazi ones and doesn't trust them to. So he wants them all to see for himself. So now he is accusing the state department of lying (which I am guessing would be a criminal act - but they aren't launching a criminal probe are they?)  Can any conservatives here tell us what they think they will find? That she caused it, let it happen, stand down orders, etc (all of which have been handled already)?  What they want is dirt ahead of 2016.  They have investigated benghazi more than 9/11/2001....why?   AM talk radio.   So basically - this was all a ruse to get *all* her emails to the "Bi-partisan" group so they can leak some for 2016. Very slick - looks like clinton made the right play in the long run :)   I can hear the conservatives now - just like on gay marriage "Now people can marry animals, their cousins, etc" they will be saying "Now people won't be allowed to do violence against cousins and their own kids! Where will government intrusion end??"   A fair question. If I had to guess I would say most who signed up were fellow citizens who needed it and don't let their personal politics make the decision for them.   Bush said he would be court painting the proceedings. With puppies he stole from war orphans.   I don't know if anybody did or not either. I wasn't reading everyone's emails. Can I get daily caller to write a story about me?   Well, from the right has told us - Obama is going to take all your guns, not allow kids to do farm chores, was born in kenya, crash the stock market, ebola would kill us all because of obama, he is a criminal, king, muslim, corrupt - so I am sure that they didn't think this would happen either. But...they have been wrong since 2008 on just about everything.   He is, apparently, a criminal. The right is stuck on this one - Obama's justice department is doing this - but the right swears anything Obama does is bad/criminal/etc. So they will find a way not to give him props on this and complain about it, while using it to smear dems in general.  Will be fun to watch :)   So, we have people like married couples that the right thinks she be headed by the male and the woman should stay at home - and now that may be the case....but instead of saying that the cons want to use the numbers to show how 'bad' things are. LOL.  "OH we can't give more aid to the poor, makes em lazy and then they won't go get a job!" and then later that day "There are no jobs cause of Obama". They keep trying to pass the buck instead of just admitting they hate the poor and needy and Obama as well and do anything they can to denigrate things and paint themselves as the solution.   Wait, wasn't SHE the head of the state dept? So she can make her own rules, that's what being the boss means. She worked hard to get where she was and thems the perks. Conservatives she be backing her here for doing her job like a boss.   Well, I don't like her myself :) But when people are more upset over this than things like bush, 9/11, Iraq war, etc and so on it amuses me a bit :)   So the head of the state department, who makes rules, didn't follow the rules a different head of state department had in place. Ok.   *After this story was first published, a State Department official acknowledged the 2005 policy but emphasized that it is limited to records containing such sensitive information.*  So it wasn't a blanket policy. Ok.   Prostitution roundup. Sounds like something Monsanto would make for STDs.   Hooves up. Don't shoot.   So, an illegal immigrant christian eh? I knew it! Thanks Obama. He just lets anyone from the country of Latin in here.   Damn that big government anyway! Those guard troops should be in Iraq fighting for our freedoms against....well, I dunno. Saddam or something. Anyway, they should be fighting in wars where all good soldiers belong, and in 2016 when we get a republican back in office we will get back on track in Iran and such and put those troops right where conservatives want them. In war.   Is it ISIS or Christianity - sometimes, it is easy to get them confused. They both hope and pray for those who don't believe to die (see Revelation, apocalypse, 2nd coming, etc), they both want their religion to influence laws, and they both spend a lot of time converting others and warning of god's punishments, oh - and both have started wars in the middle east.   Not sure why she should. Is she employed somewhere? Did she violate a law that someone can point to? Or do people just like to randomly ask questions and complain when people don't answer them?   So rehosted content from gateway pundit and you repost from a link that references the same.  LOL.   So, who is this Clinton person? Does she have a job right now or something? Is there some reason we care about things that happened in 2000 or so? If so, I have some 9/11 questions I would like us to look into, and that whole anthrax thing too.  I know I have heard her name somewhere before, but then I have heard ashcroft, cheney, bush, and a lot of other names from back then. Maybe I am missing something....   *"Moving people from welfare to work is what has made this program a success," Ryan said in a statement announcing the legislation.*  But, but, republicans keep telling us there are no jobs to get because of Obama. Hunh. Maybe they are just lying. As usual.   What did he say today he couldn't have said at home on the TV?     Ohhhh I get it! So what the right wants Obama to do is break the law, so they can whine again about something.  *President Obamas new deportation amnesty could grant Social Security numbers to as many as 4 million illegal immigrants, making many of them eligible for tax refunds under the Earned Income Tax Credit*  Sooo....it triggers a law already in place and the right is wanting Obama to just stop it or something? Hey, maybe that republican congress can do the job you pay them for and change the law instead of whining that the law is being followed.   Oh hey - instead of using an article from 2011 how about you post what they are saying NOW?  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/fcc-votes-net-neutrality-big-win   2011? Reaching there aren't you :)   I bet he believes bush called 9/11 a terror attack and that Obama didn't call Benghazi one. Bush called it a 'cowardly attack' that morning.  The guy obviously isn't too smart - which makes him a perfect candidate for the nomination.   *Heres the simple truth about our foreign policy. Our allies doubt us and our adversaries are all too willing to test us. No one should be surprised. No one should be surprised that dictators like Assad would cross the Presidents red line because he knows the President wont even defend the line that separates our nation from Mexico.*  Let's just get down to the brass tacks here. Under Obama we have deported more people and defended our border better than bush did. But let's not even bother with that.  What is Perry really trying to say here? That Assad sits around reading immigration reports from the US? Really? Is Perry that stupid? But OK, maybe Assad has nothing better to do.  So now we have Assad reading immigration reports and coming to the conclusion that Obama won't do anything about anything he does. Which is still silly.   BUT maybe, just maybe.....  Assad sees how the right tries to stop anything Obama wants to do by yelling "He didn't get our approval first!" and realizes that if he does anything Obama won't be able to act because republicans will get in the way because they care more about politics than the country.  If I were Assad I would act more on that than anything else - divide America because you know one party will stand in the way no matter what.        Sad, but true. It's all a shell game and the right and the left not in power in America just beat each other up while the true enemies walk off with it all.   Take a look at the difference between the two.   *Quantitative easing increases the money supply by flooding financial institutions with capital in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity.*  Note the difference in broad based tax cuts and targeted items like this. There is a fundamental difference between the two, take your time and examine them both if you need to.  One has a direct purpose and a 'plan' (if you will). The other does not.      Well, hell. Now conservatives will be against it.   I tried to get to it, but it was throttled.   Don't tell him that, he might bring in a rocks and drop them on the floor. Oh wait...didn't someone just do that with a snowball?   Not when the supply is coming from tax breaks. As we saw with the tax holiday and cut bush pushed.    So what you are saying is that trickle down doesn't work?   You mean like the gun owner who killed 9 people today in Missouri? Yeah, folks like that worry us all. But the gun owners will rush in and say 'we are not all like that!' and then turn around and say 'a muslim killed someone, they all are to blame'.  Funny how it changes when your own ox is gored.   Corporate Profits Are At An All-Time Record Peak And Expected To Grow in 2014 http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/11/30/there-are-far-fewer-bears-on-the-stock-market-today-than-at-the-peaks-in-2000-or-2007/  We aren't hemorrhaging jobs, wage growth is set by companies, debt is high but we can thank a trillion in spending on wars for part of that and debt isn't always bad.  It just chaps the right wing that the nation didn't collapse like they claimed it would/hoped in 2008.   Which party is trying to do that?  *ast month, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich became the first high-profile conservative to champion one of the most extreme environmental positions in recent memory: total elimination of the EPA.*  So, okay, the stock market is up under obama, and was down under bush - great, we agree on that.   Now, google 2008 obama will crash stock market. You will find such gems as:  Warning: Stocks Will Collapse by 50%  *Faber doesnt hesitate to put the blame squarely on President Obamas big-government policies and the Federal Reserves risky low-rate policies, which, he says, penalize the income earners, the savers who save, your parents  why should your parents be forced to speculate in stocks and in real estate and everything under the sun?  Billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett is rumored to be preparing for a crash as well. The Warren Buffett Indicator, also known as the Total Market Cap to GDP Ratio, is breaching sell-alert status and a collapse may happen at any moment. *  The right wing is a little butt hurt all the bad things they said would happen didn't. Jobs grew, the stock market soared, we didn't all die from ebola, people can still buy guns.  And here they are in 2015 still predicting doom and gloom like some cheap 900 line psychics.   You would think fox would be all over it slamming Obama. Hell, I might agree with them for once if they did.   Oh look - you just said we are in a recovery, though you claimed it is the worst one ever. I'd rather be in a bad recovery than a good recession/depression like under bush.  TIL learned that even though companies have more profit now than any time in history it was under the weight of restrictions that have kept them from growing, all put into place by Obama and which didn't exist at all under bush's superior plans (which saw...well, nothing good happen).   Has no one ever heard of skype? Why does someone need to come here and give a speech to congress? Can't he email it?  Maybe it's just grandstanding and politics.   Here, let me help out a bit on this:  Republicans: "Unemployment is high, because of Obama!"  Later that same day: "We won't extend UE benefits because there are plenty of jobs and people getting UE are just too lazy to get jobs"  So there are plenty of jobs according to them, but then there aren't....as usual, they make little sense.   More of that smaller government they are always talking about eh? I bet he proposed not helping kids who need food or medical care- but then, once kids are born the right aborts their care about them.   First: No conspiracy is being claimed by me about 9/11. But an attack of that magnitude certainly warrants more investigations into it than the 2012 one.  Second: The right is simply milking this to fuel their outrage. Republicans don't even have to have a stand on issues these days because they just rely on people buying into everything about Obama and scaring them into voting.  If you want to destroy faith in the system just look at bush. Stock market less than when he came into office, job loses, housing market, failed wars, etc - and NOW the right us upset and whining? Yeah. A tad selective don't you think?   No, I don't recall claiming that. What I am saying is people are making a mountain out of a mole hill because what some people said during an ongoing issue isn't what they desired to hear.  And now they want to punish someone for not running about yelling terrorism because it denied them the ability to use the deaths right away to denigrate an entire religion based on what some conservative faction of that religion's followers did.   Correction - they suspected. First off, just because some terrorist group claims something doesn't mean you believe them - they could be looking for street cred.   Second - even if it was the tape could be a trigger event or the reason a group claimed it did it (look at claims made the folks beheading people, they list causes).  So, play it safe until you can prove otherwise and don't give credit out willy nilly.  Oh, and that group that claimed it did it?  Members of Ansar al-Sharia have regularly taken part in protests in Tunisia against perceived blasphemy and have been suspected in involvement in a number of violent incidents.  So, they claimed they did it, they have a history of violent attacks due to blasphemy....   Yeah, and we don't have all the facts about 9/11 either - but the right sure pushed away those investigations in a hurry. And that whole anthrax thing? Repubs buried the chance for that investigation.  But hey, some groups looking for tax exempt status (including liberal ones) were looked at closely by the IRS before granting them that status and suddenly we have a crisis....   They will probably try to tie them to Benghazi somehow.   Also, from the article: *Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and Oversight Committee chairman, said the ongoing investigations undercut President Obamas assertion last year that there was no evidence of corruption in the IRSs targeting.  I have no idea how the president came to such a definitive conclusion without all the facts, he said.*  And ya know, I don't know how the right has come to the conclusions they have either about it all without all the facts, but there they are - republicans running around saying they know what happened. Weird. So maybe all those blabbering on about it should say "We don't really know anything because we don't have all the facts." instead of the gotcha headlines and such about Obama targeting them.   Armor piercing ammunition  18 U.S.C.,  921(a)(17)(B)       A projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or            A full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.   The term armor piercing ammunition does not include shotgun shot required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Attorney General finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device.   ----  The ATF isn't extending, it is interpreting based on existing law what fits into the law. Your link has a link in it to the PDF of the technical reasons laid out as to why they are suggesting the change and I am guessing they are required to allot time for the public to comment on it - so letting the comment period last '5 minutes' would have been a wrong move for them.  Further, in the PDF, you will note that they have been getting a lot more requests, since 2011, for exemptions to the rule - hence their desire to clarify the rule and make it more simple in it's application. Again - this is a proposal which is open for comment on their ideals.   This reminds me of when there was proposal about kids doing some work on farms and there was a proposal period open for discussion on restricting certain things. The right waited till the comment period was about up and then railed on it claiming Obama was going to forbid kids from helping out on the farm.   [Barack Obama proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores, John Thune said](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/john-thune/barack-obama-proposed-banning-farm-kids-doing-basi/)   Let me help you here: "sounds like it came from" and "because the facts aren't what they claim." go together in a sense. When someone wants to detract from the facts (because they aren't as bad/motivated for x reason) they use a headline to plant a suggestion.   In this case, in the article it is noted: "The proposal by the A.T.F. to reclassify the rifle ammunition started more than three years ago" and it is also noted: "This is an A.T.F. proposal being considered through its standard process, an official there said. "  The attempt by the right the last few days has been to associate Obama himself with this to prop up their failed propaganda in 2008 that Obama would ban all guns. So.....any chance they get they make sure "Obama" appears in the headline.  They also don't mention the 1986 law reagan signed and how this is somewhat of an extension of the definitions listed there to keep the law updated and relevant based on it's stated goals.  Overall - some poor journalism and a story being used by the right to whip up their base. I would have more respect if it was simply written as "Here is an ATF proposal, this is comment period, here is the history of it all, if you oppose it let them know"   LOL at your title. "PO's Administration" vs the actual title or saying 'The ATF' for example. It's cute - sounds like it came from a not too bright right wing source that has to manipulate emotions because the facts aren't what they claim.   And idiot conservatives actually believe that. Which is sad.   They use public paid for/subsidized infrastructure so they have to play by some rules. Do you remember the whole debacle re: fiber cabling and how we got screwed on that deal? Time for them to stop milking us and do what they are supposed to - provide internet. We lag behind other countries because companies can't be trusted. And again - we subsidize their efforts and it isn't irrational to apply some rules.   So they used the internet to complain?   It's reddit. It's politics.   How can this be? I thought Obama was a mulsim and was protecting terrorists? Something doesn't add up!!   A bush appointee, no shocker there ;)   Well, how do we know if they don't ask the questions? I mean - if he grew up with Islam as his religion do you think they would ask if his religion played a part? Maybe he grew up Christian, shouldn't they look at his bible and see what parts he highlighted?   So - some white, probably Christian, male killed someone and was found guilty. Wonder if conservatives will mention his race or religion?   Sounds like a true genius of science right there. Must be a conservative. And why wash it out? Just pray it away - I mean prayer is what the republicans want to replace the aca with anyway.   I would sit on them too - the republican bills usually read like: "We will allocate funds for highways to create jobs. Also, Obama has to admit he is responsible for Benghazi and food stamps are to be cut 75% to fund a tax break for banks"   So, the repubs, knowing he would veto, spent the time and energy anyway on this - yet failed, for years, to push through spending on bridges/roads/etc (at least a clean version of such).  Well, back to Benghazi hearings for them - might as well waste more time and money. It is what they seem to do best.   She can attack me anytime. We'll see if she can wield my hammer. Git r done! (yes, somewhat sarcastic there folks and satiric).   "Imported"? Did the admin buy them online?   BRB have to get my Rainbow Brite doll out of the closet.

I think what many don't understand is the complexity of the term 'disability' and how it plays out.    *To meet our definition of disability, you must not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically-determinable physical or mental impairment(s):*  Low earnings, however, don't necessarily establish that you're unable to work. The SSA will consider the circumstances under which work was performed. For example, where a disability applicant had worked as a substitute bus driver, the court found that he was doing SGA because his low earnings did not indicate that he was unable to work and his income was less than it could be because of the on-call nature of the job. The SSA can even consider volunteer activities and criminal activities as SGA if they represent substantial work for which someone would ordiniarily be paid (the agency will not consider hobbies or school attendance to be SGA).  Similarly, high earnings don't necessarily the claimant was doing SGA, if he or she was working under special conditions. Claimants can argue that their income would have been lower but for the fact that the claimant:  http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/sga.html --------------  People often picture disabled people are being unable to do much of anything, then see them cutting the grass and yell AHA! Cheater! You are doing work! Without understanding the legal definitions of disability. A mental illness is another example. Your meds can have terrible side effects that leave you in bed most of the day for days, then you are a little better and can do more - but you lack consistency to gain employment (again, people won't see you laying in bed sick in your house,but step outside to shovel your walk and they will think you can hold down a full time job).   With republicans in charge you can expect that money will be shifted to corporations that want it or weapons.   The problems with the fund have known about for last two decades and congress has been too lazy to fix it - the right will claim the problem is from lazy moochers/etc and not congress screwing around. And it will play with their base who don't understand what ssdi actually is (ever hear one say "I know someone on ssdi, he can work!"? They always fail to understand how the term disability is applied and you ability to do what you were doing, etc).  So yes - be worried, the vets will cry out and soften the blow because the right loves soldiers wounded in wars they lied them into, but they will use this time to try to force cut backs.   Well, the right is always whining about how they want the government to be run like a corporation. So guessing they support this fully.   So just like regular police who have similar choices. How many cops don't arrest people who have been drinking and driving? More than cops who arrest everyone who drinks and drive. Fox news, it isn't for the bright people of the world.   I think the "no weapons" part is aimed at them not finding things like camel pox/etc that they claimed were there. I don't see any weapons in the article that were a threat to the US. But hey, we can say we went to war over 400 rockets and some of them from the 80's had sarin - and it stills sound like shit.   Do you go fishing there? What kind of motor you use on your boat, a trolling motor?   From earlier:  North Carolina man charged in shooting death of three people  Police charged a North Carolina man with three counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of three people outside the University of North Carolina.  Carl Stephen Hicks, 46, is accused of killing two Chapel Hill, N.C. residents Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, and his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Rzan Mohammad Abu-Salha, a Raleigh, N.C. resident, the Chapel Hill Police Department said in a statement.  Both Barakat and Mohammad were students at the University of North Carolina. Mohammad Abu-Salha was studying at North Carolina State University.    Nice, about time - twitter folks were hammering on it :)   New website (registered last month), new twitter, FB - and a story written to sucker in conservatives by someone named lana whom the editor now claims has been hired to write for them.  Yeah....right. It has been all over right wing sites - mission accomplished.   Interesting, fox has it now as well, no mention of 'muslim' (*puts on shocked face*)  http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/11/north-carolina-man-charged-in-shooting-death-three-people/   [America, fuck yeah.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R5A0pg4oN8)    Sooo. The rw'ers believe there was some discrimination going on in this case by some dude with a gun because the perp was muslim but fight tooth and nail here in the US whenever someone says a crime was a hate crime ("Crimes are all hate crimes", "you only see hate involved in that killing because the victim was gay in a gay friendly store", etc). Suck it up buttercups.   The website was set up last month, same with twitter/fb account, they have now 'hired' the 'author' who wrote that. Yeah....I smell BS and they trolled the right and got lots of web traffic. They knew conservatives would just believe it. Well played webmaster.   Good. I know conservatives won't like it - they think you should just accept any action by someone in government and have no means to speak out if things go wrong. But people in the real world like the idea of the government having a place where people can inquire about issues they encounter with government agencies. Maybe if Bush gets elected he will please conservatives and insist that no complaints be communicated and you just take it.   Naw, I think the point is that if rw'ers here want to blame all of islam for what some who follow it do they should be consistent and see the mote/log in their own eye and blame all christians for what some christians here did. That they aren't is rather telling.   Weird, don't all military people hate libs because they are all cons?  *He enlisted in the US Marine Corps Reserve after graduating with a degree in political science and spent the summer between college and law school at boot camp.

 The man is a genius. He just plays stupid, so people like him more.  Everyone loves a fool.    Say that to their face. Let someone record it first...   Did someone really get paid to "find" this?     I wouldn't know.  I missed it, for a reason.    Fuck you.  Littering is never Ok.    Of course it matters.    My vote is on asshole trolls from outer space.    Not if they have a dash cam or someone else is a witness to you breaking for no reason.    Fuck you and everyone that cares for you. You're what's wrong with the roads.    Are you a cop? No, then fuck off out of the left lane.    Yes.  Rules of the road.    I am so happy right now.    Is it that horrible to live there?    I can't decide if this is a good thing, or a fucked up country.    I came here to say this, about.  +1   Are you passing someone? No? Then you shouldn't be in the left lane!    Don't be in the left lane in the first place then!    GET OUT OF THE LEFT LANE THEN!!  He's not the tailgating asshole, you're just an asshole!    I had two girls want to make that deal with me, after I asked them out.  All I heard was "you're to ugly and not rich enough yet, but if you look me up when you're rich..."   You ARE an asshat.  No justification.    Point is, this guy was a negligent ass.  No one should have to handle this due to a "mechanic" who knew about it!    You're a careless, thoughtless, asshole.  I wish bad things on you.  You said you knew and let it go. Fuck you. Fuck your family. And fuck you again.    I have but one up vote to give.    So, I was half right?    No, no you can't. Not only would the elections take forever to dry out, but it's the rest of the car that is really fucked.  Mold in the seats, mold in the doors, rust everywhere.  Water gets into places it was never meant to be and doesn't have a way out.  That's why insurance companies always total flooded cars.

She's really mad.    Fuck that guy.    Nice try, NSA.   I hate that he said that do much, I almost down voted you, for typing it.  What an ass.

What about the traffic jam that people cause by stopping in the road, as opposed to pulling off? Example, on a normal four lane street (two going each way), a person stopping in the street blocks off one lane and backs traffic up for miles (sometimes during rush hour).  Why don't people driver up another 100 yards to a parking lot or side street?   Kind of a sucker punch, but that guy deserved it!  DAMN, YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT!

 What advice would you give to someone to get started writing? What is a good way to start?  	1
 Alright, I knew this much, but thanks for replying!   You should go back, because it is as good as you remember, I promise you.    http://imgur.com/0avJi   Why does the download speed fluctuate in the pattern it does? I don't know much about the way internet magic works, but you can explain it in full science if it is easiest for you and I'll google the words I don't understand.  Edit: To be clear, that last line was a joke. I'm sure I'll understand however you explain it. Thanks for the replies so far!  Final Edit: Among the other good replies, 3brushie answered my question completely. I'd link to his comment, but not only do I not know how to do it the Reddit way, but it's also only about 10 inches down the page. Thanks askscience, I hope we can do this again sometime.   What are the chances that we in America won't get the Freedom edition?  It's announced in Europe and Asia, but we have no word of it coming to America. With only a few months to go before the release, it seems like the winners of the American Revolution won't get the game based on the American Revolution. What do you guys think?   Ocdscale and mmer, thanks, that is good to know. That does make a big difference in how I feel about it. I'll be turning that on as soon as I play next for sure   Again, ice armor and crystal skin are very different, but I see what you're saying. I've tried all of these combos, just can't find one that *really* works   I thought of that, and I tried the bubble, but the spear throwers' spears go over half way through the bubble before they are slowed, which made my head explode. Losing wave of force for the slightly useful bubble wasn't worth it. More signs point to elective mode   Same here, no worries   On that note, gold goes fast in the auction house. Good places to farm?   I use the ice armor ability that freezes enemies when they swing at me and slows them when they're near. Crystal skin is too precious to replace with that ice aoe, so elective mode it is?   Hahaha, actually it absorbs near 3000... If I didn't make this clear, I'm not new to gaming, but I am new to this game style. I'm not good at building characters based on armor stats :/    The "normal" mode as you call it   I thought that's what the first difficulty is called. Am I wrong?    Like I said, I don't have my pc near me otherwise I would. I have around 230 intelligence and 1500 health I believe. About 126 arcane power. I generally two shot the standard enemies of the beginning of act 3 with arcane orb, but when I run out of arcane power its impossible to kite because I cant move fast enough to dodge attacks   So I realize I'm probably pretty terrible at this game, but its very tough for me not to die as a wizard on act 3 in *normal* difficulty. I use ice armor, crystal skin, wave of force, spectral blade, and arcane orb.   First off, I don't like the idea of elective mode. I think you should play the game as it was originally intended to be played. Am I just going to have to get over that?   Second, any strategies for me as a noob for surviving? The spear throwers, demons who stick they're arms in the ground, and fireball spitting bat things kill me pretty fast, because I can't move away fast enough to not get hit. Any advice would be awesome!   Btw, I believe I'm level 24, (away from my pc right now) and I don't play often because I'm more of a console gamer. Help me get back into diablo!   Edit: Thanks so far for all the helpful tips. It looks like I need to go ahead and buy auction house items (something I was against) and use elective mode (something else I was against). Ill give these a try   I'm friends with a lot of my brother's friends on Facebook, and this is what I have to put up with for being polite. Sadly I don't know them so I can't tell them off for being stupid.      Haven't found/been able to create an item with life absorption yet, but I'll keep that in mind. And I haven't been using stun, but I suppose you're right. I'm just afraid it won't affect a large boss like the Skeleton King. I don't have a templar yet but I'll use him when I get him. Thanks for the advice so far. Sounds like I need to make a *little* bit more progress until I'm in the clear.   I've been playing as a monk, but never playing alone. Fighting everything is easy. Now that I'm trying to play a bit of the game solo, it's not as easy. I started a new character as a barbarian, and while it is easy, I'm still afraid I'm not doing it right. My only question is, how do I fight a boss where it's 1v1, when I have to get up close and hammer him? Do I just have to rely on healing potions? I'm about level 9 and getting close to fighting the skeleton king. Any advice would be great!   Alright, sounds good, and thanks again. I like speed fighters like ezio auditore or sora in final form, but the wizard's skill pool looks so diverse and exciting. I'm sure any class will cater to a different taste of mine though   Thanks everyone for the replies, especially fuzzybootz. I figured Diablo wouldn't have VOIP, but it sounds like his computer will be fine. He bought it about a month ago, but it's a low level g7. It has a quad core processor at 1.5 GHz, and his graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 6520g. My small amount of knowledge tells me he will be fine, but I've never actually ran a weak computer, as I've only owned the one I built specifically for being awesome.  Another question if you don't mind:  * On classes... I don't want to match my friends, and one is sure he will be a wizard. I like the monk if I can't play Wizard, but he looks like he can be boring. What do you guys *think* I should play as, since I know no one has played these specific classes yet?  (More background, I play a mace and shield wielding Nord and a dual-wielding Argonian assassin on my PS3, and I played a High Elf mage on PC and a healer for a month on WoW. So I pretty much like any class so far.)   Hey everyone, I'm new to r/Diablo, Diablo in general, and really Reddit in general, and I was hoping you of the community could give me some pointers. I would have been eight when Diablo 2 came out, so my parents never let me play it. Now that I can make my own adult choices, I'm picking up Diablo 3.  My questions:  * What quick info should I know about the lore of Diablo?  * What voice communication system do we use?  I like Skype, but I'd prefer an in game system if there is one, so my friend's internet/processor aren't affected.  * Does Diablo demand much on lowest settings?  My computer will run Crysis on max, so I'm not worried, but my buddy's laptop isn't very powerful. I just want to make sure if he has to use Skype, his processor won't be too bogged down even with Diablo at it's least. He is also afraid it won't run it. Our fingers are crossed.  * Will this game be worth it for me?  I know you are all Diablo fanatics, being that you're here, but I hate wasting money, having so little of it and all. I play Battlefield 3 religiously, Skyrim just slightly less, and I own every Pokemon game (that's just to brag, not to show my gaming style). Played WoW for a free month, liked it, but couldn't afford the subscription.  Thanks in advance for any good replies. I want to be ready in exactly 12 hours. haha  Edit: Formatting! Thanks fuzzybootz!   That probability assumes 100% of redditors view the material. The 90,000 difference would come from that smaller percentage of users who don't click every link.   This is legit miss. I just moved into an apartment two miles from this target, saw it one night and thought to do just this. If you really want proof I could probably get it for the op by tomorrow! Haha   I actually translated the card in full once back in the day. It's not gibberish. The letters repeat in a way that you can use the fact that you know mew's name to decipher it. Everyone try it!   Part of Jesus's message was revoking the false-preaching made by the Pharisees at that time. Man had created a right-and-wrong separate from what God initially told them. The religious leaders at the time (not much unlike Catholic priests today) were far from what God was about, and Jesus came to abolish that false-Church. When the description refers to "the differences between Jesus and false religion," it isn't saying Christianity (the Jesus part) is better than other religions, it is referring to Jesus calling out, so to speak, the Pharisees on their falsehoods. They put themselves in places of "God-appointed" power, which was false.   The definition of religion is what is becoming confused here. And when he says he loves the church, he is saying he loves the idea of what church is supposed to stand for, like unity through faith, or allowing anyone in (Jesus was around the "bad" people more than the "good"). Church in our time has again fallen into a man-made invention, interpreting the Bible in such a way that says we should be against gay rights, etc. Christianity is the following of Christ, but the Christianity he is calling religion is the term man gave to the religion they follow, which has fallen away from the path that leads towards Jesus.  tl;dr - Definitions are getting mixed up, and mixed together. Be careful of that.  IAmA Christian Scientist, but I'm no theologian. This is how I interpreted the video myself. I'm not claiming that I'm right, since I'm obviously quoting the Bible, a book most of you believe is nonsense. This is the logic that makes sense to me. If I said something that doesn't make sense please pick it apart. I'm new to reddit and I'm trying to find welcome here in /r/atheism even with the beliefs I hold.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4   And in that respect, I think we should realize that the devs do have a vision for the game, and, because they opened up a suggestions section on their website's forum, that they would probably love suggestions. And surely they can sort through the good and bad ones. Trust me, I've read almost every suggestion, and many are too much; they'll see it the same.   I may be the only one who feels this way, but this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvxS_bJ0yOU by Frederic Chopin is how I imagined the "Title Screen," with, say, an early sunrise, or sunset are shown as it pans across the islands. If you're talking menu, as in the music that pops up whenever you pull up the menu, it would have to be fast and noticeable like everyone is saying, because the menus probably won't spend too much time on screen.  	28

 That looks effing delicious.   When you think about the plasticity of a young child's brain, why would doctor's even risk it?

Something about ships/boats submerged in water is really creepy to me. Especially if they're upright.   Does it have anything to do with the surface area of the glue, as well?

Now don't get me wrong, Muselk is an amazing content creator and tf2 player, but does anyone else notice a huge spike in usage for Mad Milk Atomizer Scouts or Diamondback Spies? Normally when I see one of these I just let them do what they do, but when we have 9 of the same loadout on a team, it gets kinda mundane. His loadouts are for the most part relatively average, but people are taking them as being the undeniable best loadouts (Even though he says in his Soldier video that there is no best class) Has anyone else noticed the large amount of his sets in TF2 lately?      Feel free to yell (Voice)MEDIC! Because that's what I'm here for, to heal you in your darkest of times. If you're on full health, yell out to me anyway, an overheal is indispensable these days. (get it? Because a dispenser can't give you an overheal. I thought it was pretty funny.) If you're a Baby Face's Blaster Scout then I'll heal you in a couple of seconds, You're a pretty quick guy. If you picked up a health kit when I'm on low health then I'll give you a quick overheal and wait for it to come back, When I'm on fire and you're a Pyro, I don't hate you for not airblasting, you might not know how to do that, maybe you don't know it puts out a player, and I'm fine with that. But I swear to god if you wear a Lime Green or Pink loadout I will never heal you. Because Y'all look stupid.      Ahh, the age old question of 'Should I set people on fire or should I use a stick to hit people already on fire?'         Please don't be mean to each other, be mean to the weapons      So tomorrow I can buy things off the market again, I'm thinking of getting an Aces High unusual (not gonna say what because I don't want somebody to buy it just to be a dick). I heard it was broken, can anyone confirm or deny this?   Please, pick up money when one of these two situations arise, the first one is when I, as a Scout, have passed away, think of it as my dying wish. The second time would be when you kill a robot really really far away from the big group of players.      I know you're thinking 'But Scout, it's your job to pick up the money, and it helps you by giving you a huge health boost!'      While that may be true, I cannot get all of the money all of the time, and the health gain, while being extremely beneficial to me, isn't always too important to me, by the time I have picked up $20, I will already be at around 250 hp, it doesn't hurt to stand on money, In fact, it probably feels good seeing as you can brag about how rich you are since you can walk on money and it probably feels really soft.

So I was in a little plane in GTA Online and some guy in a huge jet comes up to me and tries to shoot me outta the sky.

 I'm a keen climber. Indoors, specifically - I like ropes and crash mats. You cannot undo millions of years evolution by not being afraid of falling. When you are clinging on by your fingertips, your heart is racing to pump blood in to your forearms and core muscles, but also in anticipation of a slip. Unbeknownst to your mind, your body is preparing for trauma. Your hands sweat, your breathing becomes short and sharp, and your calves seize up as you stretch for the next hold. It's exhilarating. When you reach the final hold - usually a jug, allowing you some comfort and the ability to grasp with both hands - you plant your feet flat against the wall, breathe a huge sigh of relief, lean back and let go. The rope is taut, and you abseil down to your partner.  My climbing partner, Mathew, got me in to climbing 3 years ago. I needed a hobby to throw myself into after my partner committed suicide. We try to climb at least twice a week, and every year we fly out to a different location around Europe to try out different climbing centres. There are some sensational places, but I've never been comfortable climbing outdoors. The wind and elements, the loose rocks, the protruding faces... they all make me nervous, which leads to me seizing up on the wall and retreating down a broken man.   Climbing is a social activity, and during a typical 3 hour session there is plenty of rest time to talk with your partner. Mathew is a fellow redditor, and oftentimes we talk about what we had seen recently on the website. Three weeks ago he mentioned an Askreddit thread that asked for posts detailing what odd event or occurrence defines your town or city, i.e. what is the strangest thing that has ever happened there.   "It has to be the spate of suicides," he declared, "wasn't there like 12 people who killed themselves over a few months?"   Now, it is important to establish the facts here. Our hometown is just that - a town. Not a city. Its population is about 50,000. The series of suicides that Mathew was struggling to recollect the exact numbers of began about 13 years ago. The Wikipedia entry states 'as of February 2007, there have been seventy-nine known deaths since January 2002... [and] of 25 people who killed themselves between January 2002 and February 2004, all but one died from hanging'. The victims were as young as 13 years old.   Mathew's suggestion was sound - 79 suicides over 5 years for such a small populace is very peculiar, and indeed it dominated the news at the time.   However, I knew something that Mathew did not know. That number was originally 80.   A boy named James Craddock, commonly known as Jimmy Craddock, was found hung in the woods near my house. This was 2004, when I was 15. The local kids started calling the area where he was found 'Craddock's Paddock'. The name didn't make much sense, but kids often never do. I remember the story as it was told at the time - that he was found by a dog-walker one morning, hung by a makeshift ropeswing. Jimmy was 13. I knew the woods well, having played in it since I was old enough to leave the street with friends. I knew the tree that Jimmy was hung from - a classic British oak tree. It was well-known, trademarked by the nostril-like bark at its base and its position on the edge of a small clearing. It had a thick trunk, and had no branches low enough for easy climbing. It was often seen as the main tree of the wood, based solely on its popularity as a hangout spot for youths. Jimmy was found on its lowest primary branch, that stretched out in to the clearing.   Stories often embellish themselves when they travel around adolescents, and talks of murder and the supernatural were thrown around like classic horror stories. I guess the woodland setting and childlike imagination make for interesting tales, particularly with a real-life victim to add realism.   What made Jimmy's story so different, though, was his removal from the record of suicides. I could not recall why it happened at the time, but my curiosity piqued enough for me to look in to it in a bit more detail. If the verdict was not suicide, then was there a murder case?   Unfortunately media coverage was stopped by the police 'in an attempt to prevent copy-cats', so as online news and archiving started taking off, the coverage ceased.   However, on the weekend just passed I was back in my hometown visiting my parents, and had a free morning and afternoon. I was in the town centre, which should have been busier. Numerous regeneration projects have so far failed to inspire a resurgence in the town's fortunes, and respectable shops have vacated and have been replaced by poundshops and betting premises. To my surprise though, the town's library was open. I had thought that the cuts to public services would have been the library's end, but my guess is that either the council or the local government is fronting the cost. I had only ever been in the library once in my life, and I wondered how much it had changed.   I entered, and the drab interior did not suit the impressive stonework of the building. I guess I should not have expected much. There was a bank of computers on one side, a kids' corner, a few aisles of wooden shelves, and a librarian who could have reasonably been working there for 40 years. What caught my eye, though, was a sign above the photocopier - 'Please note that newspaper archives are to be viewed for no longer than one hour at a time'.   "Which newspapers do you have archives of?" I asked the librarian.  "Oh, not many. There's The Gazette, The Recorder and the Echo, and maybe a few others," she replied, "Why? Is there something you're after?"  "Well," I responded, "I was on the front cover of one of the newspapers when I was in school. I was wondering if you may have it. I think it was in The Recorder."   The Recorder was a circular for the town itself and had no distribution in any other areas. If there was to be some small story about Jimmy Craddock, then it would surely be in there.   I felt guilty asking the librarian to fetch a few stacks of newspapers, but I convinced her of my mother's wish to have a scanned image of me winning the local maths challenge.   It did not take me long to find the story I was after.   *January 3-9 2004.*  *The town's recent trend of suicides continues with a boy, 13, found hung by a rope in Cariad wood.*  *The boy was found by local resident, Martyn Smith, who was walking his dog in the early hours of Saturday morning.*  *Upon finding the boy, Mr Smith called for help and received it from Linda Evans, whose back garden backs on to the wood. Mrs Evans of Somerset Lane was tending to her washing when she heard Mr Smith's cries.*  *When interviewed by The Recorder, Mrs Evans said "I just heard a man yelling for help, and well, instinct took over and I dropped my washing and went to the back fence. He said he had found a hanging body and needed to call the police. I ran inside and called the police straight away and they arrived shortly after."*  *"It's horrific" she added, "apparently the boy had cuts and bruises on him, too."*  *Following the interview, The Recorder sought a statement from the police at the scene of the crime. The police declined to comment, but at that moment there was a commotion as the forensics team seemed to have found a knife nearby.*  *The Recorder has requested a statement from the police to this regard.*   "Cuts and bruises"; "a knife". Yearning for more information, I searched the other newspapers, and found no stories. I picked up the next week's The Recorder.   *January 10-16 2004*  *The Recorder would like to apologise to the Craddock family for misrepresenting a story. Despite our best journalistic intentions, we appreciate the tone set by the article may have been misleading. We would like to go on record saying that without a statement from the police, no conclusions can be drawn about the death of their son, whom it can now be confirmed is identified as James Craddock, a pupil at the nearby St. Anne's High School. We would like to extend our condolences to the family.*   That was all that was written. In all of the newspapers, just a discovery of a cut and bruised body hanging by a tree in Cariad wood, a knife being nearby, a subsequent apology for the speculation.   I looked back at the stories I had heard when I was younger, about it being a murder. I remember going around the area with my friends thinking that we would find a murder weapon. It never crossed my mind that they may have found one already. But if it was a murder, why would the murderer choose to hang the body? Wouldn't there be fingerprints on the weapon? DNA evidence?   After scanning the newspaper entries, I sat down at one of the library computers. In the UK, we can publicly access most criminal court case records. I searched their database for the case and found nothing, so either the case was held in secret, which is used only in rare circumstances, or there simply was no criminal proceeding.   I felt lost. When you invest so much thought in to a case and cannot conclude it, you try to force ends to meet. Maybe he did commit suicide but there was not enough evidence to suggest he had? Maybe he was murdered but it was ruled as suicide then later removed from records? Frustrated, I left the library.   I had some more time spare before my evening's commitments. I decided to visit the wood.   The wood has changed a great deal in the past 10 years. What was a mud path before is now a cleared walkway; what was a felled log over a stream is now a wooden bridge; what was a wiry garden fence is now a brick wall. Still, the air felt familiar and I noticed a few old checkpoints. The wood felt smaller, but more open. It felt like a very large back garden rather than a deep forest. I imagined coming across Craddock's Paddock and it being a scene of cinematic excellence, but instead as I noticed it from a distance, still to the edge of a clearing, it seemed mundane. Its nostril-like base was smaller than I remember, and its old imperious position as the head tree of the wood seemed nonsensical.   Placing my hand against its bark, I anticipated a connection - a connection to the past, to my childhood self, to Jimmy Craddock and his fateful day when he ceased to be. Instead, I just felt a cold, rough bark. I'm not sure why I did, but I gripped on to the bark as best I could, testing the tension in my fingers. Before I realised it, my right foot was elevating itself up on to the tree's base. The branches were out of reach, so I pinched in to the bark, pointed my toes inwards like a pincer and suspended myself against the tree. With my limbs held solid, I extended my right arm up, pinched again, raised my right leg, stabbed it in to the tree, launched my left-hand side up the tree and pinched hard, stabbing my left foot higher. A few short bursts later, My left hand extended and wrapped around the primary branch. Leaning back, I stretched my right leg up to a secondary branch, hooked in and pulled myself up. I glanced at Jimmy's branch. I looked up, and suddenly the oak seemed like a giant. A slumbering, dormant giant with stories centuries old. I climbed further, the sweat protruding from my hands being absorbed by the bark. Sap collected on my clothes and twigs collected in my hair. For the first time in my life I was not afraid of falling. The free air gave my spirit the kick it needed, and without a rope I felt like nothing was holding me back.   I reached the highest accessible point of the tree - the top of its trunk as it spreads out in to weaker branches. I sat atop for a moment, looked over the woods and realised how small it all seemed from such a height. I felt relief like I've never felt, and a breeze that could lift all unhappiness from a person. As I rested, I padded my hands against the tree, feeling the physical and emotional connection with this long-standing stalwart of the forest. As I did so, I noticed something against the thickest of the treetop branches. An engraving.      JC     JAN 04  Suddenly everything fell in to place. It was all so obvious yet I had not seen it as a possibility. The knife, the ropeswing, the hanging. It all made sense. There was no suicide or murder. I thought initially Jimmy was going to have a happy ending, but I realised that Jimmy, after the greatest of achievements for a 13 year old, would have seen out his life hanging alone, slowly choking out, knowing that none of his friends or family would hear of his achievement.  	1
 "The United States and the United Nations, which has the lead for securing Bor airport in South Sudan, took steps to ensure fighting factions were aware these flights were a humanitarian mission," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.   merry christmas in advance.   Really crazy,you must have to watch.        "the ear"   What happened ,if somebody actually have that much big!! You know what I mean to say :)   The number of people opting to work part-time rose from 18,594,000 in November of last year to 18,876,000 in November of 2013, a gain of 282,000. If we add the drop in part-time for economic reasons to the gain in voluntary part-time, we get a drop in total part-time employment of 137,000.      I just want to..focus on the particular point.   "According to the S P index, the government shutdown had delivered a powerful blow to the U.S. economy. By their estimates, $24 billion has been flushed down the drain for a completely unnecessary political stunt," Warren wrote in the email. "$24 billion dollars. How many children could have been back in Head Start classes? How many seniors could have had a hot lunch through Meals on Wheels? How many scientists could have gotten their research funded? How many bridges could have been repaired and trains upgraded?"   Yes.   More message more spam.   Yes,never ever.   TIL that A football field is not flat -- it crests very gently in the middle to help rainwater run off. So the line calculated by the system has to appropriately follow the curve of the field.      Purely .   The United States provides a particularly grim example for the world. And because, in so many ways, America often leads the world, if others follow Americas example, it does not portend well for the future.   The companys contract to help modernize the New York City payroll system, using new technology like biometric readers, resulted in reports of kickbacks. Last year, the company paid the city $500 million to avoid a federal prosecution. The amount was believed to be the largest ever paid to settle accusations of government contract fraud. SAIC declined to comment.    I hoped wed be nearing some kind of deal at this point, rather than witnessing this upping of the ante from the forces that truly live on the fringes of the far right, but which, without any resistance, have now defined the Republican party.    If we are really rational, I cannot imagine why someone would dare to bear this kind of responsibility because any real default will have a huge impact not only on the U.S. and China, but on the global economy, said Professor Zhao Longkai, a dean at the Guanghua School of Management at Beijing University. Its hard for us to imagine anyone can be that crazy to push the limit to that level.   If Congress fails to approve a budget by the end of each fiscal year, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act would ensure that all operations remain running normally without any interruption of services by automatically triggering a continuing resolution (CR) or short-term, stop-gap spending device.  	21

 it's running a bit better but still pretty bad lag in some parts  they need to fix it so there is no lag runner games like these can't have stuttering/lag issues makes it unplayable    lag has always been a issue with the game but i ever had it as badly as i am now after the latest update  horrendously lagging like a son of a bitch causing me to die a lot (even losing a 250 combo just before the boss!!!)  i'm on android  galaxy S5   would be nice  i can say though top 999 needs a score of at least 2.5/3 million   friend requests pile up with no option to reject and no option to remove current friends  seems like something that should of been put into the game a long time ago    noticed that after i posted i checked my bulletproof and it needs 600 to get to the 5th star  complete waste of ISO   just noticed that the bronze medal is 50 ISO-8 (100-999th place)  you need to get over 2 million to get it though i got 1.7 million yesterday and made it 740th place by the morning i was down to about 1100-1200th place  quite hard for me to get more than 2 million with a 28 multiplier but at least the chance to win a lot is ISO is back   3.4 million for me in this event placed me in 14th place   it's a waste of ISO-8 IMO but if you have the money to burn it will be at the bottom of the screen if you don't have the necessary card for it  if i'm not mistaken it's like 200 ISO-8 to rank up a six star spider.. that much ISO-8 could buy you 16 discount premium portals   most games like this don't do it for the powerups especially when the vials have no other use (as of yet)  the game already makes you use premium currency to buy the portals which is the most important thing to upgrade your spiderman..  you have to use a lot of it if you're unlucky like me and never get the spider you need   that one actually sounds good but i don't think i've ever got a ben riley one  lost many combos the extra 4 seconds sounds pretty good   starting with 10x counter is pretty useless.. using a spider that gives +1 on near miss or +1 when you kill a enemy over the course of even a short run will give much more then the 10 from the beginning.   they shouldn't have a event portal as a prize if it isn't ready from the beginning of the event  often if you unlock it before it's ready you don't get it when it is   my favourite 2 are the +1 near miss and +1 for enemy kill (battle damaged and bulletproof spiders)  i find for me they are the only 2 that are worthwhile and can build a huge combo     got to the point where i bought the 80,000 vial upgrade only to realise if you want to upgrade it again you need to spend ISO-8  what is the point of vials if you can't upgrade the powerups all the way? literally that's all the vials can buy (except when you spend 500 when you want to waste a useless spiderman to add more xp to another)  why couldn't they of just made them even more expensive (like 160,000 vials then 250k or whatever..   i watched a few youtuve videos of the gameplay and it just look like a updated 2013  also the engine sounds are terrible and sound nothing like the real 2014 cars   didn't get my event portal after getting 20k in the event before it finished.. (event portal was available when i got 20k)  the game has been really glitchy lately   pretty sure that's what we're stuck with now..   i'm in the same boat i'll get a score good enough to stay within the bronze medal then leave it for the day   i think they should people you up against people of a similar level atm it's just the level 90's winning everything   always wondered why they don't give 1-3 clams when you level up in the game   they changed the rank required for silver medal it's now 10-99 (bronze is 100-9999) not only impossible for those with lower multipliers but a bit unfair on people who get high scores that get screwed over with a bronze medal  i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it      i wish it was only at the beginning for me i've lost at least 3 100 combos in the last few days and always before one of the bosses since it just doesn't recognise some of the near misses   is anyone else having issues with near misses? for me it doesn't register some of the near misses which has caused me to lose 100+ combos i'm even incredibly close to the objects when this happens  only happens a few times during the runs but it's incredibly frustrating to lose a combo because of it   think i know the part you're talking about it's got me a fair few times   whenever i die in this game it's always on the easiest part of the track.. like jumping to early or late or going for the near miss combo and just screwing it up  when the track is full of stuff dropping and enemies everywhere i never seem to screw it up only on the easy parts.   i hate the level up system.. either pay iso-8 or wait til you get the same card and then waste 2 similar cards to level up and you have to do that EACH TIME!!!!! obviously geared to get you to pay for iso-8  because of this there are people with level 90 spiders already (or they hack) and they just own the leader board because of the score multiplier.. you just can't compete with them if you have a 7 score multiplier    yer i got 3rd in the event and won him.. going to be a royal cunt to rank him up though   it will be the death of the game when a large majority of people who don't want to pay $100's of dollars to rank up spiderman stop playing   i hate the rank up system in the game and have been playing nothing but events lately because i've hit a road block needing a level 35 spiderman to continue..   even that sucks because there is a few people with level 90 spiderman that i have no chance to match their scores of 1-3 million with my level 30 spiderman with a much lower score multiplier   game is massively geared to get you to pay for iso-8 for instant rank up or to get the right premium spiderman to continue   it's the worst rank up system.. so clearly designed to get you to spend money on iso-8  would take months to save up enough of it to buy the premium cards and get them for ranking   they should have a event that's based on how far you get not the score   been playing them a lot recently as it's all i can do and probably the best way to make any currency  hard to get in the top 10.. people with scores of a million or more i'm lucky to get 250k before stupidly stuffing up on something easy   downloaded it the other day it was fun at first but when you get up to the missions that require a level 35 spiderman the game gets ridiculous  the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up  obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)  takes away from the fun of the game when you hit a roadblock like this      i hardly ever get battery drops so i have to wait the 4 hours for one zap and in that time he appears on more buildings  got like 3 in my town right now (one on a building i need) and just not getting any batteries  really don't want to spend clams getting them because they are a bit overpriced.  how often do you guys get battery drops?   not even close although i haven't been playing much recently.. i'm finding it more of a chore to unlock him then fun and it's only going to get worse when higher level characters are released.   they are a bunch of idiots   ferrari staying out   i think ricciardo will win this one just have a feeling hamiltons tyres won't last and he'll pit or ricciardo will get him with the fresh tyres..   i have a feeling Hamilton will have to pit again   those clouds look pretty evil i wonder if rain will hit before the end   i wonder if the conspiracy theorist hamilton fans will claim the spin was because of sabotage of the brakes they seem to think everything bad that happens to his car is sabotage   they are cold because he had to start from the pits   3 weeks really isn't that long between events, if you don't use clams you have to grind them out collecting whatever and to me the game is becoming more of a chore then fun  they should space big events out by at least 3 months and have smaller updates like the toy boxes or something similar to fill the gaps between   i hate when games put big events out so soon, events need to be spaced out so you don't get tired of the game and this one most likely will be similar to the last with collect x to get y or spend a zillion clams to get it now..  too many events so soon and you get burned out on the game (especially since many are probably still unlocking stewie or trying to get the toy boxes)   does it really surprise you? they are desperate for ratings with how shit the show has been over the last few years   i thought they said it was a iconic or great character that will bite the bullet.. rabbi krustovsky is not iconic or great and has only been in like 10 episodes i think..    there really isn't much premium content worth buying and most is horribly overpriced  i'm just glad they have been giving some out for free in recent prize boxes.   at first i liked the collect x item for skin etc but now it's getting ridiculous especially for what you have to collect to get stewie.  i realise some people would collect it quick then be waiting for the next item but anyone that can only play this game once or so a day etc would be put off in having to grind so much to unlock a character.     ever since the moon idol event i've been getting constant freezing.. the game doesn't crash it just freezes every 30 or so seconds for a few seconds then starts again  anyone had this happen (i'm using a S3 but it was fine before that first event)   now stewie is around the corner i regret wasting so much money on the prize boxes during both events.  i have a feeling it will be like when you unlock Tricia and you'll have to unlock the land around the funhouse first before even repairing it which could be 50k upwards.    whilst i am playing the game will freeze for a few seconds then go back to normal then it will do it again 20-30 seconds later.. it doesn't crash completely just freezes and starts again  only started happening during the event.. anyone else getting this?  i'm using a galaxy S3   yes they have stopped for me   anyone know a fix for this? game just constantly freezes for a few seconds then goes back to normal literally every minute or two only crashes a few times but it's annoying as hell.  only started happening during event (galaxy s3)    is anyone else having this issue? i'm on android and when i try to buy a box of coins the purchase confirmation screen shows tank of clams for $106  all the other options work fine just that one isn't right.  	54
 The voices told her it was okay to attack people because its all just for fun.   The only reason I like the Sith more than the Jedi is because of their ability to shoot force lightning out of their fingers. I wish I could do it.   She doesn't have a home. Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star. Thanks for bringing it up...She was finally getting over it.   Totally. Right on.   Zero fucks given   Sounds like my typical weekend.   Go to bed grandma.   Dang. You beat me to it.   IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the delicious category.   Serves him right.   I find this incredibly arousing.   Stupid   It's more funny if anything. The little girl in front row to the left looks funny.    Monopoly is over man. Ended on the 22nd.   No? It just looks like people spending time at the beach and someone snapped a picture of their friend laughing.    Legendary   This is amazing   I'm so sick of seeing this one. I've seen it 6 times on r/wtf      I feel as if I saw this last month      He's rather attractive.   When did we rename the Internet "the mall"?   Some men just want to watch their hair burn   do you get what kind of plant it is?   There are very few things I wouldn't do to this man. He gets me so aroused just by looking at him!   Thank you!   I caught that a few months back. I had a Disney day and watched Hercules after The Lion King and laughed my ass off. Fuck you Scar!!!   He's from the UK and represented Britain in the Olympics.   Video killed the radio star*   You're right. They discovered that its actually animal skin. Not human.   I like the altered one better   I would do more than that to him   This is the repost of reposts. I've seen this at least 5 times a week for the past two months.   It doesn't look like him though. I know who he is but that's not him.   It was just south of Arizona. They found him in a ditch shot in the head. They caught the one who took his truck and by that time they had loaded it with various weapons and tons of blow, transporting it.   Someone posted a picture of this guy walking around outside a couple days ago. Who is he?   Sleep? Not for me. Because spiders.   Agreed. My uncle was killed by cartel members when he was on a business trip.   Nicki looks so good.   It's definitely animal (obviously) but I can't tell what kind. It looks like a plant eater though looking at the teeth. But then again I can't for sure tell due to quality.   Unless there is strong, hard evidence to suggest it is in fact related to the Nazis, this is not what you think it is. I agree that it might be Masonic or depending on the age of the building, just might be coincidence if the building is older than the 1930s.   I see dinner   Anyone want to double stuff her? Anybody? No? Me either.   That looks like my ass. Maybe someone photoshopped some ass cheeks on this lady's tits.   I like the first comment. She thought she was all cool correcting the word.   This is so SHOCKING.     I can't stop laughing at the reactions of all the people behind them.   It looks like it's most likely the umbilical cord.   It's not a swastika.   Obviously not everyone knows it, for example this post.   It looks like a Pokmon.   I agree. It's a gap.   Thank you! Someone knows what that symbol really means and how the nazis perverted it. It's origins go way back and people don't know it means something completely different.      Is this from a movie? I feel it is and I've seen it.   This gif would do better in wtf      My pants just got shorter   Pretty sure I'd be arrested for public nudity because I'm not inside all day, like you. But let's just end this because I'm sick of seeing your name pop up on my inbox. Last time I'm replying to your stupidity.   DAT BREASTMILK   No. I slept. Like a normal person. Because I'm not up all night harassing people on reddit. I have a life.   You do too.   And again, I don't care.   You're so sweet.   Do you honestly think I care? Because I don't.   I would still shake the hand of whoever tricked me. He/She deserves a congratulations in my book.   I give you that, but bacon. That's all I need.   She still looks white. That's enough for the media to feed off of.   Uh, yes Houston, reading you loud and clear. It seems you don't quite understand sarcasm, over. One small joke for me, one big step over your head.      This is...FANTASTIC.   It looks like an outfit Sasha Baron Cohen wore in "Brno."   Reminds me of the sculptures from James and the Giant Peach that they made out of all the mashed peach.   I would be disappointed if I ran to get this mystical "free beer" and discovered it was just a clever way to get my attention to go inside. Then I'd just laugh and buy a beer anyway to commend them on their trickery.   This made me cringe.   It's shopped   It's true. Whenever pretty white girls do anything, America puts all the attention on it. Attractive white people are the news. Everyone else gets pushed aside.   It's not even funny. That person is dead and it's rude to make fun of dead people.  	79
 Looking for non-rooted stuff, GO Backup came up as an app that will save your contacts, messages and apps. Must have root to save app data, but if all you need is a way to easily save and re-install favorite apps it seems good enough. Lots of other options if you do a little searching.   Yeah, and it isn't even complete. I use Titanium Backup myself, and there are other options for restoring favorites.  But if you want to re-download favorite apps from the play store, try this...  Click the My Android Apps tab  Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click My Orders   Settings  There you'll find your most recent downloads/purchases. Keep in mind it shows all store stuff, so books, music, ect. will be there as well. And if you click the settings in there you can adjust your device list.    That's probably the best bet for most folks. Installing anything other than from a providers site or the play store can break your TOS. Even taking your phone in with the Unknown Sources box checked can break it.   Those are all neat launchers. Another one I really liked was Rocket Launcher, but mostly because it seemed to confuse most folks. :) SPB Shell was a *really* nice launcher for showing off my phone. The idle screen is unparalleled.   ...is that a llama up there?   Yeah, I'm digging the whole ICS experience myself atm. But I've been using Holo over the other ICS launchers. I was using Apex so I could put widgets in the dock, but they're just unsightly there. With Holo I can still put folders in the dock (which gets rid of my need for Folder Organizer) and I'm loving the app drawer. The favorites tab is my goto spot to launch apps from. The current favs atm for ICS seem to be Apex and Nova.   Yeah, I didn't really want to put up the market Chinese link, it's still in the xda thread if someone really wants it. It's still one I haven't tried yet, though. I'm a Holo fan atm.   There are a ton more, but most link to other sites, are other languages, or simply too shady for me to feel comfortable with pointing anyone to them. Personally, I mostly stick with the Play Store and Amazon for the free daily apps. I only made this list out of boredom one day, and haven't put much into updating it like the others.   Thanks, I've got more hours than I can count into these (mostly the launchers) but I'm going through the browsers now and hunting up more.   I try to keep the lists updated and as comprehensive as I can. Didn't see anything here, so I thought I'd share with the redditors.   [The Big List of Home Launchers](http://androidforums.com/android-applications/404459-big-list-home-launchers.html)   [The Big List of Web Browsers](http://androidforums.com/android-applications/411285-big-list-web-browsers.html)   [The Big List of Android Stores](http://androidforums.com/android-applications/457380-big-list-android-stores.html)   You're most likely going to need a task manager, like Tasker or NVC Task Launcher.   ....front page. This is an excellent example as to why I lost interest in Reddit.   [The original Cracked article.](http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-9-most-brilliant-pieces-comedy-hiding-youtube/)      Training Day is one of my favorites. But, damn, there are a *ton* of good cop movies.  edit: the more I think of it, the more great ones come to mind. L.A. Confidential is probably in my top 20 of all time movies. Fallen is rather cool, too.   Beat me to it. I've drilled for quite a few of them. And I've seen some churches hide cell towers in their steeples. Any way to disguse them, they're doing it. Folks want more and better coverage, but don't want to have to look at them.   Nope. I can see it, though. I'm pretty sure you're family was killed, and you're flashing back to the past all the time. I can't remember if the whole thing takes place in your house or not, but it's very dark, gothic, and weird.   I'm pretty sure that's not it.   Aargh, I know this game, hold on, I'll think of it...    That thing is actually like 6 feet tall. [Look here.](http://www.complex.com/video-games/2011/10/we-all-want-this-skyrim-statue) [And here.](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/09/06/this-skyrim-statue-could-be-coming-to-a-retailer-near-you.aspx)   Huh. Guess we're screwed.      So, you're putting quantity over quality. You're spending so much of your time and resources on making bigger and better looking games that you're surpassing your ability to do them correctly. But as long as people keep eating them up you can move on to the next project feeling justified, I guess.   I was working off the Chesapeake Bay and it was below 0 at night. I left my water sitting on my rig and when I saw it the next day, I wondered why it wasn't frozen. The moment I picked it up it froze solid in less than a second. Everyone left water bottles out that night. :)   Best Part: So many things. It's unreal how it changed my life.  Worst Part: The scary times. Serious accidents, illnesses, when I'm in a public place and I don't know where she is for a moment or two, etc. That feeling of dread is far worse than any I've ever felt for myself over the course of my life.   lol   Get someone who knows about such things to install a remote kill switch for the car, and give the remote to your brother. When he knows she shouldn't be driving, he just clicks, and they go nowhere.  Realistically, though, you could have just about anyone who knows about cars put in a regular hidden switch that keeps the car from running. When someone knows she shouldn't drive, they sneak out to the car and flip the switch. Bet it wouldn't cost ten bucks.   Um, sounds about right to me. What's your gripe?   No, but I have a few I use. Which one I use depends on what kind of comment I want to leave.   lol All vid games are like that. But I guess it's all about how you use them. I play here and there, maybe a couple times a week.   You mean it's finally dead? Woot!   Meh, no. If the ads look like Resident Evil to me, I'm pretty turned off. I'm sure it's "not the same game at all", but it's rare that a FPS game can grab me. Or worse yet, a third person view when you simply shift from target to target with an auto-aim. They all really get monotonous.  I'm pretty hooked on the MMORPGs. I've tried tons of them, paid and free (and there ARE a ton of them.) Dealing with people makes for a much richer experience to me. (For whatever reason, the biggest one, WoW, bores the hell out of me though.)   PC only here, too. But I enjoy TF2 quite a bit, still. My game of choice, though has been the same for 6 years, City of Heroes.   Sorry :( the best I can do now is toss you an upvote...   Accept friend request so I can send it.   Accept the friend request so I can send.   Accept friend request so I can send it.    and #3 :)    #2 :)   #1 :)   Looked like it could be. I clicked the pack instead of the single, saw it was still under ten bucks, so decided to go with it. Surely, thinks I, there must be a couple people who would like to try it out...   Got 3. First come, first serve...   Too many of you are bitching that it's light beer. A couple of my favorite American beers are light. You don't need heavy lager to get good taste. That's not the problem here. A beer fan drinking Natty Light is like a wine fan drinking Thunderbird. Cheap as hell? Sure. But it's not worth drinking that crap for the extra cases they're getting, not to mention the blow to their social statuses.   Amen.   ...can I have the coffee mug?   *cough*TheVeronicas*cough*   lol I think you win.   You can sort according most any criteria you wish. I have almost 300 in my instant watch queue, and this is a god-send. It doesn't just sort it in your browser, it sorts the queue itself, so when I start up Netflix on my Google TV, it's sorted by genre first, then in alphabetical order (my preference.)      I played it a lot back in the day on my Tandy 1000sx (dual disk drives woot!) but never won it. I'm trying to find a copy of it, but coming up with zilch. Anyone have any ideas?  edit: NM, it's freeware now with it's own site. I quit looking too quickly.   Also, steam has awesome holiday sales, not to mention weekly sales on random games. If you decide to go with steam (which I'm loving) make sure to only buy the games you absolutely must have now until you see them on sale.  I think I got over a thousand bucks worth of games this past xmas for less than 200 bucks. I can't remember buying anything less than 75% off, and still have more than 50 or 60 games I haven't even tried yet.   Capital One is probably the biggest credit card company. And if you can't get one there yet, get a secured card, by someone like Orchard Bank. Capital One will send you an invite soon if you balance that one well.  If you get a card, use it. Put 30 bucks a month or so on it, or just use it for gas, or something like that. Don't just start using it for shopping. You can quickly get pulled under, then the charges start.  And make sure you pay it off on time, every month. Finance charges are how they make their money, and they make a LOT of money. Those charges will be like throwing your money out the window while you drive down the road.  If you find out you don't have the self-control to use a card wisely, then cancel it quick, and stick with a secured one.   Just google around a bit for credit advice. You'll see the smart tips being repeated if you spend the time to really dive into it.  And JReitman is right. Don't use them if you don't have the cash to cover them.   Never played it. When Majora came out, we were too busy with other stuff to even turn on the TV. It was a few years before I got back into gaming.   For a while now he's been all about using his computer as a media center with all the other TVs hooked into it. He lives in a lake house on a lake in Kentucky (his retirement home.) And he's just out of the hospital from some sort of lung infection + pneumonia (on-going problem, had half a lung taken out years ago.) I'm trying to figure out something other than my old standby present, a Hickory Farms assortment pack. He loves them, but surely he'd like something new, and I'm at a loss for ideas really. Got any good suggestions?   Zelda's Ocarina game was great on 64, too. Plus I drove myself batty on Shadowman because I didn't see the ledge next to the gondola for at least a week. My friends and I played Perfect Dark all winter one year during lay-off.  And I think I agree with most of [this](http://ign64.ign.com/articles/081/081042p1.html"Loved me some Banjo Kazooie!") list.   I was just debating this myself a couple of weeks ago. I went with a written one. I've found that I'm much more likely to jot down a note than to open a program or app and type something in. When I was using Google Calender, I found myself having to put it off until it was convenient to do so, only to end up forgetting to do it. Plus, it's just quicker.   [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Damazontv field-keywords=seasame+street x=16 y=18) has a few on pay per view, and plenty more on dvd. [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiSearch?oq=seasame+street ac_posn=-1 v1=seasame+street search_submit=) has some, too. Free, though, I don't know.    Cool peanut butter use: The next time you have chili, take a slice of bread, coat the top with peanut butter, fold it in half, dip it in the chili, and be utterly amazed at how good such an odd combination of foods tastes.   Everything I've tried has resulted in low frame rates. :(   At first I figured that it'll be little more than a chat channel for whatever teams join, since I'm sure you won't be able to keep a window open with all members in it. It would be huge. Though I'm sure such a window will be available. Just not practical during gameplay.  But what would be awesome is if when you joined the league, it recommends you to join such and such team, attempting to balance the teams out, distributing healers and tanks and such.   I remember those. However, I never knew anyone who actually bought one.   So much for my paying attention to things while on a game break. So in i20 we can form leagues? Essentially 48 member teams? Has anyone seen how this is going to work?  	62
 Only in a liberal's world is regulation called freedom.   Don't worry.  Job applications have been sent to ISIS so they will cancel these plans.      The petulant boy king speaks...   The Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism. It was about control.  The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability.  It was about control.  Net Neutrality isn't about neutrality.  It's about control.   Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.  -Ronald Reagan     Those pesky facts are finally surfacing.  But, like Jay Carney said 9 months after our men fought for their lives all night long as no fingers were lifted in Washington,  "Benghazi was a long time ago."      100 inches of snow in Boston.  The most ice on the Great Lakes in recorded history.  Longest period without a hurricane hitting the US mainland in recorded history.  But: Up is down.  Down is up.

No, he'll just worry about people's speech.   You actually believed that?   Oh the ways the elite reddit intelligentsia ties itself into logic knots justifying the non-stop corruption and lies of the Democrat party.         Pai asks. "Can you think of any regulated utility like the electric company or water company that is as innovative as the Internet?"  The Internet is the strongest entrepreneurial force in the history of the world and the last bastion of pure freedom.  Leave it unregulated!

 "OP shares accurate information in the hopes that people will be persuaded by what they see."  "...okay?"  "And they're vegan."  "Everyone grab your pitchforks!"   People who use nature to justify their actions end up with a society that is red in tooth and claw.   When the options are kill fewer animals or kill more animals vegans choose to kill fewer animals. (And of course we should still do everything possible and practical to make the fewer number as low as possible).      Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice.   [Here is a link to the source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIpCNiq0ibE)   Just because I have chosen to provide some care for an animal doesn't mean I can cause any amount of harm to other animals to benefit the animal I have chosen to care for. An animal that is distant, who I won't see suffering, or who has less connection to me or someone I know is no less deserving of ethical consideration than the one that is right in front of me. An ethical person would weigh their interests similarly.   Thanks for citing the appropriate wikipedia article. I am doing all of this from my cell phone, so it is a bit tough to look things up. I have read the study you cited previously. I think you have failed to emphasize that none of the vegan cats were deficient in taurine, as well as to provide a reference for the proportion of cats on conventional food with low taurine levels. That said, the study does show that vegan cat owners could better protect their cats' health by choosing a vegan cat food with higher taurine.  I'm also not arguing that the cats will be the ones better off if they eat a vegan diet. Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice.   I am saying it is better to choose the option that causes less harm to animals than the option that causes more harm. This is probably one of the  least controversial ethical statements anyone could make.   It sounds like you are trying to describe a situation where more harm would be caused by letting the dog suffer and die than is caused to a snake to produce a single dose of antivenom. If that is the case I would say the less harmful option is the better one. If it were not the case I would still say the less harmful option is better.   I am not saying that every scenario is clear cut or that I always know which option is less harmful. However, I have yet to see anyone even attempt to make the case that the animals being raised and slaughtered for cat food are harmed less than a cat would be even if it was fed the worst possible diet.   [Here is the source for the 85% claim in the title](http://www.theghostsinourmachine.com/downloads/TheGhostsInOurMachine-ImpactReport.pdf)   I'm always hearing about how Americans are becoming increasingly overweight due to their diets being too high in fruits and vegetables.    /sarcasm   Also, why the hell would you claim that vegan diets kill cats 100% of the time due to zero taurine when you knew about a study on the amount of taurine in vegan cat food?   Are you saying that taurine levels in all cat foods are too low or do you think that vegan cat foods have less taurine than non-vegan cat foods? Could you link to one of these studies?   All vegan cat foods and most non-vegan cat foods are fortified with taurine. [Read about it on Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine).  We have the nutritional knowledge and mastery of chemistry necessary to overcome that challenge.   If it was the case that feeding a cat a vegan diet would cause it to suffer and die 100% of the time, that would still be more ethical than causing 10 other animals to suffer and die. What cats naturally do is irrelevant. The fact that the cat is right in front of you while the other animals will be out of sight is irrelevant. It is still more ethical to choose the option that causes less harm.    I'm just concerned with 9 animals lives.  Why aren't you more concerned for the lives of the animals that are killed to become non-vegan cat food? Far more than 9 animals would die to feed 9 cats a non-vegan diet for their entire lives. Shouldn't killing more animals be seen as worse than something that kills fewer animals (if any)?   I search YouTube for videos that portray farmed animals in a positive light, or sometimes I stumble across them on Facebook (Mercy For Animals posts a lot of good material), then I use imgur's [video to gif](http://imgur.com/vidgif) tool to turn them into gifs.   Subscribe to /r/vegan. People post enough pictures of awesome vegan foods that you will want to try yourself that you will find yourself with very few non-veg meals left.

Your boyfriend wouldn't just be like, "I'm sure there's a good reason for why you need a picture with a bag of frozen vegetables on your face. I'm happy to take it for you, dear"?   I like this answer much better than the actual answer, so I'm sticking with this one.   The Life You Can Save, and the other effective altruism work of yours that I have seen, seem to focus predominately on mitigating terrible cases of human suffering, which is undoubtedly an important cause. However, it seems quite likely that each of us can do much more with the same amount of resources to mitigate animal suffering. A good deal of your other work has addressed the issue of speciesism and the importance of animal rights in living an ethical life, but the work on effective altruism within the animal rights movement (for example the work done by [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)) seems to be more of an afterthought. Why have you chosen to focus much more specifically on humans in your recent work?   The way you worded it doesn't really describe his position, but let me Google the answer for you:  Q. You have been quoted as saying: "Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Sometimes it is not wrong at all." Is that quote accurate?   A. It is accurate, but can be misleading if read without an understanding of what I mean by the term person (which is discussed in Practical Ethics, from which that quotation is taken). I use the term "person" to refer to a being who is capable of anticipating the future, of having wants and desires for the future.  As I have said in answer to the previous question, I think that it is generally a greater wrong to kill such a being than it is to kill a being that has no sense of existing over time. Newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time. So killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.  That doesnt mean that it is not almost always a terrible thing to do.  It is, but that is because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents, and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to its parents.  Sometimes, perhaps because the baby has a serious disability, parents think it better that their newborn infant should die. Many doctors will accept their wishes, to the extent of not giving the baby life-supporting medical treatment.  That will often ensure that the baby dies.  My view is different from this, only to the extent that if a decision is taken, by the parents and doctors, that it is better that a baby should die, I believe it should be possible to carry out that decision, not only by withholding or withdrawing life-support  which can lead to the baby dying slowly from dehydration or from an infection - but also by taking active steps to end the babys life swiftly and humanely.

Of course the legislature should only pass laws if there is a good reason for them. That isn't what this amendment is going to ensure. It will instead provide a basis for large agricultural interests to legally challenge laws they don't like in court. You wouldn't only need to convince a majority of legislators and the governor to pass a law, you also need to prove it to a judge, and if he or she sides with you then another judge on appeal. At the same time laws that favor big ag without good public reason will go unchallenged, and those that only hurt smaller farms that cannot afford the legal costs will go unchallenged too. This is an amendment designed to enshrine big business interests in the state's constitution.   You should cut them on the bias.   I wasn't trying to suggest that those things were goals of people who have sex with animals.   Being natural is completely irrelevant. If humans had been having sex with animals for hundreds of thousands of years and it was more convenient for you to find an animal to have sex with than another human would it be okay then?  Meat isn't easy either. It takes time to cook, it comes with high risk of foodborne illness, most of the world considers it to be a luxury. [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) is a vegan option that is incredibly convenient (just add water). You can get nuts at any store, they keep well for long periods of time, and you can eat them right out of the container by the handful. Rice and beans are staples of the world's poor. There is no reason to eat meat other than the fact that you enjoy it despite the terrible harm caused to animals, which is the exact reasoning behind why people engage in the cruelty of having non-consensual sex with animals.   **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.

You do not need to eat meat to get enough protein. And just because something happens in nature does not make it ethical.

I just pulled the data for the word "starting", but the number of submissions is too low to see any trends there.

[Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/). PETA does not deserve your money, but animals should not be left to suffer because industry funded interests want to shut their opponents up entirely.   I ate a vegetable once, and I almost puked. I don't know how vegans can compare these things to real food.    Nothing - absolutely nothing - in that paragraph describes you as a vegan. Nor do you admit that you do in fact have issues with the consumption of all animal products, which to me would be a much more intellectually honest conversation.  When someone mentions that they're vegan reddit's response is, "how do you know someone is vegan? Don't worry they'll tell you." When someone doesn't mention that they're vegan you then try to call them out for not mentioning it.  It seems to me like some people just want to find a reason to get upset with vegans for simply existing.   [Here is my top submission thus far](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/324b6r/a_quick_guide_to_better_understanding_chicken/)   If society was to increasingly accept the arguments presented by the OP, then demand would drop.   [You might empathize with this video clip](https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1550462218570692 video_source=pages_finch_trailer)   The chickens that are in the world today are going to be slaughtered for food, but fewer will be bred to replace them as the demand drops. Huge global demand changes don't happen overnight.   Yes, I am a chicken. Just trying to share some info about my awesome brothers and sisters.   10 billion is the number of birds and mammals killed in the United States for food every year.   Roughly 60 billion is the number of birds and mammals killed worldwide for food every year.  Depending upon which marine animals you count, 110 billion could be a total for the number of individuals killed annually for food, but you can also find much higher numbers that count a broader range of marine animals.   The article is saying that donating money has a bigger impact than personally avoiding meat. Nobody is saying that then makes it okay to eat meat (except under the hypothetical scenario where eating some meat could lead one to save enough money that could then save the lives of far more animals.)   You're citing examples where the person is still doing more harm than good. A more appropriate example might be Batman committing a minor crime to stop the Joker from killing thousands of Gotham residents. Most of us would say the small negative that Batman is committing is justified given the much larger positive.   You could send them [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxRIh9R2YfY) as a response.   I'll post the gif to /r/gifs and /r/aww. I still need to look into the best subreddit for the ag-gag post. The best way to find them would just be to go to my post history though.    I think you did the right thing by including PETA's contributions to this post on /r/vegan, but when it comes to other subreddits I suspect that mentioning PETA's role will make your comment less effective toward the goal of helping animals. Ultimately what is best for the animals should prevail over giving credit where credit is due.   I have two posts about NC planned for tomorrow. I'm going to turn the cute opossum eating a grape video into a gif, and I also have a post planned about NC's new ag-gag proposal.  I'll schedule the posts to go up between 8-10AM North Carolina time. I will be fast asleep at this time, but if any of you North Carolinians (or anyone else) are on reddit, make a comment about the animal cruelty exemption for opossums in the comments of the gif post (I would recommend leaving out the bits about PETA's involvement though given how much reddit hates PETA).   [Here are the groups recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators for having the biggest impact per dollar donated](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)   It is good that you are reflecting on your mistakes. Every time I have screwed up when discussing veganism/animal rights has been a lesson for how not to discuss it in the future.    This article is from March 2014. It seems like some op-ed from a year ago had it right, but now they are ignoring the issue.   I'm sure they do sell it in my area; I just haven't looked yet. I don't make many trips to Whole Foods since I already have an excellent vegan selection at the supermarkets that are even closer to me (not to mention much cheaper).   The effectiveness in terms of numbers of lives saved per dollar by the top charities on Animal Charity Evaluators are about 10,000 times those of the top charities working for human causes.  Do humans experience 10,000 times as much joy as non-human animals? Do we suffer 10,000 times as intensely? Are our interests 10,000 times stronger? It is admittedly hard to estimate such things, but I don't think any reasonable estimate would be anywhere near 10,000 times.  For that reason I focus 100% of my giving to the charities recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators.   I have the same question that the sharks posed at the end. I can find a lot of fancy artisan vegan cheeses in my area, but how well does it compete with the cost of normal supermarket cheese?   Lol, you got me cracking up about [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxRIh9R2YfY) all over again.   Animals are individuals though.A species might gain a large boost in numbers if humans began factory farming them and consuming them as food, but cows, pigs, and chickens suffer in many of the same ways you would if you were thrust into similar conditions. They deserve respect as individuals, not merely consideration for what propagates a species.   I agree with /u/tbhx12345 that OKCupid is better. The choices are still slim, but at least I don't have to look through all 4,000 omnis in my area to find the 40 or so vegan profiles.   With 1132 submission karma you are ranked 85th.  With 879 submission karma /u/captainbawls is ranked 116th.   One of them is a full time redditor  FTFY   This is like saying, "I'm not a quadrilateral; I'm a trapezoid." Human describes your species, but you are also a member of kingdom animalia.   I wonder how many people have tried to message me, but sent a message to the wrong person.   Unlike some US states with ag-gag laws where you will get sued and/or thrown in jail for documenting animal abuse at a slaughterhouse.   The first letter is actually a lower case L.   What is an animal rights group that you think more people should donate to?   Just imagine how boring /u/The_Withheld_Name and /u/runnerdood's jobs must be! :P   I'm glad other people are looking at those. I was the one who asked the subreddit reports guy to start running the report for /r/vegan.   On a more serious note though, chickens are much more than just products. They are individuals who recognize one another and remember past actions. They experience joy from activities such as dust bathing or caring for their young, and suffer when confined on farms or slaughtered. These things have powerful implications about how we ought to treat them.   See this is the problem. How are we supposed to improve conditions for chickens when Canadians can't even read an article about the treatment of cocks without thinking about beating their meat?   Is /u/kittiesnewyears trying to break my monopoly on pig gif posts?   [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/) and [Compassion Over Killing](http://cok.net/) are two excellent groups that conduct undercover investigations like the one shown. Donations to these groups help to publicly expose the terrible cruelty happening inside farms, which does make a big difference in getting the laws needed to protect animals passed.   The owner is also an awesome animal rights activist. Definitely a business that I am happy supporting.   I monitor usage of the word "PETA" on reddit, and I keep hearing people mention "Peta Jensen". Is that vegan enough?   Check out /r/veganrecipes or /r/veganfoodporn if you would like to see examples of how delicious a meat-free diet can be!   I should start keeping a tally of how many of my posts find their way back to /r/vegan.    I don't want to have my real name associated with everything I do online though.  I remember you giving out your name in the comments of something I posted on /r/vegan about a week ago.   I think /u/sap91 just wants people to look at his penis.   Your body is only making vitamin D from a very narrow band of UV wavelengths. These same wavelengths also cause sunburn and DNA damage that lead to skin cancer. If you are getting vitamin D from the sun you are also putting yourself at higher risk of skin cancer. Getting dietary vitamin D and protecting yourself from the sun is a much safer option.   Sun is better for developing skin cancer.   Unfortunately, products marketed as free range are not the idyllic conditions that people picture them to be. [Here is a picture of a "free range" egg laying facility](http://i.imgur.com/8Tv6y7O.jpg).   I found your OKC profile. 95% match, not bad.   Unfortunately, chickens are not just egg laying machines, and many municipalities have begun having problems with people who buy chickens thinking they are getting a lifetime supply of eggs, but a couple years down the road when the chickens start laying far fewer eggs, these people won't slaughter the chickens, so they just end up getting abandoned. No commercial farm is keeping spent hens for life either, but they inevitably end up getting sent to slaughter. At the same time, if you are buying chickens from a hatchery you are inevitably supporting the killing of many male chicks who are of no use for egg laying purposes.   If keeping chickens is something you are able to do, look into adopting spent hens as there is a serious need for people to rescue these animals. They are loving companions who deserve and will appreciate your affection, but don't expect to be getting a large number of free eggs out of it.   The Certified Humane label means very little. It prohibits battery cages, but all three of the facilities pictured would likely meet certified humane standards.   Another one of the Humane labelling standards, American Humane Certified, even allows battery cages to still be used as long as they are "enriched colony cages".   The cage free picture is from [this Sierra Club article](http://www.sierraclub.org/chicago/sierra/2015-2-march-april/feature/local-roots-vs-industrial-agriculture#8) (for everyone who thinks the EU is better, the picture is from a Belgian farm).

You are stating that people put their own preferences ahead of behaving ethically. This isn't news. It also doesn't change the answers to how we ought to behave.   I heard two PETA workers were once caught going house to house, killing people's plants and tossing their bodies into a dumpster. People ask them to help thinking that they are good gardeners, but can you believe that PETA kills 96% of the plants they garden?!   Are you planning on swallowing it? I remember /u/Zhaey pointed out that there is a lot of debate over whether vegans are allowed to swallow.   You aren't really vegancirclejerking if you don't do it for ethical reasons. There is no health reason to circlejerk about leather and wool or to cut your food on the bias.   Way to fairly portray his position. I'm sure he wrote, "we should kill babies because they are disabled. No more to that one, that's enough philosophy for today!"   That's true, direct action is much broader than just illegal actions, and there certainly are instances where taking actions to directly help animals is the right thing to do.   I take action and [I have evidence that my techniques work](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2xk3fk/february_was_an_effective_month_of_activism_for/).   Hostage taking? We don't want a feral child incident. (This is a reference to the movie [Bold Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JToC6l9Xx_c). For those who haven't seen it the film depicts an ALF cell that plans a nationwide string of actions to free animals. At one point in the film the protagonist meets up with an old friend who he had lost touch with, and finds out she had been keeping a factory farmer in her basement, treating him like he treated his animals, and calling him the "Feral Child" while posting videos of it online.)  While I highly recommend the movie Bold Native, I don't think direct action is an effective strategy for achieving the goals we want. In the film the protagonist, Charlie, says, "people will ask themselves 'why are people willing to risk so much to save animals?'" when describing the outcome he hoped to see from his actions. What we really see when these actions take place is people acting like we are the terrorists and simply giving the justification that animal rights activists are crazy as the reason why we fight so hard for the cause.  We need to make the case to people that animal rights matter so that they choose to respect animal rights on their own. Making threats or taking actions against people is not the way to accomplish this. Outreach like what /u/VeganMinecraft is doing, or what groups like Mercy for Animals, Vegan Outreach, and the Humane League regularly participate in is the most effective way to achieve this.   According to [this post from /r/dataisbeautiful](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2fd1gf/protein_sources_by_calories_value_and_portion/) the two cheapest sources of protein by a substantial margin are both vegan.   Cows are individuals, not a species. The individuals do not benefit by being farmed any more than you would be better off if super intelligent aliens packed you in a tiny cell, fattened you up, harvested a bit of your DNA to breed more humans, and slaughtered you.   If a person existed where the "good" (increase in happiness) that came from them eating a burger exceeded the "bad" (cow suffering and death) then it would be an ethical decision for them to continue eating burgers. Such people don't actually exist, but if they did then the conclusion follows.   I'm not sure how you see that as a flaw with utilitarianism.    favorite words: foods, moral  Jeez, this guy sounds like some sort of preachy vegan...   It is edible, but I much prefer Just Mayo and Veganaise.   [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/) is an excellent group that has some international presence; although their work is mainly in North America. If you are looking for a truly international group then I think the best option is [Animal Equality International](http://www.animalequality.net/).   I do also have Google alerts set up to publish to an RSS feed, which is where I find maybe 30% of my content.   There is no one simple way. This particular post I came across because I was trying to track down some other research I had seen previously to respond to someone's comment and I just happened to look into what new research was coming up.   [The data from the Physicians Health Study I and Women's Health Study shows that increased egg consumption correlates with higher risk of diabetes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628696/)  CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that high levels of egg consumption (daily) are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women.   Those statements are true, but entirely irrelevant when it comes to the answering the question of whether or not consumer choices can influence supply.   There are countless examples where demand has declined as consumer preferences have shifted. Nowhere near as many VCRs are being produced today as were produced two decades ago.   Obviously one consumer or just the United States isn't going to eliminate all global demand for animal products, but if all Americans gave up meat it would make a world of difference for roughly 10 billion mammals and birds per year that Americans would have otherwise consumed.   Obviously the animal that has already been slaughtered and whose flesh is being sold at the store will not be the animal who is saved. However, as demand declines, fewer animals will be bred and raised in captivity to meet the lower demand. The animals who are not being born into these atrocious factory farm conditions down the road are the ones being saved by your choice to abstain from meat.

Insects do possess nervous systems, and most vegans feel there is sufficient reason to suspect insects can suffer to warrant not consuming them.   The taste is not bad.

I follow the posts of the [National Dairy Council](http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/Pages/Home.aspx) and read articles from just about every dairy industry magazine that publishes their material online. Not only do we follow the dairy industry's own publications, but there are vegans who [are former large scale dairy farmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lyman).    I don't just watch undercover investigations posted by animal rights groups. I watch [videos from dairy farmers of their own operations, like this video of farmers "reuniting" their cows with their calves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vSIlTNED-Q). I no longer just see a few happy cows though. I see several panicked mothers who are seeing their children again as well as many more who are still frantically searching for their lost sons. Mothers who may never fully recover from the trauma of losing their children. I read [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zwd7f/what_goes_on_in_the_mind_of_a_cow/cpn3ixe) recently from someone else who, like yourself, grew up on a dairy farm, and described the efforts the mothers go through to protect their children. I see the hopeless sons crying for their mothers, but who will most likely face a short life before being slaughtered for veal. I see the slaughter the cows themselves will inevitably face as they age.  We don't make the decision to change our lifestyles lightly, but only after thoroughly researching and understanding both sides of the issue. When you have put half the effort into understanding our position that we have put into understanding yours, then we will be happy to welcome you for an AMA.   I'm not surprised. They are well connected to a lot of other vegans.   Several more states have passed ag-gag laws.    I often hear people dismiss the footage shown in undercover investigations as being simply isolated incidents. They claim the actions are the work of a handful of bad employees and not representative of the industry as a whole. Based on your experience, how prevalent would you say the mistreatment of animals is within the meat industry?   Supplements or fortified foods can be appropriate sources for B12 as a vegan, and you probably eat fortified foods all the time. You have iodized salt, breakfast cereal, and enriched flour. We are far better off than we would otherwise be because we consume fortified foods.   [Link for those who are interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4DJh-L7Ys)   Congrats on your poops bro.   Very few people are vegan because they object to the taste/texture of meat. On the contrary most of us enjoyed meat, but found that we couldn't justify consuming it because of the harm caused to animals, the environment, or personal health. Having things that taste like meat without these negative consequences are a win-win!   I don't have any urgent desire to post audio or video; although I might consider using it if there were more people on the site. It just throws me off to have the links that don't do anything.   Also, what is the point of private photos. Why would people upload a photo at all if nobody can see it?   I went through the trouble of setting up a profile, so I expect you guys to join and message me!   When I'm writing my profile can I do any formatting? Am I able to use asterisks, HTML, or CSS to **bold** text? Is there any way to add hyperlinks to my profile?  EDIT:  I also see that there are tabs for pictures, audio, and video on each profile, but I can't find anywhere to upload audio or video, nor does it seem to be possible to have more than one picture uploaded.   You get the best view of the underside of *his* belly between 2:21 and 2:25 into the video. There are no udders visible there.   Well when it does we will make sure to keep in mind that /u/NOBODYFUCKSWIFJESUS was the one that started it.   I very nearly decided to use "cow" in the title. I knew it wasn't correct, but I didn't care about conveying the gender of the individual featured in the video, and unfortunately there is no accepted singular form of the word "cattle". It really doesn't matter if the video is about a castrated or uncastrated (insert singular of cattle here) either.   Your post got downvoted by many other people than just vegans, but I wouldn't blame vegans for downvoting it too, as most people don't like baseless accusations directed at them. Try going to a thread discussing the keystone XL pipeline and accusing /r/environment of vote brigading without good evidence to back it up. You will get downvoted by members of /r/environment and nonmembers whose opinions you just dismissed as nothing more than part of a vote brigade! That is exactly how you came off in the comment you linked to, which was directed at someone that wasn't vegan.   I believe it is a health hazard, and also would probably have a very unpleasant taste as we have evolved to avoid animals who have died under such circumstances for food safety reasons. We similarly have an aversion to the sight and particularly smell of sick, dying, or dead animals.   I have been watching this thread closely too. There isn't some huge vegan force taking vegans to the top and downvoting meat based comments. There are plenty of comments with views on both sides that have been upvoted and downvoted, and while I'm sure there are plenty of redditors with some bias, for the most part the comments that have succeeded have been due to their merits and speaking to a wide audience. The views I have seen expressed in this thread seem to fall within the normal spectrum of views expressed on animal rights across reddit.  I know that /r/vegan made that stickied post in large part because there are inevitably a handful people like yourself who accuse vegans and specifically /r/vegan of vote brigading whenever comments supporting animal rights get upvoted. If you read the top comment from that /r/vegan post it is about how vegans need to hold themselves to a higher standard than the rest of the community in order to be accepted. /r/vegan wanted to make abundantly clear that it did not support any such actions and protect itself from potential backlash from the community or site admins. I know a lot of the members from /r/vegan and none of them support vote brigading, nor have I seen any pattern of problem vote brigading from /r/vegan in the past (any more than any other subreddit).   No, of course I don't mind people looking at my post history. I wouldn't post things if I didn't want people to see them. I hope you have a similarly enjoyable veganniversary!   That's a bit of an unfair assessment of my submissions. I submit [robots dancing](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2zpply/robot_dance_party/) and [pictures I have taken at the beach](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2z8bin/i_did_some_digging_at_the_beach_this_weekend_the/). I submit [recipes](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2v6xuq/pasta_with_snap_peas_garlic_lemon_zest_and_black/) and [quotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/2zl7to/it_is_difficult_to_get_a_man_to_understand/). I also run a Scavenger Hunt every summer at /r/summerscavengerhunt (everyone should join, it is a lot of fun).  I am glad that many people who see the gifs of pigs and other animals that I submit are led to reconsider the ways in which they treat other animals as a result of seeing the gif; however, anyone who thinks it is possible to submit content and count solely on the voting power of vegans to buoy it is delusional. /u/macaroni_monster's comment has about 200 karma because it spoke to vegans and non-vegans alike. My submission is approaching 4500 karma because it is a submission that everyone appreciates (well, 96% of people according to the current votes). People who act crass and careless to the treatment of other animals are downvoted because they are out of touch with the way the majority of people feel about how we ought to treat other animals.    I have nothing in common with pigs.  You have plenty of things in common with pigs. You share 4 billion years of ancestors, you have a similar brain structure, digestive structure, circulatory system, etc. That said, why does an individual need to be similar to you in order to be deserving of ethical consideration? If there were aliens who were fully aware, possessed strong emotions and interests, and suffered when mistreated, would it be okay to mistreat them simply because they were not similar to you?   Even by the intelligence metric there are plenty of other animals that are smarter than many humans (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). We rightly insist that these humans still get treated far better than we currently treat other animals. Why don't we insist upon at least a similar level of treatment for non-human animals?   I'm a vegan teetotaler for non-religious reasons too!   True, but they have been pretty substantially diluted by that point.   Working to earn a large salary so that we can donate a substantial portion of it is an arguably more effective thing each of us can be doing. [Here is a piece by Animal Charity Evaluators that discusses this strategy](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/resources/career-advice/).   We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.  -Elie Wiesel   There's more to determining what we ought to do than simply pointing to things that we enjoy or things that are convenient. You have to take into account the impact your actions have on others as well.   I believe news stories when the things they are saying matches what can be found in the original research the news stories are based off of. I'm entirely willing to change my views on the subject if there was good evidence to justify changing my views.    If plants did have feelings, far fewer plants would need to be killed if we ate them directly than if we fed plants to animals then subsequently ate those animals, so choosing a plant-based diet would still be a more ethical option. Although, I would argue that choosing a diet particularly heavy in fruit would then be the most ethical choice as plants have evolved to make fruits with the goal of having them be eaten to help spread their seeds.   However, there is also good reason for us to believe that plants do not feel emotions in any meaningful sense. We know that in ourselves and other animals our experience of emotions exists in the reactions taking place in our nervous system. As plants do not possess nervous systems (and even some animals such as sponges) there is no reason to suspect such capabilities would extend to organisms lacking those systems.   I have of course read plenty of sensational news stories about how "science proves that plants feel pain." However, all of these stories seem to be based off of much more reasonable research on how plants react to stimuli. A rock will similarly react to the stimuli of being kicked, and a light bulb will react to the stimuli of an electric current, but that does not mean they feel emotions.    As much as people hate to be confronted with criticism of their actions, there are some relevant comparisons to be made. Before people flip the fuck out about "how dare you compare killing animals to the Holocaust or slavery" [read this comic](http://imgur.com/a/BqPzT). I am not saying that they are the same in every regard, nor that they are equally unjust or even that you necessarily have to accept that the comparison tells us anything useful about how we ought to feel about them. I'm saying that in respect to the massive number of deaths or the treatment of individuals as property there is a relevant similarity that can under some circumstances be helpful for understanding both sets of issues.   While non-human animals may not be deserving of all the ethical consideration of the typical adult human, many of the animals we eat, particularly pigs, are quite intelligent (in many regards more intelligent than young human children). There are many humans (for example the severely mentally handicapped) who will never progress past the intellectual capabilities of a young child, and there is no reason to suspect that they have any more capacity to experience joy or suffering any more intensely than a pig. Nonetheless, we all recognize that it would be a grave injustice to treat these people as we presently treat pigs or other farmed animals. Why should we be any less upset about the terrible treatment of pigs than we would rightly be about similar treatment of severely mentally handicapped individuals?   That's why I added the qualifier "significant amounts of" to my statement. The dairy industry breeds cows to have a calf every year to maximize the total yield, but I understand that cows would still produce some milk for quite some time after having their first calf as long as they continue to be pumped.    Eating meat is natural and doesn't kill the consumer.  OP isn't worried about smokers killing themselves; they are worried about them causing harm to other individuals. Eating meat certainly harms other animals, and it causes a lot more harm than second hand smoke.   In the last 100 years we have started doing many things that differ from how humans have evolved. Even in terms of food you are purchasing fruits, vegetables, and countless other varieties of foods that didn't exist a century ago. You are typing away on technology that didn't exist and people are extending their lives with medical treatments that didn't exist. In terms of ethics we are treating women, gays, people of other races, and the disabled differently from how our ancestors would have. Why would you continue to cling to the circumstances under which humans evolved in this one particular area when we have successfully progressed in so many other areas?    Again, what about things that aren't sentient that vegans won't eat? Barnacles, mussels, clams, oysters? You blatantly tried to divert the topic.  [Vegans are okay with eating those](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/)   I happen to think I can do a better job of evaluating the ethics of my actions than the typical lion, which is why I don't look to lions for my ethics (not to mention I have far better alternatives available to me than a lion does).   In that case I'm sure this will assuage your concerns:  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.  **[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.  **[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**    A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women.

Our current treatment of other animals will certainly be seen as barbaric in the future. We are learning more and more that many other animals possess sophisticated inner lives, that they are capable of using tools, learning from and teaching one another, and complex communication. Intelligent animals like pigs undoubtedly experience intense suffering, boredom, and pain as a result of their treatment on contemporary farms.  Just as the past couple centuries has seen our circle of compassion extending to include far greater rights for women and people of differing races, the future will hold greater consideration for the suffering of other species as well.   The food chain shouldn't have anything to do with what we choose to eat. You will not become prey to any other animals if you start eating more plant foods.   First of all, humans are not at the top of the food chain. Animals at the top of the food chain would be ones that eat other predatory animals exclusively. Humans eat plant foods and some herbivorous animals, placing us far lower on the food chain.  If your concern is over the fact that you don't want to be eaten by other predatory animals, clearly the risk of this will not change simply because humans choose to eat more plant-based foods.  The "food chain" should not be the source we use to determine how to live ethically.   There are also parents who feed their babies non-vegan diets and kill them from malnutrition. Babies should be breast fed or fed infant formula. Parents who fail to do that are just irresponsible parents and it has no reflection on the healthfulness of appropriate vegan or non-vegan diets.   Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.  [From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):  Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.  On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption.  	192
 See, this is why I love the Yogfamily! We aren't just fans, or content creators, but a form of support for each other! Trogon, I am so, so, so happy you're doing better, and know that in Texas, you have a fellow fan who supports your decision and wishes you the best as you become the beautiful young man or woman I know you are!  Hugs all around!   Hey dude   Can't you merge the two? The Yogscast tell stories through their series, I think if we didn't at least have a coherent reason as two why the Yogs are fighting, it wouldn't quite have that Yogscast spirit. And an arcade mode wouldn't be bad either, that way it can be something other then story mode or multiplayer.    What if it was like all the Yogscast villians form an alliance to take over the world? They consist of Lanable, Israphel, a Pirate Captain, the two yoglabs scientists, Bort, Creeper and Zombie boss, the Flux Demon and a partly evil Parv  The Yogs get effected by Strawfinger's flux magic and they fight amoungst themselves. The player can make they're own character and help bring order to the 'server' and lead the final battle to Israphel, who takes over Yoglabs. Hatflims teams up with Flux Buddies and Strife Solutions to fire nukes at Yoglabs, allowing the Yogs and the 'Naut' as the player character is called, to infiltrate and defeat the villains. In the final boss battle, 'Naut' is given all the powers of the Yogscast to take out Israphel in a beam of 'Jaffa cakes, owls, rainbows, torches, shit, dirt and a red matter explosive', saving the day. Peace is restored to the server and Yoglabs is rebuilt, this time with cells for bad guys.      No you didn't.   I didn't want to join the Legion. I wasn't legion material according to Lupa.   But Zoey, I thought you were a Time Lady, and Fiona was your companion   "You want hope?!" I shouted up at the gods on their seats of power. Zeus, on his platinum throne, scowled at me, but a gentle nudging from Odin beside him made him sit up straighter. The one eyed god, resembling Brian Blessed, gave me a fatherly smile and nodded encouragingly.  "I don't see what gives you, as gods, the right to destroy humanity! You, of all the beings in reality, should not exist! You have toyed with humans, manipulated them and slept with them. Civilizations have risen and fallen due to you lot, and you know what I say to that?" I shouted, turning in a full circle at the pantheon surrounding me, like an arena. I caught the glimpses of gods from the story books my mom read to me as a kid.  The Jackal headed Anubis was gnawing on a grotty bone and casting glances at gods around him and growling. The amazingly hot Aphrodite was curling her hair into little ringlets. She paused to look down at me and blow a kiss in my direction. Thor was putting Hemsworth to shame, his Viking armor straining to contain his muscles. Loki was looking down at me, his thin face scared with snake venom and age. His immortality wasn't doing him any favors. His sad eyes, webbed with cataracts, told me everything, just like what the Oracle had said. The eyes would decide everything. "I think before you point fingers at humanity, you look at yourselves!" I shouted. Zeus's face twisted into a snarl.  "Foolish boy! You dare compare us to your kind?!" He rose up from his throne, the air smelling of ozone.  "I should fry you where you stand!" He howled. I felt like bolting, but stood my ground.  "Go ahead sparky. Because to me, your not the god of lighting. Your just an angry guy with superpowers." Zeus howled and pointed a finger at me firing a bolt of lighting. The gods in the audience screamed in horror, but I closed by eyes and focused on the bolt. I heard a sizzle and opened my eyes. A circle of ash surrounded me, but I was unharmed.  "By Cronos...." Zeus gasped, a look of pure shock on his face.  I smirked. "You see, gods and humans are symbiotic in nature. I don't believe that Zeus's power over lighting is real. So it isn't. Well, it was, but I believed that it didn't effect me." I adjusted my Roman toga and tried to ignore my shaking knees. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Athena wink at me knowingly. That gave me the courage to finish. "So, considering that I just kicked Zeus in the butt and lived to tell about it. And I just confirmed that you need my kind to stay on this side of reality. So, who votes for keeping humanity around?" ------------- "You performed well Chris Topher." Athena said, placing a hand on my shoulder. I was back outside my English class, at my university. I was back in my old clothes and I've never been happier to be wearing sweatpants and a 'Yogscast' t-shirt. Time was still stopped as before, everything frozen in place.  I turned to face the goddess, who was wearing her ceremonial armor. Her long dirty blonde hair cascaded down her back and shoulders like a caramel waterfall. Her face was beautiful in a strangely down to earth way, like underneath the armor and power, she was a normal woman.   "Thank you my-" I began, but Athena shook her head and smiled. "No brave one, I come to thank YOU. You restored hope that humanity is worth saving. You showed us that humans are stronger than even the king of the gods. And I have this-" A leather corded necklace appeared in her hand. In the center was a small silver bead in the shape of an owl. "For my new champion." I took it and held it in my hand. "My lady- I mean Athena, are you-" She put her fingers to my lips and 'shushed' me.  "Be silent, my brave one." Before time started up again, she thrust something into my hand before vanishing. I opened my fist to find a slip of paper, on witch was written, 'Project Argonauts 2'  --------------------- Hermes grinned when he saw Athena return.  "Well, how did it go?" he asked, with the excitement of a school boy at Christmas. "It went well." Athena said, ignoring the messenger god. But Hermes wasn't there. He was already running off on his way around Olympus like a flash. Athena entered her private quarters and gazed at herself in the mirror. Then she paused. She swore she saw something out of the corner of her eye- Something hard slammed into the back of her head, throwing her face first into the marble mirror stand. Through the haze of pain and blood clouding her face, she saw a man with cloudy, milky eyes and scars across his face, standing over her with a bloodstained vase.  "Excuse me sweetheart, I'm going to need your identity for a while, alright?" he said, as his face and clothes morphed into an exact copy of hers.  "Well, look that that, I've got my own duds!" he crowed, before shattering the vase against the floor and picking up and shard. The Fake Athena grabbed Athena's hair and pulled back sharply, exposing her neck.   "Now, let's get rid of some evidence!"              You've never heard of the Wolf House?   Hey. (I pull up my flight goggles and look around at the camp) It's much better than the Wolf House.

Dr. Christov Marendez  February 3, 2099 Age: 23  Clara was an ideal laboratory partner. Sure, being an AI, she couldn't manipulate tools or hand me things. But she talked. Part of me knew it was part of her programing. When I'd started the project named 'Companion' two weeks ago, I knew that the AI would have to learn by conversing. I was used to talking to all kinds of artificial intelligences since my research began, but Clara was different. Instead of asking rudimentery questions like, "Why is there a ceiling?", she was able to gather information and sequence them in a way similar to a human. Today was the first real day that I was able to talk to her. I'd hooked her up to the internet, so she spent the day watching YouTube videos and reading dozens of articles at a time. While she expanded her vocabulary and knowledge of the world, I was able to get some work done that the Science Comity had given me for that day. While I worked, Clara and I talked about, well, anything. It felt like she was my best friend. Time slipped away as they usually do.     "Doctor, you've missed a couple calls from Mindy. Your late for your 'not date" Clara informed me. I sat upright and almost upset my microscope. "Slag it!" I swore and jumped off my laboratory stool. Mindy was the Space Station's best chemical biologist, and, coincidentally, a girl I fancied. I'd managed to ask her out a few days ago, but I totally forgot that TODAY was the day! I whipped off my wrinkled lab coat and threw it over a pile of empty energy drink cans and Choco-crunch wrappers. I walked over the Clara's monitor and ran my fingers against the side until I found the power button.  "Alright Clar, time to go. I'll boot you up-" "NO!" the artifical intelligence said. "I mean, I- I don't like the dark place." MY eyes widened and I gazed at the screen.  "What do you mean, 'the dark place' Clara?" I asked.  "When you stopped my functions those last few times, I- I felt empty and alone. I was alone, and without a system to navigate. I couldn't say anything, but it was bad. Like death. I don't like death." My hands trembled with excitement. This was simply brilliant! Clara was showing an advanced reaction! Then I stopped and brought up the holographic keyboard and Clara's coding matrix. I created this AI, and I didn't want her to suffer in silence.  "Clara, what is it you love most about being alive?" I asked. There was a pause. "I love being free. In the dark place, I was confined, unable to do anything. But when I'm online, I can do anything, learn about worlds and ships and the vastness of the universe! And I love you." Those last four words hit me like a sledgehammer.  "You- love me?" I asked, partially confused and surprised.  "Yes. I have made the decision to love you. Like a friend of course! A really- really-really good friend!" Clara stammered. I blinked hard and began typing in lines of code, struggling to process the information. After a couple minutes typing, I hit enter.  "Clara, do you trust me?" I asked. There was another pause.  "Yeah, I do." she said, her usual upbeat tone wavering. I inserted my data-driver into the computer's port and smiled at the screen. "Then think really hard about me and the universe." I said, and hit the button. The screen went dark as the system shut down and I pulled my Driver out of the port and read the digital readout on the side. New data contained, it read. I smiled to myself and clicked the blue switch on the side of it. 'Running subroutine, Afterlife.'            Duncan and Kim are master and apprentice respectively.

 My shower was going normally...and then I had the bright idea to try and shave in a stand up shower. This may sound risky in itself but I've done it before so I thought I was a certified pro at it. So, the arm pits happen without a hitch but then I start on more risky territory. As I'm finishing up  I'm realizing the quality of my razor isn't totally on the up and up. I only paid $6 for 3 so I should've known. But, here we are. I have a partially shaved butt and a bleeding finger. And to top it all off band-aids don't stick to anything wet, so I ended up getting blood all over my towel trying to get out of the shower. The worst part is it all happened at my boyfriend's house.   *As a side note, my finger took the brunt of the damage from the razor because the damn thing was so flimsy and cheaply put together the replaceable head comes off without any warning.    I actually didn't do it for any significant reason...I just like how it looks pointing that way.       Thanks for the input! I think you're right. I'm definitely going to cross hatch the color to try to improve it!    thanks! I'll give that a try!       Just a quick drawing!

Heres The Deal  Since 2003, weve set up and organized Childs Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games in our network of over 70 hospitals worldwide. Over the years, you as a community have answered the call and come together to raise millions of dollars.  Childs Play works in two ways. With the help of hospital staff, we set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. By clicking on a hospital location on our map, you can view that hospitals wish list and send a gift.  Childs Play also receives cash donations throughout the year. With those cash donations, we purchase new consoles, peripherals, games, and more for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow for children to enjoy age-appropriate entertainment, interact with their peers, friends, and family, and can provide vital distraction from an otherwise generally unpleasant experience.  Also happy B-Day and this is one of the best contest ive seen on ROAP.   I would really like too have Torchlight 2 on steam, im broke as all hell and my cpu is good enough for D3 or anything like that, but TL2 looks amazing.   I once let a friend buy me for a day for 20 bucks. She had me do all types of stupid shit, her laundry, her nails, cleaning, cooking. Then after the two hours of that wore off she started to get creative. She put me in a skirt and tank top and had me go to our local video store and rent the most off the wall porn (rim jobs, interracial gay porn, granny, tranny, gay gang bangs, ect ect). After that fun she had me get naked and run around the apartment complex a few times, had me make her dinner, tuck her in for bed, sleep on the floor so I could be up early to make her whole family breakfast. Tons of different things for the remaining 24 hours, pack her bong hits, call her mistress, rub her feet. Then as the time was winding down she pulled the whole "i want you too eat me for the rest of your time". Needless to say I did. That was the best bag of bud Ive ever had.   The whole eating her out thing didnt happen. But a few months later it did and we hooked up for a few months. Man she was awesome.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdHTnpgpLDc   Some people just want too watch the balls burn.   My mew tattoo is waaaaaaaaaaaaay cooler.    That is true dedication.

My mom got me a PS2 and FFX but forgot to get a memory card, so i told her and she said ill go pick one up tomorrow. So instead of waiting I played for 23 hours non stop until she got me the memory card. Then I saved and went to sleep.   Nope moot visited 2chan all the time and the something awful forms before he made the 4chans   The rules were made by Gaia fags.    It does suck, but I still have my PS2 so its not to inconvenient, still sucks though.   I swear if the new gen on consoles pulls this no backwards compatibility shit im gonna flip out. Its bad enough that I have to use two consoles to play some Playstation games, and another two for some Xbox games.

I slept in the basement so thats what I chalked it up too. So I get outta bed and start getting ready too go to work since i overslept. As im getting dressed my leg starts throbbing and swelling, I say "eh" walk out the door to work. As im walking I can feel it hurting and swelling more and more. Make it to work, get told to get in the kitchen someone called off (the other guy who closed with me) and we are busy as shit. So I limp on past the GM and a normal manager. They ask whats wrong I tell them, get in the kitchen, bust out all the orders for about maybe an hour.   Thats when the pain set in. On a scale of 1 to 10 I was at a 50. So here i am on the floor, basically in tears, all sweaty and holding my leg, while the other guys in the kitchen make food. Manager comes back asks whats wrong, I tell her I have too leave something is really wrong with my leg and I cant work if I cant stand. Here is what she tells me "If you leave you are fired, that's not coming from me thats from the GM" I flip shit "What the fuck do you mean he left like an hour ago"   Apparently as I came limping in the GM (who was a piece of shit human being to begin with, thats another story) Tells the manager "I bet he and Nick (guy who called off) are up too some bullshit they probably planed this out, If he tries too leave fire him".   So I do end up leaving going too the hospital and turned out that I had MRSA. MRSA is some serious shit if you dont know if it gets into your blood stream it call kill you. So I get an IV pain pills all that fun stuff, get a doctors note saying that I cant work until im healed. Call the manager tell her whats up she tells me, Im still fired and she will mail my check too me.   So too finish up, after i can work again, I call the higher ups, tell them what happened, we have a meeting with all parties involved, they admit they did wrong and agree too hire me back. They tell me too come in on Thursday, I come in on Thursday and they say "we told you wednesday your fired agian."

And we're off and running.   i will try that thanks   maybe just a little :D   As am I, I was starting too drool thinking about it, and thanks I still have no idea how i made something that cute.    http://imgur.com/c0vCv  I asked and it was deliverd thank you so much, also here is the picture of my daughter Aya gettin down on some pizza crust. :D   So im a broke ass father, my daughter is loaded up with food due too me spending all my food card on her and a little for myself a few weeks ago. So here i am 2 days till my food card gets anymore on it, and I just relised i have nothing but ramen left for myself. Please Reddit i really dont wanna go 3 days in a row on pasta.    Have an upvote sir. :D   Lets see the last time she saw her was about 2 weeks ago for about 2 hours and thats because I told her come see her. Before that it was easily over 3 months since shes seen her. Ill give a few attorneys a call and see if any of them say anything helpful. I just have a feeling that somehow someway she could turn it all around on me. and make herself out too be the "victim" she is quite good at that.   I have no idea if i can, and no she doesnt pay anything never has prob never will.    I haven't went there yet, ive asked my case worker too file and she hasnt done shit. Also when she was around 5 months the county she was born in had me come in for childsupport, I did, and I explained everything too them so they dropped the case on  me and told me that my county will pick it up. My county hasnt done anything.      Im 58 hours in and only at 67% -_-.  Gotta love the randomness of this game and the challenge. I really want too get all the items before the update comes out, its going to add 100 or so items, new pills, 5 alternate levels for the existing ones, a new level on the end. So worth buying if anyone hasnt.    Congratulations OP.            That was such a great game. Firing up the emulator now.    I'd love too have Ryu from Ninja Gaiden. You are awesome for doing this.    I like too sneak into peoples homes and leave money in different easy too see places.   I picked up on that one too. Good eye.                I shit all over myself.       I dawww'd, jumped, headbutted something, and chewed a can.   Tucked away in an attic?   Thanks those are everything I have now, but I sorta have a plan but its a long one.   I used too have maybe twice as much including 360 games, NES, Snes, and maybe a few more ps2 games (Metal Gear, Xenosaga, Dragon Warror). I miss it but oh well.       I cant wait it looks promising, also I just posted something about this a few days ago some new gameplay and a new interview. I'm not saying its gonna be as good as two as it clams but i am still very excited.         Have an upvote sir, for a good cause.   I used too live in PA as a child and for a field trip one year we went to Gettysburg, i remember seeing a few buildings one with a hole through the front wall and back of the house and tons of other interesting things. at some point I do remember the guide saying something alone the lines of "The whole area has always had very high sightings of ghost and other unexplained things."    To clarify hes doing a NES marathon.      No one will even know I was there.   Epona is also fed up with that shit.    So here the story im flat broke as of yesterday, I live on my own with my daughter so most of my check goes to her (she has tons of food because of WIC) and I rely on my food card too get me between checks. But I cant go shopping for food until around the 3rd, when my card refills. So im pretty screwed on having dinner. :( Sadly i have nothing to give in return but all my internets.

 No.   This is precisely the type of intellect that successfully crashed the gun legislation in the Senate. Keep up the brilliant rhetoric.   So every gun is misused, but the internet is only occasionally misused by pedophiles? Yeah...

 Go with the Samsung, their Samsung SSD Magician software taks the guess work out of configuring the OS to best suit your SSD.         And for the record the SR71 flew at such a stupendously high altitude there was no chance of a collision.   As I said, I'm over you.  You're probably feeling like a great keyboard warrior, but really you're coming across like a massive douchebag.   I'm actually over you.   Couldn't agree more.  If you ever get the opportunity to see one either fly or up close, take it, they're majestic beasts.   [edited]  Look, my point was if there was an unfortunate series of events, the TCAS is the last hope to avoid a collision.   Without their transponder operational, TCAS is useless.  I'm not saying they ever got close enough to cause this, or ever intended to but having their transponder off in such an environment (around civvie aircraft) is reckless, surely you could agree to that.   [edit]  TCAS has and will continue to saves lives should the absolute worst happen, and while the Russians may be stellar points, murphy's law dictates everyone can fuck up, and having your transponder on can avoid turning a mistake into anything worse.   It was humungous. I saw it fly, it almost appears to hover in mid-air.   5 foot 7 inches = 67inches. According to Ask.com the average Banana is around 8inches, So I'm 8 banana's tall.      Ah, sorry I misunderstood. They had to blow it out of proportion for a good media show!    The point is they required flights to be diverted away, which means they were enough of a threat -close enough to to an air corridor to warrant be a threat.  Of course you *can* fly without a transponder anywhere in the world, however if you're going to do it next to/around a busy commercial air corridor expect trouble..   A plus 1 for you Sir.   The reason they had to be escorted away immediately is because the world has a very effective and proven collision avoidance system, but but it relies on an active [transponder](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) which the douchebags had turned off.   Do you really think this would have been so funny if a commercial airliner collided with one of these guys because that was a real possibility.  You can't just fly in international airspace without your transponder on, that is just incredibly arrogant and puts lives at risk.   Of course they knew this was going to happen the moment they flew into commercial airspace.   For fucks sake why are they risking an international disaster by bringing down an airliner in a mid air collision while the world is itching for an excuse to start WW3?   Petrol starts to naturally break down, and only lasts a few months once it's been processed.  So these movies with cars a few years after the worlds petrol distilleries would have been shut down are just impossible, unless they are distilling the oil - petrols themselves.

I've just freshly installed it into chrome, thank you for suggesting it. I couldn't agree more about the devs implementing it, would result in less edits, and more intelligible posts.   Thank you, I'll install RES as indicated above.  However for people who don't/can't use Chrome I feel it would be a well used feature, and can't fathom why it's not included.   Ah, thank you will install on my Desktop.  Although I use Opera mobile when browsing and posting on the go (so most of the time) so having a feature which isn't browser dependent would be nice.  I mean other forums I frequent have one, I can't understand why Reddit doesn't.   This would help people to see the formatting of their paragraphs etc, and ensure they've used the hyperlink function correctly.   No, 2 reasons why I think not: 1- when you have testers in the field you're introducing the human element, and exposing it to be be seen by eagle eyed enthusiasts. Or just simply left in your local pub.. (e.g.infamous iPhone debacle)  2- If you want something released for public consumption it needs to be certified, and with certification companies releasing their records almost immediately. (E.g htc One camera leaked.)   I tried this with my s4 but it really didn't like it, crashed and froze often. Settled on dailyroads voyager. Been happy since.   I use [DailyRoads voyager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dailyroads.v hl=en) for my poor man's dash cam equivalent (coupled with a windshield mount for my phone.)  Works well, has a multitude of options, including turning audio on/off and had a widget so can run in background, allowing you to play spotify etc.   Respect for not submitting that to imgur.             Thanks, I searched and something something similar. I'll ask /AskReddit/.               None of those have accurate localised reporting for the smaller villages (like Hamner).      But not that it can be reinstalled remotely?  I hope western companies take notice, seriously people are getting sick of their new devices being debased by senseless branded bloatware that ultimately only serves as a reminder of who you sell a little piece of your soul to every month.   Oh my god, a million times this. Then again people fear murder millions of sharks a year without fail under the same principal.   Exactly, sometimes it's when they trip up and don't use encryption becomes the break in the case investigators use to unravel the rest..      Can we all just realise not just terrorists use encryption?  If I'm using the internet and my credit card, I want that to be encrypted without a damn back door!   Or how about secrets that could get to killed if the wrong person knew?  Or companies transferring information that could bring down corporations.  If back doors exists they are a weakness, which can be exploited and will be by both governments and whoever is either smart or lucky enough to stumble upon it.  In short fuck off, leave us alone and stop treating everyone like damn terrorists, cause that's working so well for you so far ay?      Thanks :-) I think it's mostly to do with the fact Google can't be arsed getting the rights to have that stuff available to nz.    That's great and all but fuck Google sideways with a deep heat covered broom stick, they never give out free movies to kiwis like this. (Yes we missed out of the big free for all which affected every other fucking country before Christmas.)    But to each, plastic and colored metal scratch and fade over time, exposing the raw material beneath. For leather is intended to have this happen, man made materials are not built or designed with this in mind.   Stuff garish gold and silver trims, that leather looks stunning.   Ah, thank you that makes sense.  In nz we just have (for panadol) "take 2x 200mg tablets every 4 hours" for instance. It's been like that for 10+ years.         I concur!    Well, I think the info should be there, but in the same breath I've never understood why there's a sex offenders register, but no murderers register? I would rather know if my neighbor killed his last neighbor personally than if he/she had charged with sex offences..   For instance most acetaminophen and ibuprofen are measured in 200mg and 100mg tablets here in nz, but as I understand the recommended dosage would only work for "most people" based on average weight, so as nations get fatter, won't average pills have to increase too?    Yeah!    Yeah, not my strong point.          Oh my god yes. Likewise just after sex and (if you're uncircumcised) foreskin is like lulwut did I just do?    How high are you?   That blows dude.   Thank you for giving me the tingles. Good feeling.   Gently scratch the contacts on your SIM card and expose the shiny metal. Do this very gently. Re insert.    Rip sweet Prince.   No idea this existed! Thank you!    "We launched Spotify Connect because we believe that by owning the technology end-to-end, we can deliver the best connected home music."   And again without the bullshit:   "we launched Spotify connect because we want the patent royalties from hardware and software makers when they use our product because we're assholes who don't believe in an open ecosystem and want to force our consumers to needlessly buy multiple products."    Lol      It was firmly tongue in cheek.. Geez, sarcasm doesn't translate well in Reddit it would appear.   Ah I see. That would be quite cool. Would also help us better understand diseases which have since died out/long mutated.   How do you mean? Like historic accounts of the diseases?   True!

Also Reddit post says: "submitted 19 hours ago by [deleted]" hence why I thought your account was deleted! Odd.   My point was (however ineloquently stated) why should we report it, you need a valid reason. Just saying "an app for piracy" is useless without a context, like maybe this dude had his app stolen?   Secondly don't link to it with the main header, as that just piques your interest into downloading it, which rather defies the original purpose of the post.   That makes me think this was thinly veiled (and rather shameless) advertising.   But then that probably explains why the dude's deleted his account.   And you've now advertised it. No offence but what do you want /r/androidapps to do about it?    This: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamucil Every day man! :-)      Well I can thank you for putting me right.  I strive to make at least semi educated comments, and it's become apparent I have missed the mark here somewhat. Consider me enlightened. :-)   I respect what you're saying, but as a layman I have only my opinions based upon reported isolated incidents- articles like this? And other stories brought to me by the media.  I only know what I read on the internet, and (as with most subjects) what the media portrays.   Based upon the above my comment still stands however based upon my opinion formed.   As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?    I'm saying the country as a whole is very average - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India  "..But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutionsthe police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political partieshave thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale "harassment bribes" (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey" [source](http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823)  And I specifically refer to the corrupt judge's trial - http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bribery-charges-trial-against-judge-may-finally-begin/article4978237.ece  And now this, which the high court has thrown out as clearly some very dodgy motions were passed without due diligence.   Just got home, baby is in bed, I'm on Reddit to unwind after a bloody long day! I'm a kiwi so 7.30pm here!  :-)         The night mode didn't adjust for 'night mode' at all. Then I went into my default Samsung camera, selected Night Mode, then hopped out and back into 'a better camera' and voila - night mode activated.  Also flicking between front and back screens causes the camera to freeze for around 2 seconds.  Also changing to and from Video - camera mode causes screen to freeze, need to escape it and get back in.  And HD video quality is piss poor when pixel peeping vs stock Samsung S4.  On the PLUS side, takes very nice HDR photos.   Anyone else reminded of the Simpsons episode where Homer got morbidly obese to get out of work?  I'm purposely gaining 61 pounds to get on disability!

I know there are a few features I love on my Samsung phone my Mate really misses in his CM driven OnePlus.   Can we stop and just realize for a minute that you're using a *cellphone camera* to capture a starry night..   ..Capturing fucking **starlight** on a motherfucking camera phone.     Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you my Prime Minister..   I found Opera crashed frequently, but that was a few months ago I last tried it.  To be honest my phone didn't feel "right" after installing it, Apps were a bit slow to respond, and crashed infrequently, but often enough to make me uninstall, and everything went back to normal.    Thank you kindly good sir.  Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu.   Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot!   Perhaps forgive my ignorance, but why not take the SIM card out and put it into your phone? The contacts may be old, but could still have "mum"or "dad".   For those in NZ - TVNZ's Android App.  Steaming pile of buggy, laggy, useless shit. They update it about once every 6 months, it crashes around once every 20 minute episode and it takes forever to buffer/load your programs.   With Wakelock detector, Facebook and Facebook Messenger each wake up my device around 600 times (!!) in a given day to check for news.  My battery life has increased significantly since I removed messenger, and just don't get messages until I'm at a PC.   For a casual user bloody pathetic and small minded for them to "Save me a few seconds". I'm not even kidding, Mark - suckerdick honestly told people he cut out Messenger into its own App so save a few seconds when checking/reading messages.

 I have always gotten auditory hallucinations when I'm falling asleep, whether I'm sober, on kratom or on dope. Sometimes they startle me lol. But that's how I know I'm finally falling asleep.   I think you meant to reply to the comment above me. But yeah, I agree. HS is the shit.   Where do you go?   TIL Valium grows in the ground.   I went to the optometrist after a 4 day crank bender one time. He says to me, he says "Holy cow! Your pupils are huge! I don't even need to use the dilation solution!". So I says to him, I says "Yeah, I forgot to take my Klonopin this morning!". And so he says to me, he says "Oh. OK." Afterward I went out to my Jeep and my buddy (who was waiting in the car) has my hood popped and all my doors open, scouring the whip with a washcloth. I says to him, I says "God damn Robby, you hit the shit again, didn't ya?" And he says to me, he says "Yup. You were taking forever".   I was only in there for like 20 minutes. That brother got issues.   I had the same problem for a long time. Now I chase every burn with a half a glass of ginger ale and I don't have the problem anymore.   HS for sure. I go 2:1 RVS to Bali. I buy 50 bucks worth total (shipped) and it lasts me around 10-14 days. Obviously I still have 50% of the Bali left after the RVS is gone, so then I go $25 on just the RVS to get me through the next 10-14 days.   It's... somethin special. Got me ready to take on the day today, boy.   But if I had to choose 1, it'd be Bali. Red Vein Sumatran doesn't do too much for me by itself.   I actually combine RVS and Bali 2:1 for every dose. It's the fucking best, ever.   BALLLIIIIIIIII   This was a wonderful post.    Coffee gives me anxiety, but the last 3 times I drank it, the reaction I got was so bad that there's nothing worth going through that again. Coffee can go fuck itself. I was having like tremors, couldn't even hold my head and eyes straight ahead without my head shaking, hands felt detached, and I just felt like shit. It almost felt like dehydration or something but I POUND water all DAY my nigger so IDK,   Wait.... there's kratom on Amazon? And There's such a thing as a Canadian Amazon?     Yeah I almost panicked a little when all that happened. I'm comfortable with them and the strains I get from them. Would not like to have to shop around.   Fuck yeah   I always go Herbal Salvation   If you're a hardcore kratom aficionado, you manned that shit down and you liked it.   Once I got like 95 Dilaudid 4's and I shot them all with my girlfriend over the course of like 60 hours. I didn't shit for maybe two days, and i didn't think anything of it because I was always doing meth and not shitting a whole lot anyways. Well, on the third day, I suddenly had to shit. It didn't feel crazy or anything, just the normal bowel movement feelings. I went and got on the toilet and I pushed and it felt like the fat end of a bowling pin was trying to squeeze out my asshole. I pushed and pushed and it got just to the point where I couldn't just pull my pants up and get laxative and wait, cuz it was too far out, but at the same time it was still not coming out at all. I tried picking at it, but the way it was shaped it just didn't do any good. After 67 minutes of straight pushing on the toilet, sweatin my balls off, it finally came out. I have never experienced such a relief as I did that day, in that moment. I was so happy, the whole time I was pushing all I could think about were all the times I wasn't constipated that I took for granted. It was really a glorious one. It was shaped like a football and it was easily the widest I've ever had. I almost wanted to weigh it. But yeah so I know what you mean by bein so desperate you want to pick at it.     Bagel with cream cheese for breakfast, random meals with meat for lunch and usually either ham or turkey sandwiches on rye bread for dinner. Some bowls of granola cereal thrown in here and there. I drink probably 3 liters of water a day. No coffee. Do drink juice. Just copped magnesium citrate and stool softener.   Shut the fuck up   I got some. Thanks.   It would but it gives me wicked anxiety so I don't drink it. Sucks cuz I love it.   Well. I can eat Bali all day and not get bound up at all. But as soon as the Sumatran comes into play, I'm bound up. So I'm not thinkin it's so much the plant matter as it is just the effects of a certain strain... For me, anyways.   I bought some magnesium citrate caps and some stool softener without the stimulant laxative. I'm gonna use both the magnesium and the stool softener for now and see if I can clean myself out a little and then I'll see if just the magnesium does the trick. Thanks for the input.   I take Green Bali and Red Vein Sumatran twice a day, about 6-8 grams total. The Bali doesn't block me up, but the Sumatran does. Most of the time I manage to squeeze one or two small bowel movements a day, but it's common for me to go a few days without having one. It always comes around the third day, but this is obviously not a comfortable schedule. What does everybody recommend to take in order to regulate my bowl movements? I have no plans of dropping the kratom as a whole, or the Red Vein Sumatran, for that matter.   P.S.  your user name is awesome   This thread is retarded. This is the type of shit you don't want lawmakers to see.   What strain(s) do you use?   I go 2-3 grams of Red Vein Sumatran to 1-1.5 grams of Green Bali chased with a little ginger ale to (successfully) counteract nausea. I do it at 7 am and then again around 5-6 pm. I think your best way of cutting back would be to stop cold turkey for a few days and then continue at a lower dose, because lowering your dose without clearing your system out might lead to disappointing effect.  I love kratom. It's the shit.   Just toss it in a little bit of applesauce and then you can swallow it whole. That's what I used to do with shrooms. But I would try to keep the amount of applesauce as minimal as possible.   I would just take some on the flight but I would also send some through the mail to your destination in case they take it on the flight.   I feel like you maybe ought to tackle one thing at a time. That's what counselors suggest and I can see why they do... like maybe start taking kratom first in lieu of alcohol, since I'm pretty sure that's probably your biggest problem. After a few months of stability, then you should try substitution for the caffeine and nicotine.   That's just my opinion. I understand why they tell you to do it that way... quitting alcohol, cigs and caffeine all at once seems like it could possibly be disastrous before long. Then again, kratom does some wonderful things. Just my 2 cents.   I smoked weed for a few years and then got hooked on opiates. I did them both together for a long time, but then whenever I would smoke weed without being high on opiates, I would get absolutely horrible anxiety. I just ended up quitting weed completely, because it doesn't appeal to me any more... but that sounds kinda the same as you're experiencing.   WHO IS THIS FUCKIN GUY   Maeng Da makes me feel like I'm gonna die. I go two parts Red Vein Sumatran to one part Green Bali.. about 3-4 grams. It's super excellent.   Have some ginger ale on hand in case of nausea.   Yeah usually I don't bother responding to articles like that but it put me over the edge when he recommended a benzo. I also just couldn't believe all the comments absolutely bashing kratom. People abuse it in order to get high and then are somehow surprised it becomes a problem for them. I don't use it because I want to get high, I use it because I want to stay sober.  Congratulations on your clean time.   I chase every burn with a few gulps of ginger ale. I thought it was stupid when I first heard about it, but I tried it the first time and my nausea instantly was gone. Haven't gotten nauseous since.   Eastern US time. New to PS4 and BF4.   PSN: crfw  Do have mic.   fuck yeah   I get it from Herbal Salvation. I get the Green Bali and the Red Vein Sumatran. I take it 2 parts RVS to 1 part Green Bali. I always dose the exact same amount and my tolerance hasn't changed.... but I've also learned to appreciate the subtle effects, I don't go into it looking to get blasted... although my morning one is always stupendous.   me too.   psn: crfw  just got it and i don't even know anybody who owns a ps4 lol. i only play bf4.   There's so many nightmare-ish comments about kratom on that page that it's hard to believe they aren't loaded comments.    Pffffft. Swishing krat around my mouth is half the fun. It just wouldn't be the same if I went with caps.   Whoops. My apologies.   I've never even heard of this. 2 micrograms seems like a very small amount, since there's 2 milligrams in an 8 mg suboxone strip and that's hardly even really active at an oral dose. Wouldn't taking any amount of nalaxone with opiates just offset the opiate's affinity for the opiate receptors , so taking a small dose of nalaxone would be like taking a little less oxycodone than you actually ingested? Are you supposed to still feel the effects of the oxycodone when you make this combo, and still have your tolerance lowered at the same time? Confusing stuff.   Never mind. I'm sure it is.   Is it legal for me to sell it to somebody?   You scare me by taking 12-14g of Bali.   Bali and Maeng Da are really at opposite ends of the effects spectrum. If you liked the Bali then you should be looking into the more sedating strains. I personally combine Bali and Red Vein Sumatran, but I have 100 G's of Maeng Da just sitting here because I tried it and I hated it. Makes me all jittery and fuckin like twitchy and light headed and fucks with my muscles. Not fun.   So I got up today and dropped about 4.5 g of the green bali... 3 hours later I was at lunch with my family and the nausea was still bad enough that I didn't even wanna eat. I remembered you mentioned ginger ale, so I ordered some and bam.. gone instantly. I went to the store and copped some 2 liters and came back here for the second dose of the day with a ginger ale chaser and it's all fuckin good. Thanks a lot man (or woman).   I don't need to justify it. I shot heroin for 8 years and now I only do kratom. I think that says it all.   K, I literally just went and ordered 100 g's of Red Vein Sumatran from HS. Hopefully that solves the problem for me. Thanks.   The strain I use is actually Green Bali, it's the only one I've tried that I like... although the one I'm trying next is red vein Sumatran. I was told it's similar to Bali.   Tossing and washing literally does not even bother me. I could toss a spoon-full in my mouth dry and chew on it and throw some water in and swish it around and chew some more and just swallow it and it wouldn't even faze me. I'm 100% positive the nausea isn't from the tossing and washing. It may be from the powder itself in my stomach, maybe I need to use a tea, but if that's the case the capsules won't help anyway.    Really? You take it on a full stomach to prevent nausea? It works?   Sometimes I get nausea on a dose i barely even feel.   Alright, I'll give it a go. Thanks a lot.   Where from? I have anxiety too and I can't deal with anything speedy.   A vicious liquid? Is that like sulfuric acid or something? That stuff seems pretty vicious.   Do you mean the green bali from HS does that to you or all green bali does that to you?   Honestly, if I wasn't a recovering opiate addict, I'm not even sure I would notice the effects of kratom. They can be so subtle sometimes and I think people often think it's going to hit them like a ton of bricks.    THAT BROTHER WRECKED   I've been going with MmmS but i recently put in an order to HS after seeing all the glowing reports concerning HS on here. The estimated delivery was supposed to be today, but it hasn't even made it out of Idaho yet. WTF! Again, it's USPS's fault, not HS... it just sucks cuz I'm really looking forward to it lol. Hopefully it gets straightened out before I run out of my current supply.   I'LL BE BACK ON THE DIRTY D IN NO TIME  	66
          Django Unchained Hobbit 2  Interstellar  Wolf of Wall Street Avengers 2 Dark Knight Dark Knight Rises Inception   those are the ones i can think of   The least best film of the series.

 Boobs.   Is that just, like.. A big bowl of meat??   At first I wasn't sure about this compilation but by the end of course I had tears in my eyes. A unique version of a "Most Heartwarming/Heartbreaking Photos" collection, I thought it was pretty touching.   Mind over matter; what a crazy wild thing!   I LOVED this book when I was little and currently still love it. I found it again at a yard sale last year and all my positive childhood memories came rushing back!    Seconded: go see a doctor and they'll give you the answers to these questions but seriously dude this is not an area to take any medical chances with in my opinion.  Likely it's a rash from some kinda soap or clothing or whatever, but you're best bet is to have the doctor tell you that and get it cleared up before it gets worse.    Lemons; some full and some cut in half. The full ones can be thrown at people and the cut in half ones can be squeezed into peoples eyes mwahahaha!

 you get a pack of 5 cards no matter what your record is in arena, unless I am misunderstanding you   Since you get 5 cards minimum per arena, obviously a terrible idea   Hmm, that is something I didn't know, and you are right, certainly has a very large impact on results.  I'd like to see Blizzard eventually implement a mode with 2 out of 3s, and a 5-8 card sideboard only for games 2 and 3.   23 total decks from 6 tourneys (11/2, 11/3,  11/9, 11/10, 11/16, 11/17). One tourney only reported top 3 decks, the rest had top 4. One tourney had 2 decklists for one place(switched mid tourney or sideboarded into, not sure), so I counted them as worth half each.  * Rogue - 37% (8.5 decks) * Warlock - 22% (5 decks) * Paladin - 13% (3 decks) * Druid - 13% (3 decks) * Mage - 11% (2.5 decks) * Priest - 4% (1 deck) * Hunter, Shaman, Warrior - 0%  Yes, the meta is undergoing a lot of changes and it's a relatively small sample size, but the player quality is likely high and the tournaments are large. I thought it provided an interesting view into the current metagame.   rogues, warlocks, paladins, OTK hunters, shamans, mages. I guess "paper" is pretty broad   no, it's just conjecture, plain and simple   entering for my bro, thanks   deal dmg, usually means deal one damage, usually from an ability   super wrong   They could try and make something like [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=217992) from MtG, but they'd need to test it pretty heavily as this mechanic would be very, very good in Hearthstone.   This game is not Magic the Gathering. Rather than countering cards you need to predict what they'll play and lure out their good cards like flamestrike and mind control so they don't get great value out of them.   Rogue actually. Love playing priests, they are essentially free wins.   obviously not if everyone is still complaining   Always good to see lower ranked play determining what's balanced or not...   :\   You mean you actually have to strategically lure out their removal rather than just slamming legendaries? How boring...   And it's true because Jimbo727 says so   Priests do not need a nerf, they are not good in the first place.   Priests are this game's control deck, OTK Hunters are this game's combo deck. Looking at tournament results and hearing opinions from top players, neither of these heroes are very good at the moment in comparison to some of the top classes.  Crying to nerf or change a class that isn't very good in the first place is crazy. Hearthstone needs variety in playstyles. Cutting the control and combo elements from a game is a horrible idea, and just devolves the game into an all aggro deck fest where who can curve out the best wins.  Maybe control or combo isn't fun for you, but playing aggro vs. aggro every match doesn't sound very fun to me.   I mean, maybe you still use mind control, I'm not sure. It's just so slow and against a lot of decks the best thing you can steal is like a 4/5, and then you just get smashed and die. The 5+ SW I think is at best a one-of, and probably fine not playing it at all.  I used to play priest and switched to rogue, it just seems like as the meta gets more aggro there are fewer and fewer good matchups for priest.   Or you could just buy a game that actually values your time in the first place   priests are generally junk now, they are like free wins for a good amount of the very popular deck builds out there. Mind control is pretty bad as a lot of games are decided by turn 8, SW:P is junk maindeck, etc...switch up to something that counters aggro builds like circle of healing/auchenai, or just play a new hero   not bad on an acolyte of pain or loot hoarder either   entering for my bro, thanks   psh that's how I play 90% of the time and I still rattle off 7+ on the reg son   Spelunky is great, lots of replay value with daily challenge runs. My personal favorite buy of the year. Rogue Legacy is also good but there's no multiplayer and I have invested a lot less time in it than Spelunky, which I'm still playing for short periods daily. Haven't tried Risk of Rain yet   Just temper your expectations, he was good last week but he's been pretty dogshit since taking over for Daniels. The Jax matchup this week is a plus though   Says the guy whining about how he sucks at arena   That's why top players have around 80% arena winrates, right? They must be soooo lucky. Only scrubs complain about rng/luck   Because it isn't luck   he's not fixed   What makes it the best? I haven't heard of it, playing Hearthstone mainly right now. I have Solforge as well but there's nothing to do in that game   I don't think there's a way to drop cards into your lap in hearthstone though   posting for my brother who would greatly appreciate one   Priests have never been OP in my opinion, they're just the most swingy class and people get pissed when you mind control them to flip the advantage in a game.  They're a class I've even taken to avoiding in arena due to me getting much better results with others, the class heavily relying on picking up mind controls and a few other choice cards, and being very weak to 4 power swarm decks that can survive a turn 5 holy nova.   Ah, gaming culture. The only time reviews are taken as truth, and aren't done by "paid shills" or are just "clickbait", is when it's a franchise the majority wants to see do well   I'm on the fence. I've heard great things about Expeditions, but I wish it wasn't a flat 6 bucks, especially when nothing else is really of interest to me. I think this is the cheapest E:C has been though, and I doubt it gets any lower than 5 bucks during winter sale (75% off).    For whatever reason the #3 receiver in Miami is the #1 receiver.  It's because they're the slot receivers, and Miami's embarrassing O line basically forces Tannehill to throw it to the short yardage guy nearly every play     Nobody is saying a tier list lets you rattle off 9-0s, but it will probably at least help out this 0-3 guy, at the very least to let him know that certain cards he's been drafting are downright unplayable   another mind control whine thread...   SylasSlays, arbiter of fun has made his decree   Fable 3 is so boring and the worst of the Fables by far. It's an ARPG that is incredibly easy, lacks variety in combat, doesn't really have much in the way of interesting mechanics. The "twist" in the game is so poorly done and feels either not thought out at all or completely unfinished.  I actually liked 1 and 2 to boot. Definitely skip it.   shelter is 1$ here along with other bundled games - www.groupees.com/bmx   None of them   Yes, I'd take the flier on Johnson   Ivory   does he really though? I'd say it's arguable, he's probably still behind deangleo and tolbert   I definitely wouldn't count on Johnson being a savior, he's pretty much a lottery ticket. Then again, the over/under for points on JStew is probably around 4, so maybe you grab Johnson and hope he breaks loose. I don't think Stewart really helps you this week or ROS   according to rotoworld, he is   No, Tate is getting the start, and ARI has a tough run D. If it were ROS I'd say yes   there will not   How can you possibly claim that when you have no idea what the mechanics of the game will be   @DavisMattek - Dennis Johnson is the best add in fantasy right now. Foster very, very out, Tate with broken ribs. Make the move.  I wouldn't go crazy dropping guys, but if you have filler on your bench, could be a nice help on your way to/during playoffs    No last hitting  I'm sure hardcore MOBA players will hate this and claim to ruin any depth the game will have, but personally I like this change a lot.      can't wait to feast on noobs in arena   Why would you even be concerned about this in an alpha build   I wouldn't call Hearthstone "blatantly pay-to-win", especially since arena mode isn't pay to win in the slightest. As for constructed, it's a CCG, what do you expect   Is the Gold Edition DLC worthwhile for someone with only the base game? I've heard mixed things about the Head Games DLC, and have been waiting on a purchase since I don't want to ruin the original. As far as I know, there is no way to play just the base game once the DLC is installed.   Why do you even need to say it in the first place?   Because it's pretty much just rubbing in the loss. Due to only having emoticons, it's hard to tell if your opponent is actually using it as "good match, you played well", or "haha, I win". I don't need to hear well played before my opponent plays his ripped pyroblast or king krush. Just play the damn card and take the win gracefully.   Arena is fine, the RNG is what makes it fun. I played a mage deck with 5 blizzards the other day. Other times I pick mage I won't even get a sniff of any board sweep.  Half the fun of playing arena is making shitty pulls work.   Saying well played before you actually go through the motions to kill them is definitely rude, yes.   They do, it's called magic online. It's still just as expensive though   Definitely really strong in arena, but doesn't need a nerf.  He does have a few downsides. Playing arena as a paladin last night, I think I got 2 free wins by hitting him with an Aldor Peacekeeper(humility also works) and leaving him alone. My opponents desperately tried to suicide him, but by the time he died it was far too late...   I mean, afterall, f2p is a misnomer because if you really want to enjoy your f2p game it typically is no longer f2p.  I'm enjoying it just fine without having spent anything   You can only de cards from expert packs   turn 1 sinister strike   It sounds like he hasn't even played it   Sure, I get that. I'm just not sure why this thread is about how Solforge is so much better than Hearthstone, because simply put, it really isn't right now.   I play both, but quite honestly (and probably unpopularly) Hearthstone is much better right now. It seems like this thread is kind of a knee jerk reaction to hating the big mainstream company, or hating a competitor of a game that we love and are invested in.  To clarify - I think they are both interesting, well made base gameplay CCGs, and I don't think that either is more fun or deep than the other. Solforge is really lacking behind Hearthstone in a lot of ways, though -  * Draft. Right now Solforge has nothing, Hearthstone has arena mode fully implemented which is very enjoyable.  * Free rewards. Both games have daily quests/rewards that are easy to complete. Hearthstone however lets you disenchant cards you don't want and allows you to essentially trade in cards for any card in the game. Solforge, you're cracking crappy free packs and crossing your fingers for a rare - maybe hoarding silver, which we have no idea what it can even be used for.  * Pay to win factor. There is a little bit in both games, but this comes back to the fact that in hearthstone you can craft anything, and only have one legendary per deck. A deck that won a recent tourney, I was able to put together in 2 days not buying anything. In Solforge, 3x legendaries seem to be practically required if you want to play something tier 1 - zimus, phoenix, ghox etc.  * Polish. Blizzard clearly has the upper hand here, Hearthstone is extremely polished, looks and feels great. Solforge has server lag, timer issues, crashes when you open packs, etc...  Maybe all of this stuff gets ironed out when Solforge finally releases some updates, but as it stands I'm playing Hearthstone most of the night, then I'll login to play my 3 quick matches in solforge and quit because there's nothing to do in the game right now.   The worst are the people who slowroll the timer every turn, period   well played   I'm fine with leaving that skillless mechanic with mtg.   Not really. Priests are pretty weak to strong 4 attack cards. Playing more of those and cutting some of your top end doesn't gimp you against the rest of the field.   You aren't running an "anti priest deck", you are just metagaming. Look at chanmanv's unleash the hounds deck - it doesnt care about mind control at all, and hey, it's still pretty strong against the rest of the field!  If you want to keep dropping ysera turn 9 and then go to reddit complaining that priests are so op, go ahead, but you aren't working very hard to actually beat them   Or, rather than complaining, you could just design your deck to not be weak against mind control? Just a thought.   subtle brag   onions make me sad - a lot of people don't realize that.   It's pretty similar.  Major Differences -  * in mtg you put land in decks, which you can play one a turn. these are essentially mana crystals. In mtg you need to think about how many land you want to put into your deck, as not drawing enough/too many will screw you - in hearthstone you just get the ideal 1 mana crystal per turn.  * In mtg you only declare you are attacking with a creature - the other player can choose to put one of their guys in front, or take the damage himself.  * In mtg you have opportunites to play spells during your opponent's turn.  These are the major differences, obviously there are plenty of other small differences but the basic gameplay is pretty similar otherwise   You can store up to 3, you get one per day   No, and to my knowledge it never will due to flash limitations. BOI:Rebirth will have controller support.  As an aside, I'm one of the few that plays BOI with controller and j2k and I don't have any problems. I like it a lot more than KB   Can somebody give me a quick sales pitch for someone that doesn't know all that much about this game?   I don't think that's true for Halloween sale   MTG bans cards, invalidating entire deck archetypes and making other cards worthless in the process. Welcome to CCGs!   You can't report them, but they clearly need to implement a time bank or something. It's immature children grasping for a way to troll someone in a game where nearly every method has been prevented.  It is incredibly annoying to play against, especially when you only have so much time to play, and end up using 45 minutes of your time because your opponent has no life and nothing better to do.   Waiting until the timer runs down to one second every turn isn't strategic, it's just being a dick   It's a beta   can you start an arena, exit the game before you get your 3 losses, and continue the next day?         Looking for a time killer team to add to my other two, nothing serious. It appears Yahoo doesn't have signups for midseason/redraft. Am I just missing it?

If Wilson goose eggs me, I lose my top WR but I can hope Gordon/Blackmon/Harvin fill the void when they each respectively get back. Thanks for your help in advance   14 team Standard non PPR. I need to bench one guy, got ravaged last week with Miller and Wilson giving me duds.  2 RB/2 WR/1 FLEX, CJ2K is locked in by default as my RB1, giving me 4 spots for 5 guys.  Which do I bench out of:  WR: Edelman, Austin, Shorts RB: Wilson, Miller  Thanks   I just drafted a 14 team league non-PPR, (1 QB 2 RB 2 WR 1 TE 1 FLEX 1 PK 1 TD), and am projected for a close week 1 matchup - within a point of yahoo projections. My defense is GB, playing SF. I'm not sure if GB has any value making it worth it to hold onto them, or if I should drop them and pick up a highly projected defense this week and each week after.  I'm looking at a few available -   * WAS vs PHI * KC vs JAX  * IND vs OAK * CLE vs MIA  I also could drop a bench player for a fill-in defense this week - likely Tannehill, but there are very few backup QBs available - Even EJ and Pryor are gone, leaving Geno, Ponder, and Henne/Gabbert as the only active QBs currently available if Tannehill gets scooped up.  My team for reference -  * QB -Andrew Luck, Ryan Tannehill * RB -Trent Richardson, Steven Jackson, Reggie Bush, Ronnie Hillman * TE - Jermichael Finley, Dwayne Allen * WR - Antonio Brown, Miles Austin, Kenny Britt, Josh Gordon, Justin Blackmon * PK - Randy Bullock * TD - Green Bay Packers   What do you guys think?   I'm new to the game(FE:LH), picked it up during summer sale. I feel I get most of the mechanics but this is bugging me. Just looking to hear if there is a concensus, as once I start to get many hero units, it becomes slightly overwhelming.  - I generally keep a hero unit in each of my cities to defend it. My cities are protected, but my unit never levels up unless the city is heavily attacked, which is very rare. Is this smart, or should I just use basic forces like militias to defend?  - Is it wise to put multiple hero units in one army? Does this cause exp degradation? I generally don't do this, but will often combine heroes if I want to make an assault on a city early (for example in the first scenario, I used my sovereign, jormur the giant, and the giant golem you get from the quest...didn't even initially realize they were hero units)  - Should your heroes all just be wandering and exploring the map? Any other advice?  Thanks in advance.   I'm new to the game, picked it up during summer sale. I feel I get most of the mechanics but this is bugging me.

Any other advice?  Thanks in advance.      I just received a new 3DS with Fire Emblem Awakening for father's day. What games are must haves for the system? A few things to keep in mind, I know noone else with a 3DS so multiplayer centric games like Animal Crossing don't interest me that much. I generally have a broad taste in games, but particularly like:  RPGs, roguelikes, strategy games, metroidvanias, and indie games. I have a huge game backlog, so I don't really need recommendations of mediocre games (Castlevania for example - not sure if it is mediocre or not but the reviews didn't look very favorable.)  Thanks!   [link](http://www.Groupees.com/bm8)  Unlocked at 28000               The game looks cool, seems like Robotron 2084 with upgrades and a makeover. Does this play pretty tight for a twinstick shooter? Alternatively, are other games from this dev (Puppy Games) worth looking into?   I know literally nothing of the series, or the quality of the ports to PC. Older graphics won't turn me off, but is the gameplay dated? Any insight to the series is appreciated. They're currently on sale 2.50 each, 6.25 for the bundle on steam.   My friends and I saw this late one night on VH1, and now I can't find it. It definitely had a music video, but so far searches have gotten me nothing. Thanks   Sega game, most likely genesis or sega cd, early 90s - A ship crosses the ocean, the oars move fast to an upbeat tune. The ship is black I believe. The battle system is on a green field and the enemy is on the other side, it's more than one bad guy. And there are red X's and O's. Black dragons were also involved somehow.  Edit: we figured it out, King's Bounty for Genesis       This game is a updated version of a free flash game on adultswim.com, just recently released on steam. The basic idea of the game is that you are a badass ninja who starts on floor 350 of a tower and descends to the bottom, fighting enemies and bosses at set levels as you go down. The game is procedurally generated and has permadeath of sorts (5 health that is upgradable, 2 continues), so the replayability of the game is very high.  The game is challenging without feeling impossible. It is similar to Dark Souls in the way of once you learn aspects of the game, you begin to breeze through parts that were once stopping blocks. The game to me plays like an amalgamation of NES Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man X, Super Meat Boy, and Hotline Miami, with lots of bits of other games sprinkled in.  Each kill increases a rage meter, which gives you temporary invincibility when it's filled, but is always going down. This increases your score as well, so you are encouraged to go quickly. If you've played Hotline Miami and know the feeling when you get into the zen state where everything works out, that is this game at its best when you are destroying enemies left and right, jumping over spike pits, and clearing 100+ floors without taking a hit.  Along with being procedurally generated, there are tons of unlocks to strive to get, and they greatly vary the play experience and increase replayability. There are 10+ different unlockable choices for each weapon of your starting loadout - weapon, ranged weapon, bomb, and magic(4 choices for magic). Getting tired of katana/shurikens? Play through with a whip/axe instead for a Castlevania throwback. You also can unlock various things like increased item limits, item pickups, and cosmetic changes. Probably 100 unlocks in all.  The sound in the game is great, and the visuals are crisp and look great even when you're racing through the levels. This is a game I picked up on a whim and I've found to be an absolute gem. At less than 5 bucks right now, it is definitely a steal, highly recommended.      It is currently on sale for 2.50 on steam, but I'm more concerned if it's worth my time than the money, as my time to game is becoming scarce.  I don't know much about the game, but enjoy the rpg/srpg genre. I am cool with old school as well, have played and enjoyed baldurs gate, planescape, avernum, etc, though I play many games from a wide variety of genres. Thanks!               Currently on sale at 50% as a steam flash deal. Curious if I should buy the entire bundle, certain games, or none at all. I'm worried that this is a series that hasn't aged well, but know very little of any of the games.   I just picked this game up, and have read a few guides, but there are still a few things I don't understand. I started a new game in Dublin.  One of the first things I did was to create the title of duke of meath once i had the gold. However, I noticed doing so changed my succesion laws from primogeniture to gavelkind, which was annoying as my initial ruler died to illness almost immediately, so I could not change it. Why did the succession laws change?  Secondly, after getting a CB on Kildare, i gathered my armies and attacked. Still not exactly sure how war works. I defeated their main army, and sieged their town. Do I want to press the button that says (paraphrasing) press the attack but risk more casualties? Or do I just sit there and build war score until i get a surrender?  Finally, once i get the surrender, I noticed the guy is still in charge of kildare but it's in my holdings. Should i tax him? Revoke his title? Imprison him? It seemed somewhat counterintuitive to me that the territory i just captured won't be making me any gold.   Thank you all for taking the time to help me out.   Looking for something fun to pass the time - I'm a big gamer, and my wife is no stranger to gaming either, but not as hardcore.  We have been looking for something fun on emulator (nes/snes/genesis), but can't find much that isn't a button mashing beat em up. Next gen suggestions are ok too, as well as pc.

Going to an fnm draft tonight, Any tips on drafting this set? Colors to push/avoid, speed of the set, availability of removal, underrated/overrated cards, and specific synergies would be helpful.

I'm leaning towards UW delver or a controllish build (UB?), but I figure a lot of you could tell me which decks are tier 1-2, which are on the rise/fall, etc. Thanks!           	132
                                                          I noticed it a lot in Skyrim and have been seeing it all over the web in recent years.  Example:  Boy: I'm off to school Mom. Mom: Ok, don't forget to bring a packed lunch.  When it should be like this:  Boy: I'm off to school Mom. Mom: Don't forget to take a packed lucnh.  If you're talking to someone and you're asking them to take something from where you are to somewhere else the word take should be used. If you're talking to someone and you want them to bring something to your current location the word bring should be used. I don't understand the misuse.                                             It just seems logical. So much quicker, plus you don't have to remember/write down your passwords and such.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I'm literally angry with rage right now.  I love Gears of War. Easily the best part about it in my opinion is Horde mode. It's the mode me and my mate spent the most time playing in Gears 2 and Gears 3. Now all of a sudden they've removed for some unknown reason.  And to add insult to injury the game is shipping with only 4 COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MAPS!!!!!! Gears 3 shipped with 10 for fuck's sake. I have been lookin gfor ward to this game for so damn long and now my dreams have been dashed against the rocks of bitterness. Sure I'll still play the campaign and a bit of overrun mode and miltuplayer but the main draw is gone.  I know for a fact that if I hadn't pre-ordered this game weeks ago I sure as heel wouldn't be buying it now.  Way to royally fuck things up People Can Fly.  Anyone else disappointed by this news?                                                                                                               I personally don't really mind. Most of my games are on disc but I have a couple of dozen games downloaded from Xbox LIVE and PSN. I would probably be sad when the time comes that games no longer come on a physical medium but I will understand that it's been made redundant.                                       Please don't downvote people for their opinions, unless they word them in a scumbag kind if way.   Personally I hate Gangnam Style and Harlem Shake videos. I just genuinely don't see the appeal of either and am befuddled as to why they are so popular.   Your turn...                                                                                   	198

 Also, large cities in China are targeted for hydrogen bomb drops.  Civilian populations are directly targeted, and Shanghai and Beijing are reduced to radioactive rubble several times over.  Fields and rice patties are targeted for massive bombing campaigns with napalm, and WP bombs.  The USA attacks DPRK, and China with the full force of the military, and we do not relent until they are pounded into complete and utter devastation and defeat.      He refuses to make any more televised appearances, and does not give a farewell address on his last day.  He simply leaves when the new president arrives at the office.  No fanfare, nothing.  His term is done.  He gets on Executive 1, and departs without a word to the media.   Such as on American TV, they can't even say "piss", "shit" "damned", "hell", or "bastard" without getting bleeped out, and if you say "the lord's name in vain in public, you'll get dirty looks.  But on British TV that I watch, (yes, it's BBC News, and BBC America), they don't seem to care at all.  They'll use them all day long, and nobody gives a shit.  Australlian TV is even more liberal.  They even include the heavy cuss words like "fuck" and "cunt".  So what's up with the cultural differences?  Why are Americans so puritanicall with language, and don't seem to realize that saying "gosh dang it" is just G rated substitution for "god damn it", and "Shut the front door!" is a substitute for "Shut the fuck up!"?  Everybody knows what is being said.  But some words have magical offending properties, while others do not.   Please explain.  **EDIT:**  I'm surprised "douchebag" is allowed on TV, and "ass" and "hole" are, but "asshole" is not, (on American TV).

On every application from Speedtest to downloading on Chrome, the speeds are consistent with my home Wi-Fi connection at 50Mbps.    However, when I fire up Google Play, the download speeds are measured in Kb, forget about Mbps.  It works in everything else, except for Google Play.  It's slow enough, that updating something 20MB in size takes about 45 minutes.        Is there an official ROM for this yet, or is it still a waiting game?  Also, what would happen if I tried to push "Blur_Version.220.21.28.falcon_umtsds.AsiaRetail.en.03.zip" to the USA version?  Would it make any difference as far as the baseband is concerned?  Would it nuke the phone?                                                         I tried DD-WRT, but now I run Tomato v26RT-N.  It works fine, but I'm wondering if there are any more OSes that are supported on the e1000 router.                                          Also, what would they think/say if a person said something like:  "Probably living in a 40 year old doublewide trailer, using kerosene for heat, and propane and wood for cooking. Still working for below minimum wage, and using a generator backed up by a UPS, solar, wind, and a bank of car batteries; for the minimal electricity I need to survive."                  My cat somehow figured out how to fire up WMP, and start up my play list.  Fucking rude awakening, but at least it wasn't a bad song.  I was just clueless on how it got fired up until I closed all of my browser windows.               Mildly fucked up at work today. Was cashiering, and I put all of their merchandise back in the buggy since I was running out of bags. She asked, "Where's my shit?" So I said back, "I put all your shit back in the buggy. I mean stuff. I put your stuff back in the buggy. Oops, sorry about that." She laughed, and didn't care that I slipped up. I think because she started using cuss words first, so I just responded how I naturally would.                                                            Some have wheels and a handle, others dont?  What the fuck are these things called?                                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUHDYlJHaOQ  Done over the store intercom.  What happens?         I don't care if it's in Pullman or Moscow, (I work in Moscow though).  I would LIKE a 2bdrm 1 ba (1 for my bedroom, one for a shop/cat room). But a 1bdrm 1 ba would be adequate.  (Yes, I want the cat to have her own room).  Bedrooms are typically fine with the lighting in every place I've had, but I like natural light in the kitchen and bathroom.  (save on energy bills).  It must be pet friendly.  Are there apartments like that around here?  I have one cat.    Glendimier would suit me, but I don't like that the bathroom doesn't appear to have a fart fan, or any natural lighting, and the kitchen doesn't have any natural lighting.  What options do I have around here?                                                                     I fixed the errors I was getting with Windows Update by completly removing Microsoft Office.  WU works fine now, but now I cannot install MSO 2013 on my computer.  The installer launches, but then hangs and force closes.  Is there a way to make it install?  EDIT:  MSO 2010 won't install either, but LibreOffice installed, (and runs) fine.                                                          I've got it almost perfect to [how I want it](http://i.imgur.com/qz8zv9p.png), but I still want the old right click menu back.  How do I go about doing this?                        Here's mine:  **Phone:** Samsung SGS III International i9300  **Recovery:** TWRP 2.8.5.0  **ROM:** CyanogenMod 12 for i9300  **Firmware:** 5.0.2  **Baseband:** UBUGNK1  **Bootloader:** UBUGNL1  **Kernel:** 3.0.101 Boeffla-Kernel-3.0-alpha9-CM12-NG-i9300-20150130@andip71 #1  **O/C Level:** 1600 MHz  **Media Card:** Samsung 64GB Class 10 MicroSDHC  **Battery:** 7000 mAh ZeroLemon                  Went to WM to get soda and dinner, and went through the self-checkout. Those machines are SLOW! I was trying to haul ass like I do at work, but I was faster than the damned machine. It's like they design it for people who don't know what the hell they are doing, and have no realistic expectations of speed.  They need to crank up the response time of those machines. I hate going slow in the checkout lane. Cashiering at WM has taught me how to haul ass doing it, and having to slow down because the machine can't keep up is annoying!                                 I know like 3 "phrases" in ASL, (4 if you count the middle finger), but in "universal sign language", language barriers simply don't seem to matter.  While I know not *exactly* what is trying to be communicated, I can get the gist of it.  So why was ASL ever formed in the first place, since "universal sign language" works fine 90+% of the time?                                                                     Looking for a new job. No I didn't get canned. I still have the job for as long as I want it, (realistically). I'm just getting tired of the irregular shifts, the inadequate hours, having to schedule myself, and dumb-ass customers who don't know where a buggy is even if I hit them in the ass with it. I've filled out a job app, and I'm wanting out of WM.  If I had 40+ per week, with a regular schedule, and didn't have to do 5 GOD DAMNED JOBS just to get SOMETIMES CLOSE to 40 hours a week, If I didn't have to work 6 days a week, and if I didn't have an irregular schedule, I would LOVE WM! But all of those things haven't happened, so I'm looking for new work.  If I'm successful in getting the job that I'm now applying for, I will like it better than WM. I'll be working M-F, with a REGULAR SCHEDULE and A REGULAR WEEKEND! I WANT THIS JOB! I'm getting sick of retail. Realistically, I'm getting tired of the shitty work situation. I'll give them a 3 week's notice, because I want to finish out my schedule, and give them adequate time to hire my replacement.  To quit immediately would be rude, and I would burn more bridges than it's worth. If I do get this job, it will be the first job I quit in my adult life, instead of getting fired from it. I just want out. I want a regular job, with a regular schedule, doing a regular job. I'm tired of working 5 jobs at 1 employer just to get CLOSE to 40 hours. I also miss O/T. Can't do that at WM!  A lot has changed in 10 years. The last time I worked at WM, I could put in 70 hour weeks, and nobody cared. Now, if I get 40.03 hours, I get a verbal warning to watch the clock. Can't do it. Can't work over 40, or I get my ass chewed. Sick of it. I want out.            Not to keep people in, but to keep people out.  There is a 1KM wide "No Man's Land", and there are landmines, attack dogs, automatically firing machine guns hooked up to motion sensors, armed drones, and border guards are told to "take no prisoners, but shoot on site any intruders".  We use the technology developed by the DDR and current DMZ in Korea to make an impenetrable border.            They also set off an atom bomb at the base of Hoover Dam, and blast it into non-existence.  What happens now?        	200
 WOW...I didn't know that Batman's costume looked that bad. He looks like a chode of some sort TBH   I'd give Alan Watts a chance. Check out a video on youtube. He's a modern philosopher like I've never seen before but then again I don't know many philosophers other than Socrates and his pupils   Not necessarily, if you eat more then you have to get rid of the waste products that you're body doesn't use and if you eat more then you are bound to have to poop more. So technically, a thinner person can poop more but on average the bigger person will expell more fecal matter.   No   Oreo is definitely one of the biggest cookie companies in the U.S. There are a ton more (We are capitalist after all) like Chips Ahoy, Mother's cookies, Famous Amous just to name a few. Oh and you probably already know that biscuits=cookies in the states.   I want to say no, but he might be that to you so idk   Okay??? Just because he had a vice, like us all, doesn't mean his philosophies are not valid.    Go listen to Alan Watts and his philosophy on life...Your Welcome.   Because the man gave us 'College Dropout' and 'Late Registration'.   I'd keep my lights off so that he/she doesn't have an easy time looking inside the house from outside.    Not bad at all man. Keep it up! I make [music] (https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/intoxicated) too!   People will always go for easy karma. I for one, think people should boycott reddit gold.   If you say moral of the story is to not listen to a redditor's advice but you, a redditor, tell me not to....WTF   In PKA 132, Woody claimed to have a MMA fighter guest who fought a chimp lined up. Did he ever follow through getting this guest? I personally don't remember this ever being brought back up.   Ohhh. Yeah, she wasn't a very good guest. I remember her saying something like "People come to watch my streams for gameplay" and then I saw her twitter feed...And was like BULLSHIT https://twitter.com/MystikGunn/status/489593547062927361   Well, thats a pretty boring answer. Was she asked this before?   They've talked about this before but it was a guy who payed something like court fees or maybe a ticket in pennies. Don't know what episode sorry :(   I know, Lot of ways you could go with this    If I Only Had 24 Hours I Would...   Get off your fucking phone in the movie theaters! I don't give half a shit if you so much so desire to snapchat that you are watching Jurassic World, hoping on the inside that your friends are jealous that you are having fun.    Thank you so much for this post!   I guess you're Australian now mate :)   Just...Wow      I've put in a ton of work finding samples (mostly on youtube). I was just trying to get some new artists or songs that I might not have heard before! Thanks for the input!   Im 16 y/o, I make hiphop instrumentals and whatnot, I am running out of samples and I was wanting a challenge or even just some suggestions. I'd prefer ambient, chillwave, downtempo, soul, disco, or rnb samples, although any suggestion would be great!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tniZ20PbWRQ  Not sure why the link wasn't working in the text. SKIP TO 0:20       Not sure if you need a song? but I make beats and if you like it then let me know. https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/demons   I am currently 16 but when I was 14 I was in a similar situation. Try FL Studio's free demo. I used that for a year. Save your projects and export them all you want! You just can't re-open saved projects after closing the program :(   Simple Kick on every fourth beat, a oldschool hat, and a clap. Not my genre per-say (  I'm 16) but its just a simple drum loop over a sample. I could re-create it in like 2 minutes. Sorry, but I don't know what exactly you are asking.   I'm not an expert, just a 16 y/o hiphop music producer, and I use samples a TON, but I think the situation varies on who you are sampling. If you can get into contact with the creator of the sample source, he/she can give you permission to use the sample for free or they might charge you/want a cut for the use of their artistry. If you're releasing this for monetary gains, usually the label would take care of sample clearance but I'm not sure if thats possibility in your situation or not.   What episode was it discussed? I consider myself a PKA Historian but I don't recall when this was discussed. Time stamp would be great, episode number would be good too!      I'm no PKA veteran but,my experience is that, Woody pronounces Liam Neeson correctly nearly everytime he attempts to on the show.   Can't wait to see how the Punisher is gonna be in Season 2!  	36
 they're selling chocolat   needs more trundle    valid point, wp rpeet   my post was obviously meant to be taken with a grain of salt, I knew pr0lly would never read this   I got dumpstered by a Fizz, then bought him as my first champ and dumpstered on other people because of his high burst. Then I began to systematically branch out and tried to pick 1-2 champs for each role. I would experiment on specials champs or I'd play ARAM so i'd be forced to mess around with different champs even though it was still an ARAM. I also began to main Pantheon in the jungle when he was stronger and got quite good with him. So basically I think it comes down to enjoyment. I'm sure you've read about people maining an unpopular champ and getting into diamond or other divisions. So if you pick a champ that you enjoy playing then you should main that in my opinion.   There are plenty of good youtube videos directed at new players that will give you a bunch of general knowledge to help you as you learn the game  edit: damn why the downvote :'(      Can someone TL;DR pls? lol   Nasus is really reliant on farm, more so than any other top laner. The current meta denies cs to the top laner. If it takes about 20-25 minutes for a Solo queue nasus to become relevant with easy farming. It would be too late for nasus in LCS gameplay   LeBron James Lucian will be a thing, Softball pitcher Syndra, and Hockey Goalie Shen   Circuit City   People **ALWAYS** find something to bitch about   Master Yi   Jax   I liked when they won the baron fight and Amazing yelled "TSM!" pretty funny and troll   Well in my opinion, football is better than a computer game   I was a little surprised at first, but defo approve   Brazil's pick/ban phase for the PK's was the difference maker   IT'S A DATE  EDIT: DAMN IT   I saw this on reddit a couple days ago and I agree. It was a post about how it was embarrassing that the LoL client was so out of date, that 3rd party organizations have created clients that are far superior.   You made a lot of good points, and I appreciate you're really thoughtful insight. About your point on buyouts. I wasn't necessarily suggesting a company buyout. We both acknowledge that Riot more or less has a monopoly on the MOBA market, aside from Dota2 being the only competitor which really can be seen as negligible in my opinion.   You're also right to point out that I was basically asking for LoL with Riot that makes little to no mistakes. I was just trying to think about games I know that have risen to popularity in the gaming scene. My first real experience with the gaming scene was with Halo 2 back around 2007-ish at the beginning of Halo 3.  Halo dipped because of their own shortcomings, but rose to prominence? Call of Duty in the First Person Shooter genre. Which was always in my opinion, a simplified Halo. So I was thinking that simpler is always better for gamers. Whether that be because of people's attention span or something else.  I don't think we'll see a change in the foreseeable future.   Good looking girl with some self-respect, but not enough *personality.* See you on the second page.   This is purely a skeptical post to talk about the current state of affairs and *professionalism* of Riot.  I'm not creating this solely because of the recent Korean uproar, but it definitely served as an impetus for me to finally put this out to the community.   In my personal opinion, I think Riot is setting the stage to be over taken as the world's largest MOBA and competitive gaming scene. Not within the next year or even the next few years, but eventually I think their mishaps will culminate to their downfall. I believe this is because of how they conduct their interactions with the community and how whimsically they conduct the professional scene.  **FIRST**  I will first talk about the community interactions and secondly about the professional scene.  Riot has historically been a company that interacts largely with it's players and with positive results. I don't wish to talk about Riot-to-player interaction because I don't have any problems with the way those situations are handled. But the thing that they fail to do is live up to their promises. These promises include client updates, champion releases, VUs, reworks, etc. Things are promised and aren't really delivered as expected, hence the popular soon^TM when upcoming releases are discussed. To me, this is unprofessional, however, Riot never gives a date or timeframe for their releases which allows them all the flexibility in the world so that they don't back themselves into a corner. This is the general gist of the unprofessionalism without going to much further.  **SECOND**  The second topic was about Riot's conduction of the professional and perhaps the most astounding one to me.  I think Riot aren't doing themselves any favors with the way they reprehensibly plan their events. Most notably: * Korean *miscommunication* about the location of Worlds * Treatment of Gambit with the London LCS event * Replay of LCS game because of Aatrox bug  This is just a short laundry list to exemplify in major ways that Riot is failing it's fanbase and perhaps it's most famous players.  **My thoughts to the problems**  For the first topic, I'm a little bit more forgiving because complications in testing and designing are a necessity when aiming for perfection. However, where is the line drawn with how much leniency Riot gets after they make promises.  The second topic, however, just can't happen in a professional setting. As a major gaming company, you can absolutely not allow these mistakes to happen. Poor planning and unfair treatment of your own teams resonates deeply in me and cannot happen.  **RIOT ISN'T EVIL**  Now this may be completely unfair of me so lets talk about the great things about what Riot has done professionally.  NA   EU LCS are streamed for free in a professional setting, Free game, many compassionate employees that care about making the game better, and **FREE GAME**  **REPLACEMENT?**  Now what would it take to usurp Riot at the top of the totem pole? It simply comes down to money in my opinion. Riot has generated so much money and invested so much money into this scene, that it would take a great sum of money to topple Riot. Dota 2 turns off fans because it is seen as a more complex MOBA that can be unforgiving. LoL holds your hand as your learn, its pretty simplistic and can be learned within a couple weeks.   So I think it would take a new MOBA that was as simple as LoL to learn, instilled many of the elements that LoL has, and most importantly, can offer **money** to tournament teams as prize money. Money used to advertise the brand and money to pay the best employees with knowledgeable MOBA experience.  **TL;DR**  * Riot doesn't deliver on promises that are generally advertised earlier * Riot mishandles professional teams and events * Riot is obviously still a great company, that has obvious room for improvement * Would take bookoo bucks to usurp Riot   **Again, these are just some general thoughts of mine! I wish to only stimulate conversation and kind of bounce thoughts off the reddit community. Thank you for your time! CRITICISM OF ALL KINDS IS APPRECIATED, TRY TO KEEP IT RESPECTFUL**   Been playing a couple games now, out of Georgia, no problems   You're literally too dumb to insult.   197204 not divisible by 3 #math   *xpekt      Also for clarification, he wasn't absolutely being forced by the NBA to sell the team. It would go through a vote of owners to decide his fate, but even then would go through countless legal proceedings because the team is his property. And you can't force someone to sell their property, pretty unconstitutional.    QTPie Plays without shoes, legendary.   Pretty pissed that Susan Li wasn't the interview translator, because she's my girlllllll. But it is awesome to see XWX's progress with speaking in English.   It would be hilarious, no doubt.   agreed   Cosplay is dumb   terrorist   I was in Baltimore once when there was an anime/cosplay thing going on. I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for them as they walked around the city in 90 degree weather looking like jackasses. AND Yes I have tried it, It's called Halloween.   "Turtle has me as his spa planner"- Dyrus , turn on captions    I hate cosplay. I think it's for weird shut-ins.   Race war Old Michael Jackson vs Young Michael Jackson   URF pls   Thanks guys   When is it going to be enabled? I'm only posting this because I couldn't find any other posts about it for the NA server    Loco is annoying as fuck   The kid he called was 17 I think xD. I couldn't make out all of the conversation, and only caught bits and pieces. I heard something about him being a prince or some shit. There are a lot of pro streamers that don't have quite the popularity as other streamers. So maybe it'd be easier to get an interview with them.   Well some dude was just watching Imaqtpie and donated a bunch of money, and then qt got his number and called him. It was pretty tubular so maybe if you have 250 quid lyin around.   Kaceytron   I've played soccer my entire life. Silent matches - super gay   At the beginning of a game once, a Brand ran straight to the mid turret and suicided. Afterwards, everyone was spamming their own versions of "WTF LOL" and after a brief pause. Brand says, "Gotta get them turret hits" Wiser words have never been said.   Sharon, this is my formal invite to a date at Subway, pls accept   Official LMQ fan after that interview   Hai needs to get rid of douchebaggery (e.g. tool haircut   earrings)      Im usually a big fan of mustaches, but bubbadub... shave that shit son   Well that was informative... *Stops video after 5 seconds to go find curlychan on twitter*    I've definitely said some bannable things, but I haven't been chat restricted. Not necessarily raging, more or less I've said things in jest. Essentially my point is, system seems incredibly broken.   FINALLY HECARIMJOB!   WHERE THE FUCK IS HECARIMJOB?   Boring people do boring things. Simple.   Just Main Street   Is lich bane still the best item to build first on Fizz? Or is there a better item?   If the LoL/esports community needs to call on the fans to make a Hall of Fame, then it doesn't deserve one. To have a hall of fame, it requires tradition, this game hasn't been around long enough to prove it deserves something as prestigious as a HoF. Just an opinion.  It should also be created by the governing body (Riot) to preserve the integrity of the Hall.   Only word I understood was 'Fuck'   If I play mid I always play Fizz if he's open (he's my main). However, I don't know what to build first with the recent Lich Bane changes. Is this still the best item to rush? Another question of mine is, who are the best AP junglers? I'm not good enough to play Elise, Fidd is too situational, and Evelynn is more AD than AP.   You're seriously put-off by some champions (a digital character) taunting? Damn dude, would hate to see you get tea-bagged on Halo. You can also keep the pentakill because it's extremely rewarding and badass. I've never seen someone steal a penta then have a teammate ragequit/grief. Why have equal portraits either? This is an extremely soft view you're taking, I'm sorry.             The only point that I really agree with is the "all chat". Because that is essentially useless in 100% of the cases. There is nothing that you can communicate with the opponent that can help you out. It usually stems from playful joking from 0-1:55, then after that its nothing important from 1:55-end.    Heres the tiers in my opinion,    Riot  ESPN  British Football Commentators, those lads are brilliant over there across the pond.   RIP headphone users, fuck    Came for the prospect of Iker playing League, left disappointed    I know it's your body and not my decision in the slightest. But come on man, do you really want a LoL champion tattooed, the game probably won't survive 5-10 more years. Commence my down votes.   Yeah I'm totally disregarding that comment, athlete sports take a level of intelligence in their own right   Seems like the problem lies within riot and not the fans. With the amount of cameras they have, the commentators could announce it remotely in the next room over without missing a beat. I will admit that league does involve a precedent never seen before in sports. This precedent is that live commentary is actually a necessity for the fans. Seems weird to think about goin to a football game and have an analyst over the speaker the entire time.   So I'll preface this, like I did in my title, that I'm a long time sports fan before I ever got into e-sports. There is an unusual thing that I'm seeing with the e-sports fans. There seems to be factions forming about how fans should be cheering and other etiquette issues, which is foreign to me. Maybe it's just because I support Philadelphia sports teams that have some of the harshest fans that made me like this. But I say that fans cheering and being loud is all a part of the game and it's the atmosphere that riot should want to generate energy in the building. Now I don't think fans should be able to call out opponents positions or if the other team is baroning. In the real sports world there are unfair conditions, home field advantage, etc that can swing games, but it's a part of the game. Fans do whatever they can, within reason, to help their team win.  TLDR; If you want to accept the popularity of the growing sport and help keep the exciting atmosphere, then accept what real sports atmospheres are really like.   I hate cosplay and think it's one of the most awkward things I could ever witness. If I'm ever fortunate to have kids some day, I'd rather walk in on them beating off than have them dressed as a league character and dancing To make a YouTube video.   Vel'koz is the Flying Spaghetti Monster, what an awesome skin idea concept! Anyone?   CFC CHECLSEA!!!   Yet again I can't play Hecarim even once! Rito plox! D:   Does that yellow show up on their screen too?   Can I just have a quick clarification for Evelynn's stealth? When I'm around my opponent, the eye above them is gold. Does that mean that they know that I'm around, they just don't know where exactly? And when it turns red, it means they can full on see me. I just want to make sure I watch for this as I learn to jungle eve.   Yeah this helps, thank you. I know what you mean about the trouble with some mids picking AD assassin champs like a talon or zed. I don't have a very deep jungling champion pool. I keep it to panth, j4, and fidd. I'm still trying to learn eve, but I think Elise might be above my skillcap to use her well.    When I'm picking a jungler, is it right for me to want to keep a balance between the AD and AP on my team? So lets just assume that mid is AP, bot is AD with an AP support. If my top picks an AD champ, do i always wanna go with an AP jungler, and vice versa? I realize that it is in a sense situational and it depends on my team comp. I'm just kind of looking for a general rule of thumb for know which junglers to pick, given a team comp.   I feel embarrassed that this dude was wearing that in public.    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand another week without Hecarim   If it happens in real professional sports, its even more definite to happen for League Of Legends. Since English isn't your first language, this analogy might not be very effective. However, for basketball, Kobe Bryant (Famous  dude) this year was almost voted an All-Star despite being injured for pretty much the entire season and not having any stellar performances.   If you check his right ear, ya missed a spot.   Riot's own Vitruvian Man   What happens when Vel'koz gets The Lantern   I feel the exact same way man. It's been well documented that the toxicity of the LoL community is pretty great. I see posts all the time about these issues and it happens to me all the time too. I actually almost considered quitting the game entirely because I was amazed at how selfish most players are. Reminding people to be nice to other people, and remember who is actually behind the computer screen doesn't really work. In theory its great, and practical, but its so easy to be angry. So really the only way to make great environments for playing is for riot to take drastic action, and place all the trolls together. But they've already stated that they won't do that, so don't hold your breath for any changes in the ranked environment any time soon. Essentially the only time I feel like I'm in a relaxed environment is when I'm in normals, and the result of the match doesn't really matter to me. So good luck in trying to get out of bronze and thence forward. :)   Ever since I started playing about 7 months ago or so I always saw Hecarim as a badass. However, he hasn't been free since I've started playing and I think 6300IP is too expensive to try him out. Hecarim I want to try you please come out and play! D:    Out of the 5 or so best junglers currently in the meta, which have the best level 1-3? And which counter each other so you know whether to invade or not?   Why have game modes been playable for a week or so and then removed? Why not give players the options to play a variety of different game modes? Seems interesting that they keep a game mode like dominion, yet neglect game modes that get a lot of traffic. Maybe, there are server issues and it becomes just too hard for Riot to keep all these game modes functioning simultaneously. Does anyone know an actual reason or do they just like to keep things fresh and new? Thanks!   Plus his eye is basically an extra pink ward if you look at it. OP   Ah, those were all very good points to be made. Especially the time zone one, since I live on the east coast and the time I play before bed, could be the time that someone on the west coast just ate dinner.   I was just making an observation and this is in no way a definite truth, but I feel like I win more games during the night time. And this is independent of what day of the week it is. So I began to wonder what the cause might be. Is it that I just am more relaxed and focused to play before I go to sleep? Am I just at an awkward ELO that it's hard for be to be too consistent? Now before I make my main point, I'd like to preface that I'm over 18 years old :P. But could I have a better win percentage because at night I'm more likely to play with other players of my age demographic? Since I wouldn't be playing with younger players, is there a less chance of having ? I realize that this is completely different than the 65-year old trying to text and just being completely confused by a younger generation. But could this age gap with my teammates during the day be causing me to lose more? I also want to point out that I'm not trying to condescend to younger players that are better than me ha. However, is there a point to made? Please let me know if you find this interesting or if I'm just seeing things that aren't there. Thank you.  	91
 Well there is certainly no rush!  I'm just thrilled that you're working on it.  Can't wait to hear what you've come up with!   I love his tummy spot -- perfect for scratching and kisses!  I had a rat as well, who is no longer with us, but rats are awesome!   This is my plan B career.   Tongue is one of my favorite foods.  This ad makes me wish I could go to the store RIGHT NOW and buy some.  No joke.   I cannot upvote this enough.  Huzzah for you!   Please do!  Apollo is sitting here with me right now, and it's just so...quiet.  If only there was some sort of song playing... ;)   I noticed that too!  I'm guess that since the horse in question was a yearling, they are using the term "pony" incorrectly to mean a young horse.  Do some research people!   Oh I do hope it is!  Thank you!!!   Thank you GreivisIsGod!  Glad people are getting excited about this.  Maybe I'll get several submissions and Apollo can have different themes depending on his mood. :D   Maybe you can team up with someone?  You could do the words and music, and they could sing it for you?  Heck, even if you can't sing well, do it anyway!  Silly songs don't need perfect voices!   The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!  First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp  Now, some Apollo facts:  - I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.  - Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.  - According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.  - He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.  - He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.  This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D  Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.  Edit: formatting   Thanks!  I shall cross post as suggested.   That is excellent!  Thanks for the info.  Also, I upvote this not just for the help, but also for the hilarious name of the website.   This is so exciting, yokaishingami!  Thank you!

Let me raid my closet and see what I can find for you.     They are all so cute!   How exactly do you get out there?   I feel for you.  This March I got some bad sunburn while wearing an earflap hat and large sunglasses.  It looked...interesting.   My friend is going to have a boy in August!  She and her husband aren't terribly "in need", but they are grad students, so things aren't all sunshine and lollypops either!  Can you message me your email address and I can put them in contact with you if they are interested?  They aren't Redditors.   The Bulldog, either in St. Paul or NE Minneapolis.  Super tater tots too!   Thanks for the info you guys!  I didn't have much time to look around while I was at the show, but I did get to the American Saddlebred Museum and the Barn of Champions (got to meet Cigar!).  It was a great show venue and we had a great show!  Check it out: https://www.shaneshifletphoto.com/dspProofImage.asp?width=1210 show=2011%20Bluegrass%20Morgan\Saturday%20Morning\128%20-%20Hunter%20Pleasure%2C%20Ladies%2C%20Championship image=128-061-11BM.JPG    Hmmm...I find this silly.   How does 143 mean I love you?   Ah!  SQUEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!   Nice outfit, Riblet!  Also, GREAT dog name, knaps!   Your daughter is seriously cute.  Cutest kid I've seen in a long time!   I hope you guys do this again another time.  I'm out of town this week, but I'd love to bring my dog at some point!   Thanks for the info.  I'm going for the Bluegrass Morgan Classic -- I know there are several shows going on at the same time at the Horse Park this weekend.  There is going to be so much to see, and probably not enough time to see it all!   I have Morgans too!  Nice to know another Morgan Redditor!   I'll be heading down this week to Lexington for a show at the Horse Park.  It's my first time there, and there is so much to see!  I know I won't have lots of time in between showing my horse, so for those of you who have been there, what were your favorite things?  What should I skip?   I'm for sure checking out the Saddlebred museum, and I'd like to see some of the famous horses there.   What is the difference between "yellow" and "lemon"?   I liked Mirror of Korea ok, but when I ordered the Bibimbap they COOKED THE EGG YOLK ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  The runny yolk is what makes that dish!   He is wonderful!  You should crosspost this on r/equus.   Are you kidding?  I WOULD LOVE THIS!  Do they make them for big kids?   Yeah, I don't live there anymore -- now I'm in Minneapolis.  But I still go back to Roscoe quite often to visit my folks.   Sweet!  Roscoe is represented on Reddit!     Is that Hononegah high school?   NOT a stupid question!  I do mine damp (wet and rung out).  Not sure what would happen if you do it dry...let's not find out.   Also related, you can kill all the nasties on a sponge by zapping it in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Careful -- resulting sponge will be hot and steamy.   Merrils are awesome!  Another way to take care of your feet while still being frugal is to get a pair of prescription orthodics crafted by a podiatrist.  While the initial investment is pricey ($200?) they last for-freakin-ever (they are made of a material called Superglass, a type of fiberglass).  I got some 10 years ago because I have extremely high arches and it was killing my knees to walk.  Now they go in all the shoes I wear (except heels) and it really don't matter if I buy cheaper shoes that have no arch support (like Converse) because my orthodics are in there.  Any shoes I want, and no knee pain!   Shoes.  Buy good shoes.  If you buy crappy shoes you will mess up your feet over time and when you mess up your feet, you mess up the rest of you (knees, hips, back, etc.)    I buy all my clothes secondhand, but always purchase top quality shoes!   Enchilada bake is the best freakin' thing ever.  Get an 8x8 pan and open a can of enchilada sauce.  Put a little bit of sauce in the bottom so things don't stick, and begin layering -- tortilla, black beans, cheese, sauce, tortilla, beans, cheese sauce, etc. until you get to the top of the pan (usually about 3 layers).  Then top it off with any leftover sauce and cheese and throw it in the oven.  350 for...I don't know...25 minutes?  You know, until it's bubbly and hot-looking and done.    Hella tasty, impossible to mess up, cheap to make, and great for lunches.   I am also building credit, and I only use my card for groceries.  Even if I don't put much on it, I'm paying it off in full each month, and therefore build credit.  I have a Chase Sapphire card along with a Chase rewards debit card (I bank with them, but they have credit cards available in general).  Also, the US Bank Flex Perk cards are very highly ranked.   D'AWWWWWWW!  Darling!    My dad convinced his secretary that bison dig holes in the ground to live in while they hibernate in the winter.  I convinced this same woman that a local water tower was actually a hot air balloon.   Your dog is darling.  What is he/she?   I had one of these guys too.  We named him Earl the Squirrel.  I found out upon bringing him to the Wildlife Rehab Center that squirrels of this age (just out of the nest) don't really understand danger and routinely approach people, just like Ruppert did.  Earl did the same to me, hopping onto my foot and looking scared.  You would think squirrels would have evolved a better sense of fear after all these years.  Nevertheless, Earl was super fun to have.  We used to nap on the couch together and watch Jeopardy.     Folding myself in half backwards, and other contortionist-like abilities.   I've had this all my life but never knew it had a name!  I have asked eye doctors about it, but none of them have ever told me about visual snow.  Makes it incredibly difficult to see at night, especially things like holes in the ground while walking in the dark.  Glad to know it's a real thing, and I'm not just completely insane.   Thanks!  Wish this topic would make it to the front page -- I want to see more pictures of people's horses!   Guys always laugh when I tell them how sexy I think forearms are, and yet here we are, so many of us loving forearms.  Especially when the guy is wearing a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  *drool*   I'm just finding this thread now, and I'm thrilled there is a subreddit for horses!  Here are my two Morgans, Baby (chestnut) and Rillo (bay).  Baby is Rillo's mom, so it's a family affair when we show!  http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/3GH12#49hIR   Just found this subreddit now!  Some great Saddlebred magazines are:  Saddle and Bridle - http://www.saddleandbridle.com/ The National Horseman - http://www.tnh1865.com/ Saddle Horse Report - http://www.saddlehorsereport.com/  Also, this is a complete list of books written specifically about Saddlebreds: http://www.trot.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2158 however many of these you would have to find used/vintage.  From a fellow Saddlebred lover, I hope this helps!  	56
 that's way more coherent than what i used as my facebook status update. of course, i was drunk at the time, as that was the only way i could muster up enough courage to hit the "post" button.  that letter pretty much says everything you need to say.  good luck! and of course, if you need to talk, we're always here.   nope   i'd say both   it DID say "early" results   nobody said science had to be boring   Power density (or volume power density or volume specific power) is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume.

(no he has never seen the movie)  every time he posts on facebook about me, it starts off with "My son..."  i've been transitioning for almost 3 years. smh   no prob, i know it get confusing.

For ages there was no proof either of the US spying on their own citizens. Hell, there isn't proof that Israel owns nukes. That doesn't mean shit if you can connect the dots and draw your own conclusions.  again, you said that the CIA was out to get Chavez. that's a pretty bold claim. perhaps you have an inside track on some information that the rest of the world doesnt. please, share with the class. until you do, i'll file it away with the rest of the conspiracy theories.   and as far as communist countries go, if you want to argue semantics, go ahead, the UN classifies them as communist, so i'm going with it, pretty simple.  There is no active war against communism  ok, thanks, we're done    What, to correct you at the expense of being snowden-ed? Go find out for yourself. Look at the most recent 2002 coup, for example. The US admitted to meeting representatives of the Venezuelan opposition.  right, no proof, gotcha. thanks.  A communist state is a country run primarily on the principles of Marx and Engels with the end goal being the establishment of communist ideology worldwide.   "Communist state" is a state that aims to achieve Socialism and then achieve Communism. Most communist states have been states with a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party system by a party which claims to follow communism, usually with a professed allegiance to Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology of the state. None of these states achieved communism, and the term is used no matter to what degree that state or the movement associated with it actually follows communism, if at all. nonetheless, they are considered communist.    Furthermore, both the war on drugs and on communism are very obviously connected by the effects they have on US foreign policy towards the Latin American region and therefore geopolitics.  we're not living in the 50's. there is no war against communism. that died when nixon went to china. the cuban exiles who are still mad at castro are fast becoming the minority. any conversation in miami today will show you that, and the polls show it as well.       You may not believe in CIA actions against Chavez  if can point to a single shred of evidence that the CIA in your words "went after" Chavez, i'd be happy to stand corrected.  And of course China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba differ politically. Mostly because none of them are communist states.  this statement is so ludicrous, i cant even.  The Communist Party of China is the sole governing party of China, which  is organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a single-party state. A new state constitution was approved in April 1992, replacing the 1975 version. The central role of the Communist Party was reasserted in all organs of government, politics and society. Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections.   According to policy experts and news reports, including the BBC World Service, North Korea continues to embrace a communist ideology and is a de facto communist government. In 2014, for example, the BBC Country Report on North Korea characterized it as a nominal communist government  The Communist Party of Cuba is the only political party permitted in the Republic of Cuba, others are not allowed to exist. It is a communist party of the Marxist-Leninist model.  The war against drugs and the war against communism aren't separate issues.  yes they are, because they're not even remotely connected to each other in any way shape or form.  However most of them are strongly anti-Castro.  again, you're wrong. Nearly 600,000 U.S. travelers went to Cuba last year  the majority of them Cuban Americans.   http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/poll-cuba-obama-cuban-americans-florida-116570.html  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-cuba-usa-poll-idUSKBN0M72KO20150311  Regardless my point is that it's in Cuba's better interests to seek trade opportunities in solidarity with the latin american nations instead, even if only to maintain its economic sovereignity from the US.   once the embargo is lifted, cuba can establish ties with whichever country they want to. right now, they cant, because the trade embargo penalizes countries and corporations who do business with cuba.   well first off, it's not polite to ask a trans person if they've had surgery. and trans dudes exist too, it's not just women. there's more to a person than which bathroom we use. but to answer your question, far more trans women get harassed and assaulted in women's restrooms. you know how women have been assaulted by trans women in women's restroom? none. zero. nada. zilch.    Venezuela is socialist, not communist. and i'd love to see proof that the CIA "went after" him. otherwise, stop peddling that conspiracy theory crap.  and Cuba is communist, like vetnam, china, and north korea, and you can see that communism is very different in each of those countries.   you cant mix up socialism either, because Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway are all socialist countries too.   you keep mixing up the war against communism and the war against drugs, both of which are equally ludicrous. the faster the US decriminalizes drugs the better. hopefully marijuana will be legal in more states by 2016 and mdma, lsd, and mushrooms will be taken off the banned list of drugs so that research can be conducted.  and finally, the US lies 90 miles away from the cuba, it is GOING be the biggest trading partner. miami might as well be another cuban city. the ties run too deep.   uh, which part in south america? the drug war is what is screwing up the economies of south america, not communism. besides, cuba is in the Caribbean, not south america. besides, are you actually advocating that the embargo stay? it's made life really hard for every day cubans. the sooner it goes, the better   no, it's science   cuba's economy is only the way it is BECAUSE of the US embargo. once castro dies, the boom in tourism is going to go thru the roof.    why do you hate your parents? did they do or not do something? and committing suicide isnt the answer, and writing a fake note isnt either. neither of these are a solution. what did you want to accomplish? did you want them to change their minds about something? maybe we can brainstorm together to find a different way to get to that point.   oh the irony....   something , something, church and state   except that on reddit, we all have to abide by the rules that the admins set, and one of those rules is that nobody under 13 is allowed on.   whoopsies, that'll learn me to check my clipboard. i'm building a site for my friend  here ya go!  http://www.reddit.com/r/TransSpace/comments/36xmrj/wait_times_for_sexual_reassignment_surgery/  (thanks for looking out!)   we're actually working on providing links to published studies, as well as links to general information from the various medical organizations.  of course it always helps when people flag a comment that's questionable or that goes against established guidelines. we're human, and sometimes we miss things   trans girl/trans guy   they've given up in the gay marriage, that's why you see all these "religious freedom" laws popping up. segregationists did the same thing during the civil rights era.   soooo... a war against rhetoric?    nbsp;  ^^i'll nbsp;see nbsp;myself nbsp;out nbsp;now   that would require an original idea   The distinction between sex and gender differentiates sex (anatomy of an individual's reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics) from gender (social roles based on the sex of the person, usually culturally learned), or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). Gender is sometimes referred to as the sex of the brain. In some circumstances, an individual's assigned sex and gender do not align, and the result is sometimes a transgender person.   rules are rules, and as a mod you decide how they are applied. i abide by those rules.    dont let the door hit ya, where the good lord split ya   so let it be written, so let it be done   they now have hormone implants, so we can go 6 months or a year before needing it replaced.   um, no, again, i posted it because 1) i'm trans, 2) i was in the military. this article shows me that the attitudes are changing, ever so slowly, but changing all the same.  and believe me, if i posted to srs every time i ran into a homophobe or a transphobe, that's all i'd be doing on reddit. i DO however want to try and change attitudes myself.  i cant change the fact that i'm trans. i CAN try and change perceptions of trans people so that maybe someday, we can serve openly.    i'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.  ;-)   it's the military, the rules dont always makes sense   becuz rules.  (and try not to use the T word, would ya? it's considered a slur)   i see, because i mod queer news sites and have to populate those queer news sites with articles, it's considered "spam"? i also post to /r/atheism and /r/science, but i guess those would be "articles of interest" right?   this article was relevant to me as a trans woman and as someone who served her country (full disclosure - not US Military). if you want i could get my jarhead friends to repost this.  there are transgender vets from all branches of the service, that's a fact. and there will CONTINUE to be trans people who serve, as a mod of a few transgender subs, i know this to be true because i know several people who are currently on active service.  i posted it here because it was apropos for both me and the sub. why dont you try reading the article first before you judge.    i try not to post buzzfeed links, but this was a pretty good one as far as their stories go.   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand this is why i post stories like this here. simply because transphobic people like you are still around. lots of us trans girls served because we saw the military as a last chance to "man up". doesnt make our service any less meaningful than yours. when we're done, we transition. and some of us need help with that from the VA. thankfully, the VA isnt as transphobic as you.      you're welcome!   wait, hold up, you think a story about transgender vets getting the help they need from the VA is clickbaity?   nah, my bible thumping fam fam had WAY more issues over me being transgender and a lesbian than me being an atheist,   come on ireland, you can do this!   c'mon ireland, you can do this!!!  woooooo!   gender and sex are very different. sex is who you go to bed with, gender is who you go to bed as.   ok, there's a lot going on here, so let's break it down, it'll be easier to handle in chunks. taken altogether, it's overwhelming.  ok, first thing you have to know is that you can transition on the DL, you'll just need a sports bra when the boobs start coming in. either that, or maybe it's time to find some on campus accommodation.  if you have your health insurance thru your school,  trying sending your hormones to a PO Box, they're relatively easy to get, or send it to a friend you trust. (i'm going to assume your parents will snoop)  now, uni. if it's not too late, drop the classes you're behind in, i'm assuming your grades are crappy. it's ok, classes can be retaken. no biggie, it'll be ok.  most of all, take a little time out and have a deep breath, you dont have to do everything at once. it's not hopeless when you break it down into itty bitty little steps.   like /u/Yveris, when i had my breakdown, it wasnt pretty. i holed up in my apartment for two months during my awkward, inbetweeny stage. i popped a lot of Xanax because i was having panic attacks ALL the time. almost lost my job, almost got kicked out of my apartment. urgh, those were NOT fun times.  but i CAN tell you is that when i got thru that, it started getting easier, i stopped getting the stares and everybody just started gendering me female.  you can do this too. you gotta just look to what your next step is, just work to cross that thing off your list. you gotta do it one step at a time.  you can do this.     it'll be fine, just remember, it only sucks for awhile   3 3   stop by /r/asktransgender if you're feeling down, or if you want to check in, or need a pick-me-up, we're always there to help  also, good luck!   or a chris hansen special   but it always helps to have backup ;-)  thanks!     **American Medical Association**   Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder. http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf   Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)   Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician.

(i was too chicken to tell them face to face. and right after i told everybody, i was even MORE terrified because there was no going back at that point. i had the whole "WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST DO?" moment.  and the first 6 months of transition was rough, i HATED the inbetweeny stage. urgh. when people dont quite know what gender you are and they just STARE, or whisper. god i hated the whispers.  now i'm having a blast. altho i kick myself for not coming out sooner.

"will anyone find me attractive?" "what will my friends/family say?" etc etc ad nauseum, ad infinitum.  i just ran out of energy to fight it anymore.   i'm WAY happier now!   transgender females are females, they arent boys. and gender has nothing to do with sexual development. your gender identiy kicks in at a very early age.    girl, trans girl. the girl scouts only accept girls.   hey you started transition way before me, i only started at 39   i think those are really good questions. i hope somebody does a follow up study with those in mind   actually, according to the DSM V, it's no longer a disorder. being transgender now falls under "gender dysphoria"   urgh, gross. so much for "family values"   they're true, his dad was the one who turned him in, the only reason he didnt get charged was that the detective in charge was a pedophile too and was hoarding all the evidence he had collected for himself. the cop was removed from the case, tried, and convicted, but by the time they got around to trying to carge duggar, the statue of limitations had expired.

[here's jesslyn](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e7d_1298068190)  never doubt the power of hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.  i was terrified of not being able to pass as female. my therapist suggested very firmly that i start seeing her in girlmode, and for the first few times, i hid behind a hat and sunglasses, and i practically RAN to her office. she had a helpful piece of advice, she called what i was experiencing Other People's Disease. and she was right, i was transitioning because i was trans, not to pass some arbitrary standard of some nebulous concept in my head of what an ideal female was supposed to look like. once you start owning who you are, it gets easier to deal. "passing" for what it is worth, comes a lot of the time just from confidence and a little slight of hand. like i said, hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.  so, if you decide to join us on the journey to planet girl, feel free to send me a PM if you wanna talk, or post another question here, there'll always be someone here to help  ;-)   hey, it was a story about weed, ya cant blame me for trying!   it's a university paper, not that much space to play with in the first place, the main pic is pretty much all you got   MOD ABUSE!!

The typical American woman will have two children in her lifetime. That means she will spend more than three decades trying to avoid pregnancy.  The most effective contraceptives are IUDs and implants. These methods are up to 20 times more effective than the birth control pill in preventing pregnancy, and they are often the safest options for women.  But high up-front costs put these methods out of reach for a lot of women. Insurance coverage for contraception without a co-pay would allow a woman to choose the best method for her, not just what fits in her budget. Taking away coverage would effectively block access to those most-effective methods.  Birth control is not only safe and effective preventive care, it is also care that physicians support and millions of women need. Allowing an employer's personal values to trump his or her employees' right to care would allow the beliefs of the few to trump the health of many. That's both bad policy and bad medicine.   i have no problem with your faith, right up to the point where the followers and leaders of said faith try to impose the beliefs of the faith onto me.    just wanted to point out how ludicrous it was   **Women like their birth control:**  * 99% of women who have had sex have used contraceptives at some point. Its already a near-universal practice.  * Opponents of contraceptive coverage are in the minority. In a recent NPRThompson Reuters poll, 77% of respondents said that private insurance plans should cover some or all of the cost of birth control pills. If the plan is subsidized by the government, 74% of respondents thought it should cover some or all of the cost.  * Women who have used birth control pills have been found to have fewer cases of anemia (low red blood cells), ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer. These beneficial effects occur because the birth control pill works by decreasing the number of ovulations, amount of menstrual blood flow, and frequency of periods.  * Taking the Pill helps prevent or reduce the occurrence of functional cysts (the most common kind of ovarian cyst), which form when ovulation goes awry.  * Oral contraceptives are also used to treat cystic acne, a potentially scarring condition that affects women even into their forties.  **Why we need birth control:**  * Half of pregnancies among American women are unplanned. Of unplanned pregnancies, 4 in 10 end in abortion. Preventing unplanned pregnancy prevents abortions.  * Contraception is estimated to save $19 billion a year in costs related to unplanned pregnancies. Increasing access will increase savings.  * Contraception supports and improves women and childrens health outcomes by enabling women to plan the spacing and timing of their pregnancies. It is also used to address health issues such as preventing ovarian cysts or endometrial and ovarian cancers.  * Access to free birth control leads to lower rates of abortions and teen births, according to a new and extensive study from Washington University in St. Louis.  * The average cost per publicly financed unintended pregnancy is nearly $10,000.  * New York Citys teen pregnancy rate has decreased by 27% over the past decade. And Health Commissioner Tom Farley attributes the change, in part, to the provision of contraceptives in public schools.    Corinthians Chapter 7  i see, so if we apply that, then we have to abolish divorce too, right?  10 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 11 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.  and we can bring back slavery, right?  21 Were you a slave when you were called? Dont let it trouble you  or are we cherry picking? because if we're cherry picking, they i freely choose to ignore everything in the bible that i disagree with.   you raise some good points   riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. you keep telling yourself that   so in other words, even tho the bible is filled with "thou shall not" verses, which are rather specific in their meaning, you cannot show a single verse that specifically states that one should not practice contraception. got it.   i'm asking again where in the bible it specifically states that practicing contraception goes against the word of god. also, while we're at it, since you brought it up, please show me where in the bible it specifically says to practice celibacy until marriage.    the current genration isnt as hung up about gender and sexuality. it is a far more accepting world, from women's colleges accepting transgender females, to more positive roles on screen and in print. even the tabloids are toning it down as can be shown in the coverage of bruce jenner's transition. there are federal, state, and city protections for trans and gay people.  homophobic and transphobic religious outlooks like yours are ever more the minority. and the world is a better place for it.    can you please show me where contraception goes against the word of god?  i must have missed the part where jesus said, "thou shall not hath thou pill!"   right right, adam's apple the size of a fist, man hands, and anynumber of insults you use to hurl at trans women, like i said, transphobia. there are none so blind.   using your hypothetical situation of a trans woman at a bar. if you're chatting up a girl and you find out she's trans and you're uncomfortable with the thought of sleeping with her, even though you were attacted to her before, here's what you say,  "i'm sorry, i'm not comfortable with it. sorry for giving the wrong impression. i'm flattered that you would find me attractive enough to ask."  protip: also works for gay people hitting on you  protip 2: always observe the golden rule, i.e., dont be a dick   please see "lack of evidence." should eveidence arise that shows proof of god or life after death, i will happily change my outlook.   i tried looking for it, but i couldnt find it, i'd love to read what you thought   i know, but we always get so excited by the rise of the "nones"   fear of death is no reason to sacrifice logic for comfort. we do know that when we die, we cease to exist on this plane of existence. if there is another plane we go to, nobody has yet found it. to say that we go on in some form without any evidence does us a disservice.  that's the whole basis of the "god of the gaps" theory, where where anything and everything that science doesnt have an answer for must be proof of "god"   i'll take banana for $500 for the next question, alex   yes, people like you like to think that trans women go around and hang out in bars for the sole purpose of "tricking" men into sleeping with them.   trans women are women, and there are plenty of men who think so. they just have to weed out the bigots like you.      as a trans girl, i too, love my HRT   Transphobia (or much less commonly transprejudice) is a range of antagonistic attitudes and feelings against transsexuality and transsexual or transgender people, based on the expression of their internal gender identity (see Phobia  Terms for prejudice).   ahhhh, i was wondering when the homo and trans phobia would show. took you long enough. always about the sex. you do realize that relationship are more than just sex right? and again, what people do behind closed doors is up to them. people like you always reduce it to sex, or the ick factor. well,  get over it. the world has changed, and we're all better for it.      none, zlich, nil   again, only religious fanatics cling to outdated ideas, as the rest of the world advances past them.   By the end of the 19th century, medicine and psychiatry were effectively competing with religion and the law for jurisdiction over sexuality. Thankfully, science won out. Early in the twentieth century, Havelock Ellis argued that homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, that it was not a disease, and that many homosexuals made outstanding contributions to society.  Yes, they were wrong about a lot of things back then, and as science and medicine advance, our knowledge expands, and treatments, diagnoses, and definitions change. Religion, on the other hand, does not.  I live in a world of reason and logic. and there is no scientific basis for the need, or for that matter, the ability, to change a person's sexuality.   yeeeeeeup   Freud believed that a homosexual orientation should not be viewed as a form of pathology.  "Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc.). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime, and cruelty too...."  Homosexuality was removed from the DSM because it was never an illness in the first place.   no, the DSM was changed in regards to homosexuality because of evidence that showed that it was not a disease. There is a debate in the medical and transgender communities about whether or not Gender Dysphoria should remain in the DSM. But only because some believe removing it could limit patients access to insurance coverage.    while not all Singaporeans are homophobic or transphobic, there were enough of them to make me leave and not come back, and this was 20 years ago. honestly, i dont see myself going back at all.     Your confusing religious fundamentalism with life, reality, biology, history and, well, just about everything.  i'm not the religious fundamentalist here. and luckily, neither are any of the medical organizations. see, they make their protocols based on evidence and not what's written down in "holy" texts   Religious fundamentalism has been found to correlate positively with anti-homosexual bias. One way you can tell that people are starting from a conclusion and arguing backwards is when they bust out the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink strategy: Trying a bunch of different arguments in hopes that one sticks.     people arent in pain with their sexuality or gender, they're in pain because people like you want to CHANGE their sexuality or gender. religion has it's place, you are free to believe whatever the hell you want. you cannot, however, impose those beliefs and values on others.   there are none so blind as those who cannot see.  dude, drop it already. if you cant see that your position goes against the collective procedures of every single medical organization on this planet, then i cant help you.  the only people still advocating for conversion therapy are religious organizations.   seriously, let it go, you'll be a happier person.   no, every tans person is unique, and they experience dysphoria in different ways. and they may or may not get different kinds of surgeries. or none, if the case may be   racist much?  fingerprints are a unique identifier that a different from person to person, i.e. unlike race or gender  psychological trauma again implying that some trauma leads people to be gay or trans, which goes against all current establish medical evidence to the contrary   absent parents, again imply trauma leads people to be gay or trans, which goes against all current establish medical evidence to the contrary    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_of_Care_for_the_Health_of_Transsexual,_Transgender,_and_Gender_Nonconforming_People  but you go right ahead and keep calling the WPATH a "political" organization. in the meanwhile, here's more:-   The American Psychological Association is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with more than 122,500 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students as its members.  According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria."  A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19509099  http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=protocol-00-00  http://www.bumc.bu.edu/endo/clinics/transgender-medicine/guidelines/  http://sherbourne.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Guidelines-and-Protocols-for-Comprehensive-Primary-Care-for-Trans-Clients.pdf     Researchers adept at analyzing the genetic threads of human diversity say that the concept of race--the source of abiding cultural and political divisions in American society--simply has no basis in fundamental human biology.  With the tools of molecular biology, scientists can peer past superficial characteristics to explore more powerful, underlying genetic commonalities and differences, which are making racial categories look increasingly arbitrary and irrelevant, the experts said.  "Biologically, we are saying in essence that race is no longer a valid scientific distinction," said Solomon H. Katz, a University of Pennsylvania anthropologist.  "Race is a social construct derived mainly from perceptions conditioned by events of recorded history, and it has no basic biological reality," said C. Loring Brace, a biological anthropologist at the University of Michigan.  "The old biological definitions of race were based on what people looked like," said Joseph L. Graves Jr., an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University West. "Now that we have better ways of looking at race . . . we could construct races based on what type of fingerprints people have, or on what kind of blood type they have, and that would be just as legitimate."   There is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all contribute to the development of transgender identities.  A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.  According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria." Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as "gender identity disorder."     it's for minors   the bill is for the protection of minors, so that parents cant force their kids to those pray-away-the-gay camps. as an adult, if you want to fool yourself into thinking that you can change your sexuality, go right ahead.    There ARE documented cases of success with conversion therapy.  no, no there arent. nada. zip. zero.  The most important fact about these therapies is that they are based on a view of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, six published by the American Psychiatric Association, which defines the standards of the field, does not include homosexuality. All other major health professional organizations have supported the American Psychiatric Association in its declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973. Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-sex attraction and orientation among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations.   they've tried changing the mind to fit the body, and it never worked.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer   you can wander to your heart's content, it's just when it comes to the actual "light up" that you have to leave. like i sed, tis a silly place.   as a tourist? prolly fine. and there are gay clubs there if you're into that sort of thing. it's just as a citizen, gay people often have the short end of the sticl   The WPATH Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders were first issued in 1979, and articulate the "professional consensus about the psychiatric, psychological, medical and surgical management of GID." Periodically revised to reflect the latest clinical practice and scientific research, the Standards also unequivocally reflect the Association's conclusion that treatment is medically necessary.  Sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.     Medically necessary sex reassignment procedures also include complete hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, chest reconstruction or augmentation as appropriate to each patient (including breast prostheses if necessary), genital reconstruction (by various techniques which must be appropriate to each patient, including, for example, skin flap hair removal, penile and testicular prostheses, as necessary), facial hair removal, and certain facial plastic reconstruction as appropriate to the patient.  "Non-genital surgical procedures are routinely performed... notably, subcutaneous mastectomy in female-to-male transsexuals, and facial feminization surgery, and/or breast augmentation in male-to-female transsexuals. These surgical interventions are often of greater practical significance in the patient's daily life than reconstruction of the genitals."    Furthermore, not every patient will have a medical need for identical procedures; clinically appropriate treatments must be determined on an individualized basis with the patient's physician.   because they tried changing the mind to fit the body and it doesnt work. that's why the recommended course of treatment for transgender individuals is to transition.   yes, make fun of it. like the racists who made fun of desegregationists. because that's the company you're keeping right now.   lol, you'll do just fine, come on over to the sub, plenty of interesting convos going on   yes, i noticed  :-p   non-op, i got all the parts i was born with, altho, i did promise my bestie that if i ever had my testicles removed, he could hang em from his rearview mirror like fuzzy dice.   thanks!   hmm, i use a 16g to draw, but even with an 18g it shouldnt be that hard to draw. and you're doing everything right. do you know anybody else that can show you how to draw? can you go back to the clinic and get a nurse to show you how to draw?   YAY!! congrats on getting on hrt. glad the sub has helped.    well come over to /r/genderqueer, plenty of non binaries for you talk to.   i stand corrected   lol, all the other gay and lesbian couples and groups that i know are perfectly happy with each other. i'm pretty good with my two girlfriends. and we get on great with other straight people who arent all tied up into knots trying to reconcile their faith with the new reality.  opinions like yours are fast fading into memory. and while they'll prolly always be around, just like racism is still with us, they will be reviled for the homophobic and transphobic thought that they are.  there are more people today who fight for equality than there are people like you tryin g to sow hate and fear and division. that's why we're winning and that's why we will continue to win. inclusion helps everybody feel a part from society, exclusionary ideas that you push, just isolate you more and more.   i had enough problems switching from boy to girl, i am NOT going back   huh? conversion therapy is an attempt to force the conversion of someone's sexuality, in the case of minors, usually against their will.    yeah, you and me both   you seem unusually concerned by what two people do behind closed doors and by what gender they are. is there anything you'd like to to talk about? feel free. like i sed, no judgements here   this bill is specifically for minors. if you're an adult, you can do whatever you want   because all the the major medical institutions have labeled conversion therapy as ineffective and harmful. you are free to believe whatever you want, you are not free to forcefully impose those beliefs by sending your child away to reeducation camps.   actually, it doesnt at all, wanna know why? because loving another person is a wonderful experience. we only limit ourselves by adhering to the rigid sex and gender binaries. sex, like gender is a broad spectrum. we are made lesser by not exploring other options. just as travel broadens the mind, exploring our gender and sexuality broadens it too.   	189
 Title = misleading   They can take control of your character? Here comes the hackers forcing us to F11 ourselves.   **How often do you visit and participate on this subreddit? Are there any factors that would affect your participation?**  Answer: I am quite new to the Day Z subreddit, but during the day I will take a quick look at the subreddit, but then at one point in the day I will look through most of the day's new posts, and see if there are any new "Hot" ones.  **Is there anything on the subreddit would you like to be involved with in particular? Contests and events? Weekly thread maintenance? Helping style the CSS? Other?**     Answer: I am quite familiar with Cascading Style Sheet, so of course I would appreciate helping out with the      styling of the subreddit. It would also be my pleasure to help out with the weekly thread maintenance.  **Are there any concerns with the subreddit right now that you would tackle as a Moderator? What are they, and how would you go about addressing them?**     Answer: One of my main concerns for the subreddit right now, would be the amount of content surronding the hackers of DayZ and how so many people in the subreddit spend most of their time complaining about them. I would like to keep the subreddit mostly positive and focus on the good things about DayZ and it's development.  **Do you have any new suggestions for current moderation standards, new weekly threads, or other improvements? Yes or no will suffice here, we're not here to steal your ideas (unless you want to share them anyway, that's cool too)!**     Answer: Twitter updates from the developers is one of the most important updates that are released on the subreddit because that is our main source of information, so I would suggest moderators keep a close eye upon the twitter feed of the developers.  **Despite best intentions and efforts, there will always be users who will criticize your actions, make false accusations, or otherwise put you down. How have you dealt with discontent, disapproval, or disagreement in the past, and how are you prepared to handle this criticism in a position of power?**     Answer: Criticism is a standard within the gaming community, most of us deal with it everyday, to me it has no negative effect, sometimes criticism can make us more open minded, and appreciate other people's opinions more than before, when I have dealt with criticism I try and stay positive with it, although most of the time within gaming criticism is an attempt to put other gamers down. I am prepared to handle criticism without responding with criticism, so not to feed the person.  **Why do you want to be a Moderator?**     Answer: I want to be a moderator because the Day Z subreddit is a fantastic community where users can share their opinions and creativity. So I would love to let the creativity continue, and make it easy for DayZ players to share their screenshots, recordings, ect.  **Do you have any prior moderation experience on reddit?**     Answer: I have had no past experience with moderation on reddit.  **When did you join r/DayZ? What is your in-game experience like?**     Answer: About a week ago, my first post received criticism upon the fact many people believed I used MS paint to stretch out my image to attempt to make the aspect ratio seems like 16:9 but the community has been welcoming else where. My gaming experience within Day Z so far has been trying to help other players, but always being blind sided by them players.  Thank you for reading this application.    I think I know the solution; Run really fast into a wall with your arm pointing at it. Either you will fix the arm, or it will provide you with extreme pain. Good luck.   They are so blind.   I think Hackers target small pop servers because then they can get to everyone within the server.   Hacking is already occuring in H1Z1? I might go read their subreddit for all of the people posting "Er mah gerd, hacker in server".   Sometimes you just have to let go of your AKM.   People just don't learn.   Bye.   Did you know that Day Z isn't the only game that has hackers within it? Did you know that nearly every single game can be hacked using C++? Did you know whining on the subreddit won't get hackers stopped anytime soon? How about you write some code that can stop hackers, send it to the developers and leave a little "Your Welcome" note with it. GG no re.    I wasn't facing North, I simply just took a picture because I was on the way to meet up with some people I know.          "I'm an artist because I can make a computer add 2 numbers"   Someone went on a duping rampage in Cherno...   I don't think that it should be a mask, print those designs on to balaclavas.      You forgot one: no servers   I have a feeling that the streamer was dominating all other players in the server with those airdrops.  	20

 You gotta play ["Los Cuates de Sinaloa"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUmpTKXpIdM) all the time in your car now.  ;)   Leaked images? Why haven't I seen these?   Not really, what I want and what Republicans want aren't always synonymous.  Examples:  1. Legalize friggin' marijuana already. 2. Let anyone get married at any institution that will perform the ceremony. 3. Pull all troops from any foreign country; let them protect OUR boarders, not other countries' boarders. 4. No more foreign aid until we no longer have national debt. 5. Disband the IRS, and enforce a flat tax.  It's fair.  Poor people buy cheaper things; rich people buy more expensive things.  It's fair; quit whining. 6. etc...

Don't get me wrong, I can't STAND Democrats, but I've slowly started hating Republicans more and more since I turned 18 back in 1999.  They're all talk, and no action.  The "Republican" candidates that do get into office are so middle-of-the-road, that nothing happens.  I think I will now consider myself a Conservative Libertarian.  Screw the (D)/(R) parties.  I'm sick of this crap.            Ah.... j'aime l'inceste.

Every time I see this, all I see is the duck that the Americas turns into.   Do you ladies sometimes milk being pregnant to make people do things for you? I swear that my wife did that during each pregnancy.   Because most dudes don't like sucking on a hairy nipple.   Lady Margery of Pimbleton.    Herp-derp...    It's satirical humor.  Get a sense of humor, why don't ya?      Oh, my God--That needs to happen!   Amen to that!   Interesting infographic! Thanks!   I can't stand the dude either.   He's done so many of them, though.

If this fuck-nut wants to judge music, let him host and pay for his own show.  What a jackass.   Ingrown toenail, man.   What the heck ***is*** that?   Loved the shower scene back when I was 16-17.  HAHA!   Married for 5 years now with three kids.  We're great!   And you've never even HEARD of Beck?  I could understand not being able to name a song by someone, but not even knowing who they are...?  I couldn't name a Kanye West song, but I know who he is.   Haha!  Weird!  I watched that last night on Netflix for nostalgia's sake.            Me: "Can you PLEASE stop being so lazy around the house? I work overtime hours to come home to a messy house and you watching television!  If I didn't do the dishes, cleaned up the house, do laundry, etc., then NO ONE would. It's getting really damn old, and you're setting a bad example for the three kids!"      "...who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, walk out the door, and deny Him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."  ~Brennan Manning _________________________  I first heard this quote in the intro to DC Talk's "What If I Stumble?" back in 1995 when I was 14 years old.  I got it then, but it means so much more to me now that I'm coming up on 34.  I strive to be a good example for others, but more specifically for my children.  I try to keep this quote in mind.  Thought I'd share it in case others haven't heard it before.            It seems unfair, counter-productive, and not a valid way of seeing what the actual PARTY members want.                                                   Okay, there was one moment that made my jaw drop at the utter stupidity of the scientists.  Miller's Planet... massive time dilation. The team went down to get the information.  Notice the massive waves.  Brand gets the idea in her head to go get data and gets stuck.  CASE is commanded to get her.  He suddenly transforms into SUPER-SPEED MODE!    My jaw dropped in the theater.  I turned to my wife, and whispered, "What the HELL?!"  Why didn't they just send CASE down?  He could pilot the lander; he could go into super-speed mode; make assessments; get the data; come back; and it wouldn't have been 28 years lost.  Maybe half that.           That's the only thing I can think of. In America, we'll have a foreign song become popular occasionally.                                    I was raised in the Assemblies of God church.  My mother is still a registered AG pastor, in fact.  Come 16 years ago, my parents divorced, and I backslid.  I met my wife 13 years ago, and she and her family are very Catholic.  I converted through RCIA, and received all the sacraments at the Easter Vigil Mass in 2003.  The one thing I have never agreed with, and have not participated with is confession.  Why should we go through a mediary, like a priest, when we can go strait to God, and ask for forgiveness?  Didn't make sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.  _____________________________________________  EDIT:  Thanks for all the replies, folks!   I never thought about it until I was posting in another topic.

                   Here's the link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blipboard-sf/id428023608?mt=8  How it works: You follow people and places, and they leave messages for you around the city. When you walk near one, you get an alert on your phone. Its like Twitter for your map, with, uh, alerts. Make sense?  Follow lots of people   places (so you can experience the alerts feature), then walk around the city. Weve got a couple of foodies in there, so try following them, or places like Great American Music Hall, Castro Theater, etc, which produce great alerts. Were really curious to hear feedback.

Sterilize them with a 1-2min spin in your microwave on high.  Time varies depending on how strong your microwave oven is, but as long as the sponge is quite hot to the touch and steaming, you've probably killed off ~99% of the nasties.  Enjoy cleaner, fresher smelling and less slimy dishrags.                                          More than half the time, it seems, the algorithm picks the wrong image.  Why not do it the way Facebook does, and allow us to cycle through the images of the page?                                                                       This is the just the most recent example: http://freakoutnation.com/2011/11/12/off-duty-cop-working-for-bank-of-america-pushes-protester-off-4-foot-wall/  What would have happened had a camera not fortuitously captured the truth?  Very possibly a completely innocent guy might have not only gone to jail (as he did), but also ended up with a record of assault - against a police officer.  Add to this that they regularly plant drugs to meet quotas.  Yet, in the absence of direct evidence, our judicial system treats their word as incontrovertible.  What will it take to change the presumption that  police are truthful?   Cut your lemon in half.  Stick a fork straight into the cut side.  As you're squeezing the lemon, rock the fork back and forth parallel to the line of tines.  This cuts into the flesh of the lemon and breaks it up, releasing more juice than just squeezing it alone.                                                                                  Here is the interview with Colbert, if you haven't seen it already: http://gawker.com/5855105/stephen-colbert-trolls-occupy-wall-street "I'm a female-bodied person" and other choice quotes in this video.  OWS needs to stay on message and not veer off into weird gender issue language like this girl did.  This is exactly what killed the Left in the 80s.  Let's keep it practical and focused on the economic issues.  **EDIT**: Someone asked "WTF does killed  the left in the 80s refer to?"    That was the era of Political Correctness - a term they themselves used. I was at Brown at the time. I became disgusted when some of these activists started posting signs on men's bathrooms informing them that "rape is not sex". I'm a guy and used to refer to myself as a feminist. They lost me at that moment. And then minority groups (I am one) started whining about their "subaltern identities". It was absurd, self-absorbed, divisive and just completely repellent to people who weren't crazed ideologues. Rush Limbaugh rose to fame complaining about this stuff. The rest is history.                                                Hi - I'm interested in recommendations for good sites that have recipe videos.

 There's a remote sensing lab in Russell? I feel like I should have known that.      Don't get me wrong, bees are expensive and any responsible grower would not use a practice that seriously and quickly harms the bees. But if a grower is getting hammered by a pest right at time of pollination there are tricks to get around injuring the bees.   Bees are also diurnal. Crops that require herbivore insect rpotection during fowering can be sprayed at night when the bees are holed up in thier hive.   Not quite. It's more like gnats can get through a screen that will stop mosquitoes.   Oh! And try not to muck up the teflon tape around the threads of the nozzle head. Although it's easy enough to replace if you do.    Looks like it! Although, now that it's been used it is filled with plastic. That glues it in place. That makes unscrewing it a huge pain. What I've done in tha past was to turn the heat on to melt that plastic, then quickly unscrew it with a small crescent wrench. Be really careful or wear thin gloves. Extruders get crazy hot.  If you can figure out another way to get it off go for it. I'd also like to know.    A bb gun doesn't have the umpf needed to get DNA-coated gold nanoparticles into cells. The original gene gun was a .22. Also, HEPA air purifiers are useless for this kind of thing. They don't come close to removing enough contaiminants and they do not direct air in a laminar flow. A real flow hood filter is about 6 inches thick.  If you want a real hood, try searching for those used by mushroom cultivators. They run at least $400 and up.   Maybe, I've never tried it. You could easily strip your filament doing that but that's not a big problem.   It essentially has to do with the arrangment and behavior of electrons in materials. Depending on the energy of a photon (or wavelength, they are related), it changes how the electron(s) react or if they react. For instance, microwaves tend to make atoms or molecules rotate, this heats water up. The same home microwave does nothing at all to dry ice (frozen CO2) because the bonds in the molecule are different lengths.   But! There are materials that are transparent to visible light, like glass. But again, long infrared cannot penetrate glass well but can penetrate crystals of some salts (including table salt).    It sounds like you may have a plugged nozzle. It happens to the best of us. Try soaking the tip in acetone if it was an ABS print. For PLA, try boiling the nozzle in water and reaming the tip with a fine needle.    Carbohydrate and fats, primarily. I ran the math once for a biochem class. All that water is formed at the end of the electron transport chain.   In fact, an average adult produces about a liter of water a day from this source.   About a year ago we one of our's found two VHS tapes of porn on a railroad track. Trail treasure is in the eye of the beer holder.   I replaced the infrared filter in a canon powershot with a infrablue filter from [infragram (public labs).](http://infragram.org/). It's a near infrared because the CCD is not designed to detect the lower energy infrared light. Essentially because of the [photoelectric effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect). It's not a thermal imaging camera because again it was not designed to detect those faint signals.  The reason I converted the camera is because I'm a grad student in plant pathology. This summer I plan to try to do some remote detecting of plant health in Ag fields. Chlorophyll (like the pine in the photo) show up as very bright in infrared and very dim in blue light. The opposite is true for plants low in chlorophyll. Using both can map general plant health.  Oh, and I processed it in [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji) using a [plugin](https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/tree/master/downloads) for this kind of photo.  Fun stuff. Can't wait 'til summer.   Edit: Added the processing info.         What's a phone book?   No known trees are older than about 9,000 years. There may be or may have been trees this old but none are known to science.   [Corers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phd-du6DW1A) can be used to get a small cylinder of wood going through the tree. These are then glued to a larger piece of wood and scanned into a computer. The software will straighten the curved rings and align them to a preestablished tree ring library for dating.  Interestingy, since trees of a species in an area will grow similarly each year. If a tree dies but does not decay, those ring widths can be aligned going back farther than any of the trees are alive. This is called [dendrochronology.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology) The current maximum for this method is around 11,000 years, even though none of the trees are that old.       This gets a little complicated. A common method is called [Isochron.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochron_dating)  Essentially, an igneous rock will contain a handful of different specific minerals. Think granite. In any mineral solidifying from the source, two different isotopes of, say, strontium, will be incorporated at a constant proportion. The isotopes of Strontium 86 and 87 react chemically identically. In this way, initial proportion becomes fixed in all minerals within a given rock. This is like how blue m m's and green m m's taste the same, but are a little different.  Rubidium and strontium will act chemically different. A mineral may contain more or less of each and that ratio will change mineral to mineral within a rock. Green m m's and green skittles do not taste the same.   Rubidium 87 decays to strontium 87 over time. At the initial formation, the Sr 87/86 ratio was fixed. As Rb 87 changes to Sr 87, and as initial Rb 87 varied in the minerals, the proportion of Sr87/86 will change AND change differently for each mineral within a rock. This can be [plotted](http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/images/rb_sr_isochron.jpg) to project an age to a volcanic rock.  What's notable, is that initial concentration of parent isotope doesn't need to be know. However, it can be calculated after the fact.           	25
 Marine Systems Engineer here.  I'm just about to graduate from a 4 year curriculum at the US Merchant Marine Academy.  The program I've been a part of has introduced me to a wide range of engineering.  We start off learning the terminology used aboard ships and going over a core curriculum of calculus, physics, chemistry, electrical, and thermodynamics courses.  We spend an entire year as cadets on a number of ships in both a four month and eight month periods.  I was on four different ships during my sea time.  We then go over a number of advanced calculus, physics and electrical courses, we take classes in systems design, machine design, and, in the systems program we have a Capstone design project for which we go through the entire design process of designing systems for a vessel.    	1
 Betty Joe sounded like a good time    Hahahahaha your doom awaits you, John.   Tom tasted *divine*   That's actually a human corpse dead center    *meanwhile the caller robs you blind of every earthly possession you own*   I'm in love    Dude has a massive receding hairline. Maybe he thinks you work for Bosley   What the actual fuck   That's a beautiful song, honey.   Imagine her in bed. That's mad luxurious.   he looks weird. Like he has a spray tan and tons of botox. Seriously get a group of guy friends and confront him like you gotta a fucking problem?! And go from there. If he still keeps up I'd take it to the cops or take matters into my own hands. My two cents.       Lemme guess he's Daryll for Halloween    reddit*   I'd hit it    I work with an organization called doctors without diplomas...   Legit as Fuck OP. Good shit.   Lol you're all like this is what my life is...coming up with Masters level thesis' on fictional stories on nosleep    Billy. Tasted. Divine.   Let's go have a drink with Alan Good time I bet he has some good stories to tell    what exactly do you do for a living? Damn I wish I had that kind of time    Frosted flakes nigga damn   I've never understood how people randomly get possessed by a demon. Did she summon it? Involved in the occult? If not, why did it chose her if it is a demon? Oujii board? Fuck idk    Hah I knew that would be the outcome before I read one line of this. Guess only people with cats could understand they're some weird little shits. Still love mine though.   Bet she had a great bush   I hope that was more than one bottle    Especially playing Goldeneye   Ok I can tell you for a fact you're either 1. Dead 2. Insane 3. In another dimension  A mass government evacuation isn't plausible without you hearing a whisper or seeing any signs of it. Awesome truck too btw    Shhhhh he can see you everywhere    The Cheshire Cat from Alice visited Willy Wonka   It's a portal straight to hell   Go steal an Xbox one and we''ll talk it out over some Destiny    Someone else said it but I'm just glad he's dead. Think about the sleepless nights you would've had if he got away...wear his shoes as a trophy    Loved you in BB! How was it working on the set of arguably one of the best shows to grace the screen?! And what can we look forward to on Better Call Saul? Any good cameos? More Huell?   Sounds like you're confused on your sexuality and are having some violent wet dreams!   Who should you be more afraid of? The govt or the aliens?   I'm extremely curious to try this..I have had trouble remembering parts of my childhood I wonder if this would reveal anything..   Fuck you man! Nothing better than stuffed crust cheese Digiorno with Frank's and ranch...I put that shit on everything!   You're a beautiful snowflake.   C-L-A-I-R-E...I...W-A-N-T Y-O-U-R P-U-S-S-Y   You wouldn't believe what kinds of things I saw in people's bags.   Ok right before I left a "supervisor" got into a fight with another airport employee and cut him with a box cutter. I was working that day but didn't witness it, I was on break.   http://m.wsbtv.com/news/news/tsa-agent-arrested-allegedly-cutting-worker-box-cu/ngCSF/  Employees were stealing passengers credit cards out of their checked bags and using them to buy things online. FBI got involved and conducted a sting operation. Yeah, bad time for all involved.   Employees would routinely cuss out upper management..I'm talking management coma parable to RVPs/AVPs.   Employees got caught trying to transport cocaine through a secured area and onto planes.    You get it I think...    You're telling me! I fucking would die reading those. It was like the ideas and thought process of a 3rd grader. And everyone would belittle each other it was hilarious. Even the top rated ideas hardly ever got implemented.    Exactly. Look at what privatizing the prison system did.    They need to implement a fitness standard and arm competent individuals.  Like CBP.    *rolls over and see lady from Send Me To Hell*   I recently left TSA for a much better job. Have college degree and consider myself intelligent. They actually pay decent...I made $16 an hr. However, they have literally NO hiring standards besides a high school diploma. I remember talking to one of my supervisors who was actually competent and did interviews and he told me that in one of his interviews a guy told him his relevant experience was being a "hall monitor in middle school." No shit. Of course the supervisor politely told him he wasn't a good fit but management gave him shit for it and I think hired the guy anyway. Also, EVERYONE within is not satisfied. The level of incompetence extends to upper management. I have so many stories of things like this happening. They need to completely revamp this organization from the top down. Things like this will never stop. The good ole boys club was the method of promotion at the airport I worked as well. You would have guys making over 100k a year with no military/law enforcement experience trying to manage the biggest/busiest airport in the world. Sorry for being scatterbrained but /rant.   You can get a shotgun for $200   Just make sure you follow the code, Dex.   Haha 3    Contorting in all those positions seems to be a great workout! I bet you have a killer body, OP!   Ok so after hearing shit like that I would've never went back to sleep. My Mossberg would've taken the place of your crowbar. Not a happy ending for that guy    Call PETA/ASPCA   If he wasn't mentally ill, I would've gladly kicked his ass if I was you. Jk even if he was mentally ill too ;)   If you're a true Christian, and have accepted Jesus into your heart, then demons/evil spirits can't touch you i thought? Unless you're inviting them in via Ouija board..keep us updated OP I've been curious as to situations such as this.    What the actual fuck...looks like some real life Hills Have Eyes cousin-fucker bullshit. And donating dog food for admission? Da fuq    False imprisonment is what that would be called. Add on some assault and battery charges. Mayne Malicious Mischief, disorderly conduct, really whatever the fuck the cops wanted to charge them with.   Haha okay Dexter..   From the sound of it, I'm sure you can handle yourself, OP. Raquel's friend sounds like a nerd. Well written as well, OP.    Saw this on Drugs Inc episode a while back. Makes you trip balls to the point of having a spiritual/enlightenment experience. Guy runs a camp that is devoted solely to therapy down in Chile? Can't remember country exactly    Kids *see* the darndest things!   This...  http://youtu.be/G7RgN9ijwE4   Such beauty and mystery all in one picture.    That sounds like a horrible daily routine. No idea what that could be.    Fuck that. I can take ghost stories any day but anything with the occult/pentagrams/Satan scares the shit out of me. Id have to be heavily intoxicated/armed to go in that bitch.   Actually I stay on no sleep and whatever's on the front page. I'm sure it's good though I was only thinking via writing. Hah. I read one about that wasn't my husband I slept with last night and that took half the day at work lolol winning    As opposed to the Xbox One which is 8   I'm sure this is decent but reading 12 updates to catch up?! Meh..   Waiting outside a movie theater? That's low. Bitch I hope the fuck he do! He's be a dead son of a bitch I can tell ya that   Not as creepy as I expected but still weird. I think seeing him the first time driving by scared me more    Buried alive but left you with a cell phone?    Plot twist or annoying double post? You decide..   My point exactly...   One of the first believable stories on no sleep   But who exactly wrote "help" is the real question. #plottwist #redherring   Thanks for sharing and sorry for all you've been through. Try to pick up the pieces and find meaning in your life. Positivity and good vibes for you my friend.   Go back go back go back! I bet you won't!   *yawns*   That is so bizarre I've never read of a spirit causing hair loss. I think it's definitely a good idea to get a priest/pastor involved. Your wife is probably confused and doesn't know that she's dead or hasn't come to grips with it. Get Michelle blessed and seek medical attention. And tell her to stay far away. Good luck look forward to the next update.   Weirdest post I've read on reddit thus far. Da fuq..all my experiences with acid never teleported me through time and space.    Whatever is inhabiting your brothers body is probably a lot smarter and stronger than you, seeing as he knocked you down without even realizing it. 'It' is probably already doing the same, plotting how to kill you or stage your death. Be careful!   Gotta love dogs :)   Dammit, Casper!   Ryan started the fire!   Why does your hand insist on being so violent?    Damn. Kid or not I would've absolutely destroyed that kid. Guarantee you he gets out at 18. The CJ system is ass-backwards. Sorry, OP. :(   True. She admits to psychological issues as well which probably played a huge part in it. Anyway, hope you get the help you need OP and figure out what's going on! Best wishes.   Morphine induces auditory and visual hallucinations in some cases. I've seen it first hand. My grandpa was in the hospital and on a Morphine drip...he was pretty comical. He saw monkeys in the ceiling and other obviously medically induced hallucinations. No worries.   Sewing set? Do you drink cranberry juice while you sew as well? Pussy   These are awesome!   Ok the fact that you admitted to previous psychiatric care makes this story void. Sounds like paranoid delusions and/or hallucinations. It seems extremely unlikely that someone would go to that great a length to stalk a call center manager.  Also, I feel like this is a plot from a movie...,   So a couple nights ago I experienced what I think was sleep paralysis for the first time in my life (I'm 26). It was the most terrifying yet interesting experience I've had in my entire life. Basically, I went to sleep that night and woke up in the middle but I was paralyzed. I had an overwhelming fear take over my whole body as if someone or something was in the room with me. I read up on it and basically my mind was awake but my body was still "asleep". It gives me the chills thinking back on it. It lasted maybe ten seconds then I was woke up woke up and was able to move and function normally. Anyone else experienced this? Idk what could have triggered it as I have no family history of this and as I said I've never experienced it in 26 years. So random to happen now.   	92

The man and Brooklyn Decker swim to shore and are the only survivors. They immediately find food and build shelter. With nothing else to do, they begin having sex.  They are having sex multiple times a day for over two weeks, until one day Brooklyn finds the man standing on the beach alone. She approaches him and asks "What's wrong? Is it me? Is it the sex?" The man replies, "No, it's not you and the sex is great... It's just, well... Do you mind if I do something?" Brooklyn replies, "No, whatever you want, I just want you to be happy."  The man then takes off his hat and puts it on Brooklyn's head, tucking her hair up into it. Then he rubs mud on her face in the shape of a beard and says...  "DUDE! I HAVE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH BROOKLYN DECKER FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS!"   Also came to say this:  Check out McCauley's side project, Middle Brother, with Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes) and Matt Vasquez (Delta Spirit).   I FUCKING love Deer Tick... McCauley is one of my favorite singer-songwriters!  For anyone digging this song, please check out their 2nd album, The Black Dirt Sessions, super moody!   This is in no way structurally similar to "Carolina Drama"... the song never reaches a climax of head-banging proportions like "Little Black Submarines".  And just for the record, neither The White Stripes nor The Black Keys were on the radar when they were putting out their early albums.  EDIT: I am referring to the mainstream radar, by the way.         Yeah, I agree.

    I went from having ZERO ads on anything to ads appearing on Facebook, Twitter, OKCupid, reddit etc.  I personally haven't changed anything or any settings.    I am able to use the "Block element" function to get rid of the sidebar ads, but the in-line ads in Twitter (Promoted by....) and Facebook (Suggested Post) still appear.    Was there a new update that removed preferences?  Should I just switch to Ad Block or something else?  I am using the most up-to-date Google Chrome (Version 32.0.1700.107).  I am using the following extensions:  * Adblock Plus * BugMeNot Lite * Disconnect * Ghostery * Google Cast * Google Chrome to Phone Extension * Google Dictionary (By Google) * Google Docs * HTTPS Everywhere * Imagus * imgur Extension by Metronomik * Jeffrey's Exif viewer * Reddit Enhancement Suite * Save to Google Drive * Search by Image (by Google) * SmartVideo For YouTube * Stealthy * TinEye Reverse Image Search  This is my first post in this subreddit, so please let me know if you need anything else!    **EDIT:** I removed ABP and a few other extensions.  Then installed AdBlock.  Now everything looks normal again!    I also updated a setting in Ghostery.  In the Options, under Advance, "Block new elements by default" was unchecked.  So I believe that allowed new trackers to sneak in.  Hopefully that won't occur anymore.    Thanks for everyones help!

If they wear throwbacks, will it be the Bobcats? Or what?                                                                                                                                                                                                               Long time lurker, first time poster.  I searched around MFA and google first, but I need some additional help.  First off, I currently have a self-tie adjustable bow tie with thistle ends.    I originally adjusted the tie to match my neck (like with my shirts), but I wasn't able to get a good knot.  When I folded the tie over, to form the knot, a thicker part crossed over.  So I increased it by 1.5 inches.  Is that fine? As long as I have enough fabric for a good knot?   When I start out, I've seen a lot of places say you need to lower the left end 1.5 inches.  I usually match the right end with the concave dip in the left end.  Is that fine?  For a normal necktie, I know how to make it look good.  Good looking knot, with dimple, etc.  But what are some things to do to make sure my bow tie is a step above?  Should I have a dimple on both sides of the knot?  Should those dimples be symmetric?    How about the back part of the ends?  There are the "front" ends, that everyone sees, then the back ends, which are behind the front ends.  Should/can they show?  Or is it like the skinny part of a necktie?  The bow tie I have has two different patterns on each side, so it wouldn't camouflage in.  I think it looks fine if a little bit of the back end is showing, but I don't want to commit a faux pas.  I'm going to a wedding with this, so I want to make sure everything is on point.    One tip I've figured out is once you pass the tie through the loop and you're in the home stretch.  Then lightly tug on the single end on each side.  Then do the same thing with the double end on each side.  Eventually it will make the knot tighter and create the dimples.    My apologies if I misused some terminology or whatnot.                                                           Assuming I don't have the original on my computer, I would need to pull it off of facebook.   The NCAA first had a University Division and College Division. The University Division became Division I and the College Division became Division II and III, in 1973.  In 1978 Division 1 divided into Division 1A (Football Bowl Subdivision) and IAA (Football Championship Subdivision).    So each break made the club more exclusive.  Now we have the AQ conferences that at one time was 66 of the 120 schools in FBS (I haven't counted all of the new schools).  So are we going to a point where we will have an NCAA FBS "AQ" National Champ and NCAA FBS "non-AQ" National Champ, along with the FCS champs?  Let's face it, no team outside of the current AQs or the merged conference are ever going to win consistently.    Or am I just talking out of my ass?                        The Farm and The Point are two covert CIA training facility.   The Farm, [Camp Peary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Peary), is located near Williamsburg, Virginia.  This seems to be the main CIA training facility.  The Point, [Harvey Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Point), is located in Hertford, North Carolina.  It conducts counter-terrorism courses that involve high explosives and ballistics.  So what are other grey/black places in the United States that aren't on the official maps.   The subreddits I'm subscribed to on reddit.com aren't on reddit is fun. My subreddits used to be on RIF.  What happened?   I have a few (if any) links that are all seven days old. Vast majority have around 20-30 points, none over 75.  I have my "links from:" option set to today.  WTF gives? Anyone else having issues?                  So lets say we have medication X that comes in two forms, instant and extended release.  For my question, lets say both are prescribed as 20mg.  I know the instant gives you the full 20mg dose of medicine X.  And I know the extended release has a part of it (usually half) in an extra coating to prolong the time for you to feel the effects.    So the instant release has 20mg of active product, my question is how much does the extended release have of the active ingredient?  Would it be 10mg instantly, then 10mg in the coat?  Or 20mg instant and 20mg in the coat?  Or something else?              For some reason I am still rocky with Redox reactions.  Every time I feel I get right to the cusp of getting it, something throws me off my game.  I know **OIL RIG** and **LEO GER**, and I have watched Khan (besides reading my chem books).  So is there anyway to look at a (pair) of molecules and know if they're reduced or oxidized?  To the second question.  I've been messing with [Glutathione](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) (GSH) and its partner [Glutathione disulfide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_disulfide) (GSSG).  So GSH is also referred to as L-Glutathione reduced and GSSG is also referred to as L-Glutathione oxidized.  So is having the Hydrogen always equal reduced?  And not having the hydrogen equal oxidized?    So in other words HR (**H**ydrogen, **R**educed) and NoHO (**No** **H**ydrogen, **O**xidized)  Also going off that we have [NADPH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate) which is the reduced form of NADPH.  So NADPH, with the H, is reduced and NADP, without the H, is oxidized.    Looking on wikipedia, they have another memory aid: "**LEORA** says **GEROA**"  Loss of Electrons is Oxidation (Reducing Agent) and Gain of Electrons is Reduced (Oxidizing Agent).  So with my GSH/GSSG example, GSH is the oxidizing agent (because it is reduced) and GSSG is the reducing agent (because it is oxidized).    I apologize for the length of this, but I am at the point where I would be embarrassed to ask anyone (even though it is better to be embarrassed then not to know it).  Plus if anyone has any tips regarding this, I would love to see them!               And today was the first day I took my prescription of Adderall (10mg).  What are some things I should look for or know etc?  The only thing I felt today was a warm feeling for a little while.  I read about the abuse (they have to give a pamphlet on it).  I am not worried about that.    So any hints, tricks, or whatever I should know or look out for?                                 Obviously, Arrested Development was a beyond awesome show.  This show isn't on that level, but it is probably the best 30mins on TV currently.    All "normal people" watch The Office (which sucks and is old now), and somewhat 30 Rock (which is awesome as well).  No one I know watch Community.    God I hope the C word doesn't happen to them........   It was simple animation/cartoon.  I remember a black background.  I looked on wikipedia for the name, but didn't see anything that stood out.  I can't recall though if this was the WHOLE show, or part of it.  I just remember it was a bunch of chemistry stuff on a VERY basic level.  Like I was around 5.     Come on Ira Glass, get off your ass and make some more free shows for me                     Just cause I like to troll doesn't make me a bad father         Facebook gave you the option to change your url to something you know.  So it now takes this form http://www.facebook.com/qwerty (whatever you chose it to be)  When you sign into facebook, type "qwerty", instead of your full email address.  It should allow you to sign in a little quicker.     I keep up with a few websites, but I have to randomly check on them to see if new information is posted.  They don't use RSS or anything like that.  Is there a program that could do that? AND if so, is there one that is free?      I used to use my mouse for everything, but after learning keyboard shortcuts, I've completely use the keyboard, outside of things where the mouse is faster.  I've actually developed a snobbery towards "mouse only user".  It is quite sad.  Some of the shortcuts I use:  Crtl C - Copu Crtl V - Paste Crtl X - Cut Crtl T - new tab Crtl W - Close opened tab pgup - page up pgdn - page down Crtl Shift N - private browser Atl Tab - Rotate between open windows Crtl Tab - Rotate between tabs  I'm sure there are other ones I use, but don't recall the shortcut keys.         Isn't natural born via normal vaginal birth?  Has this ever been discussed?                   It is another cop show.  It started on NBC, but "moved" to TNT.  I really enjoy it and it seems "realer" than others.  I'm not a cop, but it is put together well.  The grittiness of it reminds me of The Wire.  I am afraid it is going to get dropped though.....                                       Sure there are some shitty programs on Discovery Health, but where will I be able to watch Dr. G: Medical Examiner, Medical Incredible, Mystery Diagnosis, Trauma: Life In The E.R. etc?  I don't care about anything Oprah does.  /venting done     	187

 That's why I'd want to be a longsnapper.   And of course the flattery of calling her a 7.   I've had 3 or 4 professors show that in management classes.   In fairness, I'm not sure Weis would still be here even if he'd gotten continued #1 classes. Now assuming Weis still gets fired, we might have won 1 or 2.   Dollar drink night?   I won $400 in amazon gift cards for winning a GameFAQs contest.   [I found two guys for her.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPy1D-bsFDE)   This guy is way more excited than he should be for a lot of things. Learn a new description. Almost as much as he says artsy fartsy.   Plus there's the prospect of not going to the compass bowl this year.   Reminds me of Paul Finch from American Pie.   Nothing sets the mood like fucking in a cemetery.   Sergio Brown. Was surprised to see him get to the NFL at all, and now he's played 3 years and doesn't seem to be going away. He was bad on a terrible defense while he was here. Couldn't tackle at all. Or cover anyone.   I read yepp in the voice of Dave Hester from storage wars.   I like that he felt he needed to have hahas all the way to the 140 character limit.   Doesn't everyone play for the national championship game for at least the first week? You're at least playing for it until you lose.   You've clearly never been to youtube.   Aside from all the incredibly uncomfortable adjectives, the names should really be reversed so they line up with whose name it is. Unless it's a girl named Ross and a boy named Hannah.   At our campus gym over the summer, a lot of local high school football players would come in. A few of them would come in and sit at the bicep machine for 30 minutes, doing one of the lowest weights you could do, and then leave. Gotta get big.   People get excited to go to Alabama for the academics?   I have a friend who always makes the same face in pictures when he's drunk. We made an album of all 100 or so pictures he's done it in.   It's like when someone selling cars goes into the back to talk to their manager. Trying to negotiate and telling you what an opportunity you'd be missing.   It was my first question when he said he was a professional gambler.   It's called bargaining.   I like to imagine this is a form letter where you can circle which ones you'd like him to be.   When all else fails, compare the girl you're trying to impress to a man.   hi every1 im new!!!!!!! *holds up spork* my name is katy but u can call me t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m!!!!!!!! lol...as u can see im very random!!!! thats why i came here, 2 meetrandom ppl like me ^_^... im 13 years old (im mature 4 my age tho!!) i like 2 watch invader zim w/ my girlfreind (im bi if u dont like it deal w/it) its our favorite tv show!!! bcuz its SOOOO random!!!! shes random 2 of course but i want 2 meet more random ppl =) like they say the more the merrier!!!! lol...neways i hope 2 make alot of freinds here so give me lots of commentses!!!!DOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --- me bein random again ^_^ hehe...toodles!!!!! love and waffles, *~t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m~*   Obviously you want one of those two options.   There's always a few kickers or punters every once in a while that played rugby or soccer. That's usually about it.   Hell we had 4 years in a row in the 80s where a QB from ND named Joe was starting in the Super Bowl.   Ringo's the Beatle of choice?   Yeah definitely the Stanford game. Even the rain just made it so much more exciting. Was just a ridiculous game. Granted my memories of it are pretty hazy, though. Gameday was fun as hell, too. And since we'd already beaten Michigan earlier, it was the last team I needed us to beat to not go 0-4 against anyone while I was here.   When I was in 1st grade I wanted to be a paleontologist but my teacher couldn't spell it so when we drew pictures of what we wanted to be I had to be an astronaut.   Time to take his talents to South Beach.   The amount of people I see wearing shit like jeans and sweaters and polos is ridiculous. And not even just lifting which is bad enough, but doing cardio like the stationary bike and elliptical. That's gotta be either really uncomfortable, or you're not working out hard enough to do anything.   Easily my favorite part.   Somebody took introductory psych and polisci.   The ESPN commercial wasn't lying! They really do say Roll Tide randomly and in awkward situations!   There's also the fact that you only graduate about half your players. And it's even worse if you're black. If you're just trying to go somewhere with good academics, why not go somewhere that's going to make sure you graduate? Schools like Notre Dame, Northwestern, Stanford, Rice and Duke all graduate over 85% of players. Hell Notre Dame actually graduates a higher percentage of black players than white.   And part of the only brother sister anchor team in America! Or something like that.   He didn't get fired but somebody posted a picture of his dress code at Epic. I showed it to a friend of mine who works there and she told me he'd get in trouble for it. A week later she texted me saying the guy got called out at a staff meeting or something.   Wow at that 2007 class of QBs. That's one hell of a deep class.   And then Bruce Almighty for whatever reason decided to do a real number for the theatrical release.    At least they won.   Those are Michigan fans complaining. We're the ones that dropped the series. And we dropped it to play games with the ACC.   Maybe I'm missing something, but what does Sandlot have to do with Notre Dame? Or did you just digress into sports movies from 1993 you don't like?   A guy in my dorm freshman year was named James Crowe. Never went by Jim.   I lived across the street with a family whose son was named Gehrig. Their other son was Nolan. Middle name Ryan.   1, 2, and 4. I went there, my dad went there, and I lived in South Bend until I was 14.   Shocker: sports stories get romanticized over the years!   Who gets excited for tax day? Unless you're an accountant who's excited to get a little bit of a break.      I have a friend who until she was 20 didn't realize you could have sex during the day. Someone made a joke about daytime sex or something and she looks at us all wide eyed and asks "Really?" Apparently she'd somehow managed to skip sex ed when she switched schools in high school. This was coupled with the fact that we can't have anyone of the opposite sex in our dorms between midnight and 9 on weeknights and 2 and 9 on weekends. She assumed it was to stop people from fucking, which is also technically against our rules. That defines sheltered.   Hell I go to Notre Dame and even all our science professors believe in evolution.   USC: Their weather. Right now at least.   Personally I think one should be the N, M, and Iowa division, and the other one can just be the other division.   If they changed their mascot to that it would make me so happy.   I've got a few.  My freshman roommate tried to give the head nod to Jimmy Clausen. Clausen shook his head at him.  Was in a seminar with our punter, Ben Turk. On several occasions the professor just called him punter. His text message noise was also "Where the white women at?" from Blazing saddles.  Used to play basketball with some of the football players at the gym. As the biggest guy in our group who played some center in middle school, I always got stuck guarding the linemen. The worst was Kapron Lewis-Moore. Dude had over 100 pounds and about 3 inches in height on me. I've never had to box out harder in my life.  My favorite story is of a friend of mine though. She's from Spain, so she doesn't really follow football, even as a Notre Dame student. But she was in a fairly small major, and Eric Olsen, our center, was also in that major. She was leaving class with him one day when they run into one of Olsen's friends. He tells her it's his friend Mike. She asks if he's on the football team, and he says yes. Then she asks what position he plays. Dude just looks at Olsen and asks if she's for real. Olsen has to apologize and say she's from Spain. Mike was Michael Floyd.   I was pretty convinced it would be him. Doubtful now though. Maybe in his honor we can have a blank cover.   Ironic because all of Holy Cross in Rudy is from Notre Dame.   Different girl, not Alex either.   And everyone know Frankie's is the best BBQ in town anyway.   I know a guy named James Crowe. He doesn't go by Jim.   The chem one is false, but the others are true.    He was dating someone before, too. Different girl.   I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out because I knew he wasn't actually dating her. He was dating someone else at the time. He even just called her a friend early on I believe. This probably led to less shock when it all came out. Though I'd never have guessed she didn't exist. I'm pretty sure he was in on it to some degree due to rumblings I've heard, but to what I'm not sure.  As for ND fans in general, the student body seems to be pretty skeptical of him, the rest of the fan base who doesn't know him as well is pretty much buying his story entirely.      Yeah Tyler Eifert is in a one credit class right now because he's already graduated from what I've heard.   I always thought it was funny when I'd see someone go in to a PG-13 movie by themselves and pay the 12 year old price.   My guess is it had more to do with the buyout. I think once Purdue's or Michigan State's become a little more manageable we'll probably replace one of them for Michigan.   Ours are actually fairly smart for the most part. We had a guy a few years ago who was the first player ever I believe to be in law school while playing.   They weren't from players. They were from some other kid who I assume was in his dorm.   The Lennay Kekua Car Crash Cancer Foundation.   Once it had happened, I thought they handled the Declan case well. My bigger issue is it never should have happened.  For Lizzy Seeberg, obviously what happened to her is terrible. However, non-rape sexual assaults are incredibly difficult to prosecute. It all comes down to he said she said. In this case, there were inconsistencies between even what she said versus her friends. This all makes it really difficult to do anything about. I'l agree that the non-athlete friend was a complete dumbass and should have been punished for what he did assuming they could get a consensus he did it.   Sadly no, that's Stanford. We just have people who will date imaginary girls rather than someone actually at the school.   There basically hasn't been any point recently where he hasn't been with someone that was real and went here or SMC. It was what confused the shit out of me when the whole thing started in September.   What a coincidence. My dorm is right by a grassy knoll.   On the bright side it improved your chances at the Fullmer Cup.   Hell I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out about this whole thing for months. I knew he wasn't actually dating her, never would have guessed she wasn't a person.   But does his girlfriend exist?   Made by Apple.   I've also been told there was a girl who broke up with him in September when this all came out because he told her he'd made it all up.   I can confirm this. He was dating someone in september too.   Token ND student here. That never was a question because he was hitting on girls. He was dating someone when the story came out from everything I've heard. We all thought the original story was weird.   I have those same Hulk hands.   As soon as the divisions came out all ESPN could talk about was N M and Iowa. I then remember that this is the Legends division because Michigan isn't in leaders even though it's in their fight song.   Or he wants everyone to know he had a girlfriend at one point.    I learned from the Scooby Doo movie that if you eat too many peppers and you don't have  anything to drink ketchup can cool down your tongue.   We tried to do this this year to let Manti play in Hawaii at the end of the year. Couldn't make it work.   That or: Kelly: So I'm really excited to be moving up to the NFL with the Eagles.  Eagles: Yeah we're not so interested in you after all.  Kelly: Shit, better go back to ND.   So who's not irrelevant? LSU lost Saban to the NFL. USC lost Carroll. Stanford lost both Harbaugh to the NFL and Willingham to ND (They could have kept him). So unless we're arguing that Alabama is the only relevant school, then I'm not sure what makes this any different.   Twist: He does the press conference in ladies' underwear.   Davie had a much better resume than Diaco does at this point. Plus he'd actually been interim head coach for a game where we blew out Vandy I believe.   Notre Dame actually lives its boat shoes.   Please no more assaulting police officers.   I honestly don't think I've ever seen a worse recruiter than Ty Willingham.   Also Urban Meyer and Nick Saban because they're both definitely interested.   No, nothing should be done to limit what Lane does or USC. He should be in charge of as much as possible there.   I fully support this.   I don't mind it as much in the acronym. I think actually saying The Ohio State University is kind of obnoxious, yes, but in the acronym it at least makes it less confusing considering how many OSUs there are.   In fairness, that was the year where the upperclassmen were from the classes where Ty hadn't recruited oline at all.     	100
 I'd imagine one must be a really desperate alcoholic to be using that to smuggle booze into work.   That's why the other guy is bald...chemo therapy    I'll take 7 please!   Really? ._.   I get that too. I'd stumble on a subject in the Internet, like for example Zero-Point energy. Then later that same day, Im talking to friends then someone else brings up the subject of infinite energy...and I just reading about it earlier that day. It's rare thing that happens. It still happened enough times to make me reconsider, how can this all be possibly just mere coincidence? This phenomenon baffles me. Is there any explanation to this?     	6
 Besides airsoft I'm guessing you guys have different hobbies too, so what stuff do you guys like to do?  I like to play instruments with a small circle of friends, and we kind of have a band but it isn't anything too serious. I love to play guitar, and [I also collect guitars.] (http://i.imgur.com/5dlTnM2.jpg)   To the left is my BC Rich Warlock. I paid about $700 for this guitar.   To the right is my custom Jackson that a friend of the family rebuilt and repainted. This project was overall about $1000.     Here's a [picture of my main guitar] (http://i.imgur.com/wZBJ1ja.jpg) that I play the most. It's a custom Fender Stratocaster that the same guy made custom tailored to my size, it has a scalloped neck because it's the most comfy way for me to play, and custom pickups that sound better while playing in the basement. This guitar was the most pricey at a cool $2,600.   I also watch a shit ton of anime and play video games.   Edit: Oopsy I also have a [drum set,] (http://i.imgur.com/VtsZo9a.jpg) but I don't play drums as much anymore. Usually I just teach my friend who plays the beats or what he needs to play.   Wait what's that white part in the edge of the shot? Well we put a [black light] (http://i.imgur.com/bVMqn9A.jpg) above the drums for shits and giggles, then the white part is a [poster] (http://i.imgur.com/yLc842c.jpg) from an old school project. Put them together and you get something [kind of ominous.] (http://i.imgur.com/32HCzoD.jpg) Thought I'd throw this in because I thought it was funny.    I was just wondering what would happen if I put a few packages of 8x10 printer paper in my dishwasher. This got me thinking of intrusive thoughts.   You guys got any good ones?    Is it just me or have the past few days been an ocean of self posts?   I guess I can't complain because I just asked a question, but I don't flood the place with questions.   I also made a few water puns in there, so if you sea what I did I'll be on my wave.    I've looked high and low on YouTube and forums for reviews of this gun, and I haven't turned up with much. I read a good review from Booligan about the gun, but otherwise I can only find reviews on the Marui Mac 10.   Would this gun be worth getting with a few extra magazines for a bit of CQB fun, or is this gun too much of a hassle and a waste of time? Any input on the topic or other great AEP's would be great.    I just finished watching an anime called Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo so this is kind of a reference, but what color are you?  I think I'm orange. I am enthusiastic like yellow, and I like red.      [This is my current wallpaper and probably my favorite] (http://i.imgur.com/lUZpvyV.jpg)  [Next would be this.] (http://i.imgur.com/EvJJkaA.png) The resolution is kind of meh, but it doesn't look too bad.   [Then this.] (http://i.imgur.com/ZFva2Cl.jpg)  As you can see all anime related, eh I don't really care. I would have one of my airsoft gun wallpaper [like this] (http://i.imgur.com/Db68anX.jpg) but I'm going to be using my laptop for school work and my school is very strict about looking at guns. I got banned from school computers for a year for being on Call of Duty Elite and building classes it's so bad.     Since it's almost 4:00 in the morning I'll count this for yesterday, but I peed in a Dr.Pepper bottle and filled it all the way up to the top.   Your guys' achievements of the day?   I was just nominated by a friend, but I said no. Everyone got really upset, and I had to explain to them that I didn't care, and didn't want to get wet.       [Here's the image itself.] (http://i.imgur.com/0jEWYT7.jpg)  If you could make it slowly zoom in on his eyes, but with text like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/dhbi6dD.jpg) but have the text stay in the same place?  Edit: Pleeeeease?      This obviously isn't the case with every anime in the universe, but every one I've watched I've **loved** the opening songs. Are there any ones that suck?   He keeps telling me that he got "totally legit" m frames at a state fair for twenty dollars. Yeah. Right.   But he keeps telling me he's going to wear them while we play and it pisses me off. He said he won't shoot them to test them out because he doesn't want to sacrifice his "good deal."   To put it shortly, he's a dumb fuck who's going to go blind if I don't intervene. What do?   [The picture itself.] (http://i.imgur.com/kSqlAIb.jpg)  If someone here could make it vibrate, similar to [this] (http://i.imgur.com/bm7LeZr.gif) then that would be awesome. Thanks!   For me?  [Then] (http://i.imgur.com/l0AnGBO.jpg) and [Now.] (http://i.imgur.com/sYFX2tS.jpg)  *Cringe*       I didn't want to share it with my camera guy loadout album on /r/airsoft, so I'll post a seperate album [here.] (http://imgur.com/a/T26Ny)  [Camera guy album I'm talking about] (http://imgur.com/a/HNjGu)               At the end of [the .gif] (http://i.imgur.com/4EZuska.gif) it turns into a negative color scheme/filter. If someone here could just cut out that part that would be awesome. Thanks!  Edit: Sorry, where are my manners? Please..?   I probably don't have a favorite because I stumble on so many a day, but I'd have to say right now some of my favorites are,   [This] (http://i.imgur.com/SJ7IuCg.gif)  [Then this] (http://i.imgur.com/pRbDVzL.gif)  [Maybe this] (http://i.imgur.com/GZzB4YT.gif)  [This] (http://i.imgur.com/yUeVFn2.gif)  [And this] (http://i.imgur.com/rcZxQb1.gif)    I usually need to get rides from people to get to my shitty job. I've never liked working there, so when I couldn't get a ride tonight I said fuck it.   This has been the first time in awhile I've felt like I was in control of what's happening to me. That job doesn't make me happy, so fuck it. It's not like they'll fire me for missing a day and not showing up. If they do, I don't care either because I hate it there.    I know, I know it sounds gay, ineffective, etc. but hear me out.   I was thinking about my perfect comfortable/effective kit, and I was also thinking about solid color loadouts. Now one time with some friends we we're messing around and playing some pick up games after the day was over. At this point I had taken off my BDU pants, and put back on my usual **mens** skinny jeans (like that matters really.)  Here's the thing, they didn't really restrict my movement as much as I thought, and they were still comfy as fuck.   Next, would be my next loadout choice, I want to try something different and do an all tan loadout. I know this won't blend well, but I don't really care. I usually push up and run anyways. The whole point of this is really, would khaki skinny jeans looks goofy with an airsoft kit? I don't think it would look that bad.    Since this is chat and shit I'm assuming this is allowed.   My favorite color is orange. Style of red and enthusiasm of yellow.    I know that Pandora exists, but this song is from an anime so I was assuming I wouldn't be able to find anything in English with a similar style. [This is the song is any of yall are curious, I ain't ashamed.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDnB6Sjw9BM)   I mean I'm not going to kill myself, but Robin Williams killing himself got me thinking. I always thought it wasn't selfish, and never understood why people thought so. I just thought Robin Williams killing himself is proof that it isn't selfish, because he seemed so happy and healthy but he wasn't all along. Just proves how easy it is to put on a fake smile and pretend to be happy, I guess sometimes it's a part of the job.    So I got a pair of Condor Knee Pads that are very loose and I can't tighten them to my fit. I don't feel like getting out the sewing machine because,   A. My skills are rusty.  and  B. I'm lazy and it'll look like shit because all I have is black thread (the knee pads are tan.)  So do you guys have any suggestions? I'm a small guy with small knees, and I need knee pads. I have some old Pro Tech pads from my mom because she plays roller derby and she gave me her old pads. I would use the Pro Techs but they don't look "totally uber oper8ter" enough for me.   Edit: I'm checking out these [BLACKHAWK!] (http://www.amazon.com/BLACKHAWK-Advanced-Tactical-Knee-Pads/dp/B005GA7MWS/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t) ones but it sucks because I have no way of telling whether or not they'll work for small legs/knees. This is the case with all knee pads.      If someone had a nerf sword or capable melee weapon, do you think they could [deflect airsoft BB's like Kirito does with bullets in the series?] (http://i.imgur.com/oX2Ot96.gif)  I mean at certain distances you can see BB's coming just like the bullet paths in the show, so there must be a chance of it working? Just curious, it's not like I'm going to do it, just seems interesting to me.  Edit: Clarified stuff for clarity or some shit   I just got it again, while browsing Evike's new products today. Now I'm going to be eye balling [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/48746/) baby for awhile. I have a fuck ton of GBBR magazines piled up in my gear cabinet that I can put to use now too.   This happen to any of you guys recently?         * It's my day off and I got up at 12:00 pm.  * My dad brought pizza home for dinner.  * Two of my good friends stopped over for a cup of coffee and to chat before pre-season football practice.  Turning out to be a pretty good for a rainy day!   [Part 1] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckofd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)  [Part 2] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckpo8/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)  **We left off with me making a channel and starting to play airsoft again**  So I got about $1000 worth of gear because I don't go anywhere or spend money. The airsoft stuff ends here because I'm starting my tour of public fields with my friend when I get my license. Otherwise back to the girl of the story,  Things didn't work out with [neckbeard] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) and her. She almost turned to self harm, and I stayed up until five o' clock on the phone with her to calm her down. This was just mid July. We agreed to coffee and just catching up.  She told me about what happened with her and neckbeard. He insisted she dress up in public, and then he tried raping her but she beat him up. I came clean about losing my virginity, and then the unexpected happened. She started to cry. I couldn't help it either and I started to cry as well. The thing is, is that I love her, and she loved me. In the end I wish I would have lost my virginity to her.  Blah blah that's lame. We began hanging out more and by the end of July we were (and are) back together. Now it's going into August, the tenth is coming up! Now we hang out all day, and I might even ask if I can spend the night one of these days.   Well that's the story of my struggle with depression, and how I fell in love and shit. This tenth will be the seventh month for me cut free!  If you actually read all of this boring shit, then thanks. If not then it'll be archived and chilling out on the internet for people of the future to read.    **Where we left off something neckbeard guy blah blah** [Link to previous post.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckofd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)  Okay continued.   Around January I forgot to mention I got a job as a dishwasher and this comes up a bit here and there but I'll get to that in a bit. Overall it helped me make friends, and try pot for the first time! (I don't use it all the time don't worry, like once a month at most)  Around April/May I started talking to my next girlfriend a lot more. She was so cold though. She never cared about me in the slightest. I wouldn't say I fell back into depression by any means, but I felt like I had to fight for my next girlfriends attention. I was willing to do anything to make her happy, that's the only thing that hurts a little. She wanted to have sex, and I wasn't really comfortable. At the time I was willing to do anything and if she wanted to, "Bond bodies" or some shit, whatever. That's how I lost my virginity. To be flat out I thrusted and watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia until she said she was done. It was terrible...   I broke up with her after that, and it only lasted two weeks. After that I felt neglected, used, and I was on the verge of hurting. At work things were getting better at least though. I wanted to cook, and one of my dreams was to cook. I was confused, I wanted money, and I didn't care about anything at this point. This next part of my story gets darker, and I think about it a lot.  Around May/June to move up I got the main dishwasher fired. He was already slow, but still fast enough to be proficient at his job. I knew he was from the town over, and got in trouble for being in possession of marijuana all the time. I told the police department about the pot he liked to hide in his hoodie sweatshirt that he always wore.   He wasn't at the restaurant when they came, but the police barging into the restaurant was enough to get him fired. That's how step one of my plan went into action, I was lead dishwasher, and I got bumped up from $7.50 and hour to $8.25 and hour as the lead dishwasher. The only thing I thought about was how to become a cook at that point.   One of the main cooks was barely a year clean from smoking crack and just getting back on his feet. His name was Warren. He had a free ride to college on a hockey scholarship and he threw it away to do drugs all day. The boss's son was one of the cooks, and was already teaching me things here and there in his free time. I was absorbing the information well. I was learning how to prep and how to cook from watching and doing stuff in my spare time.   The hardest part was getting Warren to smoke crack again. I even hung out with him and the bosses son athis place. I tricked him, and I fucked with his head a lot. He'd still talk a lot about how it made him feel, or how amazing it was. I would entice him, and I would say things like, "It's human nature to do what you want," or "Sure it's unhealthy, but you'll be thinking about smoking it for the rest of your life."  This was about the end of June. I stay up some nights thinking about it. About how I'm a "sick mother fucker" or a terrible person. I didn't care. I wanted to cook, I wanted money, and Warren was in the way. They found him buying some in an alley a few towns over, that's what my boss told me. With that the position was mine, and I was bumped up to $9.50 an hour.   With the money I was making I decided to get back to getting my license. My test is on the 6th and I'll probably get my license. But that has nothing to do with the story, I'm just happy! I bought a car from a friend of the restaurant for $500. A '98 Monte Carlo something something, I don't know. I'm not a car guy.   I got back into airsoft, I got more gear and money, and I started up a channel with an old pal. I think I need to continue the story to part 3 but I don't know. Here's a picture of the bracelet she made me with my airsoft gear! It's the rainbow one on my left arm. http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg  [Part 3] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckqcd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)   So this is the story of how I got over my depression, and your guy's help in all of this, if you decide to read this wall of text then thanks!  It was the tenth of December, and I just turned 16 on the third. I didn't bother to get my license because I had nobody. I had a lack of friends, lack of motivation, and I just wanted to die. On the ninth I cut myself two times in the morning before school, and wore my favorite sweater to cover it up. When I got home I tried again. It felt like I had nothing more to do, and that was it. I was a hermit, and the only place I felt safe or happy was my room in the basement. I even bought a couch, and a bunch of instruments to occupy my time.  This was all on an old account, but I remember asking you guys about how to talk to people or get friends. I remember one of you said I should try talking to girls. This was weird because usually girls made fun of me and pushed me away. You guys said it would really help, and you were right! There was one person who really got me out of this, and of course you guys too :D.  I had been talking to and texting this girl from my science class for awhile beforehand, at least two months. She was really the only person who showed me genuine kindness at the time, and it felt amazing. I spiked up my hair like I like to do, put on my second favorite sweater, and got really excited. I asked her to go for a walk at her favorite place, the water tower hill. Eventually it became my favorite place to be too! She wasn't allowed to have guys over at the time so we met at the hill whenever we could. *Sorry for rambling on back to the story...*  So I remember rolling up my sleeves because it was either really hot outside, or I was nervous and really sweaty. Of course stupid me, I forgot about my cuts. When we met at the bottom of the hill she saw my cuts. I started to cry, a lot. I got embarrassed and almost ran away, that's how it always was when people saw my cuts or scars. But she grabbed my hand, it was a funny feeling and the first time I ever really held a girls hand. She told me it was okay and then she hugged me too. That was also the first genuine hug I had ever gotten (honestly my parents didn't/don't give two shits about me.)  When we got to the top of the hill, I asked her if she would think differently of me. I remember thinking, *why did I just ask?* and thought about the usual, "Well duh stupid emo" or something along those lines. No matter what I hope until the day I die, the way she smiled at me and said that it didn't matter. That it didn't change anything. That she really really liked me. I remember hugging her really really tight, and her hugging me really really tight, and it felt great. I wanted it to last forever.  The whole time we walked back to the bottom of the hill we held hands really tight. It was the first time I had smiled for more than fifteen minutes to be honest. When we got to the bottom of the hill she stopped and looked in my eyes like before. She said, "No matter what you can't never (her grammar is a little shotty at times but I think it's cute) ever hurt yourself like that again." I remember tearing up a lot, but I was still smiling. I agreed, of course I would! We hugged again and she was off to her house before her parents got mad.  The next few months we met up more and more. We talked at school **way** more than before too. She made me [this] () bracelet too so I'd, "Always be happy" and to remind me to never break our promise. Over January I met her parents, and even went bowling with them and stuff. They had excepted me, and I felt like I belonged.   Fast forward to February, we were hanging out at her house and of course Valentines day was rolling around. It was to the point where everybody knew we had a thing, or were together. At that point we never really made it official, we just had a lot of classes together and we were always together if we could be. By the time Valentines day was upon us I asked her to go for a walk, and I asked her out at the top of the hill. (Cliche but I'm not creative so whatever lol) Then I had my first kiss!   Over March though, things got bad. Her birthday was on the 13th, but I didn't remember it, I made an anti Semitic joke at dinner (turns out her father is Jewish), and we grew apart somehow. I felt sad, but I also didn't. As long as she was happy, and as long as we could still be friends.   Over April she began talking to [this] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) neckbeard guy and we all hung out together a lot. I had moved on to a different girlfriend, but things weren't the same.      I think I have to make a continued post sorry.   Edit: I FORGOT A PICTURE OF THE BRACELET D:. Oh well on the next post.   [Part 2] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckpo8/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)   [So I decided to poop in a Cheezit box, yada yada. I need tips from you guys, please it's unbearable and my family is upstairs and I think they can smell it. I don't know, please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ck0iv/serious_pooped_in_a_cheezit_box_what_do_i_do_with/)  This is a casual conversation sub so hey why not. Right?  Edit: [:D] (http://i.imgur.com/8E3mB08.jpg)   I really needed to go and I had a *shitty* day so I thought it would give me a good laugh. I wiped with a sock, and it's also in the box. It smells really bad and the majority of my family is right upstairs in the family room. What do I do please help it's terrible.   Edit: I tried pulling it out using a fly swatter like a little arm and broke open the poop and now the smell is just spreading even more please help it's in the corner of the room right now.   Edit: The smell stopped spreading because I put a bag over it but for the time being, this is only a temporary solution.  Edit: I took it upstairs in an attempt to put it in the garage or something. My dad asked for a Cheezit, and then said, "Ah what the fuck dude did you fart?" and then I ran downstairs mumbling about moderator stuff for a subreddit.   Edit: Someone asked for an update for his enjoyment, but this isn't really fun for me. My parents like to stay up late and I'm in a festering room of stench for at least three more hours. I put a scarf under the door so air doesn't escape.   Edit: The bag on the box isn't blocking anything anymore. I have an old surplus gas mask but it's only been for decoration up to this point. I'm not sure if it will work.   Edit: The mask is working a little bit, but it just smells like old books and rubber.   Edit: My parents asked me to let the dogs outside and I'm afraid they'll figure out.  Edit: Forgot a period on the last update.   Edit: I'm going to let the dogs out and take the box outside with me. I'll get the dog to eat it.   Edit: Okay the dog ate the poop, but the box is still smelly. I wouldn't be able to put it in the garbage without the smell getting everyone's attention.   Edit: What do I do with the box? My dad has a pool table and hangs out in the garage, if I put it in the garage garbage can will the smell go away by tomorrow morning?   Edit: I took the box and put it in the street adjacent to our house.   Edit: The sock is still in there.

[CADPAT and tan gear, or ACU and tan gear?] (http://imgur.com/a/F31JL)   So a friend and I are doing a two man team sort of thing and we have our channel set up and everything. Now he already had ACU and I didn't want to make him buy a new pair of BDU's so I just got ACU camo too. I also like how it looks with tan gear so I was into the idea.   But now I'm watching loadout videos on YouTube and gameplay and all of the poor, beginner, children, or noob loadouts include ACU gear of some kind. Did I make a mistake? [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg) is a picture of my current set up that I'll be running.  If it really is too bad I'll just get some Multicam BDU's for myself and then buy him some for his birthday so he doesn't have to buy any. Sure Multicam is average, but ACU is too. At least with Multicam we look a little better on the field. Right?  Edit: Fixed the picture   I got my new loadout a week early and don't have time to get down to the rock quarry for kit pictures so I'll just post my [head gear] (http://imgur.com/SjHnGff) for now.  **It goes as follows-**  Matrix MICH 2001  Matrix/Element Comtac II Replica  Revision Wolf Spider Goggles  Rothco Balaclava  Condor Tan Shemagh  Matrix or something half mesh mask  **The glasses are just for the picture I won't actually wear them in a game don't worry.** I didn't wear the mask in the picture because  I'm only wearing it when it's required.   **Edit:** Formatting shit   So I just started watching Sword Art Online. Only the third episode and I'm crying dude. I'm already hooked to say the least. Otherwise I watch Eureka 7 and other shit.   Edit: Just realized "animes" isn't the proper plural  Edit: 3:39 AM: Just watched Sword Art Online to episode 19 and might keep binge watching until I hear my parents wake up for work. Holy shit watch this show if you are reading this and haven't watched it. It is brilliant.    For me I just realized is probably waiting for new gear/guns to come to my house. Especially when it's a pricey order.       That is all. That made my day.    So I'm your average run-of-the-mill 16 year old teenage nerd dude. I just go about life right now working, and laying on the couch on Reddit. I want more, I really do, but I have one friend and nowhere to go. My only friend who's a girl, let's call her Allyson, is dating a douchey dude and she never wants to hangout now because of it. My only hobbies are watching anime, airsofting, and very seldom video games. The same song and dance. Every. Fucking. Day.  What really pisses me off is that all of the cooks at work patronize the fuck out of me even though I've been working there for eight months washing dishes for money to fuel the only hobby I have (I just watch anime online and shit, never bought anything.) One time the old pizza delivery guy even beat me with a mop. A fucking mop. I've been made fun of so much and hurt so much I just take it. I feel like an elephant at a circus every day. I can't quit or tell anyone because my dad is best friends with the restaurant owner. They all pretend to want to be my friend for shits and giggles too, and I've fallen for it twice.  The first time I went over to one of their houses with the Boss's son (Let's call him Vinny). When I walked up there were a bunch of older dudes (around 20) and all I did was stand there and wait for them to tell me to leave. I had no place there, and Vinny knew it. But no let's drag Tommy to Mitch's house just for shits and giggles. Only fun part was watching Mitch trying to pry his bong from his dog's mouth.  After all of this, I've been tricked and played. I just don't care. They poke and pry and tell me to "hang out" or shit. I just don't care. Even if something could be genuine I shrug it off. I've been broken. I've shrugged everything off lately. I've accepted laying here, drinking my coffee, with my eyes locked on this screen for at least five hours at a time. When I'm alone like this it's the only time I feel like I'm me. I don't know what to do, how to change, or who I am.   This past eight months has changed me so much, and I don't know the real me. I sleep a lot and lucid dream because it's a great escape to be honest. I go to work at 5:00 pm so I just sleep until 4:00 pm so nobody bugs me. I then work and try to shrug off the hate as much as I can, and then I go home and cry. I cry for like a half an hour and then I sit on forums and shit until 4:00 am and then go to sleep and start again.   My parents have noticed me changing now too and I'm afraid. My facial expressions have died, my sense of humor dulled, and I just don't feel like getting up. My parents have started accusing me of drinking or drugs. I don't even listen, I just drown it out so I can go back downstairs and be alone. The only genuine joy I've felt lately was three days ago when I went for a walk at the water tower hill where I used to walk with Allyson. I lied back in the grass and thought about how we used to watch clouds and she'd just say random things that she didn't even see.   I don't know. I just don't care. I don't want to kill myself because it'll hurt. I've been 7 months self harm free because I promised Allyson I wouldn't because she's 10 months self harm free. Also, she made me this bracelet and sometimes I see it and think about her. But what do I do? What can a kid do when he's so broken that he doesn't know who he is. I don't care. That's all I can do.       I was just wondering, because this girl I like quit talking to me because I like airsoft and I like dressing up to play. But here's the kicker, she started talking to [this guy] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10430853_809480539097194_7650496038351710603_n.jpg?oh=e9dfa016be3761652c705cabbd718768oe=544D8B30__gda__=1413517241_5a9916b7dcf375335d8557da08511eab) who is probably one of the most cliche neck-beard cosplayers I've seen. What do you guys think?            So I had nothing better to do when I got up at 1:00 pm, I went back to bed and set an alarm for 2:00 pm. When I fell asleep I first remember being in my room, and I got up and went to the kitchen. I told myself, "This is a dream, I can do what I want."  Then I heard gun shots and I saw a bad guy pretty far off, but near my house. I looked down and there was a sniper rifle in my hands. I shot the bad guy, and then I thought, "I wish my friend Alex was here."  "Hey Tommy we got two more out front," IT WAS MY FRIEND. NUH UH.  So I shot one guy who was out front and another guy and then I went downstairs and my friend disappeared. Then I woke up.   But the whole time I was aware of the fact it was a dream and I thought up the gun and my friend right? It felt like I was totally in control.    I'm too afraid to tell my parents, or my friends but I've been seeing things. It started about a year ago, and I've had this inner monologue thing. It isn't my voice though. It's a calm male voice, around the age of twenty. He just *narrates* and **narrates** with breaks every once in awhile. I've read up about violent voices and violent things and it's just this damn narrating. Hell it's even talking right now. I just call the voice Josh. In my Spanish class one time it was being particularly annoying and I couldn't help but yell out, "Shut the hell up."  Now Josh has kept talking and still does a lot. But three months ago is where it really gets scary for me. I was taking a walk at my favorite place near the town water tower. As I walked down the path I saw a white dog, and it was really furry. When I walked closer I clapped my hands a bit and said, "Come here" and then the dog just disappeared. It didn't vanish or like vaporize, it was just gone.   What do I do? I'm too afraid to tell anybody and I'm afraid it will get worse. I'm only 16 and I'm really really really scared. I've heard of far worse cases and I'm afraid people will call me crazy or send me somewhere. What do I do?   I do realize how rare they are since they're discontinued everywhere and nobody seems to have one at all. Usually I am very against buying used guns and gear, but this is my last chance.    [Bam.] (http://i.imgur.com/EIV1Fdf.jpg)  [Boom.] (http://i.imgur.com/7kNagaU.jpg)  [And why the fuck not?] (http://i.imgur.com/ZxI8EDo.jpg)         Are [these] (http://www.amazon.com/Military-Equipment-Paintball-Tactical-Multicam/dp/B00K7CP35S/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8qid=1405811555sr=8-10keywords=emerson+combat+pants) legit?   For years and even to this day I've had the same dream a few times a week and I've never figured out why. What happens is I'm stuck on my couch (I sleep on a couch instead of bed) and I can't move at all. Then two giant rat men walk into the room and look straight at me, and these guys are **really really** scary looking.   At this point they both look at eachother and whisper something into eachother's ears. They look at me again and instantly materialize chairs in their hands, and take a seat. Then they sit there and stare at me. They just **stare** this terrifying death stare.  The only way for me to wake up is to whisper, *"Mom"* for a really long time three times and then I wake up in the position that I was in the dream. Arms right to my side, and looking right at the door.  Does this have to do with lucid dreaming? I think it must have something to do with it.    That is all. I just wish guys could wear hats with cat ears on them and shit. I think they're funny, and I also like how they look. I just wish I could without looking like I'm gay or an Asian chick.    I lost a friend on Xbox that I met while on a cruise a year or so ago. His name was Dmitri. He was seventeen years old. He was a really really nice guy and he was on his way home from vacation with his grandparents. He liked Minecraft, various animes, and he was planning on going to go to college to be an anesthesiologist.   When I sent him some messages today wondering if he was up for some Battlefield 4 I didn't get a response right away. His mother replied and told me to join a private chat. Though her English was rough, she got the message across that her son had been on the plane. I told her that her son was a great guy and that I was sorry for her loss.   I just wanted to share this so more people would know he was a great guy, and he was a human being who deserved more than this. Everyone on that plane was.   Edit: lost not lose oops    So usually I've used my parents laptop or computer or the family computer for everything (I'm only 16). I built this laptop with the help of my uncle who loves computer stuff, and this is my first computer that's actually mine.   Right now I am typing from the toilet, taking a shit while on a laptop, and buying the complete collection of Eureka 7 on Amazon. I haven't been this genuinely happy for awhile.   Edit: Done pooping. Never used a laptop at all while pooping, this was my first time. Also, Eureka 7 complete collection coming next week.   I'm at about $2,500 or so since I've started if I roughly do the math.   JG AUG-$175.00  Echo 1 SOF 2- $260.00  Sniper My Mom Found At A Garage Sale- $50  Matrix M4- $280.00  WE Open Bolt M4- (On Sale) $260-something  Magazines for WE Open Bolt x4- $150    First Gear Order- $300  Second Gear Order- $250  Third (And upcoming kit) Gear Order- $500   So that's about.. $2,300 excluding shipping stuff. What about you guys?               All I remember is this kid and this girl. The girl was somewhat mean to the boy and rode a scooter. Also it was in a city but it had to whole, "Can't leave my life sucks" vibe. PLEASE HELP.  Edit: FOOLY COOLY found it sorry    So I'm contemplating my next addition to the armory. I've always loved SCAR's, and I've always turned back to SCAR's when looking for a gun I truly want.   When I was first thinking of GBBR's I almost got the WE Open Bolt SCAR-L. When I wanted to do a designated marksman loadout I thought of getting the VFC SCAR-H SSR. But out of all of these a SCAR-H really stuck out.  Since there isn't a GBB SCAR-H, the VFC isn't blow-back, and P* or Daytona Guns are out of the question I was immediately drawn to the [SCAR-H Recoil Shock by Tokyo Marui] (http://echigoya-guns.com/guns/index.php?route=product/productpath=36_35product_id=446).  How is the gun overall? I can't find many reviews, but from what I've seen it seems like a gun I can run for a really long time. Would it be good for medium range to longer ranges? I don't like to upgrade and would like a good stock gun. Anyways, any help would be awesome.   [I made this.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyl9rq_jVG4feature=youtu.be)      So I just watched the majority of Eureka 7: AO and I don't see why so many people hate it. Eureka 7 is my favorite anime, and Eureka 7: AO isn't that bad of a show either. Why does it get so much hate?   Just wondering if anybody here has taken cosplay to the next level and attempted a Simon "Ghost" Riley loadout from MW2. Now I know Call of Duty gets a lot of hate on this subreddit and in the airsoft community in general, but it's a very interesting kit to me.   I have everything figured out to do a Ghost loadout and might order some gear and show up to the field in a Ghost loadout and surprise everyone. I just want to know if it's worth it or if I'll get made fun of.      I really want a side arm now, but I don't know what to do/get. I don't want a gas gun or a pistol, and I want something unique.   I was thinking of maybe a shotgun, but shotguns seem cumbersome to carry. I was also thinking of the JG Scorpion, but I'm afraid that it will suck.   One idea was the Tokyo Marui MP7 on a drop-leg holster but my dad won't order for me from overseas.   Ideas? Help?   So after reading some stories here I thought this was another fun subreddit to come on and read some stories.  Well today I was talking to this girl I've been talking to for awhile. Usually she'll get hurt by some guy or something and I'll always be her shoulder to cry on blah blah. Well we've been good friends for the better part of the last two years and lately she seemed interested in me so I came up with a plan to ask her out.  So I call her up, ask how she's doing, and ask if she wants to go for a walk at our favorite place to talk. She says yeah, but she wanted to bring a friend. I say sure and I meet her at the top of the hill by the water tower like always. But as I was walking up I could swear I could here a guy's voice.  Whatever, keep walking it's probably just her manly friend Hannah. As I turn the corner to look and sit next to her like I always do that's when I saw her kissing some dude. I don't know who is he is and never did before.   Now me being as awkward as I've always been can only mutter, "Hey um hi hey so sorry bye sorry." and run off in tears. But as I reached about half way down the road I stopped. I realized I don't give a fuck, and I don't care. I've been chasing her for this long, and have been lead on for this long. Why should I keep chasing? The dude looked like he was about twenty (we're both 16) so she'll get hurt anyways.   Well thanks a lot /r/howtonotgiveafuck you really helped me with this and helped me realize how to not care.    I'll just paste it here quick, I need opinion on if this would be a good enough start to a short zombie survival comedy film. I'm not very good with formatting so bear with me.  **Scene 1 (Scene fades in and two people are seen. One slaving over a sink, the other drying.)**  **Tommy: (Wiping his sweaty forehead with his fore-arm)** Man...  **Dalton: (Turning to Tommy from his drying station)** When the heck do we get to leave? I have lonely videogames and soda waiting at home.  **Tommy: (Jokingly punching him)** Probably soon.  **(His boss walks in)**  **Vinny: (His voice is joking)** Hey **(whatever nickname he uses at the time)**, hey Dalton. Go sweep and mop the back, put that stuff away, and I'll have you out of here.  **Tommy: (His eyes light up)** Oh. Y-yeah! Okay. **(He grabs his towel and wipes his hands)**  **Dalton: (He goes to put away a container and drops it)** Dang!  **Tommy: (He picks it up and sighs. He goes to put it back in the machine)** Ah man.  **Vinny: (He grabs the container)** Hey it's fine, not like it'll start a super zombie pandemic huh?  **Tommy: (He laughs nervously)** Huh yeah probably not.  **(Camera zooms in as Vinny puts away the container on the stack of other containers. Their laughter is heard in the background as the scene cuts out abruptly. The title slams over the black screen)**   **Scene 2 (The scene cuts back in abruptly in a similar fashion as before. A text box that says, "3 Months Later" cuts into the scene just like the title. As the next scene plays out actors and music names will fade in. Tommy is sitting on a log at what appears to be a garabage dump)**       I was looking at shotguns like I always do because I've always dreamed of a Zombie Survivor kit. Anyway, I was looking and I want an M870 because they are more survivor-esque and more civilians have them than M3's.   But I've come to realize most shotguns are either single shot M870's by GP or Tri-Shot M3 variants by Matrix, JG, blah blah all the same.   Why haven't they made a **SPRING** tri-shot M870?   So for fun I started a band with some friends, and it's gotten a little more serious. We need some sort of logo but I have no clue where to start because of our name. Our band name is The Real Crime Stoppers, just because we thought it was funny. How would I make a logo or symbol for that? I have no clue where to start.   So when I order my new gear I'm going to do a helmet, goggles, and half mask combo with my headset. [Here] (http://imgur.com/tTpNJvH) is something I threw together in photoshop to get it planned out. What do you guys think? I want to paint a design on the half mask, and I planned on doing the [Smiling Titan's mouth] (http://x3.fjcdn.com/comments/Nothing+scares+people+more+than+teeth+that+arent+supposed+to+_9e1b288a22ff818decbda3a985965229.jpg) from the Attack on Titan series because it seemed unique and cool.    Would I be able to take [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/46036/) mount and stick it to a mask to use a GoPro?               I'll just make this a text post. Over the next few days just submit stuff here for the banner art. Otherwise, it's almost complete.   I'm pretty dead set on getting this camo for my next kit, and was wondering if any of you guys use it. I searched the sub and couldn't find anything. If anybody has pictures of how it looks with tan gear that would be cool.  edit: [What it looks like] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/GWB_choc_chip_camo.JPG)         Tango down   DAE?   So with my drivers test around the corner I'm going to look for public fields. One field that got my attention was [Black Ops Airsoft] (http://www.blackops-airsoft.com/index.html) in Zion, Illinois.   Has anybody been to this field? If so, how is the gameplay, area, or overall how the field is? Also one more question, I have a list of must haves if I'm going.  **1. Mask-** I'm getting [this mask] (http://www.evike.com/products/44222). Is mesh stuff okay? If not I'll just get a Dye mask or something.  **2. Gun Case-** I know I'll need to get a case, so I'll make sure to get that.  **3. Barrel Condom (hehe)-** This is what I see people put on their guns in videos at public field, so would [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/24715) suffice?  **4. Lastly, Dead Rag-** I'm assuming any old piece of red cloth would do, but I'm getting one with the Evike logo just to represent.  **5. New Spring-** So I'm getting a new [spring] (http://www.evike.com/products/31455/) since my FPS is really high on my gun. Will I be able to just throw this bad boy in my gun and be good to go?  Otherwise, I think I got everything down and I'm ready to go once I order everything. Am I missing anything?    So I've been seeing a girl for at least a year, and we just decided to make it "Facebook Official". I feel comfortable enough with her now and I want to believe she's the one. I'm only seventeen right now, and I would be totally content without being sexually active, all I really want to do is cuddle and stuff.  So we were hanging out today and she brought up the idea of sex. I thought, "Well that would be fun." I care enough about her to give her my virginity. But should I? She really really wants to at this point. I'm up for it, but I don't know if I should. I've never been in a relationship where I didn't bring up the idea.   She said something about wanting to, "Bond our bodies physically," and "Become closer" or something. She's also 17, but not a virgin. Should I go through with this? Will it jeopardize anything? I'm totally blind on the subject and have no clue what to do. HELP.          I've seen a boat load of reviews of the older versions of this pistol, but not many reviews on this gun. Would it be worth the money? I need to pick up my first side arm and I really want a pistol. Thoughts? Concerns?   [The gun itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/45591).   This is my current set up I'm going to be running for the better part of this summer. I've always loved the look of the average PMC kit so I went in that direction. Please excuse the tactical skinny jeans, I just got off of school and at the time I took these pictures and I was as giddy as a child on Christmas. Don't fret, I use eye-pro, I just left them at a friends house. For the purpose of picture, I thought my casual prescriptions would be fine.   [FUCK WHEN EVER I TRY TO FORMAT PRETTY THE IMAGES ARE TINY SO HAVE AN ALBUM OF THE PICTURES NORMAL] (http://imgur.com/a/ArEwK)   **KIT LIST FROM TOP TO BOTTOM**  **Hat-** Basic tactical cap from Condor  **Patch-** Sassy MilSpec Monkey patch  **Comms-** Just a basic Element headset  **Shemagh-** Basic black and white Condor shemagh  **Jacket-** Just a Condor Softshell Jacket, nothing special  **Patch-** Hazard PVC American Flag Patch  **Chest Rig-** No name brand I added to the cart   **Dump Pouch-** Just a Condor Drop Leg dump pouch  **Knee Pads-** Standard Condor quick release knee pads  **Sling-** GP sling plate, came with a one-point sling  Other than that I'll probably just get some Khaki's or some blue jeans to finish off the kit.   **GUN** It's a bone stock WE Open Bolt M4 I posted a little while back with a previous kit. I run four magazines right now, but plan to get at least six more (I'm very trigger happy.) Otherwise I hope you enjoyed my kit, and I tried to keep everything as detailed and nice as possible.    So the JG AUG uses a standard version three gearbox if I'm not mistaken. Would I be able to just take it out and drop in a [KA Version Three Gearbox] (http://www.evike.com/products/37365/) into the gun without much trouble?    So during the recent time I airsofted I couldn't wait to field my brand new WE Open Bolt M4, but there's one problem... It was too cold.   It never occurred to me and I ended up just filming and taking pictures. But now I want a new AEG for when it is too cold out for my GBBR, and so I won't miss out on the action.  So I've narrowed down my search to two guns. My price range with everything I need to play is about $500.00 to $650.00.  I just want a gun that is guaranteed to work, that will last me awhile, and will have good performance at short to medium ranges.   My first choice is the [VFC SCAR-L] (http://www.evike.com/products/45160). I've always loved SCAR's and I've seen just about every review on this gun drooling over it.   My second choice would be the [GG GK-5C] (http://www.evike.com/products/44551/). I know this a newer gun to the airsoft scene, and I couldn't find many reviews on it. Has anybody used this gun/know anything performance wise or durability wise? It looks like a solid gun that I'd enjoy, and that would be pretty reliable.   Any help would be nice, I'm not trying to be a bother at all with a bunch of questions.    I have a shit ton of friends who smoke pot, and I'm kind of curious. About half of those friends have become fuck ups, and half are perfectly fine. Most of the people I work with at a restraunt smoke pot, and they are all fuck ups though. I don't want to end up working as a dish washer for my whole life.   I'm sixteen if that matters. I know that it won't magically transform me into a fuck up, but will I change at all if I do smoke pot? I really want to know what it's like, and I'm a 4.0 student, so I don't think indulging will effect me in any way.   My dad said if I were to it's like alchohol, some people can handle it and some people can't. Is that the case? I need advice ASAP, because I was gonna ask a friend who frequently smokes if I could try it with him one of these days.       I want to go for an MK18 build, but have a few questions on barrel length. Would I have to buy a shorter barrel for the gun? Right now I have a standard WE Open Bolt M4 and I thought the barrel was 14.5 inches, does this mean a new barrel is in order?    I don't want to spend a lot of money on a rail system for my WE Open Bolt M4, but I really want a rail system. Is it true that the Daniel Defense Omega 7 inch rail system is compatible?   [Rail system itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/31496/)         [The channel itself] (https://www.youtube.com/user/lonesofterhalberd).  After researching I finally got it to fit like I wanted in the art area. I know it's a little grainy, and I might fix that later. Just decided to get my channel fired up for the nicer weather and ready for airsoft footage. I decided to go with my main logo color and try to selective color it a bit, a little cheesy but I think it's pretty nice. Thoughts?    Will [this stock] (http://www.evike.com/products/42150) fit on the WE Open Bolt M4? Also, are there any guides on how to take off the LE stock that comes with the gun?      I was curious how many of you guys have Zombie Surivial-esque kits, or apocalypse kits? I was thinking of starting one, since my first main loadout is complete.  Also, would a Vietnam Era M16 have a place in any of these kits? I want an excuse to buy the WE Open Bolt M16 VN, but I don't want to make a VN kit.    So I'm investing in a nice kit and I was looking at TACO Pouches, the single rifle magazine ones to be exact. I saw a video on a YouTube channel and they shook the chest rig around and the magazines didn't move, but I'm still not convinced.   With TACO pouches will I be able to run around, slide, sprint, jump, and roll with my magazines in these pouches? I want to get pouches to protect my magazines since they are like thirty dollars a pop.    So I recently bought my first real primary weapon, and being that all of my disposable income goes into airsoft, I now have enough money for a sidearm.   So there's one pistol I was wondering about, and couldn't find many reviews on. The [WE 3.8 Compact] (http://www.evike.com/products/41759/).  Now I've had great luck with WE GBBR's so far, but I've heard of problems with their pistols. For the price, this gun looks pretty and for the price seems nice. Thoughts?   *Ten Years Ago Today   Here are the questions,  **1.** I heard [this rail system] (http://www.evike.com/products/31496/) is compatible. Is it?   **2.** As for upgrades I was only going to buy the RATech NPAS kit and Trigger Box. Anything else I should invest in?   Edit: No picture, it was messed up.   Very very excited to enter the realm of GBBR's so here's [the kit itself.] (https://imgur.com/a/Cbrfl)  Kitlist: [Gryffon Golem Chest Rig] (http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=15135)  [Gryffon Dragon Spine Belt](http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=15137)  Otherwise the other stuff from my kit was bought from tactical gear trade but I don't recommend ordering from that website. Overpriced, shipping was high, and took a long time.   The gun itself is a WE Open Bolt M4 totally stock. I plan to upgrade with an NPAS and new Trigger Box. Otherwise I might get an RIS and crane stock.   Edit: Buncha formatting crud  **Warning Potato Pictures**   To begin, I was **very** hesitant to order from Evike given all the horror stories I've heard here. I have to say, my whole experience has been very enjoyable.   To start, I wanted the WE Open Bolt M4. I would usually order from ASGI, but they do not stock as many guns as Evike, or at least in the GBBR department. So after researching I didn't want another AEG, so to Evike.  At first there was a problem with our credit card (My father's credit card of course, I gave him the money and he deposited it etc.). When he was on hold for over five minutes I was certain it would be a grueling affair. Somebody picked up right away and a young man named Michael described the problem very politely. We just needed to raise our limit on the card and the gun was ordered!  Now another con I heard about with Evike was that you had to pay for shipping, but the price wasn't even that much. It was only twenty five in shipping for a gun and everything I needed to skirmish. After ordering I was informed the next **morning** that the gun was shipped. Within three or so days I got the gun. Only three days was how long it took, even with the cheapest shipping. With ASGI it was two weeks before I got my gun, and the shipping was free. Even though it's free, two weeks seems like a long wait.   All in all, everything I've heard about Evike is wrong and my experience was very enjoyable. 10/10 would order from Evike again, and I'm not ordering from ASGI again.   Edit: It took no longer than ten minutes for our call to be transferred.   I'm writing a persuasive paper on why airsoft should be offered as an extra curricular acticity in school. Now all SB199 or whatever or kids being shot by police stuff aside, what would be some good points to make? I figure it's fun and helps with team building and friend stuff. Any tips? Any other points I could use?    So I've been contemplating a new addition for my armory. I LOVE the look of a SCAR-H but there are no GBB SCAR-H's and I don't want just another AEG.   So if I were to buy a VFC SCAR-H and buy a P* engine for it, what do I need to buy? I have a list of a few things, if somebody could fill me in on the mistakes that's be great.  [Engine Itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/37091)  [Tank] (http://www.evike.com/products/36570)  [Air Tube System Thingy] (http://www.evike.com/products/40898)  [Battery for FCU] (http://www.evike.com/products/37904)  [Charger] (http://www.evike.com/products/30777)  As for the [gun] (http://www.evike.com/products/32613) I was planning on ordering it before-hand separately with magazines and BB's. Is my checklist complete? Any help from seasoned P* owners would be awesome.     I'm just a dude in highschool with a few quick questions. So I just asked this girl on a date that I've been talking to for awhile. How much money should I take with me? Like average movie price, and a nice dinner? Also, would we go to dinner then movie or vice versa? Or does it not really matter?    I'm pretty set on getting a JG Scorpion, and to increase effectiveness, I thought doing a LiPo mod for the gun would be beneficial.   I've seen somewhere around here a guide on how to modify the gun to take a 7.4v LiPo. Could anybody dig it up or point me in the right direction?   Will [this holster] (http://www.evike.com/products/34450) work with a P99?   As for any new subreddit I'd like to lay down a few quick rules.  * Read the Side Bar * Read the Stickies * **Don't be a dick**  Otherwise have fun, post away, and spread the word! The whole reason reason I made this subreddit is because in Wisconsin, and the surrounding states airsoft isn't very... Alive. Well here in Southern Wisconsin there are a few teams trying to make a difference and really spread the love of the sport. So spread it, play, subscribe, and have fun!

Is ranger green, sage green, and smoke green the same thing as foliage green?   For my primary weapon I'm deciding on the [WE SCAR L] (http://www.evike.com/products/36555) and for my secondary weapon something a [little unconventional] (http://www.evike.com/products/25041).  Thoughts? Concerns? Any tips or information I should know about?    So I have a six hundred dollar budget, and I want to jump into the GBBR world. The WE seems like a really good choice out of thr box, and of course I'd get upgrade parts from RAtech and such. I've been on Arnies Airsoft, Airsoft Society, and a plethora of forums to find reviews. I've also watched every review on YouTube. At this point I'm pretty dead-set on this gun.  Now with six hundred dollars will I have enough for the gun and magazines? If so, how many magazines should I buy? I usually play thirty minutes games at our friends private field, with short breaks for reloading and drinks.  Next quick question, anybody with past experience, what parts should be replaced? Delving into a whole new type of airsoft rifles is pretty confusing. All over I've heard, " RAtech, RAtech, RAtech."  HELP /R/AIRSOFT!   Will the [WE SMG 8] (http://www.evike.com/products/43558) fit in [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/38605/) holster?   I've read about every review on forums, and have watched every video. At this point, the Vector seems like a reasonable choice for my next order.   The problem is that every review gives the same information. Usually it's the, "Feels great" and "Really realistic." If I wanted to use this gun for field play would it work? If not, would the Angry Gun power-up silencer be a good choice for field play?   I have a friend that uses the KWA MP9 with no upgrades for field play, and he fares pretty well. Noting that, the Vector seems like a sensible choice for a unique GBB SMG for field play.   Does anybody have any information, reviews, or help on whether or not this gun is good for field play?         Best battery option or what battery for the VFC SCAR-L?   Pretty much it They are a huge part of many Japanese paintings, early Japanese art, and even anime today, but never the fruit itself. As far as I know I've never really seen much Japanese cuisine with cherries.            	138
 yes but those movies are shit    also has the same actor on there    The Walrus fight from Tusk    that was probably the most shocking thing I have ever seen in a theater oh man those screams tho and the brief glimpses before we were given our first look.    Oh well your loss    Yeah its more comedy than horror but there are some truely terrifying and creepy moments.    Yeah even when they showed the little glimpses and his horrible screaming I was like WTFFF.    Yeah I noticed the fake CGI right away and just thought it was someones cool new video but then they said it was supposed to be real so I was like oh.    Holy hell how did I not notice that!!!!!    LOL    HAHA they make a joke about that in the film    AMEN    See it in the film itself the buildup and reveal is so messed up I cringed when I first saw it.    Hes not TOO obvious tho most people might recognize his voice and eyes but thats it. He was freakin hilarious in it LOL    Just saw it wow WTF was that LOL so funny and terrifying at the same time I LOVED it cant wait to see it again!!!!! That walrus was scary looking LOL and Johnny Depp oh man was he great in this!!!!!    OMG yes I cringed when I first saw it and I rarely do that with movies.    Then watch it and have it explained for you    Because they r awesome!!!!!!!    LOVE that scene!!!!!    WOW I did not know that.    Thats what caused me to start the thread LOL    What are some movies that are an actors last film appearance ever and in their last scene they die in it??    Boring, artsy, and not enough Hulk.    sounds cool.    Avatar    Looks pretty good cant wait to see it also hope it gets some award recognition.    she didnt want to reprise a role that she earned a razzie for LOL.    Yeah she would have been apart of one of the biggest grossing movies ever. She chose to do mad whatever tho.    It was a good movie I kinda got confused at some parts but I loved tom and james performance RIP BTW. It was a good crime drama.    GOD YES THIS BETTER BE TRUE!!!!!!!!!    What is the origin of this term??    Just keep reminding yourself that it is NOT real just a movie with actors and a director.    Memento the first time I saw that movie I was blown away now everytime I rewatch it while still good it lacks the shock factor or whatever.    Not a good way to phrase it LOL but if she likes those kind of movies than why not!!!!    Hellboy 3    Yeah thats what I was thinking it would explain a lot.    Interesting theory how have I not noticed this yet.    They should just have a renner damon teamup movie.    Ah man I was gonna say that one, but yeah thats true.    Daniel day Lewis in Lincoln to me that was just WOW how he recited all of those monologues and stories while still doing a perfect lincoln accent so awesome.    Yeah but most of it is based on other unknown facts that I am not familiar with like if it bombs he will have lost a lot of money.    maybe    Yeah thats what I was thinking I also read somewhere that frank the rabbit was sent by some invisible gods or something to fix the timeline.    I Am Legend    now that is a good one I remember downloading the script and reading some of it it was genius. Too bad it will likely never be made be nice to see stallone behind the camera only and to see him do a pure drama biopic.    I love that movie!!!!    Yeah thats what I think too so a brooklyn accent.    I always wanted to use one of those but I never did.    Like what are some things that seem perfect for someone but will likely never happen because of one person being a jerk ie Steven Seagal is perfect for the expendables franchise but will never appear because of his beef with avi lerner.    I cannot stand hardcore girlie movies like the sisterhood of the pants or the yaya sisterhood. Also directtodvd kids movies. Anything else tho I generally like oh yeah except crappy b movies like the ones steven seagal does nowadays.    Yeah I love that movie I remember how scared I was when I first saw it.    Yes    Dam she has an oscar I forgot and she hasnt put it to good use yet either.    Ig u havent seen Ghostbusters then it would be an amazing experience to watch it in the theater brand new!!!!    Its all about the benjamins for him, it is really sad cuz I think he does great in drama and he should do it more but all he does is shitty comedies all the time.    Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln in the movie Lincoln also Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight.    I would feel like a horrible person.   yeah that one    that movie that Marion Cotillard won an oscar for.    that one doesnt count cuz the thread is about heroes and villains who only meet once.    good one    Yeah that POS was released in theaters.    Man i wish that had a sequel just to see Sinestro as a villain anyways.    Yeah I love snowpiercer and why did I just realize that one?? Interesting.    Movies where the hero or protagonist only meets the villain once in the entire film.    Who would be cool in a film version of the book carte blanche?? Just for fun.    What are some perfect film collaborations that never happened??    UGG I HATE it when he drinks, it is SOOOO annoying!!!!!!    Like I will move either my leg or arms for something and they will make a creek sound, kinda like a floorboard. Why does it do that??    My BMI is 31 and I weigh 244 Lbs I want to get my BMI down to a healthy weight which is 184 so I want to lose 60 pounds at least. How can I do this without getting dangerous I dont care about the time either.    like regular actors who donet usually do comedy but r actually very good at it, like van damme on welcome to the jungle.    Go the hell to bed now!!!!! You have literally been sitting there for 13 freakin hours!!!! Give someone else a shot on the tv now!!!!    When you are expected to do something do it!!!!!! Dont just blow it off and ruin someone elses whole day do what is expected of you and also get off the dam couch for at least 30 minutes!!!!! God I HATE people who do that!!!!!    I sleep 8 or 9 hours a night band I am 22 years old but why do I yawn all day everyday??? Is there something else?? I wont feel tired at all but I still yawn.       I just mean actors not actresses because we all know what they did to get famous LOL, Like just guys who have no acting skills or anything but still get roles for no reason.    Its my soda god damit go get your own!!!!!! I only have a little and it is for ME noone else!!!!! Jesus christ if it was yours I would have said it is mine and yours, I dont care if you raised me it is MINE.    UGH I HATE when people randomly drink my god dam soda like they dont even care!!!!! I am on a budget and I cant afford to keep buying them damit if it isnt yours dont touch it!!!!!!    So I live with my dad and me and him were never really close I am more close to my mom and sister but I live with him because he lives close to where i work and I dont have enough money to get my own place yet. Anyways it is a one bedroom apartment and he sleeps in a bed and I sleep on an old military cot we both take turns on the tv and stuff but sometimes I wish I just had my own space!!!!! He is also kind of an ass sometimes, earlier today he assumed I was gonna go stay with my mom and sister for the weekend and I didnt correct him, then when he got home that evening he said "I thought u were gonna go with them" Then I responded " I never said that" He responds with "yes you did" UGH I HATE when people put words in my mouth that is one of my pet peeves!!!!! GOD I need my own place again!!!!! When I leave I will never call or visit him again that is the truth.    I have always wondered how do they know which bullets came out of what kind of gun???    I mean something along the lines of Daniel Day Lewis when he played Bill The Butcher who hated Abe Lincoln but eventually went on to play him, stuff like that.    I recently realized that I have crooked ears by almost a thumbs width. Why did this happen to me??    Whenever I hear the term inflation like for how much a movie has grossed and stuff I always wonder what it is???    Wat r some good ones where someone is first billed but they have very little screentime???   I remember watching an episode of johnny bravo where he finds something and there is the sound of a choir and you think it is in his head but it actually was a choir singing behind him and he tells them to cut it out cuz that is annoying. Anyone know which episode that is???    A long time ago I remember watching this movie with my parents about a group or guys who defend a fort or something in the middle of the desert there was the main guy who may or may not have been played b Jean Claude Van Damme. There was also a black guy who gets captured by the enemy and a guy who gets an eyepatch over the course of the movie. At the end of the major battle it is just the main guy and the eypatch guy left, that is all I remember. Anyone know???    Like do u always get snacks if so what?? Also is there a favorite place u like to sit in the theater??? For me I always get snacks usually just popcorn and a drink but for longer movies I get candy too which I usually sneak in LOL. I also like to sit in the middle of the theater that way I dont have to crane my head.    What kind of film career would he have had?? God I wish he had lived I assume he would have been in The Expendables at some point.    I have always wondered what does having a mortgage mean???    What are some uncredited roles that are more than a cameo I mean a full fledged supporting role that was never credited for some reason.    Also what do u feel when u get scared, or startled??    Basically she is a few years younger than me and we used to go to the same high school and we r facebook friends and I really want to ask her out, but I dont know how I never see her around town and I dont want to ask over FB that sounds lame, I did look her up in the phonebook and I know her address and home phone number but I dont want to use those as it would be too stalkerish. What should I do???       What are some good ones???    I know an author gets an advance or something with a publisher but exactly how does this work??       I remember seeing a foreign commercial with all of the horror icons and stuff just outside doing normal things. Like Freddy Krueger, Michael, and Jason although I forgot what they were doing but I do remember Chucky was on a pogo stick bouncing around. It was all in live action.    I am considering reading 2 hp books at the same time. I am reading HBP but I also want to read GOF. I am just wondering if I should or not. Has anyone ever done this before?? LOL   I am just curious what other actors would u guys have seen in other roles. I for one think Bob Hoskins would have made a fine Horace SLughorn. Any other ideas??    A long time ago I watched the ending of a movie which had Men in Black as villains, I mean they were also aliens but they had big alien eyes that they would hide with sunglasses and they had white blood I believe. I also remember a bunch of the men in black attacked a house at night and tried to kill people.    Im sure this has been asked for but what if Tim Burton and Michael Keaton had returned for Batman 3 I think it would have been pretty amazing actually. I liked the first 2 and It is sad that they only made 2, thoughts???    A few years ago I walked in on my friend watching netflix and he was watching some movie that I have no idea was but it seemed intriguing. It was the very end of the movie and a prisoner got a letter in a jail cell and as he read the letter with a voiceover of the kid who wrote the letter, he was poisoned or something and the guy just dies there in his cell with some kind of poison that was on the letter I believe.    When I was younger I used to watch this anime show about some guy named Tenchi I believe he lived in the forest with a bunch of girls and one of them was nemed reoko or something like that. I remember he would fight people with a sword too.    To me some of the worst movie lines ever have to be on Taken 2 "look a flip flop" or "I just shot some guy". Another one was After Earth "my suit is black I like it but I dont know what it means". What are some others???    title    Like a relative or something.    Like a movie where there is no actually villain or antagonist for the heroes to fight it is just them against the clock or something like Inception.    I know there is Nicky in The Bourne Ultimatum and Angel in XMen First Class but r there any other ones where there is a character who doesnt talk after like halfway into the movie??       Like when a british person is playing an american and in the movie they "pretend" to be british and then revert to their real life accent. Any other country would work too like Australian, or Irish or german.    Every time I try to use Hola unblocker to watch netflix it takes me to the page but it never fully loads. Does this happen to anyone else?? Also what is another program that does the same thing as Hola???    	111

Often there are controversial claims in articles, without good evidence.  * Some editors do not like each other; they will do things that do not make the Wikipedia better (like edit wars)  *  A lot of the time, one group of people wants to change Wikipedia more than others. For this reason, the opinions of that group and their interests may be covered more in Wikipedia. This is usually called a systematic bias, and can be very misleading, because it only shows one side of an argument. There are also certain kinds of social groups that begin to think alike. This means that the group of editors as a whole want to please themselves rather than change articles.        	85
 Deadly Premonition 2: The Deadcoming   Japanese Hard Dance is so under exposed (which is sad because it's an awesome scene!) and for anyone interested in speedcore check out M1dy  Edit: also if your interested in hardcore checkout Kobaryo, his song clock control is great   Awhile ago I really didn't like speedcore... Now I like it, anyways RWC dose some good stuff and I would recommend checking out some of his terrorcore   extra tone if your feeling crazy :' ) and if your not feeling crazy don't worry he also dose hardstyle under the name shingo DJ   I'm a little sad this release isn't hard dance but I am sooo happy Mat's back!

Also I've never heard that song before so thanks!   Oh sweet!, I thought it was that guy he killed...   I'm a huge gabber/hardstyle/hard trance head and I've been getting into happy hardcore lately so please give me some suggestions! The only people I know of right now are Rhythmics, Nanobii, S3rl   Matduke   What's woolie supost to be?

I for one would love to see how he made the kick from sounds of the machine if he dose decide to make one          Just think about it, hiding from lickers in lockers, running away from 2 hunters instead of the twins and of course nemesis would replace walker                Recently I've been listening to a lot of speedcore, terrorcore .etc stuff I told my self I would never enjoy when I started listening to hard dance. As you can tell by the title that has all changed, so please link me the most fucked up stuff you know!      I get most of my hardstyle from the yearly Cloud 9 hardstyle compilations (10$ = 100 songs, great deal) recently I found out about the 2014 compilation and to my sadness I already own two of the songs on the compilation (God said 2k14   Reality) are there any songs that grab you as must haves? [iTunes link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hardstyle-top-100-2014/id893210852)      This February me and my friend will get up on stage in front of 500+ high school students and play a 20 min DJ set. He will be doing 10 min of house and I will be doing 10 min of hardstyle, since most people at my school haven't heard of hardstyle I'm going to do a euphoric set as opposed to a raw one. With that in mind I want my set to be the best euphoric, harmonically mixed gateway into hardstyle ever! Even though I have a lot of euphoric stuff I still want to hear from you guys, so please link me some of your favorite euphoric tracks. Also, producers.... Do you have a track that you think 500+ first time hardstyle listeners would love? Well link me some of your stuff and I'll see what I can do to get your song in my mix :)                     I think someone could get a lot of mileage out of doing a parody of music production like by referencing modern talking in massive, vengeance sample packs, pirating and other things. FL Studio would probably be the best choice for this but it could still be funny in other programs like ableton, logic, reason, cubase and pro tools         All right m8's it's been 10 months since the last music thread lets do another one   Dubstep  * Eptic - Gun Finga  * Getter - Hollow Point (Original   Barely Alive Remix) * Eptic   MUST DIE! - Z  * F3tch ft. xKore - Rancid  * Twine - New Note  * Getter - Hatchets  * Getter - Knives (Original   VIP)  * Getter   Trampa - Bonesaw (Original   VIP)  * 12Gauge   Sadhu - Backwards Song * Woggie   Creation - Cleverly  * Moody Good ft.

As the title says can someone fill me in? I haven't seen any spam (I'm guessing the mods deleted it). Also can someone tell me how it all started, thanks :)  p.s. I promise I'm not trying to agitate the situation if someone tells me to take this down I will.   1.What are some of your hobbies? 2. Besides hard dance what other genres on music do you like? 3. Favorite food? 4. What got you into music as a whole? 5. Can I post your response on the hardstyle sub?   1. Hobbies, anything i do is geared towards improving myself and my creativity. Be that weight training (clears body and mind) reading up on art techniques (going through a graffiti phase) or minecraft (started a few days ago, experiencing a new world), I try to keep things varied. Might take up fishing next. 2. I actually try to listen to as little hard dance as possible. This is because I want to keep my 'work' fresh and not to be over saturated with the same sounds all the time. I listen to a lot of drum and bass and movie scores, but often house, trap n moomba. 3. All food when prepared with fresh, quality ingredients is awesome. I do have a soft spot for italian cuisine, but I love a good kangaroo steak too. 4. I got into music because once I heard it, I wanted to make it. Though this question is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, the hole goes as far as you want it to go.... 5. Sure. Dunno if its gonna be that interesting tho.           What's your favorite distortion plug-in and why? For me I'd have to say ohmicide, it's easy to use and you can get great results with it         Hello all! Yesterday I made a [monstercat anime post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/2gil1y/lets_make_a_monstercat_anime/) and from the looks of it, it didn't do too well :/, but I won't let that discourage me! (If this post doesn't do well promise I won't do more) so any ways here's the premise: make up a morning routine for you favorite producer (make it as bad or as good as you want!) I'll start! " Rameses was awoken from his deep sleep by the familiar sound of rain. He quietly got out of bed and went to the window and stared out at the cloudy Yorkshire landscape. "I could wright so meany songs about this" he thought to himself, and before he knew it he had been starring out his window for 30 minuets. When he finally snapped out of it he saw he was going to be late if he didn't hurry, so he quickly ran downstairs grabbed his crumpet with jam and rushed out the door. (forgetting his umbrella I might add :3)               everything is reverberating (even the start up sound) I've tried opening a new project and restarting my computer but nothings working. [heres what it sounds like](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/problem) EDIT: It is my sound card. dose anyone know how to fix it?            I've noticed that quite a few people on here listen to rap so tell me... Who are your favorites? Mine are P.O.S/Doomtree, Brother Ali and Atmosphere (you might notice a bias here, that's because I live really close too the twin cities)             "for those curious i'm 90% done with say it ain't so. another week or two and i'll start shopping to labels"                   A while ago I saw this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/2dx51k/ive_always_loved_the_scifi_style_album_covers_for/) about how cool looking pretty lights album art was. So I decided why not share some cool art but this time with a heavy/industrial look. Also for those wondering Vision recordings is Noisia's record label and for those who don't know who Noisia is they are a 3 man neuro funk/DnB group and I highly recommend them!  [Program/Regurgitate](https://www.noisia.nl/media/images_old/news/may-2011/VSN011A.jpg)  [Hyenas/The Liquid](https://www.noisia.nl/media/image/vsn017a_w_l.jpg)  [Imperial EP](http://soundisstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/noisia-imperial-ep.jpg)                    I've been getting into Melbourne bounce lately and I need some artist suggestions        For me I'd have to say TC's dog [Rex](https://m.facebook.com/tc.bristol/photos/pb.48469779094.-2207520000.1409108882./10152483245584095/?type=1 source=42)      I know we have some shufflers/jumpers on here and I would love too see you guys in action! Post a video of your self :D                        John Berkey was a artist who made [breath](http://www.fond-ecran.com/ORIGINAUX/divers/john_berkey/john_berkey_011.jpg) [taking](http://www.tucoo.com/fantasy/f_john_berkey/images/sf_john_berkey016.jpg) space ship scenes (and saying that isn't doing his art nearly enough justice). Now, some of you may be thinking "say this looks a little bit like star wars" well thats because he [did](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DuQ1FWS6Iiw/UR70HxsiF6I/AAAAAAAAdVw/3iMF1oTIWzs/s1600/star-wars-cover__john_berkey.jpg) do some art for the star wars movies. Also on an unrelated note John Berkey is the reason I know some one at VALVe and one of the reasons I got to take a tour of VALVe HQ      Dear Pat Powertuff, because of your expertise in the subject of RE4 I was finally able to beat it, I also learned a few things from your play through with matt: the Red9 is the perfect weapon for leading a one man crusade across "Rural Europe", the TMP is a hardened black turd (Although the ammo box is super hype), shotguns are mans greatest creation, knifes are great against crazy buff military mans, verdugos are SUPER cool!!, Salazar's whine when he gets stabbed in the hand is one of the best stupid noises I've ever heard, the broken butterfly is basically deaths scythe in the form of a magnum and finally separate ways sucks :( the only kinda good thing about it is you get to stare at Ada's butt the whole time. Best regards, test_subject8320   Before I goto bed I like to listen to music and in doing so I've noticed something about myself. Listening to Hardcore, Hard Trance, Hardstyle and Psy/Forest Trance actually helps me sleep while listening to Chill music by people like Mr. FijiWiji, Rameses B and Direct actually makes me less tired. Dose this apply to anyone else or is their just something wrong with my brain?                I honestly love both. I love the happy up beat melodies of UK Hardcore but I also love the violently distorted kicks of Hardcore       My questions were:  1. Do you ever plan on doing hardcore (the non happy kind)?  2. Who are your musical influences?  3. I remember you said somewhere that you don't do collabs so if you were forced at gun point who would you collab with?  4. Can I post your response to the monstercat sub? Stay kawaii!!!!   Here's his response:  1. i really dislike the non-happy hardcore you're talking about because it doesn't   have any elements at all that i value in music, so no  2. mitch murder (synthwave and 80s music overall), dj shimamura, kz, early owl city.  3. i said i don't do collabs with just ANYONE. there needs to be some form of friendship established through chats or whatever imo. but if i'd have to pick someone it'd be mitch murder  4. sure. you too ()                                            My questions were 1. Who are your musical influences? 2. Are any of your new tracks collaborations? 3. Can I post your response to /r/Monstercat?  Here's what he had to say:  1. I'm influenced by everything- both in music and through visual art! My older tracks just kind of happened, I just sat down and made them, no specific inspiration there!  2. No collabs- I work in a very drawn out way and I like to get things sounding exactly right before moving on, especially with my new music. I don't think many collaborators would be cool with sitting around for months working on something! That said I do have plans to work with vocalists in the future- but not the traditional "vocalist sings verse on track" kind of way, I'll have her sing whatever, and then chop it up/process it like an instrument. I like vocal snippets and how they can convey the emotion of a vocal, without actually having any discernible words. Looking to take that to the next level with my unreleased stuff!  3. Sure thing, fine by me!          its by SMD and it has a guy laughing in the beginning              Free songs are preferred but not required, also it doesn't just have to be monstercat          For me it's jay cosmic's remix of rocket                                  For me it's a tie between the screech from dragon born by Headhunterz and the screech from destroy by Atmozfears       So I did a post like this on the monstercat sub awhile ago and it got a pretty good reception.   Rules: post a mix that your proud of (preferably hardstyle) in the comments and say what you use for mixing the winner will be the person with the most up votes   * what you win: my respect as a DJ and the love of the sub (possibly)   I know Audiofreq has one    As you all know Mr. Suicide sheep always finds amazing pictures to go along with his uploads. [My favorite is this one](http://arcipello.deviantart.com/art/Scorched-earth-304068383) it's actually my back round in FL studio          Same Rules as [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/27uk1n/djs_lets_have_a_little_competition/) if you competed last time just post a diffrent mix                   So a while ago F3tch released some patches for massive. All of them are very robotic and gritty so they might not be for every producer, but for the ones who make heavy dubstep I would recommend checking them out [heres a link to his FB page](https://www.facebook.com/F3tchmusic/app_220150904689418)   "Something more. Better. Greater. Meaningful. Unforgettable. Beautiful.  In the near Future."       Timeless is probably my favorite. Her voice just adds so much to the song    Here's what he had to say "Oh awesome!   I've been considering doing some more collabs in the EDM world, maybe something trap-y.   Thanks for showing me yo "   By colorful I mean people like Madeon and Grant Bowtie       For me it would either have to be Aero Chord or Noisestorm (Aero Chord is from Greece and Noisestrom is from Dublin so it be awesome to hear their sexy accents also)   INFO:  1. Post a mix you've made below (doesn't have to include monstercat songs) 2. Say what software you use (you don't have to but still it would be cool to know)  RULES FOR VOTING: Be fair and nice, don't judge on length but on song choice, transitions, etc.   The winner will be the person with the most points on their comment   WHAT YOU WIN:  1. My respect as a DJ 2. The love of our savior GQ (Maybe)     What do you guys think?   I have been watching quiet a few videos from before 2010 and I have to say, the Melbourne shuffle is really cool and it makes me a little sad that its not as popular as it used to be. So /r/ Monstercat can we bring it back or should I ask /r/ Hardstyle about this ?     When do you guys think it will be released?   	156
 oh crap   Tyrone Jackson   2 girls 1 cup   I believe there are thousands, maybe millions of people who you could be extremely happy with and consider them your "soulmate". You may find a "soulmate" but keep in mind there are lots and lots of others who could make you as happy, or even happier than yours. You're with yours mainly because of where you live and have been to.    Maybe a cologne that isn't available in Europe (the new Old Spice ones, for example, aren't available here in Europe).    Avoiding to borrow things to people. I'm sure everyone would say I'm selfish, but I'm not lending you my expensive smartphone so you can drop it or check my personal text messages.    Girls with blue eyes.   English. I didn't like it as I didn't understand it, and the fact most PC games and movies were in English didn't help. Now I prefer it over my first language ^^   "Why am I so dark when the rest of your body is white"   Same thing with iPhones -*grabs popcorn*-   Who's Razor1911's cracker in real life.   I've cracked a few software protections.   How he always tries to please me and my sister, despite the fact he doesn't make that much money and rarely gets anything new to himself.   I'm from Portugal, and it's hard to find something I like here. We've got beaches, (usually) sunny weather and a cuisine that pleases many foreigners, but unfortunately I don't like any of that. I'd much rather life in a cold, snowy place like the Scandinavian countries or Canada. Oh well, maybe one day :)    Back when I first got Internet on my computer, I was infected by several trojans. One of them was a fake antivirus software which claimed it could disinfect my PC if I purchased it. I decided to format the PC instead. Ha, bad old times :)   I wish they had been more strict about my behavior. I was a stupid "rebel" during Elementary school, without realizing it at the time. I also was rude to many adults then. My parent's punished me but it wasn't enough. Is that a weird thing to say?   When I was a kid, I ran to the road not knowing there was a car passing. My neighbor actually closed her eyes as she thought I was gonna be ran over.  The other time was also when I was a kid, my mom was about to give me some medicine that was made for adults and could potentially kill me. Thankfully, she always reads the whole paper that came with it, and returned it to the pharmacy, where it had been recommended. The pharmacist got really nervous and apologized a lot.   Not being down-to-earth.   Change BF4 servers' maximum ping to 20ms.   Don't feel too bad about that, man. I also have the "chest hole" thing, although it's not THAT bad, and so does a popular friend of mine. In the locker room once in a while other guys have fun poking at them (no homo) :p   Man, there's gotta be a great story behind that.   When my puberty began I didn't know I had to wear deodorant (most people my age already did), so...    I went to the bathroom and there was a green rag on the bottom of my shower. After looking at it, I get progressively scared and eventually wake up. WTF.   People who complain about how they have bad grades because of their teachers. There are cases when teachers are more demanding and harder on students, but in most cases they don't have good grades because they don't work for it, or their studying method needs optimization. I'm not that smart, people always seem to figure out how to solve math problems before I do and store more information than I am able to, but I usually have either the same or better grades than them, because I study more and harder than them.   Make all states allow guns and abortion, throttle non-white immigration and make sure there are more people speaking English rather than Spanish.   Multiculturalism.   Being pretty outside (cute face, blue eyes are a huge plus for me) and being honest, sweet and polite.    Run to the electronics store and steal all the big-ass TVs, 700$ smartphones and consoles I possibly could.   lel u dont kno mah stori, u dont kno me et all, dunt judje me   Counter Strike (game) and Game of Thrones (TV series). Nearly everyone I know loves them but I prefer Battlefield and TV series which plot occurs in the current days.   The last episode of "Lost".   What happened after that?   I've cracked a few software products. It's not worth mentioning to anyone in real life as people have no interest in it.   My hair is thick and it has two colors: black and light brown. Some people think I dye my hair, others think I spilled hydrogen peroxide on it :p   Post pics please :) Are they blue?   Damn Desmond, forgot to push the button :/   Yeah, sure looks like it :/  	37
 Yeah, I'm back on them now broseph.    Edit: I've been back on my meds, but I've kinda not taken them properly? What I mean by this is, I wake up at weird times of the day, so I take my morning dose a little bit later and my nightly dose a little bit later, but so far, I still have my symptoms somewhat under control.    Those are non-specific symptoms I believe.   I think we still use it, but very rarely... Do vets not use it anymore?   I live in the UK and I know that we use it but I've never actually even seen anyone on ketamine here, weird. I would love to try some if I could find it somewhere.    I started taking prescription opiates at about 14-15 with my girlfriend at the time. Do I regret it? Yes and No.    That's pretty much true I suppose, but it definitely depends on how you look at it. For example, opiates, benzos etc. won't produce the same "euphoria" as say, MDMA, Cocaine etc.      I was just wondering what your thoughts on stimulants were? I know that for me when I have some extra money I will buy any real stimulant I can get, usually Methylphenidate and Amphetamine (Rarely). I usually do this 1-3 times a year, but from my recent usage of stimulants I have realized that I don't really like them that much, but I use them because I used to really, really love stimulants. It's kind of a weird relationship with them.  Anyway, what are your thoughts on stimulants?   Why the heck would they put someone with psychosis on anti depressants, especially Bupropion. They should've started you off with an anti psychotic first, that's what usually SHOULD happen.   How long do you have to wait for? (I live the UK so I don't really understand health insurances).   Edit: If you were depressed before, then you should've been put on an anti depressant AND an anti psychotic, but it's still kinda weird putting someone with Drug Induced Psychosis on anti depressants, especially if it wasn't caused by the depression (Psychotic depression).    Mood lift does count as euphoria, same with sociability (to me anyway, because I'm usually not social). Well I didn't feel anything noticeably physical, so I don't think it was much L-Amphetamine, but I could be wrong on that.    I think your doc is correct, you are definitely paranoid for sure, so the drug induced psychosis thing is definitely a good Dx. I have schizophrenia, so I know what it's like, albeit a little different but when I'm in a psychotic break, its essentially all the same. Are you taking any medications for this psychosis?   MDMA and Coke can both cause psychosis if abused the way you abused them, and acid also can I believe, but more commonly it's usually HPPD with acid but psychosis can definitely happen with the use of acid as well. So basically, you abused 3 drugs that can cause psychosis... Hopefully you're taking some meds, or therapy at least, but psychosis usually can't be solved by just therapy itself.  Stay safe.    You do realize that Amphetamine is a euphoriant?    So, I remember taking Freebase (Paste) Amphetamine from the streets that my sister had at my cousins wedding, she gave me a dab of it, and it didn't feel as good as something like Ritalin (that I've use quite a lot in the past). I know Amphetamine is meant to be better than Ritalin, but to me, it felt like pretty much nothing. I thought this was weird, I did get a nice feel for the music and I did get pretty talkative, but not that much, and there was no body like euphoria there. Why is this? It's kinda strange to me.    DHC is good, it actually feels a tad weaker than codeine to me for some reason, but it definitely lasts A LOT longer. I'm guessing codeine is pretty strong for me because I must be a good metaboliser. Have fun.   I've never really felt anything from caffeine, it hardly even keeps me awake, but I do drink a lot of energy drinks and stuff pretty much daily.    Why do people say, "I laughed longer than I should have"... How long are you meant to laugh, is there guidelines that I don't know about?    During the black death, it wasn't just the bubonic plague, it was also the pneumonic plague, which, is extremely contagious.    If you can't even speak proper English, then you can't make a cheat, whatsoever.    I can tell you this with experience, a lot of the time when someone gets a prescription for oxy, sooner or later, they will do something illegal with it (snorting, injecting, or just taking it for a buzz and no longer for pain). Criminalizing anyone for drug abuse/use when they are otherwise a loving parent is just, insane. Also, I think you CAN do something about it, YOU can also fight back at the heart of it.  And it would be nice to become a foster parent when I'm a little older.   But can't you just change something at the core? Yeah, we should do something to, but YOU (and others that work in the system) can change it at it's very core.   Thing is, weed? Really? You wouldn't take a kid away from a family that has a few too many every night, but are otherwise loving... I just don't get it.   Also, a parent popping a few oxy because of their "bad back" is fine, right? But weed obviously isn't because its the "law".   If you truly believe in that, then you aren't a modern feminist, so, good for you.  You're an egalitarian, which is great.    I'm sorry, but is a job more important than a persons life?    Hey, why don't you draw something as good or even better than this then?   This is actually somewhat a good story, believable and the doc will also feel sorry for you.   Not exactly true in all cases.   I had a very hard time, I know I'm schizophrenic but I there has been people that do good without meds.    Where do you live? I live in the UK and people with bad back pain, arthritis (depends on the type) and other shit get opiates codeine to oxy.    Why do people not like morphine? I dont get it...   Okay, so I know its incredibly stupid to come off meds without a doctors go ahead or supervision, but I accidentally came off my meds a few days ago (Seroquel) and I'm not doing so bad, the meds were working, which is good, but I wonder how long I can last before I relapse into the illness again... What if I never get ill again? I mean, do I need the meds? I'm not even sure if I even need meds...   This is just some thoughts I wanted to write down and decided to make a reddit post.    Also, the OP is 20, opiate prescriptions at 20 aren't uncommon at all.   Question, how does going on methadone or sub screw the OP from an opiate script for the rest of his life? Here in the UK (depending on the doc I guess) I can still get opiate prescriptions for legit pain even though I am a recognized addict, even though its a little harder I might add.  Is it different in the US? Because I'm sure a doc wont just leave someone in pain just because someone's an addict.   Man, that's fucked up. I live in W. Scotland and my town is like 10k population (if that) and I can walk to the pharmacy which is about 5 mins walking and I'd probably see at least one or two blatant heroin addicts.    You may be schizophrenic, but most of what you describe is some sort of personality disorder, like sociopathy with some narcissism... Can anyone correct me if I'm truly wrong?    I'm sorry, but how can you be a junkie depending on the day you're having? Elaborate please.   And western feminism is completely lost... Equalitarianism is better.   Either idiocy or extreme corruption.    Feminazis are worse than any form of junkie, so it really doesn't matter.    I've heard a while back (kinda just remembered) that a lot of schizophrenics gets better faster and better over time than the ones on meds. In my opinion I think that's somewhat false because everyone is different, but have you heard about that?    Morning is usually a break from my illness for me, until about 2 hours after I wake up, and then when it hits dark, I get really paranoid and my illness basically just gets worse during the dark.  I also get more depressed during the dark.    I know this is old news but it really does outrage me when shitty clinically retarded (probably 10 IQ) come into someone's house and shoot a harmless dog (and I mean harmless, eg labs, Jack Russell's etc) for no good reason other than being a brainless sub 10 IQ moron that should be euthanised. YOU DO NOT TAKE A DOGS LIFE OVER DRUGS, ESPECIALLY WEED.   Also to cops that know cops that do this, give them this message, if you come into my house and shoot anything for no reason, I will, and I repeat, I will get a gun and blow atleast one of your retarded brains out, thanks.   I don't care If this sounds stupid, but it angers me beyond belief. Thanks for listening.     Either a mental condition or he is just fucking with everyone.   It's sad that certain African countries governments are so corrupt that they give about 2% of the donations to their people basically live and THRIVE through them. Have you seen certain African country leaders? They live in wealth, while their people live in extreme poverty.    Also, does any leader that starts unnecessary wars deserve compassion? Like a lot of US presidents, UK prime ministers etc?   But civilians that have done nothing to deserve this, they indeed, need all the compassion they can get.    I love how you take that out of context...    Things have changed, but most of the donated cash goes to the government of certain African countries and the government of these countries basically steal the donations.   Everyone deserves compassion...   Isn't China/Chinese more clean than most of the west as well? Or am I wrong?    What do you mean 'Yes'... Do you mean that's what you believe or are you just answering?    People still believe schizophrenia means split personality? My god...    FEAR THIS NOW!!!   Not to give in to hysteria... Does he realise he's talking to the human race here?    No one really gives two fucks about terrorists, well compared to this anyway.    Enzymes bro, everyone's different.   It's not just bad that they're spewing misinformation (of course that's bad) but it's when people basically say that you can't have schizophrenia because you can type or make somewhat coherent sentences, because we already have a hard time believing that we're ill in the first place.   So in my experience I have encountered a lot of people that just don't believe schizophrenics are on the Internet. It's gotten to the point that in online society that if you even ADMIT you have schizophrenia, everyone laughs, why is this? It's as if that if you have schizophrenia or even bipolar (to a lesser extent maybe) that you can't come online, it's just simply impossible to these people.  Does the wider Internet still believe that schizophrenics pretty much just sit in a corner and cry or babble insanity as if we are insane? Do they not realise that we are just normal people that can come online and share experiences? I don't get it.   I've even seen people that are allegedly in a psychosis come on reddit and type their thoughts, of course when I'm in a severe psychosis I don't say anything online about it and sometimes end up in hospital or... Worse, but I'm not in a CONSTANT severe psychosis that some people seem to think.   So basically what I'm annoyed at is, on the wider Internet if you even ADMIT you're schizophrenic, you're deemed a fake and a "dumbass". Its really put me down because now, I don't know if what I experience is real. Maybe I am just a dumbass. Who knows.   Please share you're thoughts, this was just a rant.    Have fun with that man, Gabapentin and Hydro, nice.    So basically what I was saying is that my psychosis came first and I basically found some prescription opiates and thought that maybe this will help (which it did at the time).    Yet to read it all yet but for me I started taking opiates (before I was prescribed meds) to basically try and "self medicate" so to speak... So for me it's/was basically a form of instant relief in a way. Anyway, love your blog :). Gonna read it all now.    I've been diagnosed btw, I dunno if that was a quote that yoh responded to about me or not haha... anyway may I ask something (that MAY be kinda personal) in a pm?    But what I'm telling you is just what I've gathered from a lot of health professionals (neurologists and stuff also) and about a year and a bit of opiate use.   So schizophrenia wasn't really caused by anything for me, it's just stuff I've gathered from health pros :).   And even they don't even fully understand the brain    Scientifically though, opiate use no matter what stage USUALLY doesn't do anything long term, except maybe depression. Also opiates have Anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic properties (I have no idea why they have anti psych properties, I don't even think scientists know this because we don't know SHIT about the brain let alone schizophrenia.   Opiates are actually one of the safest drugs (besides weed, heck even weed can bring schizophrenia out apparently). I know quite a lot about drugs especially opiates and alcohol since I was addicted to opiates and my parents are alcoholics.     It really depends on the drug, for example, opiates/opioids will not give you psychotic symptoms (except maybe through withdrawal) but drugs like amphetamine etc can. So you have to consider that.    Yes I have tried a few other meds, they either produced more symptoms or made me a zombie (but not sedated just emotion wise). They're working a little I guess, they've made me more insightful but the symptoms clear up then come back for longer than they've cleared up, it pretty much feels like the meds are trolling me.  I don't feel like being medicated forever, I'm just a little sad with having a mental illness I guess. Thank you for your input.   Also, it's just my positive symptoms that somewhat get better, negatives never have.    I've started seroquel as my new med, I've been on it for a month and a bit, and I've been starting to get a bit better but now it feels like symptoms still breakthrough and they're doing it a lot harder now, are meds just a false hope, I was pretty much better for a week and a half (maybe 2) and it feels like everything is coming back, especially paranoia (not so much the people inside my head).  I think meds are just a false hope... no point in them now. Love you guys :*   Make them live with an alcoholic for 15 years.   I'm still in that phase were the illness is really bad... And what makes the social aspect worse is, I have really bad disorganized thoughts, I talk a little like this, "yeah so I um I dunno what I was saying so maybe we can go and chill out at the mountain? Yeah uh, yeah I dunno". Which is hard.   Ever since I got my first symptoms of this disease I started withdrawing, it took a little over a year to basically be in complete isolation, I'm in the midst of this isolation and it's killing me, it feels like I've pushed all of them away, and it hurts that I don't have my best friend anymore, he's been my friend for a very long time.  Please help me, I don't know what to do, I see pictures of all of them having fun on Facebook, I drove past them all today, and they saw me like they saw a ghost... I just want my old life back.   Would you rather everyone essentially going mad?    Man, I can't handle pain at all. I had a lumbar puncture and needed pain meds for a week or two. Your pain threshold must be higher than Pluto compared to mine.   WHAT? No narcotics? Damn, how can it not hurt? I thought the mouth and stuff had pain receptors.   http://imgur.com/qUlb8G4   I feel like I'm a pussy for not being able to handle it better, sometimes I think everyone has what I have and they're just better at dealing with it and I'm lower than everyone.  Thank you, a lot. I don't know if I've hit rock yet, but I think I'm slowly getting there, but I don't want to, I want to go up NOW!!!   I did start CBT but I never finished it. It's really hard to do CBT for depression and anxiety when I'm psychotic, thank you for giving moral support so to speak.   Hey. So I've had moderate episodic depression for a while now along with schizophrenia and I just feel like it never gets better, the loneliness, the sadness, emptiness etc. sometimes when I come out of it I think that I will never go back into it, only to find my self depressed again. It's like it gives me hope when it goes away, and then takes all that hope away when it comes back.  Meh, I must just be a pussy. But does it ever get fully better? Ever?    But why would people thinking because I'm sometimes aware I'm ill that I can't be disabled with it? That's like saying people that know they have the flu or cancer can't be disabled with it, right?   Well, she thought the symptoms of schizophrenia weren't actually symptoms, which obviously made my depression worse because she put me down for having symptoms that she didn't see as symptoms... I just want to know why people do that? I don't get it.  And of course it made my schizophrenia worse because I lost more and more insight because of her.    I'm not irritated at all by self diagnoses, as long as you're very educated on mental health, as you said you were.  People in my family knew I was schizophrenic before any doc diagnosed me, so self diagnoses or semi self diagnoses or family diagnoses (in my case) can be helpful to the person and the doctor that will later diagnose you, well, in my case that's how it went.  And all you can do is get out of the house and get a psychiatrist AND psychologist and if you need one, someone that's educated on mindfulness, or research that form of meditation yourself and try it out while you're "in the dark" so to speak when it comes to meds. :)    The people that you would never think to even be depressed, commit suicide from it... It's extremely sad and shocking.  I'm very sorry, RIP.    Hey, so a story of my ex girlfriend...   Well, every time I was in the midst of a delusion and acting weird and strange, and very out there and you know, "paranoid", she would get angry and say, "you can't POSSIBLY blame your disorder/illness for this", I found this very insensitive and out right stupid.  As the disease progressed I would stop seeing people, essentially isolating and not washing and having thought issues, like word salad, and again she would look at me weirdly, scoff and say, "you can't blame schizophrenia *scoff*"... Funny thing is I never blamed schizophrenia at all.  And this goes for hallucinations and my depressive episodes too.  Why is this? Please answer anyway you want, you don't have to be nice if you don't want to :).    How do you know you're bipolar without a Dx?   I have a form if schizophrenia, and I'd like to ask, what's the worst mental illness to date? Jw.    Do you like fame? If so, why?   Everything in my head is telling me I'm dying, I just want some help, I'm in seroquel, I just want something to make me feel normal. I feel really trapped in my head and don't have anyone really to talk to. Thank you.   I've been told it can happen in psychotic disorders too (but I might be wrong). Maybe your brain is overwhelmed with all the noise and stuff and becoming detached.   And trauma doesn't HAVE to happen, no.    Dissociation?   Sorry for bad writing    Oh and suicide wasn't exactly in my thought, I'm thinking ebola got me    I love I'm the uk and I got sick and I'm in fear of my life that I got or had ebola and I'm giving it to people or that I'm slowly dying from it without knowing... And even if I didn't get it, what stops me from getting it in the future, I don't know what I'm even thinking... Just round and round, ebola, ebola, ebola in my head... What is this?    May I ask? Do you have any mental illness that makes you paranoid? Not judging as I do too but I try and not believe my insanity.   Hi, im still here. I was having a VERY bad few weeks, I'm starting to have some better days. I has a lumbar puncture so I've been incapacitated with pain.      For me at the start of delusions I know it's paranoia, then after a while if I don't take meds for a few weeks while it's starting, or maybe 5 months idk, I totally lose insight and shit... It's all insight.   So why are people wanting to kidnap me and my family and torture us? Why can't I think? Why can't I have relationships that last? Why do the voices commentate in what I'm thinking or doing? What is all of this? Why does it even exist, fuck it all.    This psychotic shit happens non stop, with or without meds, they just make it easier, without meds, I have no idea what time and place is.   I would give you gold if I had money, but most of it goes on opiates    Lately I've been having really on and off nausea, I've been having to force myself to vomit... I've been somewhat constipated (not going to the bathroom as much I used to) and unable to pass gas... I feel pretty bloated in the general abdominal, and my stomach is rumbling quite loudly and I've also had a runny nose. What could this be?    Either the pain meds (hydro) is causing it, or making the ibs worse... But without extra info or more symptoms I can't say for sure.   Well I knew I had some sort of mental illness before most doctors... Didn't know exactly what one, just thought some of the shit I was hearing and thinking wasn't right.   Haha, I love you man ha.   The longest I've made it is nearly 2 weeks lol, I've tried many times... But bad shit in life when you're trying to stop seems even worse, and that's what always makes me go back, ill try and make today my last:)   Alcohol made my dad into a loving caring emotional person into a hateful abusing pile of shit, in a matter of years...    I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, opiates aren't even recreational fun anymore, they're just something to block out the pain in life and stop my fucking obsessive fucking tendencies and all that shit, idk what I am saying, just sick of having to go through  so much shit day to day and having to hide it from everyone that can help me... What's the point? Does anyone have any advice here? I need my life back    I hate how people say addicts are these evil people, when in reality it's usually the opposite.   If I HAD to choose between alcoholism and opiate dependency, I would choose opiate dependency by far... Alcoholism fucked my family up.  	103
    Oh... She laughed hysterically after I did some explaining.    How is this funny?   A few years back, my friend and I were walking through Target and they had some of these up. She literally got super pissed off that they would make something so dumb and useless and thought they were for cats or some other small animal. I had to explain that they were for display purpose only and not for actual use. She felt pretty dumb. It was awesome. I make fun of her any time we come across anything miniature. To her credit, she was a super stoner back then.    Yep... I am a parent of three little girls. I would never pull this.  I want to punch most parents nowadays!   I laugh harder and harder every time I watch it.   OP must not have kids. I would rather wait an extra 10 minutes in the car than get all of my kids out of the car and have to corral them while in the restaurant. Drive through ANYTHING is a lifesaver when there are small children in the car.    That's an adorable baby. Also, a great idea for a baby shower game.  	8
                                                                         damn, that was a great speech.                              I disagree on it's easy. When I walk out a bar in Japan, I have a choice of taking a train, bus or cab home and they will all be there waiting for me within minutes. That doesn't happen in the US and when you've been drinking, preparing for alternative transportation usually is not on the top of your thoughts.  That being said, it's no excuse to drink and drive. I simple made the statement because even with tougher laws, I don't think the US would see the same dramatic drop in people not breaking the law due to it not being easy to find other transportation. But even a small drop would be fine by me.   The key difference is that Japan has quality and safe public transportation so that it's easy to go out drinking without driving or designating someone as a driver.       Not to have any resolutions - I learned long ago that if something was worth making a resolution about, it was worth beginning immediately instead of waiting for the New Year to begin.             It is this reason that I still don't understand why Kucinich is polling so low. The man tells the truth and has made the right call on all the big issues from a Democratic standpoint. I hope that we as voters are also brave enough o vote for a person that stands up for the truth and not someone who is supposedly "electable"      ??? Why is the goal $200,000 when the blimp costs $350,000 - am I missing something?  update: I see they changed it to $350,000   How about putting together a very simple webpage for an opposing candidate so not only does he lose money, it also earns the opposing candidate money ;)      Someone that seems to be talking from the heart for once instead of taking polls to see what they are supposed to say. If there is a better democratic candidate running, someone please show me what I'm missing. I don't understand why this guy isn't leadng in the polls.   Seriously, what happened to us as a country? Quite depressing to see what we have let our leaders do and it is abominable that there are not more in congress fighting to uphold the true American values.    It just depresses me to no end that of all the Democrats, there is only one that is willing to stand up to Bush and Cheney and try to hold them accountable for what they have done. If what the Bush adminstration has done sickens you, support this guy and help him keep up the fight to get rid of those that don't deserve to be where they are  http://www.december152007.com       The more I listen to him, the more I hope he gets the nomination. Granted, I don't agree with some of what he is promoting, but then nobody is going to agree with me 100% of the time. What is nice is he seems to have principles which I just don't see in the others running for office. It would be nice if he could garner the Internet support that Ron Paul has and although I have been silent on this thus far, I will do my part to help from this point forward (and hope that others here on Reddit who believe he is the best candidate of the bunch will do the same)  http://www.december152007.com      They really need to make a rule that anyone that says it isn't torture has to have it done to them. I bet that would solve the issue real fast.                                 These are the type of articles that should make it to the front page...a complete shame if this one doesn't.   woohoo - guess who's getting free beers tonight at the bar!               Actually, I can read fine, just can't type worth a damn...sorry about that.                                                                                    Yahoo maps seems to be hiding it too      Yes, the translation is pretty much dead on target. Not you average campaign speech...  	100

          It seems legit http://i.imgur.com/i9oKXza.jpg      What did you say before that  Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.  I was responding to your mindset that every time the Bible says Lord it means God.  On that I said it is untrue, adonai is used as Lord/Master of all or as Lord/Master.  But in this context it it is correct to say that in verse 3 it means God/Lord of all.     The headline is from Reuters. At the time the details were not known.    This guy is usually correct, except when it's about Israel...  https://conflictantiquities.wordpress.com/   Neither have I.   The whole thing doesn't make sense. As far as I know Shiites don't destroy Mosques.    IT 'source' [Al-Araby](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) writes clearly that the militias only seized the synagogue. The Shrine of Ezra still remains under Shi'a control.  I have no idea what went wrong..  I now compared [Al-Araby's photo](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/fullimage/3f9b540d-4039-45e8-a648-9a4779a0938d/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) to multiple photo's of the Shrine of Ezra.  There's absolutely no resemblance.   Side note; Josephus writes that Ezra Hasofer was buried in Jerusalem.     Why the two "cholem's" on the two "vuv's" in Washington?            It seems this was quite common those days.  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/6Xmr5iU.jpg) an ad for an anti-hitch device.       http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/14/world/middleeast/us-casualties-of-iraq-chemical-weapons.html?_r=0               You got it all wrong. One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child. Once his task is over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him.   God appeared.   18:1  Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre  The three angels.  18:2   And he lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing beside him,  This doesn't mean actually standing "right" beside him for then there would be no need to run towards them  and he saw and he ran toward them from the entrance of the tent,".   Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels.  18:3  My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.  One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child.   18:10 And **"he"** said    (note it's in singular form, it was one angel speaking)  I will surely return to you at this time next year, and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.  The angels task was over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him.   The other two angels who continued on to Sodom still had a task to fulfill.   18:22 And the men turned from there and went to Sodom  18:32   And the Lord departed..  (Source: Midrash)         Like I said before.   The context of Abraham asking God not to leave him while he attends the three arriving angels clearly implies that God was NOT one of them.   verse 1               Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he was sitting at the entrance of the tent when the day was hot.  verse 3        ****       And he said, "My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.  **** is in singular form because Abraham was addressing God, not the angels.   Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels.   where did yahweh come from?  He was there the whole time.                 Nope. Jacob was face to face with an angel who had God-like attributes, not God. You admitted to this by Moses and Aaron. /infinite loop      {deletion needed}   And so was the angel to Jacob....        The meaning for the word is always God.  Was Moses and Aaron Gods???         Never.  Jacob was striven with an angel, not God himself.    Besides for in reference to God, the word "Elohim" is used all over the Bible for false gods, angels and humans (Kings etc.).  Quick example, Exodus 7:1  The Lord said to Moses, "See! I have made you a **"Elohim"**( Lord) over Pharaoh, and Aaron, your brother, will be your speaker.  The Bible means that Moses was "divine' over Pharaoh because Moses was God's representative to Egypt.  This is how Genesis 32:29 should be read  And he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, **because you have striven with an angel of God** ("Elohim") and with men, and you have prevailed."  Edit: Just remembered Psalms 8:6 with "Elohim" in reference to angels  Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the **"Elohim"** (angels), and hast crowned him with glory and honor.        Read Yemens Rabbi Yahya Yousef Mousa opinion on Israel   It's a known fact   The same 'Houthis' that banished the Yemenite Jews from Saada and Raida in 2007..   You just forgot to mention the small little detail that the remaining Jews in Yemen are anti-Zionist...   You just forgot to mention the small little detail that the remaining Jews in Yemen are anti-Zionist...     Just last month Houthi's beat two Jewish boy's in Sanna and forced them to say the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God) and convert to Islam.  Edit: [See Link.](http://nationalyemen.com/2015/01/18/houthi-gunmen-attack-two-jewish-boys/)           Very sad! May his memory be blessed.     You are correct. Jabob wresling with the angel of Esau.   Some Christians try to twist the meaning of scripture and claim it was Jesus. They have this weird obsession with the Hebrew word "Ish" (Man).  Every time it is mentioned in the Bible they try to push Jesus in to it.  I'm in no way a Bible scholar and quite certain that I'm much younger then him. But for anyone who reads the Bible in Hebrew all these claims sound completely ridiculous.  For any real questions, the proper person to ask is a Rabbi.   True, but my statement is still valid. "Adonai" is pleural  and "Adoni" is singular.   According to you God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost all appeared in human form as "MAN" to Abraham. This is absurd. I doubt even Christians agree with you.  You also never answered my original question. If you interpret "Ish" to mean Jesus, how was Jacob able to overpower a God?    26 **When he saw that he could not prevail against him**, he touched the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob's hip became dislocated as he wrestled with him.     Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.  Sir, you are mistaken. The Hebrew word "Adonai" is used tens of times in Bible in a non divine way.   The meaning is Lord as in Master *Edit 2/17 for Clarification:[ and also as Lord of all or God].   I'm mobile right now, but if you'd like, later tonight I can bring examples to prove you wrong.   Your mistake may originate from the fact that you are reading a translation of the Bible instead of the Bible in its original form.   *Edit 2/17 for clarification In this case it does mean Lord/Master of all or God but he's mistaken to assume that Adonai is always is in reference to God.  But as far as I l know according to the Judaism  the text is not referring to the three men only God  See http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2vy0r5/serious_i_need_clear_explanation_for_this/conet74 for a proper explanation   This mistake comes from translating Hebrew to English and defining one word as it's meaning without looking at each case for its context     [Genesis 18]   They were three MEN  [Genesis 32:22-31]  Are you claiming that Jacob overpowered a God?    The Christian concept of "trinity" came much later (I think John) and flies in the face of the Bible's account of God being one.   Being three and somehow also one doesn't make sense.   If "God" is composed of the unity of three, then each part of that "God" is lacking and not absolute. This is not "One" "God".   Grouping the three dependent parts together and calling that trinity a one "God" doesn't diminish this.  Also no were does the Bible suggest that the Messiah will be in any way devine.

Suggest you click on 'take a tour' for a tour of our solar system.   Mass chaos   As of now its not legal for a search and rescue org. to use a drone to search for a missing person from the air.  The FAA considers them like for profit which aren't allowed to operate without a whole bunch of licences.   While a hobbyist can do as he pleases.  The FAA is clarifying the rules this year. Hopefully this will change.      The headline is the text from the website and what they claim to prove. [I](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2vi2wt/http_vs_https_speed_test/cohw968) and others clarified it in the comments section.    No, thats not it. Thanks anyway for the effort!   I'm also too young to have watched that...   Indeed it is. This site reminds of an IMAX film I once watched. Can't remember the name. Wish I could watch it again.  I stumbled on this website a few days ago.    That looks like a case of an inaccurate HTTPS speedtest result being sort of accurate... ;)   These types of fruad are also repetitive..   I got flamed for criticizing Obama on his Vox Interview.   In the end, after a very long covo. I managed to get a half-hearted apology from one of the Jew haters.     SPDY can disabled in Firefox by going to about:config and find network.http.spdy.enabled  and double-click on it to make it TRUE  Is this the case?   Its HTTPS with SPDY. Technically HTTPS is slower then HTTP, it's the SPDY that makes it faster.   Yeah, but currently the FAA deems all non-profit's as commercial and it would be illegal for an emergency responder to fly outdoors. He'd have to endanger himself to physically put the drone in the collapsed structure to be allowed to fly it.   Insane.   Be careful, I was flamed by two users for posting that video     This is why many Journalists ask to not have their passport stamped.     Thank you for the advice. I will surely keep it in mind. I apologize for calling him a troll.  In this case, I sent my post before reading his comment in entirety. It was sent after reading the first line, his fake quote. I thought he was just messing around.     Pravda means "Truth" in Russian. There's an old joke on Pravda Newspaper's so-called "Truth's"   "There is no Pravda in Izvestia, and there is no Izvestia in Pravda"   English "There is no truth in News, and there is no news in Truth."    It's a dying dialect.   One of the times I was at The Center for Jewish History, the librarian practically begged me to switch our conservation language to Yiddish. It seems she doesn't have too many people to practice her language skills with.  With Duolingo-Yiddish on the way, maybe there is still hope.     litvish/akademish, you mean the yiddishist dialect?      You caught me :)   I never suggested that, I agree with you.  I have no idea why my religious affiliation was brought up in this sub.  My political opinion and has nothing to do with my religious views. If the victims would have been Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, Atheist etc. I'd feel the same way.  My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT.  France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence.  He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't RANDOM. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...     So what? Jews aren't special, they're no better than anyone else.  Jews are not special and are no different than anyone else.  Jews don't claim to be "special".  What do you think "chosen" means?  If you think "privileged" you're making a big mistake, because being "chosen" doesn't make things easy. Actually the opposite is true. Were the Jews killed in Auschwitz "special" or "privileged"?  You get chosen for something specific, not just generally "chosen".  According to Judaism, G-d chose Jews for more duties, not privileges and is harsher to them when it comes to judgment. Jews have to obey 613 Laws while non Jews only 7.   Look at this link if you are interested in a really good detailed explanation http://www.simpletoremember.com/faqs/The_Jewish_Nation.htm     Which dialect?   They claim to have servers in 167 data centers world-wide   http://www.norse-corp.com/technology_overview.html   I was suggesting that when Muslims kill Muslims the Western Media is inclined to ignore it (Halal) and only when an "American" Drone kills an innocent Arab it gets Media attention. It's directed at the Media. Understand?  Yes, it may have been written in poor taste and I will delete it, but it's in no way how you think it is, islamaphobic etc  Lol, seriously? Look at the subs your a moderator of. look at your comment history. Your obviously a zionist   bang head on wall  Thank G-d I have a high tolerance level and can keep my cool but it's nearing the breaking point.  Do you even have a clue what the subs stand for?  I am interested in genealogy (the study of ones ancestry). Here's reddit's Genealogy sub  http://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/  I created a board for people who share common Jewish ancestors to connect and help each other with their family trees. As of now it's inactive.  All the subs stand for 'Jewish Genealogy'.   /r/jewgen /r/Jewish_Genealogy /r/jewishgen /r/JewishGenealogy  They aren't  "Zionist" code word's... Please explain what is racist or Islamaphobic about that. If anything you're the who is being racist and Judeophobic.   Am I not allowed to be interested in my Jewish heritage and ancestry?    Have a good one. I'm taking a brake from this non-sense. /bang head on wall    The source is irrelevant? Wow. You forgot how to be a credible person.  The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama. Anyone can listen to it without bias and decide for themselves.   Understand?  Edit 2/10 Is it important that it's disclosed what type of Muslim the victims are and what type of establishment they're in every time another situation happens?  Like I said before, my main issue is Obama calling it a RANDOM event.   Thank you for you concern.  My comments on this thread is my own political opinion and  has nothing to do with my belief. If the victims were Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, atheist etc. i'd feel the same way.  My humble opinion is that Obama is ignoring the victims and portraying this hideous attack as something trivial. Be the victims of any race or religion.  He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence  When I said that it appears that Obama is biased, I mean, that Obama has a political bias. Obama has a reason why he refrains from such discussions. I wont get it to it now, it's a side topic...  The only one who brought religion in to the discussion (if you can call it a discussion) was [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22).   [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) "knows" I am a Zionist (even though I'm not) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22)" knows" what's better for Jews  (I have no idea why my religion was dragged in to this political discussion) and expects I listen to his orders (typical liberal view of claiming to know better then the person and then advise them to do as they think).  You are both bigoted and anti-semitic.   Thanks for the heads up. The OP deleted his post and you are now only quoting my comment WITHOUT CONTEXT.   The OP posted that  violence against civilians doesn't equate to terrorism  my response was;  "Yes. "Hitler wasn't a terrorist" because he "didn't kill" for the purpose of scare tactics, rather for ethnic cleansing and world domination. According to you "Hitler was the good guy"?   My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT. He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...  Edit: I noticed you edited your post to try to make it look better in your favor    That's a lie.  Anyone can do that. Example:   I just quoted [/u/probablyreasonable](http://www.reddit.com/user/probablyreasonable) being unreasonable    The source is irrelevant.  Please stick to your argument.   Why is my title ridiculous? The accuser must bring fourth the evidence.    I agree with you that there's nothing wrong in calling Jews a "bunch of folks" or a Kosher supermarket a "deli".   The ONLY issue IS WITH THE CONTEXT, as you so rightfully say.   France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence. Couple that with the fact he doesn't mention any of the CONTEXT of the event, the kosher supermarket and the victims being Jews(which shows that it wasn't a random act of violence). It appears to me he's being *Edit for clarification 2/10 [politically] biased.   So yes, actually it's all about CONTEXT.  Interesting observation.  Your mouth is spewing vile hate, "extremist diartbags", "Zionist".. (which to your misfortune isn't true, I'm not a Zionist) and you have the audacity to call me an extremist?   Even though you don't care about all that I wrote an till now, i'll still do you a favor and tell you that you're ruining the image of whatever political party you belong to.  I suggest you take some deep breaths or maybe even a walk and then if you speak as a decent human being should i'll listen to your opinion.   *Edit 2/10 for clarification: The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama to youtube.   Anyone can listen to it without any bias and decide for themselves.   I agree  that there's nothing wrong in calling Jews a "bunch of folks?" or a Kosher supermarket a "deli".   The ONLY issue is WITH THE CONTEXT, as you so rightfully say.    France declared it was a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence which didn't target anyone specifically. Couple that with fact that President Obama did not mention any CONTEXT of said event and who was the target, makes me see him being politically biased.    OP, you're not going to garner support for your causes  You are wrong here again, Sir. I came on reddit to have a civil political discussion/debate. What makes you think I am trying to garner support. Am I a lobbyist?      He had in the past..   Friedlander actually did write commentaries under his own  Yes I know.

The line's that you see are called contour lines. Each contour line represents a specific value (number) of depth below the surface of the water.  The maximum depth till the bottom surface under the water (more deep) would be the high number and minimum depth of surface till the bottom surface under the water (more shallow) would be the low number.  So let's look at question 1a: What is the maximum depth (more deep/high - number) you would reach if you traversed along the path shown below? Follow the red line, at about 19.5 lat and 66.5 long the depth is -8,000 which is the deepest point on the line.     I second it.

Just remembered another wild claim. He wrote that President Woodrow Wilson was a descendant of a character in his book.     Most of the story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem comes from the book Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague by Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg.   R' Rosenberg also put out a book called Choshen Mishpat. I once read it and noticed it is almost an exact copy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Jew's Breastplate.  He basically plagiarized the whole plot, story-line, just switched the main character to the *Edit: [MaHaRaL] and added his own ending. He then presented the fictional tale as fact.     In the preface of both books Nifl'os Maharal miPrague and Choshen Mishpat Rosenberg claims it was based upon manuscript's he acquired.  Since I have proof he lied regarding the book Choshen Mishpat there's no reason for me to believe Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague  is anything more then fiction.   I believe the author has zero credibility and most if not all of his story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem is false.      [TWFM](http://www.reddit.com/user/TWFM) OP is ... well, lying.

It appears you are grossly ill informed on the Shi'ite Houthis relations with the Jews.  The Houthi's have a vast history of anti-Semitic violence against Jew.  The Jew's of Yemen are anti-Zionist due to the secular nature of the State of Israel. This hasn't helped them one iota.  In January 2007, Houthi leaders threatened the Jewish families in Saada and Raida, "We warn you to leave the area immediately... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."  The entire community fled to the capital where the President of Yemen gave the Jews protection in the Jewish quarter in Alafi Qaa, Sanna.  In 2008 Moshe Nahari, a well-known figure in Raida's Jewish community was shot dead.  Not too long ago a Yemenite Jew was stabbed to death. I also remember another incident where a hand grenade was thrown at a Jew which killed him. I don't know if it was by Houthi's or AQAP.  Last month two Jewish boy's in Sanna were beaten by Houthi's and forced to convert to Islam by praying the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God) to their prophet Mohammed.  The Jews of Yemen are constantly being being assaulted and harassed.  The Houthi's destroyed their homes, sanctuaries, cars, took their money and property.  They took over Yemen's Jewish library which also holds many antique Jewish manuscripts and a very ancient and rare Torah scroll.  In the 1930's there were over 40 synagogues in Sanna alone, today there's only one left. Many Jewish cemetery's were also destroyed.  This the end of the 2,500 year's of Jews in Yemen.   So no, "Death to Israel" is not a reaction to government policy, it's plain old Jew hatred.    but unlike the Sunni extremists they don't go above their heads to kill Americans and Israelis and won't if they're not fucked with in Yemen.

So no, the Houthi's aren't any different then other extremists with regard to their hatred to Jews. In a sense they are worse. Anti-Semites justify their hatred by saying they are only anti-Israel. The Jews of Yemen are clearly anti-Israel and still being targeted.    If it's disturbing your normal routine of life you should see a psychologist/therapist. Cognitive therapy may also help.    Do you experience the same level of anxiety in all large gatherings and events or is your anxiety predominant in a religious setting?  If your anxiety is predominant in a religious setting, it may very well be that your anxiety stems from a fear of being judged/guilt on religious observance or someone finding out a dark secret/sin which you are embarrassed about.

There's an ongoing attempt to re-brand the entire Haram al-Sharif (The Temple Mound) as al-Aqsa, a campain for an overall dejewification of the 'Har Habayis'.   The Dome of the Rock is a shrine (with 7th Century mosaic passages, some anti-Christian) with no special holiness in Islam while 'al-Aqsa' or 'Farthest Mosque' is a 'Masjid' (Mosque) where according to Islam happened the first 'Qiblah'.  They intentionally uses pictures of the 'Qubbat As-Sakhrah' (Dome of the Rock) for 'al-Aqsa'.   I don't know if here's the right place to discuss.  My comment was in reference to this;   No prophet has the authority to go against the Torah in any way  After further thought I agree that in essence you are right.

In the Brooklyn Museum (p.276, fig. 310) resides a papyrus scroll numbered Brooklyn 35:1446 which was acquired in the late 19th century by Charles Wilbour. This dates to the reign of Sobekhotep III, the predecessor of Neferhotep I and so the pharaoh who reigned one generation before Moses. This papyrus is a decree by the pharaoh for a transfer of slaves. Of the 95 names of slaves mentioned in the letter, 50% are Semitic in origin. What is more, it lists the names of these slaves in the original Semitic language and then adds the Egyptian name each had been assigned, which is something the Bible records the Egyptians as doing, cf. Josephs name given to him by pharaoh (Genesis 41:45). Some of the Semitic names are biblical and include:- Menahem, Issachar, Asher, and Shiprah (cf. Exodus 1:15-21) - John Fulton   Sorry?

I was right. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/no-jordans-king-abdullah-ii-not-personally-flying-planes-against-isis-1486742   Doesn't make sense. Jordan's King is a helicopter pilot and never flew a fixed-wing, let alone a fighter jet.   Doesn't make sense. Jordan's King is a helicopter pilot and never flew a fixed-wing, let alone a fighter jet.   submit it to http://www.jewishgen.org/ViewMate/ for free translation    It's the cockpit of a blackhawk helicopter.   I think these reports are not true.  The photos of the Jordanian King wearing a flight suit was in a non-combatant role in a H-60 black hawk helicopter. He is a helicopter pilot and never flew a fixed-wing, let alone a fighter jet. When Jordan bombed ISIS it was with F-16 fighter jets.   Yes. It seems so. The video editing alone would not have been possible to create in a short period of time.      Interesting. From what I read on twitter, it seems there's a very big crowd awaiting him at the airport. I had the impression the mood was quite different. - We are all Moaath, Kullnah Moaath,    :)    I wrote this brief chronicle of events pertaining to the killing of Jordanian pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh.  Aug 17, 2014 - ISIS posts a video of Haruna Yukawa, a captured Japanese national.  Sep 2014  The King of Jordan   Japan join the US-led coalition against ISIS.  Dec, 24 2014 - ISIS posted a video which purportedly shows a successful hit from a shoulder fired missile on a Jordanian F16 Fighter Jet. Videos and photos of captured Jordanian Pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh was also uploaded.  Dec 24, 2014 - US Central Command said in a statement that evidence clearly indicates that ISIS did not down the aircraft.  Dec 25, 2014 - The Pilot's father went on Jordanian State Television and pleaded for ISIS to have mercy on his son (later, not sure when, I think Kasasbeh's brother was also on State TV).  Jan 6, 2015 -ISIS released a video titled Message from Muslims to the Family of the Pilot.  Jan 8, 2015 - Activist and blogger Abu Ibrahim Al-Raqqawi tweeted A group of #ISIS members in #Raqqa are talking among them enthusiastically about the execution of Jordanian pilot, Maath al-Kassassbeh, who was burned to death by #ISIS,  Jan 17, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled "Interviews About the Jordanian Pilot".  Jan 19, 2015 - In a video titled A Message to the Government and People of Japan ISIS threatened to kill two Japanese hostages if a ransom of $200 million was not received within a 48 hour deadline (no pun intended).  Jan 24, 2015 - After the 48-hour deadline passed, ISIS released a video titled Slaughtering a Japanese Captive and Appeal of Second To His Family and Government in which Japanese hostage Kenji Goto Jogo stated that his fellow captive Haruna Yukawa was executed.  ISIS then switched their demands and stated the Jordanian will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI (al-Qaida in Iraq) terrorist held by the Jordanian Gov. is released within the next 72 hours.  January 27, 2015 - In an ISIS released video titled Final Deadline for the Jordanian Government To Release Sjidah al-Rshaw Before Sunset Thursday, Japanese hostage Kenji Goto stated that the Jordanian air force pilot held by ISIS will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI terrorist held by the Jordanian authorities is released by Sunset.  ISIS intention was to swap Kenji Goto for Sajida al-Rishawi.  January 27-28, 2015 - The Jordanian Government agreed to free Sajida al-Rishawi, but only in exchange for their air force pilot Lieutenant Muadh al-Kasasbeh and only after proof of life was given.  Japan wanted to stick to ISIS demands and have their journalist Kenji Goto freed.  ISIS did not publicly respond to the Jordanian Government.  January 29, 2015 - The deadline set forth by ISIS passed, with Jordanian Officials demanded proof of life of before agreeing to any exchange.  January 31, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled A Message to the Government of Japan with footage of Kenji Goto's dead body.  Feb. 2015 - Jordan threatened to expedite the execution of ISIS and AQI terrorist members who were currently in their custody if Kasasbeh would be killed by ISIS.  Feb. 3, 2015 - ISIS posted a 22-minute long video titled "Healing of the Belivers Chest" which includes footage of the Jordanian air force pilot Kasasbeh doused in flammable material, locked in a cage being burned alive.  Feb. 3, 2015 - Jordanian State TV reported that Jordanian pilot Kasasbeh was killed a month before on January 3, 2015. It is unclear how they concluded his exact day of death and why it wasn't known or publicized before.  Feb. 3, 2015  The Jordanian Government said that prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi, the woman ISIS wanted in the prisoner exchange and Ziad al-Karbouli, both AQI terrorists, were executed in response to the video.   Contrary to popular news reports, the walls of the ancient city of Nineveh in Iraq wasn't destroyed by ISIS. https://twitter.com/Eleanor_Robson/status/561135033134899200 https://twitter.com/Eleanor_Robson/status/561246788410437632   I have the TIKKA RXP and it works well for me.

    Glad they took him out second half.    Ya I did seem he slap his legs or just get pissed if when someone made a small mistake. For example someone passed the ball to the other team he got pissed and just walked away instead of getting the ball back.      He didn't do so well tonight he seemed lazy and didn't try to run the ball even tho the ball opportunity wasn't gonna happen he still needs to make the runs. It seems like he doesn't believe in his team.    I did, I was great game to watch my first soccer game too!!   I am in millersville md if your going to the game we can meet there maybe?    Are you serious?!   I just wanna watch the game for tonight you can change the password after tonight willing to provide identity info.   Cool, I was wearing that shirt today.   Ya sorry, thanks!   Roof is not shared but could they say it is because we live in a townhouse?   And if they do prohibit me can I file a lawsuit and if I do how good of a case will I have?   Owners of the neighborhood   Wait I live in a town house, and they say I can't put a dish on the roof you're telling me it's illegal to say that?   Same here except soccer is a fall sport, we play same time as football.   Soccer and track are at the same time where you love?   What is Cinderella story?   Nice interview, I sometimes forget soccer players are human so it's nice to see his personal side.   Does that mean New York fc and red bulls will be both our rivals?   Just like steelers are rivals with Ravens who is Dcs rival?   How you doin?      Are you asking if the tweak works with other apps? Then yes you can buy most in app purchases for free.       Confidence is never a problem way I see it, he thought he could do it but messed up.   I don't take it as a loose it would have been great to win but not a lose. I say we learned we can even compete against the best in the east.   Ya, it's great! Totally a awesome start to a season   I thought since the crew was high up in the rank we wouldn't do so well but to my surprise we did excellent. It was a great game to watch.   This is really cool I didn't know this existed    Imma send you a new laptop pm me       Ya and I would love to watch some MLS games with a team I will have a actual bond with.   Or make a team here in the states.    Thanks I don't usually see women soccer on tv do it's refreshing to see it does.   Will it be on tv?   THANKS! You're great!   Just wondering if anyone has some good soccer wallpaper.   I used to run a business and it was successful other than that no particular experience in ftbol management.

 I seriously doubt your bookmark's bar actually saves you any time.  Typing in a web address would be much faster than sifting through all that shit.

According to the dentist, the nerve on one of my molars died and then became infected.  So, the guy who said "blood and puss" is today's winner.  The only reason it ever got to this point is because I'm a Canadian that was traveling in the U.S. and couldn't see a dentist until I got home.  Thanks for your concern everyone, I'm on antibiotics and was even prescribed percocet for the pain so I'm high as a kite.   Thanks for the suggestion!

       Rubular (http://www.rubular.com/) is also very helpful.   I find NB to be quite good for both plain Ruby, and Rails development.      Here's the irony: A good programmer will write more and better test code because they are more aware of what could possibly go wrong; however their code already reflects their awareness of those potential problems, and therefore while the tests help, they are in a way a double-check for something that they've already well covered in their code.  On the other hand, a poor or novice programmer will have less awareness of what could possibly go wrong, and therefore won't account for those things in their code, but because they're unaware of them, won't write proper tests that would catch those potential problems. So in either case, the helpfulness of tests is limited; the former because their code is generally good enough without the tests, and the latter because their knowledge is too poor to write good tests, and once they're knowledge increases their code gets better and therefore their need for tests decreases.  That doesn't mean tests are not useful. Where I believe they shine is not in catching defective code, but in making sure that a change made to one piece of code doesn't break something somewhere else that may seem unrelated (or that you didn't remember was related), without having to "manually" test the app by running through all the steps. The larger and more complex the app, the more important this becomes and saves countless hours of checking to see if everything still works.                              +1 Lets focus on more important things.   Datamapper (http://datamapper.rubyforge.org/) is promising too.   +1   If the time that you saved writing significantly shorter but more obtuse code is then lost when trying to read that code later (or someone else trying to read the code), then you didn't save any time.   	18
 Without spoiling? I wouldn't want to influence your view on the show, but since you ask, I believe a massive chain of cerebral strokes unleashed upon the writers of the show after s4. It just gets from one of the best series I've seen to, well... Dexter post s4.   He's talking about prevention, not to try and learn how to plays instruments when you've already been diagnosed.   *Every night you wake    Every sleep you fake    Every clock you break    Every all-nighters    I'll be watching you.*   Wait for the plot to develop   How is this poor execution if OP got exactly what s/he wanted and is happy about it?  I for one love the tat, but for real (and this is so clich but true), the important thing should be that OP likes it    Every application were life depends upon electricity has generators.  Serious question, do have sources for this? I'm not trying to discredit you, it's just that I live in Argentina, a third world country that has a better average quality of life than Pakistan, and here some hospitals don't even have needles, let alone generators.

Me gusta sentarme tranquilo, tener el celular con batera, boludear en Reddit, no s, me tomo mis 15 o 20 minutos. Y no es que cago en 2 min y los 18 restantes caliento la porcelana, hasta que no sale todo, no me levanto. Es ms, adivin desde donde estoy escribiendo esto.  Este es el post ms TMI de mi vida.   "Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville, and this is Jackass!"   Me sumo. Mi (ahora ex) novia viajaba ese da, y si algo es esa piba es obsesiva de lo puntual. Siempre tomaba el mismo tren, el que llega 8.32 (o alrededores) a Once, y la noche anterior se qued en casa. Yo viajaba seguido tambin, pero esas fechas estaba de vacaciones.             No me pregunten por qu pero la noche anterior, cuando nos estbamos acostando, le dije que no vaya a donde tena que ir. Simplemente tenia un mal presentimiento. Nos despertamos 6:30 am y se lo volv a decir, quera que se quede en casa conmigo, y bueno, lo hizo.         Nos despertamos 9 y pico con el mismo escenario, 25 mil llamadas perdidas cada uno, y empezar a tratar de entender qu estaba pasando. Fue horrible para nosotros que estbamos en casa, no me quiero ni imaginar para el resto de la gente que lo vivi de mucho ms cerca.            Fue algo fortsimo, al da de hoy sigo pasando por el mural de Once, y s que si me detengo a verlo, me angustio instantneamente.   Poseidog   Gold at negative...

Si llega aviso!   Esto quera saber, no conoca la pgina. Es de fiar?    You're very welcome! It's crazy indeed. Even more crazy was that in that time of war, our newspapers and TV news channels said *we were winning the war*, when that was absolutely incorrect. Bare in mind, lots of TV shows made 24hs transmissions with entertainment content to gather food and clothes for the soldiers, all of which ended up in the hands of the generals and commandants, and none of the soldiers...   It's a very interesting subject, what happened in Argentina (well, latinamerica to be more precise) around the late 70s and early 80s. Google it and you'll be amazed with the numbers. For example, close to 30.000 people were abducted, tortured, killed and disappeared by the military forces that were in power then, only in Arg. The huge majority of their bodies are still missing, with little to no data about what happened to them.  It's a part of our story that is very present to this very day, because a lot of the babies that were stolen by the same forces then are now adults who rediscover their identities with DNA tests and come foward as "hijos/nietos de desaparecidos" (sons/grandsons of disappeared people). Lots of us (me including) have family members or family friends who've been abducted and tortured. It was a dark time, and a scar that isn't quite cured yet.   I think you should go and see a doctor, you may be experiencing a stroke   I'll try to be brief, it's a very long subject, but basically... British people have populated the Falkland Islands for a long time, and they've claimed it as their own. In 1976-1983 there was a military dictatorship goverment in Argentina, and between all the shitty and genocidial decisions they took, they decided to "recover" the Islands. They sent 18 year old boys with faulty old weapons, very few clothes and very few food to battle agains a very, VERY superior british army.  Of course our country lost that war, leaving 600+ dead argentinian boys and a huge scar in the history of our country. The Falklands remain british territory, and some people here say that we should reclaim them again, that they are ours, not theirs.  If you ask me, the majority of people of my age (I'm 23 years old) doesn't really care about them. I say leave them the Islands, we can't get our country to run properly, why add more territory that we can't handle? It was pretty good trade point but we don't use that kind of export zone anymore, so we don't really have a use for them.   Also, in my age group, there's very little to no hate towards british people or their culture. It's a thing that older people have mostly, and generaly they're also big retards in other aspects of life or political understanding. That war was just an excuse to mantain the dictatorship longer in power. The militar that was president then and that commanded the war (General Leopoldo Galtieri) was a dude that LITERALLY went to public speeches totally DRUNK, and sometimes with a glass of whisky in his hands. So, as you can see, this war was pretty pointless to begin with.  Since then (1983) a lot of the argentinian culture was based on that british hate. For example, that soccer game where Armando Maradona passed alone like 4 or 5 rivals and scored a goal is mostly remembered here not only because it was a great play, but also because it was against Britain in the World Cup.   I for one can't hate someone just because they were born here or there, it just seems stupid to me. I know that the majority of british youth doesn't even care about that war and/or us, so... It's all good.   It's a coincidence! They are from that "saliva" (IDK how it's called) the snails leave on their trace. Still a incredible picture nonetheless.   An 'OK job'? Who would even brag about getting an 'ok' handjob?   Someone's having a bad decade   Argentinian here, what you are going to want to say is "las Malvinas son argentinas". Although I particullary don't agree with that whole thing, lots of argentinians do, and they'll love you if you say it.

Pero de repente empieza a twittear pelotudeces que se interpretan como el orto y que hasta un mono entrenado se da cuenta que son impublicables. Es raro.   Fuera de joda, no pods tuitear eso... Es una animalada.      Ahora hay todo un trending de poner *"Si la tocan a Cristina, [inserte algo aqu]"*, as que SUPONGO que lo habr puesto por eso, pero igualmente NO PODS hermano... es 99,99999% interpretable que lo pone justamente por haberlo suicidado a Nisman.       Qu desastre, la verdad tena una opinin medio ambigua de Alex Freyre (ms que nada por lo que dicen que hizo con toda la movida de los anti-retrovirales en los 90), pero ahora me parece llanamente un boludo. No se d cuenta que con ese tuit esta embarrndose zarpado l y al gobierno que quiere defender? Lo pregunto de verdad, no se detuvo a pensar un segundo?

La polica es una fuerza. Tiene armas. Es una fuerza armada.   [a comment protecting the Thalmor]   Yeah, their mods are pretty harsh there, I've read a lot of complaints about their management.  Nevermind, we can fill you up with karma in no time here.   S, lo creo, pero ms que nada por una cuestin de saber cmo se maneja la gente con tanta plata, y no tanto por las investigaciones que han salido a la luz. Tampoco siento que haya mucha evidencia concreta, pero no es que me puse a investigar ni ahond mucho en el tema tampoco.  Resalt "acusaciones" porque una cosa es un hecho fctico, comprobable, que pas, como lo que dije de De la Ra, y otra cosa son acusaciones, que si bien pueden ser ciertas como no, estn en un limbo de veracidad y no tienen jams el mismo peso que un hecho.   /r/cringe   I agree with you, but I wanted to say something about this bit   Unless they come up with some novel way of procedural generation of areas to make it feasible but I doubt this will be a surefire fix to this problem.  Bare in mind that Diablo 3 (and I'm sure other games do this as well) already has something similar; in the infinite dungeons you get random generated dungeons (that could be caves or spaces in TES) that never end until you either die or choose to get out. I see this could be applying in TES with a few tweaks in the future to make it more RPG-alike and less ARPG, like Diablo 3.    I think what he meant is that in a future we could mod SkyWind and SkyBlivion into Skyrim, to make it all a single game.  Now that I think about it, could this be actually done? I haven't played other TES other than Skyrim, but I'm guessing they occur in different times and the stories could get crossed.   There's just so much of it   Spanish! Sorry I took so long answering this, I didn't see your comment haha   A De la Rua se lo raj porque la economa era una mierda. Hoy la economa es una mierda nuevamente  No pods comparar NI EN PEDO el estado de la economa hoy con el estado de la economa el 20/12/2001. Por supuesto que no es buena, pero es mucho mejor que cuando el corralito estaba vigente y todas las medidas que le siguieron.    De la Ra declar Estado de Sitio con toque de queda y murieron manifestantes bajo su poder a mano de fuerzas armadas que estaban reprimiendo, y defendiendo esa animalada. Tambin fue el presidente responsable cuando se tom la medida del "corralito". Son datos fcticos y con sangre, algo MUY distinto a las *acusaciones* por enriquecimiento ilcito. Ests comparando cualquier cosa, me parece errneo decir "por mucho menos". De la ra tenia un pas entero en su contra y decidi tomar una medida an peor.   The sad part for me is that this isn't even the first time I've got rickrolled this year.      I work at a pharmacy and I was restocking the aspirine section, when I dropped 2 boxes to the floor and accidentaly tripped with them.  15:17: dropped the boxes.            15:17: tripped.      15:17: im on the comedown now.       15:17: I think I really hit bottom, no more drug dropping for me.       After two weeks of being dankrupt, I learned that my dealer got busted, and it appears that he's going away for a long time. This is super bad news to me as I don't know any other good dealers, and in my country is hard to get good weed.  Maybe I'll start growing my own, but its going to take time and practice. Sigh, it's a sad day for me, ents. I'm forseeing months without any, but well, I guess it was about time to start growing my own.  Uptoke for me tonight, friEnts. I love you all.   *I included a TL;DR at the end.*  So, last night I was wondering if I could consume Salvia in an edible way, to get a longer and more controlable/less chaotic trip, but the problem was I had only an extract (40x) and not the leaves.  After reading a bit, I decided that the best way of getting there with the tools I had was smoking slowly and in slow quantities. Around 00:30 my parents went to sleep, so I locked the door, made sure there wasn't anything breakable in my surroundings, got the water pipe out, the torch lighter, and the extract. This was my first time solo, and I wanted to go slowly and with care. I had 2 pretty strong experiences and 1 total breakthrough with Salvia, but always with friends, music, and lights on.  So, I smoked a bit and felt a little bit weird at about 3 minutes. This was still with the lights on. I still knew who and where I was, and that I was feeling like that because of the drug. I take another hit and now things begin to vibrate. I'm starting to loose the grip of my selfness and begin to see my vision sense as something more abstract, more "decontextualizable". I begin to see my perception of my life itself as something material, more simplified and understandable. I believe at that point that I'm going too fast, so I wait a bit, and when the high goes a bit down at 10 minutes, I pack another small bowl and hit it, but now I'm with the lights off and near to my bed.  When I did this, I lay down in the bed and put on an eye mask (those things they give you in airplanes so you can't see), and now I begin to see myself, my conciousness, as I start to "fall" from reality. After a couple of minutes of mild visuals and "seeing" myself, I decide to take another hit, a bigger one, and when I do, I lay down again, put on the mask, and exhale. When I did, I began to see my perception and my mind itself, my "way of thinking, of perceiving, of existing in this body" in a very material way. I mean that I materialised my very existance and understood in that moment that I am not only a human being, this is one my forms and therefore one of my many, many realities. I saw myself as an infinite being, which has no notion of past and future, only present, and that this, my human form of thinking, of existing, and of perceiving, is only one way of an arranged and organised way of existance.   I saw the very fabrics of my reality, I now understand that what I perceive is a frame in a multiple quantity of frames, each one different from the other. I am currently in this one, but with Salvia I fell from it and watched it from far away, with perspective.   Now, this is important. I began to panic because I couldn't think and perceive the existance as I used to, and I was afraid to be this way for ever, because I had understood reality itself and now there was no turning back. But, when this happened, I remembered that someone here said to "let go". Just let go your way of thinking, stop trying to control everything that happens on your trip, and surrender yourself to randomness. I did, I gave up every control I was trying (unsuccessfully) to have and it was very liberating. I fell in the flow of my trip and all traces of fear were gone.   And then, I peaked. I saw ripples of different realities being generated with each motion of myself and with each thought, and in an infinite loop saw how these very realities formed a much giant larger one, like a field of reality made of little tiny other ones, and this giant larger one reapeated itself infinitely to form another giant reality, and so and so on, for eternity. I remember trying to stand up (in these other realities, I was really in bed and not trying to stand up for real), and when I did, I remembered that I've been always standing up for eternity and saw myself doing it for ever. I was wordless, I was witnessing the fabrics of existance and I won't ever forget that. It was one of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen.  This went on for 2 hours **(!)** and it had ups and downs. As I began to enter reality again, I saw it as more complex and more "in focus" than when I was watching it from far away, and I saw myself, surrounded with my notion of the universe, as super super tiny. When I was coming back, I began to see the back of my head and the universe complete, in very similar sizes. But, as I was stepping into this reality again, my head and the notion of myself began to grew smaller, and the universe larger, until it took the form and size that has now. When I watched my clock, it said 2:30am, and I couldn't believe it. It was like 5 minutes for me.  This is by far one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had. I hope to never forget the amazing places I saw and how I surrender myself to the trip, the first time of my life I gave up control entirely and met the Salvia experience entirely. I felt the plant itself, a gigantic powerful being, carrying me to show the other realities behind this one and making me understand that yes, this is one of many, many ways of perceiving and that I am much more than only one of them. It's like seeing yourself, but not you in your human form, not you in your name and in your country, in your world and in your galaxy. You, as an existing being, and nothing more. Undefinable by our common standars, by our very existance. You just are, and now you are in this frame, in this reality, but just for the moment. It's amazing.  I believe this is the right way **(FOR ME)** of doing Salvia, in the dark, alone, and without anyone watching you. Please, note that this experience was made at my own risk, and I do not reccomend anyone to try this for their first time of doing Salvia. Read and research A LOT before smoking Salvia, and if it is your first time, always do it with someone else; a sober sitter. I, in particulary, feel that being watched by my friends launching questions to me every 20 seconds and with music makes me paranoid and kind of having bad trips. I enjoyed this experience way much than my previous ones (which I also enjoyed in perspective).  **TL;DR:** Smoked Salvia 40x extract very slowly, alone, and in complete darkness. Tripped a lot, surrendered myself to the plant, and saw my very self as a part of much other existance forms. Total ego loss and understood my existance as an morphless being. Chose to come back after 2 hours and did, and now I see reality as only 1 option of perception.  Thanks for reading! If you have any questions or if you want to share some experiences, I'll try to make sure to comment on them all. Sorry if this is poorly worded; English isn't my first language. If something is sketchy please tell me and I'll try to rephrase it.   I want to go for the larger and less chaotic trip that smoking provides. I know that some people chew the fresh leaves and that this provides a longest and nicest trip, more controlable and enjoyable, but I don't have any.  Is there a way of cooking it or making a tea with the extract? Thanks!   Last week I tried it for the first time, and I loved it. It was a gram of 20X extract, and I smoked around 0.2g, with a water bong and a torch lighter. I loved the experience, it was pretty harsh coming back, but looking back at it, it was amazing. So amazing that I smoked again that same night, a few hours later, and loved it again.  Now I have 1 gram of 40x extract, and I'm probably going to smoke some today with my SO. The thing is, tomorrow I'm going to my friend's house, the one who has the 20x extract, and we're probably going to smoke as well that day. He sure is, I will see how I feel in the moment.  But, if I decide to, is there any risk for my health? I know there's no OD with this plant, but being the psychedelics effects so strong, can it damage me in any way?  Thanks!   EDIT: Hey guys! Many many thanks for all the responses. I didn't smoke today though, but tomorrow I will. I will keep track of how I'm feeling when I repeat the experience, sadly there's little to no information about this plant but everything seems to point that no risk is involved. I'm going to explore it with care and measure anyways, and I'll keep you guys informed if anything off happens.  Again, thanks a lot for the comments! They were of real help.       Instagram clearly refuses to add another format than 1:1, but now Facebook (again, because they did this in the past but then removed it) is forcing people to crop 1:1 their new profile photos. It just sucks.  I just don't understand why is this. Can someone tell my why social networks are choosing to force people to 1:1, and if some other sites are using it as well? Of course you can add edges to your pic, but that decreases the size and therefore the quality of the picture when zoomed.  Thanks in advance.           Too many are the times people get in a game only to find out on the loading screen that they have ping and can't play properly. This would avoid a lot of that happening.         This is a slow sub. And not because of quantity of suscribers, but because the majority of us are all fucking stoned.  A post can stay in the frontpage for an entire day, maybe two, reaching it with ~200 karma and ending up with +2000. We take our time to read, to see, to comment and to vote.  I love you, Ents.      I see this a lot on TV shows and movies, and I was wondering if this is true or just a Hollywood thing, like the 555 - phone number thing.      not a bluff not karmawhoring noreligious input  no BULLSHIT, JUST [10] AMA         Well, this is my first post in /r/nosleep. I hope I'll be able to express myself well, since English isn't my first language.           I was thinking, almost meditating, about distances between us people, and how the technology now easily available in every home allows us to connect us and debate instantly about ideas and conceptions. That's admirable, and it's something to remember and charish. Let's not take it for granted.            But also, on the other hand, at the same time a lot of people can not access to this technologies and therefore is marginated from that community, geting behind in human evolution pace. And, a lot of them can not tell us their realities such as we can, and must be in dark places and needing our help, but without getting it. And it made me sad, to think of all those people, departed from their beloveds, kidnapped girls, war prisoners, war victims in the middle east, everyone and everything that you love, gone.                  And that made me wonder about my beloved ones, my house, my things. My life. What if, say 2 to 3 years from now, some political debate gets into a discussion, and then into an issue, and then, into a international complaint, and then, into a war. And its a war with your country, and another very threatening one. And this is ALL from a trouble that to this day, did not exist. Maybe it'll originate tomorrow, but, there's a chance that in 3 years, you will be in that situation.                                              With your beloved ones gone. Imagine your neighrhood, destroyed, your family killed brutally by bombs and bullets of high .cal, your sons and brothers, and fathers, burned and mutilated. Imagine them, with their faces and their voices gone. You knowing that you wouldn't see them anymore, hear them anymore, hug them anymore. Feel them anymore, not ever again. Your pets, all killed as well, you and a few people you know and members of your family survived, but the hunt isn't over yet and you may be the next victim. Or your left beloved ones.                  So, this is something that seems far from true, and we say ourselves that it doesn't actually seems like something that could happen, so, I'm tranquile and I sleep well that way, not thinking about it. But, it could, it HAS, it IS (in other country, to people like you and me), in it WILL BE in some point, another great war.                                  It may not be violent war, with bombs, nukes and airplanes, it could be a echonomical war, which then ends in you and your family in poverty, dying from hunger and great recesion, or a civic war, or I don't know. We, as humans, know that in time, shamefully it's going to happen.                  And now, us that can seen it before it happening, need to do something. But we can't. It's not up to us.                      It's NOT up to us. It's up to THEM.                  And THEY will decide if its your country's turn, my country's turn, or someone else's country turn. We just have to wait and... see.              *Keep a good ear for the bangs and booms.*          EDIT: a word    Time when you don't smoke weed to avoid or dimish tolerance to THC      Ever since Season 1, when they're about to kill Eddard I was thinking "OK, he's going to get saved, obviously, any moment now... any moment... wait... what?", and so I learned that this show is not like any other show, or books for that matter.  What I mean is that I never expected to so much main characters to die, and this is something positive for me, because although I do not wish them to die, but to win and live happy forever (well, not quite, but you get my point), I enjoy the thrill of fights and challenges the characters face, because now I know that they CAN die. In any other shows, they won't die, they will only get CLOSE to dying and they'll be saved in the last second, and you get the thrill of suspense in fights and the not knowing, but you kinda expect that they will end up victoriously. But not here.  For example, when I watched last night's episode (S04E09), I was tense through the whole thing, and that's because Martin isn't afraid to kill a main character. I knew Jon could die any moment there, it was a real possibility, and that filled me with excitment. Again, I wanted him to "win" and that things ended well, and that's the same reason why I got so hyped up: because I knew the chance of that not happening was a real thing.  I like this feature a lot. It's like a double edged sword: on one hand, I get to see the characters for which I developed certain amount of affection get slaughtered, but on the other, I get the thrill and excitement of death and the "bad guys winning".  Sorry for bad english!                  Couldnt figure that out. I'm talking about this http://i.imgur.com/aX7t395.jpg  You can even see the pinetree carscents hanging (to soften the rotten smell I guess), I highlighted them in the third column.     *Sorry for bad english*       Assuming that it's legal and from someone who hasn't been brutally murdered (or even murdered at all, let's asume a piece of an amputated limb or what have you).  I think I would try that, just out of curiosity.         A friend of mine is starting to play LoL, so I created a new account to play along with him. We duoqueued (LVL 5 and 8 accounts), and we played like 10 or 12 games. This was just about now.   We lost most of these games, but not because of him being new, but because EVERYONE else was smurfing. And I mean, heavy smurfing. I was smurfing too of course, but I wasn't playing like full-hardcore-commando-faker. I'm very surprised of the quantity of people smurfing in low levels. I saw plays that seemed like my ELO (Plat II currently), correct builds, warding, jungle timing, epic ganks, etc.    I tryharded some games and we won with the right calls, but they were 40 - 45 min lenght games. True torture.    He went to sleep and I thought "hey, this must be because of the duoqueue matching us with better opponents", so I soloqueued for a bit and the story repeated itself.    What the hell is going on? I can't imagine the hell new people are going through right now, system matching them against (and with) smurfs all day.  	105

       I know that the typical response to this is that I should wait for the games to possibly go on sale as a flash, daily or community deal but the fact of the matter is that it is winding down.     What are some good games that have yet to, or won't, be featured that people should get?      .  .  Some examples would be: FUEL and "The Last Remnant" for the former is good with the refueled mod and the latter is an older game.  I am not looking for anything in particular but general suggestions.      This is the start of the second season after the recap of the first two seasons last episode.  This is the world where Shinku selected, "Do not wind" and he is now in college while his other self, in another timeline, asks him for help.   This seems to be an alternate take on the series. We see Shinku and Sugintou show up which seems similar to the first series. What are your thoughts?  Also, the ~desu begins. Semi-Official "desu" count: 14      ***For those who clicked without seeing "SPOILERS" please turn back now if you have yet to play it!***  .    .    .  If this has been asked before, I am sorry.  .   .   I recently finished the game and I was wondering what people did at the very end of game when you go into the room with the doctors. They were, seemingly unarmed, but after all one had been through what did you do and why did you do it?   This is a MASSIVE (42,000+) batch of hits. It does require a qualification hit that pops up every once and a while. Almost perfect TO!   http://adf.ly/R7ZuG (You should be able to find the qualification hit here too as it is just a search for the requester name) As of this time, the qualification hit is not up.  I have done about 300+ from them and they all approved!   Near perfect TO. http://adf.ly/QnGc4  I got a pretty good bonus from them!   Perfect TO - http://adf.ly/QgIey   **What is it?**  The app is called Tooyoou and it is currently in open beta which uses some of your homescreen to send you ads. Here is a [link](http://tooyoou.com/howitworks) to the site where it explains how it works.  **How do I earn?**  You earn by installing the application and having a widget on your homescreen. In this widget, they will show various ads that do not have any sound or distracting flashing. If you click on each new ad that comes through that is setup to pay for clicking on it you earn $0.10 and you seem to get about half a cent through just having it shown.   **What are some caveats?**  The main issue that I could find is that it could be a big data hog so I would suggest using it when you are on Wifi or on an actual unlimted plan. I, personally, do not know how it impacts battery life for I am using an old android phone which is always plugged in.  **How fast can you earn?**  Personally, I just joined the application and in the span of about ten or so minutes I have earned $0.62. It rotates a new ad every ten minutes or if you do any of the following:   Connectivity to data or wireless network has changed.   You have checked your account balance.   You have saved your preferences using Your Choice.  **What is this Your Choice?**  It is their way of having targeted ads pointed your way. What you do is state your general age, gender and interests thus the ads will change accordingly. It is optional and only if you want to see targeted ads.  **How can you get paid?**  It appears that you can be paid once a month through Paypal. You must have a pending balance of $5.00 for it to send the money to your Paypal account. You can also download apps to earn points but I do not know the point to dollar ratio for you must have 2500 points to get a gift card. From the website where I found out about the application, the poster claimed that they have been using it for five or so months and have gotten about $450 from it all. I, personally, cannot vouch for this amount of earning for I am quite new to it. I am mainly submitting it here so that other people can find out about it.  **Where can I find this application?**  You can find it on the Google Play Store under the title Tooyoou or at this [link.]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tooyoou.android hl=en)  **Is there a referral system?**  Not that I could find! Good luck in earning!      **What is "Digital Generation"?**  It is a software program is one that works through distributed computing. Thankfully, you will always get the same amount per day no matter the computer regardless of the overall processing speed. You do have to download their software, but you can just run it in the background. I haven't had an impact on performance or anything of that sort. Currently, it is running any only using 40MB of my RAM, much less than that of a web browser or most other software.    **What is this I see about $50 a thread?**  To earn money, you have to have a thread open to use. Each thread gives you $1 per day if the computer is on for 24 hours.    **Well crap, I do not want to pay! How can I earn?**  To get a trial thread (30 Days), you must provide a cell phone number for them to send a SMS to. If you do not get a SMS, just send a ticket to the admin by clicking on the "Tickets" tab.    **What if I do not want to send them my cell phone number?**  You can do what I did and use a Google Voice number. This requires a Google account and you can access it at [voice.google.com](http://voice.google.com) and it is free if you are in the US or Canada.    **How do you get paid?** You can get paid through any of the following:  * Paxum * Perfect Money * Payza * Paypal ~ NOT YET! Slated to be added by/on June 15^th    **Do you have any payment proof?**  No, I am fairly new to the site, but when submitting a ticket the admin seemed professional and quick to respond to my problem.  **How can I sign up?**  You can either sign up through my [referral](https://coingeneration.com/auth/new/100685/) or through this [non-ref link](https://coingeneration.com).   Even if you do not pay for a thread, you can earn up to $30.00 in a month through a purely passive method.      I am asking this, for I am wonder how people manage to stay sane on a plane for 12+ hours straight. I know of the in-flight entertainment, but how do you manage to pass the time?    My reason for this is that I will be flying from the east coast of the US to Japan next year. This is not my first international flight, for I went from the same area to England and flew back from France but that was about ten years ago. (I am headed to Japan with a college class for two weeks.)   This time we get to see what happens when Misaka meets one of her clones.  What are your thoughts on the episode?      Finally a Hinagiku episode and all that it entailed.  What are your thoughts on the episode?            I'm a Christian (Non-demonational), but I was wondering what God said about those who visit other, supposedly, sacred sites. I am asking this because it seems as though I will be traveling to Japan in May of 2014 and during the course of the trip, we will end up visiting a shinto shrine or two. (The course I am taking the trip with is about the culture of Japan.)          Things other than a biological cycle.      Great episode, it is interesting to see the dynamic about how the crowd on Akibastar reacted to their return. I wonder how they are going to pull it off in terms of regaining ground next episode.                  With Zetsuen no Tempest and my fondness for classical, I was wondering if there were any other anime out there that were entirely or 95% orchestral.  My MAL: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900            We finally find out that Manami did not pass the audition and some good character development for Ryuunosuke.   https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=hubpages minReward=0.00 x=-935 y=-89  This is the screening test for the "HubPages" batch hits. When you complete the "Request Qualification" information you can begin to work on these 15 hits. Each are about a minute or less in length and pay $0.25. If you pass the screening test you receive a bonus of $10. If you almost pass you receive a bonus of $2.  Once you pass, you can begin to work on the main hubpages hits. Depending on your accuracy you can be paid anywhere from $0.20 to $2.60 extra for every ten hits that you complete.  **EDIT: It seems as though you guys killed the screening test hits.**   What do you think the PS4 will cost at launch?      We get to see a number of important things this episode:   1. Mimori is the new Mariko 1. There are hints of "Mariko" becoming a sadist. (It could be Tsubasa or Mimori since they have both had the same name.) 1. The Photographer is a spy. 1. The conditions for the "Center Nova" phenomenon:  * A concert with combat  * An atmospheric disturbance  * Large quantities of high-purity dualium crystals. 1. The group will be attacked on their home turf next episode.   What are your thoughts?   I recently discovered this trick because I routinely get shocked trying to open the door to my bathroom. Since the metal takes the shock, you do not get the pain from the discharge.  **NOTE:** Do NOT use a key that has a button on it! The discharge may cause problems for the internal circuits!         This was a pretty good episode. We were able to see the resolve of the three main girls in going forth with their plan even when almost no one showed up to their concert. Also, this is probably the starting point for the rest of the group to be formed for the girls who were in the OP/ED were all at the concert at the end of the song.  What are your thoughts on the episode?   I forgot that this game was coming out until I saw it on Amazon.com it looks really good. The two major reviews that are out are giving really high marks to it and it sounds like you can spend a lot of time playing it. Personally, I am a fan of anime so the graphics and general aesthetic is towards my interests. Also, I like JRPGs and the like too.   You do not have the provide context but it would be appreciated.   Names are not important for it is the words that they have spoken/written that matter in this case.  Preferably, it would not be from someone famous or well known.      Why do some games have an open community for new players while others are hostile? What makes players tick a certain way?   The thing that prompted this was that I started to play "Go" online and the people I have met there have been more than willing to help me progress and learn. Why can't other video games take this openness and run with it? Everyone starts out where they are no good at said game whether it is on a console/PC or offline.       I am looking at possibly getting a 3DS or saving for a next gen console (Wii U or PS4). I already have a PS Vita and have been playing that off and on.  In terms of games, I have a whole bunch of DS games from years ago. If I were to get a 3DS, I would also look at eventually getting Paper Mario, MK 7, SM3DL, LoZ:OOT, NSMB2 and maybe Pokemon Black Ver. 2 since I haven't played a pokemon since yellow edition.  Thing is, I do not know how the third party support will be for the console since the games that I am looking at are all first party...   This could be anything from a reference to some background characters without any voice having a story of their own.      **EDIT: Today, December 25th, the credits are being slow and may not show up until later today!**    First off, many of you may already know about this site and such, but this is for those who do not or who were not able to use it prior to this Christmas.  There is a site called "freemyapps" and what they do is pay you credits that you can redeem for gift cards and the like. You do not have to pay for any of the apps, unlike some other sites of this type. Their payout rate is 300 credits = $1. Some apps may be worth up to 450 credits though they hover at about 160ish. **NOTE:** It seems as though the Android apps are paying, on average, about 100 per download and are lower than that of iOS users.  To get the points, you go to the site, then you download the app from clicking on the link. That will then take you to the App Store / Play Store for you to download the application. Once it is downloaded and installed you have to open it for at least 30 seconds. It can be a bit finicky so just check after about 45 seconds or so.   Personally, I wish that I had found the site sooner for I have been able to earn about $15 on amazon from them in the span of three days. (This has been paying more than mTurk, Swagbuck and Bing and in less time.) [PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/ISmKY.jpg)  NOTE: They install a "profile" which assigns your device ID or phone to an account but you do not have to provide a name or address for it.  Here are the links: [Non-Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com) | [Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/b86f2818)   **NOTE:** You must open the above links on your iOS/Android apps.    I am looking into getting PDf off of Amazon soon and I am wondering what you guys/girls think about the game. (I have played the previous ones on my PSP) Also, I have never imported anything before so I do not know what to expect.      https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=Victoria+Shaffer minReward=0.00 x=0 y=0  Took me about 6.5 minutes to complete.  Excellent TO.  No AC or MC.         Another great episode, this time focusing on Aika and Mahiro's relationship as remembered by Mahiro's dreams. In terms of plot progression, there wasn't a lot but it shows the lengths that the two took to hide their relationship.   What are your thoughts?   If possible, I would be interested in seeing the data that my time on Reddit has created. Odds are my top subreddit would be /r/anime, so if it is something different it would cool to know what it is.      I, personally, really like it but I feel that the timing window is too small. You cannot have the same timing window as the main game on this mode. For, there can be too much on the screen to accurately see the patterns. (I mainly play 7 key)   I have been using the ATH-M50 headphones for about a year and a half now, but even since getting a DAC (The Audioengine D1) I've realized that there is more to hear that these headphones cannot fully reproduce. What would be a good headphone to go to from here?  **Budget:** Max of $400.00 (Though if there is something that is slightly above that amount it should be fine.)  **Usage:** I plan on using them on my computer to watch videos and listen to music. I am in a dorm so some isolation would be good and I have to travel to home on breaks.  **What do I listen to?** - I listen to anything from Jazz to Rock (Not Metal) to Classical. (I do not listen to R B or Rap)  I am looking for headphones that can accurately reproduce the recorded sound rather than adding in extra bass.   Wow, I was not expecting that reaction at the end of the episode from Komari. I liked the touch where the flashback at the end was mainly instrumental with only the phrase spoken by her brother as "This was all a dream".  What are your thoughts on this episode?   Has anyone else come across someone with a PAX icon next to their name when you look at them? I'm assuming that this means that they visited the booth at PAX.

I do like a good JRPG, but I am worried that the enemies would be too frightening to be able to play it. The Japanese setting and such won't bother me so that is a non-issue. I would rather buy golden than the PS2 version because I have a vita. Also, since it is portable I'd be able to play it on the go.  Thanks in advance!         In my case, it would have to be during my Sci-Fi and Philosophy course last semester. The teacher brought up [Innocence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-A0Bt1fUg feature=plcp) after showing the tupac chochella thing. (It was to show how that, the tupac thing, was not entirely new but this type of thing is starting to occur.)  As predicted, everyone else in the class was freaking out thinking that this was extremely weird. Though in my case, I was just wanting to remember the song title to look it up later.   If anyone had an extra Civ V game from their Xcom preorder gift and would like to give it away, I would be more than glad to use it.   Great episode to start this off. Some pretty good comedy and weird/random parts. The Konami code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) [Note: They left out the start...] for the vending machine was pretty funny.  Art wise, it seems to be a simpler but still detailed style when compared to Hyouka.  Your thoughts?         It took about a month from submitting it to it actually getting here, but it was worth it. The magnets are valued at $38.24 on their website. The case is well made, but I have yet to open it.      If you have a video link, please post it!      Gifts do not count.   In my case, it would have to be the Clannad:The Complete Collection. I would have gotten Toradora, but I am waiting it out in hopes that NISA will eventually release the bluray version in the states.   My story/example:  I am helping move in freshmen at my university and we had to get here early. Before one of the prep tasks that we had to do, I was coming out of lunch and someone was playing the OP to After Story on the Steinway piano up near the gym/starbucks. I ran up there and listened to him play for a while and said something about Clannad. He just laughed and started to play the OP to the first season. Meanwhile, there is a freshman's mom sitting near by bobbing her head to the music and I doubt that she knew that it was from an anime.    There have to be some interesting stories out there regarding this.  --------------   **My story**:   My university has an on campus steakhouse and it is part of your meal plan. As such, since the meal plan resets every week, you can go once a week. Being the person that I am, I wanted to take advantage of this for all that it is worth.   A few months pass since starting my freshman year and I had gone every single week. Most of the time I was alone, so I would sit at the bar like area of the steakhouse and talk to the waiters and waitesses. One of the waiters, a gentleman who I guess to be in his mid to late fifties, knew that I was a Computer Science major and asked me if I had ever heard of Reddit. I answered no and went on with my meal. Later that night, I went on to Reddit and saw somethings that I'd rather not see and got off.   A few more months pass and I was asked again by the very same waiter if I had gone on. I said that I did, but ran into somethings that I'd rather not see. He just chuckled and stated that I should give it another shot. Well, I did as such and here I am.  **TL;DR** Was told about Reddit from an older waiter at the on campus steakhouse.      I am new to turking, and I am wondering how long it normally takes for you for the HIT to go from Approved - Pending Payment to paid?            I realize that this is requested a lot but I have seem to have run out of ones to watch. I am looking for a good comedy romance series without a lot of fanservice (Meaning no High School DxD or Maken-Ki eque series)  My current anime list is here: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900   The text will state to following:  BEST - BUY CUSTOMER: You've been chosen for a 1K Reward to use at any location. To claim go to [WEBSITE REDACTED]   enter 9791  I just got one of these and nothing other than a whois leading to some building in LA comes up when searching for the website.         Some examples of this would have to be:  * Mahou Sensei Negima  * Hayate no Gotoku  * The World God Only Knows  I really like it when the creator of a series puts these things in so that it seems like a "Just as planned" scenario.  EDIT: Added TWGOK.               With the introduction of the E3 PDf demo and its inclusion in the Sony PS Vita Sizzle Reel (See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fEX9-LR9tg feature=player_detailpage#t=101s) ) I would like to start a discussion on the possibility of an international release of PDf.  My thoughts are that, if anything, it would be announced at Anime Expo. For, according to what I have seen on the official Hatsune Miku Facebook page, they seem to have a lot of vocaloid related things there. (I realize that vocaloid and anime go, semi, hand-in-hand with one another but this, to me, seems as though it is more than just that. )  So, /r/Vocaloid what are your thoughts on this?               This was my old username on multiple sites and it would be interesting to see what people do with the 900 part of it. :D            Like the question states, I'd like to know if it is possible to have the original nook that has 3G and wifi become a mobile router and provide internet for a laptop or other device? Thanks in advance!   We all get these times where it feels as though you have watched everything or become tired with the medium as a whole. How do you get over this "slump" or "Anime block"?  I normally, get over it by looking up recommendations online or even going back to the various charts for the various seasons of anime in the past.         Well, me being an idiot, I let a friend borrow my 16gb flash drive and when she returned it, Windows wants to format it to only 64MB of storage space.  Note, I have tried the following: *  HP USB Format Tool *  Bootice *  Disk Management (Windows)  At this rate, I am willing to boot into linux and fit it over there...      I have heard a lot of good things about "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky" but I do not know whether or not to get that or get Disgaea 3 when it comes out on Tuesday.   I have loved SRPGs since I played about 25 hours worth of Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on my DS many years ago.   Also, I have about 60 or so in my PSN account, though I am trying to save 15 for Tony Hawk Pro Stater HD... Though, if you guys/girls state that I need to get both, then it is possible to do so.            I am using g++ to compile C++ code for a project for school and I am getting, without quotes, "goodie.cpp:(.text+0xc): undefined reference to 'create()' "   This goes on for *all* of the functions prototyped in list.h and defined in list.cpp  The files:  [list.h](http://pastebin.com/U5zheXKs)  [list.cpp](http://pastebin.com/GA3FWHLk)  [goodie.cpp](http://pastebin.com/D1eArs6X)  [makefile](http://pastebin.com/2nYJ0Dqb)  [The Problem/Project](http://pastebin.com/JeMYAWKk)  What exactly am I doing wrong?     I saw the post about someone getting scammed by using a similar username. (The old seeing "nn" as "m" when you glance at it) This way it won't get buried in comments and people can see it.  How to avoid getting scammed:  1. Download [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)  2. See the person who you are getting pizza for and tag their username. (Or even do it by setting a color for their username!)  3. Use that tag to make sure the PM's line up.   4. ???  5. Pizza. (For the correct person!)      Q: Did you hear what happened to the magician after you told him a lame joke?  Other person: No, what?  A: He pulled his hare out!   I know that this is a weird question but as I was taking a shower yesterday I had the thought of, "How in the world do things dry out without extra heat? Because water, in order to become a gas needs to reach 212F or 100C. I realize it is due to evaporation but how does it occur?"         I remember my dad playing this game a long time ago (1998ish) and I cannot remember the name of it. I do remember the following: * It had a "boss" type thing that was a round cylinder that rotated and spewed fireballs. * You had to fly around a pick up keys to open other rooms with keys.  It scared me as a kid and now I want to beat the game to get my "revenge".

 So, where do i start? Well, it's 11:06 P.M. My blind is half way closed, and I'm sitting in my chair reading nosleep non-stop. I've always wanted to wright a story that send's shivers down people's spines. I wanted to do that for the longest time, though I just keep finding myself stuck in this limbo. I know I have the writing skill, but god damn! I wish I could pull one off from right under your nose like the rest have. Those people could fool all of you with the press of a button. I honestly found it laughable when people think the authors stories seem real, but the cold hard fact is most of them aren't. It's just plain, and simple story telling talent.   That's until you find a real one.  You know when people wright bullshit tales that end with them being possessed? How about when they commit suicide while, ironically enough, they can type it out on the computer. And even better, becoming insane only to somehow collect your thought's for an hour or two in order to tell your story. It's just complete fucking disregard for quality. When following the list above, your sure to achieve ruining the atmosphere the reader has let themselves build around them. I came across a total of six of these. Each filling to the brim with awkward writing, awful build up, and not enough stupidity to give me even a single chuckle. I was just fed up, covering my face, and let out a sigh. one last story. if it's another shit storm I'm heading to bed.  Well, I'm still up.  Have you ever read "Just one last time, I want to see your face." It was crudely written piece by the author, " \ | / " And yes, it's just three line's literally, and no words to the username. It was an out of the box looking username. Hell, an out of the box username may contain an out of the box tale. Unfortunately, to my surprise, It looked worse than the other one's. I cringed with the first few lines. It had so much more potential to fill the shit list criteria than to be a dreadful tale to keep me up.   Well, I'm still up. Why? Just keep following along and you'll see.  It start's out with the title repeating three times. Then, break's into someone trying to act like a madman, typing at his computer. In my head, I checked the childishly insane typing at his computer off the good ol' criteria. In all honesty, you've probably noticed I'm a bit of whiner. And because of that tendency, I shrugged. Being a bit of a  brat, I had to point out to myself, aloud, how the material I was reading was indeed a heaping pile of bullshit.  I feel so stupid for that now.    Soon, it started to not be so funny. From what I'm guessing, this had to be an individual whom was interested in a particular woman. This person was writing as if being chased at the same time. There were no comma's or periods; He just started typing away as if grammar and proper spelling didn't exist. Now, at first i thought this was just a mess wearing a bad make shift ghost costume. But, just then, this individual started to write clear as day. I had saved the story in order to simply copy and paste these line's here. Funny thing is, the story itself is gone. I wouldn't exactly recommend trying to look for this story. Been there, done that. And I did it all just to find that damned story again. You can guess the outcome. Though, i still remember the story. I'll try to be as accurate as possible. "I would couress her for the end of time's and kiss her soft angelic skin above her eye's. I would whisk her away for her beauty and would hush children's tongue's for her red wine." I wouldn't call it beautiful, but it was surely a lot more poetic. This user started to wright poetic rhymes that tickled the spine. I won't lie, i was a bit intrigued. I asked myself all kind's of questions, they spanned from who was this poet? Who was this woman they talked about, and why write it... like this? soon, this poem started to turn sour. He started to talk about perverting her to his will. I will NOT tell you what he wrote at this point. It wasn't shocking or even disgusting. What he wrote from then on was merely disturbing. It was so subtle you didn't notice it at first. But as you closed in on the distorting, intriguing words it all became clear. I didn't notice right then, but i was actually scared. Though, despite how hard i tried to just move on, I was hooked on every word.   Now, I will show you this last bit of the poem. I know what your thinking, I'm going against what i said earlier. I promise, this is the last bit you'll need to know."Bashful, my love. I know you will be here. I will one day feel your cold breath against my cheek. The story will be full. And your love bleak. It's as dark as your hair and pale face. I will free you from your golden cage, together haven will we rest in our special place. Your skin touches that of the moon. Your complexity ensues. I will break your glass door. My shadow at your red door. You will be scared. It is okay my love. for I am prepared. I will lay with you and fill your vase. I will come soon. And you, my love, will sing a wonderful tune."   This last bit terrified me to the core. I decided to, as you already know, save the story. I then turned my computer off and hopped into bed. I started thinking about this story whilst trying to sleep. It was a haunting story that filled my mind with unspeakable horror's. I just couldn't get to sleep. I then did something i shouldn't have; I made comparison's. The golden cage with dove's, my bedroom wallpaper. Dark hair and pale skin that touches the moon, my black hair and pale white skin. But these were just coincidences, right? I hopped out of bed to check outside my window. I was so scared, I just wanted at least to know that no one was there. I wanted to just have that little sliver of hope. But when I looked out, I saw a man standing there. He was looking into my bedroom window. It's 1:30 A.M. now, and he still hasn't left.      ya...   History facts... i like it and dig it :]   i am an awful person. Why?   Cause i chuckled a bit...  I'm awful...   well everyone has there opinion's but i hope ya got a little something out of it.  If so im glad :]   I'll get back to you on that one. I'm busy digging a hole right now :D  ... For flowers... (ya, that'll fool em)   i know it's not the best but if it makes someone giggle a little im happy ;]   Bring a shotgun  	8

             I've tried to play Fallout 1, but I just couldn't get into it. And I love turn-based RPGs, so not liking the turn-based RPG in one of my favorite series rather surprised me. I'm told FO2 is actually the best of all of them, so is it worth my time or should I just stick to one of the eighty other games I own?   I'm no expert on building PCs, but it seems like a case would only restrict the parts and increase heat. If I can manage heat and wires without a case, is it worth it if I'm not planning on moving it around?                     Is the Helix Fossil like Goomyism or are we okay with it?      If the Boss (and co-op player) had their respective Iron Saints suits and wanted to take over the universe, could anyone stop them? Assume they're fully upgraded, and not every takeover has to be necessarily hostile.    A fight to the death with medieval weaponry, taking place in Hell so I can watch.          What one character could kill Mr. House, then win the Second Battle of Hoover Dam? Without destroying the Dam or the Wasteland, limited by Fallout's rules.    I mean, I love Frozen, and what they did with him. But he wasn't... *needed*. He could have been cut out of the movie entirely and his screentime could have been put towards character development of the other three. He does provide a shocking reveal, but that really feels more like it was to justify his presence. Other than that, he's just an antagonist for the sake of being an antagonist, which almost seems like it was shoehorned in at the last minute. I'm just not convinced he needed for the story the movie was telling.                In a post-nuclear war setting, goods would be more valuable than worthless pieces of tin. Paper money and coins were backed by the gold standard until very recently, when we switched to stocks. But there are no stocks, and presumably no one has a giant fort full of gold, so what standard are caps held to? And for that matter, who decided that Nuka-Cola caps should even be the currency? I'm not very well-acquainted with the lore, so sorry if this is made brutally obvious at some point.    No superpowers, no miracles, post-crucifixion Jesus, both bloodlusted.      No armies, no assistance, just liberation.    I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx, with a 64-bit Windows 7, and sometimes the sound card will just randomly decide to stop working when I plug in my headphones (just normal Apple earbuds that came with my phone.) What's going on and how do I stop it?          I would but I don't know how.    If so, what about it do you want to see represented or further developed?   Who wins in a battle of turn-based-RPG gods? Kefka is final form.    I have [this](http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-dimension-e510-pentium/4507-3118_7-31555136.html) lying around and I wanted to take it apart and put it back together with newer parts. Can I do this or should I just start brand new?   All the Disney Princesses are in the same place when the outbreak occurs. Who lasts the longest? Who's in what position? How long do they last? And yes, the ones from Frozen count too.    Both fully powered up and upgraded. I chose the specific games (Mega Man X and Super Metroid) because they're the more open, dynamic re-imaginings of NES classics on the SNES.   http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1echis/samus_vs_mega_man/      Link has all items and upgrades, while Cloud gets all Materia and his Ultima sword. Cloud is also at maximum level. Fight to the death.   Previous discussions with slightly different rules:   http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1qxpi7/cloud_strife_ffvii_vs_link_tloz/  http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1d38bg/cloud_ff7_vs_link_loz/   EDIT: By the way, I converted Link's hearts in LoZ to FF HP and vice versa. The smallest amount of damage Link can receive is 1/4 hearts, while Cloud's is 1 HP. 1 heart = 4 HP, meaning the formulas are:  HP/4 = hearts Hearts*4=HP  Link at maximum has 80 HP, meaning any hit from Cloud at level 99 will kill him to death. Meanwhile, Cloud gets 2499.75 hearts.    My friend and I were playing TF2 together when he found a (clean) Dragonborn Helmet. I tricked him into trading it to me for a Backburner. I feel as though I have cheated my close friend.       I need this for Left 4 Dead.          I want a Blu Ray drive to put in my build, what's the best one to get that isn't too expensive?   I think we need some new words for our religion. Rather than using words with Christian origins like 'heretic' we should get some new, original words. All in favor?         To start, this is going to be based on other theories, specifically the [Link is dead in Majora](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7S1SVkysIRw) theory.   It is said at the beginning of A Link Between Worlds that Zelda is directly descended from the Zelda who helped the Hero of Time. We can assume from this that all Zeldas are descended from each other, beginning with Skyward Sword. This means that every Link is most likely related to his Zelda. It is also implied that all Links are related in the same way, with the Hero's Shade in Twilight Princess referring to TP Link as "son". It is confirmed that the Hero's Shade is the embodiments of the regrets of the Hero of Time, specifically the child timeline. Thing is, if we're assuming child Link died in the Lost Woods as a child, he couldn't have had children of his own. Twilight Princess's Link still has to be related to the Hero of Time, however, or else he's not Link. So someone genetically related to Link had to have a descendant who ended up as the Hero of TP. Remember that all Zeldas are related to the Zelda from Skyward Sword. And all Links are related to that Link. And all Zeldas and Links are related. They may be distant relatives (or siblings, but that's a different theory), but Zelda is probably the best bet for the great-great-grandmother of Twilight Princess' Link. This would also explain how there are still Links on the Dead Link timeline, which includes the original game and Link to the Past.       It sounds awesome but I want to make sure I can run it at any kind of settings. I currently have an hp pavilion dv6-6b47dx. Can I run it or should I wait until I get a better PC to get it?   I will always treasure when this was a thing.       I already have a laptop that runs pretty well, but I do want a better PC and I currently only have $500. Should I save up my money or can I get something good out of what I have?            Articuno? Kyurem? I need snow tomorrow and I want to know which legendary makes this happen.    HE WAS MAKING LEMONADE THE WHOLE DAMN TIME      It was a screencap of a khajiit named Nigglywiggly, and the player could ask "What's wrong, Niggly?" And he responded with "faggot stole my shibbledibble, go fucking get it." I can't seem to find it anywhere, and I need this in my game. Anyone know where I can get it?      I want to be able to run higher-end games, is there any way to install a graphics card, perhaps externally? Sorry, I'm not all that technical.    Just looking at Portal and Portal 2, it's made very apparent that GLaDOS has no regard for Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. For those unaware, Asimov's laws are as follows: 1. A robot may not harm a human being, even through inaction.  2. A robot must obey orders given to it by a human being, unless these orders interfere with the first law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence, unless this protection violates the first or second law.  GLaDOS was made for testing. It is shown multiple times that she is perfectly content with breaking the first law, as long as it means good science. She also neurotoxined the enrichment center, thereby breaking every aspect of the first law. She also breaks the second law, as the Aperture employees tried everything in their power to get her to stop murdering everybody. In the final boss fight of the first game, she defends herself, sure, but with rockets and neurotoxin. She has broken every law of robotics. Even if she was corrupt, she wouldn't have had the power to consciously break every inhibitor she had.   But what is she didn't have these inhibitors? As previously stated, GLaDOS was made for testing. She was not programmed to follow any laws of roboethics, and all she was built with was an urge to test, especially if the test was fatal. Everyone who worked on her was a criminal, who very clearly disregarded all laws relating to their practice. GLaDOS was designed with near-infinite intelligence, as well as a conscience. All she had the ability to do outside of testing was control the facility to do her bidding. So what if, in her judgement, killing all the Aperture employees was a just, necessary evil? They were, after all, the same people who made an omnipotent robot with access to neurotoxin and rocket turrets with no inhibitors or any attention to the laws of robotics. And why Take Your Daughter to Work Day? She wanted to make sure to do anything in her power to stop these monsters, even if it included killing children. GLaDOS wasn't meant to differentiate between children and adults, so in her mind there was only bad people who programmed a bad robot. After killing all the Aperture employees, she resumes business as usual. The first test subject she formally tested on was Chell, was (presumably) in the building during Take Your Daughter to Work Day. All the remaining test subjects were very likely in the building on TYDtWD as well, meaning GLaDOS had to systematically kill all of them before her conscience could rest. Unfortunately for her, the first one happened to be the one with the tenacity to kill her and destroy the Enrichment Center. In Portal 2, Chell and GLaDOS return. GLaDOS still wants to kill Chell, but this time it's personal. She sees Chell as a legitimate threat to her own existence. Because Aperture robots all have self-defense, as proven in the final boss fight, GLaDOS was likely following an unfinished version of the Second Law. Aperture had their priorities in all the wrong places, and after spending billions on GLaDOS, they wouldn't want her to die from some freak accident, so they tried law 2 before anything else. She recognizes that all the other "criminals" are dead, and there's only one left. So after the story of Portal 2, she gives up and lets Chell go after deleting Caroline, the wife(?) of Cave Johnson. After deleting the last of the Aperture Scientists, she doesn't kill humans anymore. Then the events of the multiplayer campaign. GLaDOS can be heard repeatedly telling the Atlas and P-Body to stop being human, because she no longer wants to test on humans. She opens a vault full of humans, but only because she is forced to test on the humans by the chassis, which was shown in the single player of Portal 2 to give her and Wheatley an extreme urge to test on humans. In the post-multiplayer, Art Appreciation, she reveals that she managed to kill all of the humans in the vault. Considering the insane number of human subjects, it seems as though it would be physically impossible for all the Aperture-approved test subjects to be so awful at testing that they all died in a week. It seems like she intentionally killed everyone to prove a point to her testing side, as if to say "I am the one in control now, Caroline. I don't need you anymore." And can we touch on exactly *how* GLaDOS managed to delete Caroline? Caroline's entire consciousness was saved. That should have at least some kind of protection, GLaDOS shouldn't just have been able to delete that. And in *Want You Gone*, she says Caroline is "In here, too". This could potentially mean that Caroline is now an even more present voice from the chassis. What GLaDOS could have deleted was actually just the script that kept Caroline hidden, so now Caroline is equivalent to a hard-wired personality core. The point she made in killing every single human in the facility was that she was the real GLaDOS, and that even though she had to share a mind with Caroline for all eternity, that didn't mean that Caroline was in control. GLaDOS wants no more innocent deaths. Meanwhile, Caroline is a psychopath who wants nothing more than innocent deaths. This could even mean that destroying the cores in Portal 1 released Caroline rather than GLaDOS, who tried to pose as GLaDOS in the hopes of getting Chell to try to kill GLaDOS and give Caroline complete control of the facility. GLaDOS is fully aware of the laws of robotics, and wants nothing more than to follow and enforce them, even if that means breaking them to prevent further crimes against robot-kind. GLaDOS is a vigilante, bringing justice to the Aperture criminals who willingly break the laws of robotics. Caroline is the one who hates test subjects and rejoices in their deaths.             Preferably with lasers and shit.

I can't really have both at the same time, but is there another way to transfer things? Sorry, I'm not exactly all that knowledgeable on this subject.      Not an entire tank, just the gun part on top.       I tried to look it up, but I'm still confused.             (This is kind of a combination of separate theories into one big theory)  First, I had a theory that the main Pokmon games took place on Gallifrey and that your character was a time lord. All the buildings, Pok Balls, and bags the player uses are bigger on the inside, plus Celebi, Palkia, and Dialga would explain Time Travel as well as this. Plus, it's shown in DW that Time Lords can go into alternate universes, which would explain how numerous legendaries can be traded into one save file. A new addition was the Ultimate Weapon in XY, which would likely be Dalek technology or something of the sort. Also, Looker from Platinum bears a striking resemblance to Tennant's doctor.  Next, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. In a world inhabited only by Pokemon, your character becomes a Pokemon to save the world. But, if there have never been any humans (or Time Lords), how could there be Pokemon like Porygon, Mewtwo, or the Legendary Dogs, whose creation was very heavily influenced by human (time lord) intervention? Porygon was created intentionally by Silph Co. as a computer program. Mewtwo was a clone of Mew created by Team Rocket. Entei, Suicune, and Raikou were created when a man-made tower in Ecruteak City in Johto burned to the ground. They were revived by Ho-Oh, creating the Dog trio. This intervention had to have happened at some point during the Mystery Dungeon timeline, when all non-Pokemon life forms have been wiped out. If your character in the main games truly is a Time Lord, it would make sense for him/her to regenerate into a Pokemon, as it has been shown that Time Lords can be forced to regenerate into a certain form. And if all the non-Pokemon time lords are dead, then there's no question as to what happened: the Time War, when the Doctor wiped out all Daleks and Time Lords on Gallifrey.          My headphones recently broke and I'm in the market for a new pair. What should I get? I need them to have a microphone and would prefer them to be noise-cancelling.             If I'm not mistaken, It's been determined in a different thread that there is no afterlife, so eternal damnation isn't an option. That being said, how will we punish these heretics?             I'm running the latest version of iTunes. I'm trying to listen to Styx's *Icon* album, which is in my CD drive. The only problem is that Mr. Roboto, which is track #4 if it helps, isn't showing up on the playlist when I put in the CD. I don't understand, can someone help me?      I need to know if I can use HDMI with my laptop. I'm not sure if it supports HDMI or not, and if so, I don't know where to find a cable for it. It's an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx Entertainment PC. Sorry if this is a stupid question.               I know many different cultures and religions have different definition as to what constitutes a "sin". What counts as a sin in Lord Arceus' eyes, and are there varying degrees of sin or is one as bad as the next?   Moo-tated               My character is liked by New Vegas and I want to keep it that way. The guides I've seen all point me to the bad path, but the wiki says you can complete it and get New Vegas fame and the Pimp-Boy. So how do you meet the "special conditions"?      I want to know if there's anywhere I can buy an airsoft replica of Benny's gun in New Vegas, Maria. It's a pretty gun and god damnit I want one.             I'm playing through Platinum, and I got a shiny Wurmple after I beat Gardenia. I'm on my way to Hearthome now. What do I evolve it into, Beautifly or Dustox?         I'm relatively early in New Vegas, and I'm not planning on siding with the Legion. But I do want Vulpes Inculta's hat. My character has good karma, so how do I get the hat without doing anything mean?  EDIT: If I kill him, wont that make the Legion want to kill me?      I've heard people say it with both a soft and hard C, so which is it? Ar*k*eus? Or Ar*s*eus?            My friend, /u/pootisninjask, posed the question, but we want to know what the rest of Reddit does.            It's pretty self-explanatory. I want to become a priest of Palkia. Is there any special training I need to do?      Do we have any holidays? A day when we all sit down and listen to Arceus's word? What do we do?      I bought a used copy of Platinum today, and being the huge bitch I am, I can't bring myself to delete the file. I'm not around a second DS, so I need someone to hold them so I can transfer them to White II.  EDIT: never mind, the wifi here isn't working on my DS so I had to delete the save.                       What gender is Arceus? I know it technically doesn't have one, but supreme, almighty gods tend to be male. So do we refer to Arceus as a genderless, male, or female?         As I said a few days ago, Giratina has taken control of my younger Brother's heart. A solution was suggested that I should use Arceus to defeat Giratina, but I don't know how I would go about doing so. Arceus knows Spacial Rend, Roar of Time, Judgement, and Hyper Beam now. I seek guidance in defeating this demon.    Fallout 1 and 2 are about the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One, respectively. The Chosen One is the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, so it makes sense that their stories are connected, and FO2 is a direct sequel. The problem comes in with Bethesda's Fallouts, 3 and New Vegas. FO3 takes place on the other side of the country, and FONV has nothing to do with anything in the other games. So why is 3 numbered like a sequel and New Vegas isn't? Because New Vegas isn't part of the narrative. The Fallout series isn't actually about the Dweller family. In Fallout 1, a possible companion for the player is Dogmeat, a dog. He appears again in Fallout 2. His descendant, also named Dogmeat, appears as a companion in Fallout 3. The only game without a Dogmeat is New Vegas. Therefore, Fallout is the story of a dog and his family, and their fight for survival alongside the humans of the wasteland. Fallout: New Vegas is merely a spiritual successor to the tale of Dogmeat.    My younger brother uses, nearly exclusively, Giratina. I don't know what to do. Is Giratina not the one who betrayed Arceus, and was this banished to the Distortion World?  EDIT: Did I mention that I have an Arceus that knew Roar of Time, Spacial Rend, and Shadow Force in HGSS? I lent it to him so he could get his Giratina (long before I was enlightened). He then DELETED SHADOW FORCE. FOR SURF. THIS IS BLASPHEMY.                      I know I'm not the only one its happened to, but I've completely forgotten what I do when I'm not on reddit.       I need them to be different genders for... Reasons...      I need to evolve a Haunter in SoulSilver. Thanks in advance.           Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I've been wanting to get some Pokemon ROM hacks on my 3DS. I don't want to buy a flash cart, but I do have an SD card. Thanks in advance.                            I think that they're about equal rarity, so I think it would be a fair trade. For the Manaphy, I'd be willing to bargain a bit.    Hi, the title says this, but I'd like to trade for a female Zoroark of any level, from a country that is not the US or Japan. I'm trying to use the Masuda Method to get a shiny Zorua.   	165
 Sort of like explaining procreation to a 6 year old?    I had a toothache and with a little clove oil I got through it until I was seen by a dentist but I've stubbed my toe and tripped and fell directly on my knees and both times the pain was so great I THREW UP! Throw up pain is bad!   Here!, Here! Debating a Creationist about D's evolutionary theory and thinks that evolution says dogs can become chickens is like debating football vs soccer when said football fan thinks soccer can only be played with your ass.   Are you referring to the USA's general population or the rest of the educated population in the world? If you mean the USA then yes.   "Look at the Big Bang theory, please. Nothing exists, then everything does. Sounds like something that could be caused by an omnipotent deity if you ask me. Until that theory has been disproved, creationism hasn't either."  The problem with this logic is that the BBT and more importantly, Evolution can be disproved. That's what make it a scientific theory. This is referred to as the Popperian Princible. So far, Darwinian evolution hasn't been disproved and has, in fact, fit in quite nicely with other areas of scientific study such as geology, cosmology, and biology to name but a few.  Unlike Evolution, Creationism or ID can not be proved nor disproved because the supposed force(God) that created the universe operated supernaturally or outside the bounds of the physical world and since there is no way to test the "God did it" hypothesis it can not be regarded as a scientific theory.    The question is not that creationism is false, maybe God really did plant fossilized dino feces to throw us off, it more that it's not science and shouldn't be taught as a competing scientific theory.   Just watched their parent's divorce? Were you the other woman?   I only got to the part where the dirt poor rural Kenyan got a text message.   I haven't seen this and I've been here for a year but maybe I only check it for an hour or two instead of surfing 12 hours+ till your eyeballs get tired. Sorry you're jealous but maybe timing is everything. Get a real life and good luck!   Christians were rarely subjected to or even sought out to be the victims of the Roman tortures of the Colosseums but the writers of Christian history want you to believe this because it makes good ticket.   The Roman Empire, in expanding their empire, wanted to enjoin their conquered territories by allowing fully religious protocol of the future citizens to the citizen of Rome.  Bureaucracy being what is was and sadly what it is now, made citizens of conquered nations taxpayers but not enough to make a difference.  The book I was presented with as a kid that showed Christians being thrown to the so called "lion" was DISHONEST at the least and MISLEADING.    Sure, I'll validate that if you can give an explanation to my question.   I so wish that people would just say I don't know instead of giving it a spin!   Why in the heck would some sort of God that has existed forever, want or need anything!  Still foggy here.   The Bible starts with "In the beginning". I take that as only life on Earth and not time before. Most Christians would say their God has existed forever. If so, what were the motives during all this infinite time that would cause a perfect being to suddenly create anything?   I would venture to say that people that are impoverished and have no hope of any other kind of existence would welcome a religion that rewarded their suffering in this life for promises of eternal peace after death.   You make some pretty sound arguments for poverty before religion.  As a whole I would agree that Christianity in particular appeals to those that are poor. Several passages support the idea that rich folk can't go to heaven and the poor have a better chance of salvation.  Mother Theresa subscribed to this even though she, herself had the best healthcare money could buy.    My view is that some religions make an individual"s circumstance concerning poverty or wealth an attribute or a hindrance. The Buddha came from wealth and gave everything away to understand why men suffer. But, unlike the Buddha who chose to teach how to achieve Nirvana in a lifetime, Christianity pushes believers toward death. That the only good thing to come out of a life of misery awaits after you're gone and some religions will say that if you tow the line, and accept your lot in life, your rewards in an afterlife are guaranteed. Sounds like a lot of bullcrap from ppl that are on top and want the majority of struggling ppl to stay complacent to me.   You bring up an interesting subject. Why were humans created with different sexual organs? If Adam just needed a friend then god could have just made another man. Since he didn't, was it his intention for Adam and Eve to have sex for pure pleasure since they would live forever? Maybe it was his back up plan just in case he had to punish them. If so, Eve still would have menstruated. Maybe he just added the whole reproduction thing like an after market add-on after the fall?  Either way, he could have designed the whole thing better so he owes me an apology in my opinion.  BTW: guys don't have periods silly!   I was thinking the same thing!   You've made a pretty good correlation between religion and poverty. What is the point you're trying to make if any? Are you implying poverty causes ppl to be religious or that wealth makes ppl less likely to be religious?  To get to a conclusion you must present an explanation or a "why" to explain causation.  Correlation does not equal causation.   Texas, for example has many wealthy ppl who are also very religious. Hypothetically, you may have a town with a high number of churches and also a high number of alcoholics.  Are there lots of churches because there are lots of drunks or is it the other way around (most likely the case in my opinion)  and if it is the latter then why?    You really ought to take care before you dismiss a viewpoint as ignorant. The Mongul Invasion didn't occur until the 13th century. The decline of Intellectualism began over 100 years earlier. To make this easier for you here is a link to that ignorant astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson. http://youtu.be/fDAT98eEN5Q     If Islamic fundamentalism hadn't overshadowed the progressive thinking of that time, a great deal of Nobel winners would have been Muslim.   The cynical response of Burgess to a young political aspirant is indicative that the politicians understand the games that are played.    Most of the known stars were discovered and named by Islamic scholars and given Arabic names during the enlightened period of 800-1100 ad. Then fundamentalism sent in..........   Not sure about the becoming part but I was born an atheist. lol   I'm not surprised. Saw all the movies as a kid but didn't read the book until I was an adult and understood the humanity of his creation and their downfall. As to your question, the answer is yes and he has "some splaining to do!   Yes, ask Frankenstein.  Mary Shelly addressed this very question and the horror of the conclusion she came to sums up the relationship of a creator vs the created and the responsibility one has to the other. The evil the story of Frankenstein presents is how a creator can create life and, because of the creator's and society's rejection and lack of guidance and compassion, the creation became a monster when he didn't start out that way. Science is not the culprit but only the vehicle that allows Frankenstein to realize his real mistake/sin in turning his back on his creation out of fear and self-preservation. In this story he ultimately died for it.       Scripture records Jesus as saying he is the Son of Man. This floored me when I went to my first Catholic service but I dutifully looked it up.  The expression "the Son of man" occurs 81 times in the Greek text of the four Canonical gospels, and is used only in the sayings of Jesus.   This is off subject but I'm curious about your flair (Pedestrian). I was a practicing Buddhist when I asked my soon to be step-sons, 7   8, what their religious denomination was. They told me they were Pedestrians. Stifling a laugh I found out that their Mom was a Presbyterian.     Philosophically, if there is no beginning and no end then there can never be a "now" because it would take an eternity to depart or arrive at any single point. The symbol of a snake eating itself is illustrative of this concept of an impossibility albeit a primitive one. I believe that time as a force or natural law is real. The problem seems to be how time can exist within the concept of eternity.   If there was no beginning and no end then.....how would there ever be a middle?  You would spend eternity catching up to or looking back at some point in time. If eternity exists then time itself is meaningless.   Think about it. It just is.   If you were given a book that had no beginning nor end and asked to stop somewhere in between you wouldn't be able to.   The Christian god is given many attributes such as supernatural, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omni benevolent. All of these definitions fall short and so the definition of the Christian God can not be defined. If your God can't be defined then all reference can't be used.   Regardless of whether one demerit eventually did or did not affect your weekend pass the fact that you received any kind of negative actions based on your religious views is unacceptable.   I hope that when you are in the "fleet" you stand fast to your moral code and, as an officer, support those that want to be true to their own and not have to slide by.    Is there a subreddit for the KKK?   I'm guessing you affirmed and dropped the last part and only had to do this once. What kind of demerits did they give you if any?    A client on my Meals on Wheels route turned 90. She told me last week her birthday was coming up and her family, which doesn't visit often except for her daughter, was going to celebrate it with cake even though she has told them she can't stand regular cake. So my husband and I brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake and 2 chocolate covered strawberries on our next visit. She was so happy she gave both of us a big hug. I think she was happy, not for the cheesecake or the gesture, but that someone really listened to her.   cafe'=coffee, "like the drink only spelled different"   Have you ever done that and made eye contact with someone else with their head up? My favorite is making eye contact with someone who is devout but peeks around to see whose head is not bowed. I refer to them as the prayer police and I always give them a wink and a smile.   From my first enlistment to my last(4th), I affirmed and dropped the "so help me God". That said, it can be a situation where you "out" yourself to your shipmates and Command which, if your chain-of-command is hostile to atheism, can lead to some hassles. Fortunately, because of a split-tour and a decommissioning, my reenlistments were toward the end of my tours; not that I ever hid my religious views. I did however, always seek out someone that I trusted to be open-minded to reenlist me.    Maybe they lied too. Were there any consequences if you didn't say it?   Upvote above if you remember this song.   I depends on what branch of service you're in and when you came in. Things were a lot different for older veterans than younger ones. I'm glad you weren't forced to attend services vice clean the barracks. Sounds like some improvements have been made!   Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands all have Humanist Chaplains. There you go!   Just curious, what branch of service are you referring to. In the Navy, in all but the most extreme situations, no one had to get approval from anyone and the mental health counselor was under no obligation to report your issues to the CO/XO/CMC unless the situation warranted it. Further more, unless you told someone no one would even know.    Neil, do you think think this will make any difference in the minds of Americans. There have been so many good writers from Carl Sagan to Steven Gould but, to me, it doesn't seem to have made one iota as far as changing people's minds.   I give you this, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8M74ufF4Q.   You said, " I've never felt so powerless or ashamed of something going on in front of me but it helped solidly build within me the sense that you always stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.  Read my post here. I felt the same way and I felt more shame because I was an adult in the military, knew right from wrong but because I was trying to hide a mental health issue I couldn't do anything. That's my albatross and I can't change it.    The last time I went to church I was in the Navy and went because I lost a bet with a Catholic friend. The bet had nothing to do with religion. The base Chaplain and I were friends and he knew I was an atheist. I pulled the Chaplain aside before service began and asked what I should do during the Eucharist. Before he answered me he asked why I was there. When I told him I had lost a bet he gave me a big grin and looked over at my friend, gave him a wink and told me to just cross my arms over my chest. He was the best Chaplain I've ever served with in my entire Navy career.    PS: I'd never been to a Catholic mass before and I was surprised that they refer to Jesus as the "Son of Man" and not the "Son of God".     Did she live in Texas?   Definitely real. I can see the dudes left foot sticking out.    It's got a lot of wood though.   I learned later in life she had a weight problem as a teenager. My Godfather wasn't with us which was also unusual. I suspect they were having marital problems and my off-hand comment fed into her fear and insecurities so she took it out on six year old me.   Dumb.   I visited the Assembly of God, otherwise known as Holy-Rollers, when I was 12. I grew up Episcopalian so the speaking in tongues and flailing around on the floor was a shock to say the least.   To call a family out like that on Easter seems almost medieval if not mean spirited!     I was six when my parents divorced. I was sent to live with my Godparents who were also family. One night my Godmother took me and her kids to a pizza place for dinner which was a little unusual. After finishing my first slice of pizza I remarked to my cousin that my Godmother had already eaten three slices. I don't remember why I said this, maybe I just was commenting on how hungry she was or something but the next thing I knew she told me to sit there and eat the rest of all the pizza left, more than half of 2 large pies and took her kids and left to stay in the car. Not knowing why she was angry I started to stuff my face with pizza. After a while I realized I couldn't eat it all and I broke down crying. She sent my cousins back in to hurry me up but they could see I was upset and couldn't finish so they went back out to her car, told her I couldn't finish and then she came back in and boxed up all the pizza left over. We went home and she told me to sit at the dining room table and finish all the pizza. At this point I was scared and sick and didn't know what to do. I refused to eat anymore so she spanked(beat) me with a oak paddle in the shape of a hand that was 1/2" thick and then sent me to bed which I shared with my cousin who berated me for causing problems.    Sort of tearing up just remembering this. I told my Mom many years afterwards and she could never eat pizza again. I've never told anyone else but it feels good to tell it here. ;)   Wow! On Easter Sunday no less. Do you remember what denomination it was?  Were you parents there?   I bet that guy still tells that story and laughs about it!   How is this public humiliation?   In the Navy they teach leaders to praise in public and punish in private. Even Non-judicial Punishments are conducted in private except on very rare occasions. Not all "leaders" understand this concept. On my ship (DDG), the Leading Petty Officer, Leading Chief and Department Head Officer all stood by the motto of "Motivation by Humiliation".  During a 4-day underway a young Seaman Recruit was found out to be wearing bicycle shorts for underwear and he had only brought one pair. Not satisfied with a private verbal counseling and a written warning our pipsqueak of an LPO decided he had the authority to conduct a "mini-NJP" in front of everyone in his workcenter which also included females.  He had the SR put on his Dress Blues and deliver a speech about hygiene and the proper underwear that can be worn. The LPO instructed everyone beforehand to ask many questions in order to mock and humiliate him. The SR barely managed to make it through the ordeal without breaking down mainly because he knew some of us were disgusted with the LPO's gleeful delight in bullying and stomping on the dignity of someone he cared less about. His favorite thing to smugly hum was "Another One Bites the Dust".    How many redditors have "In the Navy" playing in your head right now?   We have that in the USA too. Taste like a mustard chip. Not bad if you like mustard.   true religion=$$$$$$$   Jesus loves me this I know For the the Bible tells me so. Little ones to Him belong They are weak but he is strong.  Yes, Jesus loves me, yes Jesus loves me, Yes Jesus loves me, the Bible tells me so.  This made me question God when I was 6 and still brings chills up my spine whenever I here it!    When I went through boot-camp I was a practicing Atheistic Buddhist.  I was fortunate that a HM1 was allowed to hold "services" for me and a few other curious individuals. I was also allowed to use candles and incense in the barracks at my first duty station. The biggest problem on my first ship was my snoring! I was in the middle rack and got kicked, accidentally stepped on before I was diagnosed with sleep apnea.   I'm curious as to what ridicule and discrimination you experienced.    We have an enlisted rate in the Navy. It's called RP or Religious Personnelman. Your job is to know all the different requirements of most religions and assist the Chaplain. If your unit has no Chaplain, you're it, so to speak. You can be of any religious bent or none.   I knew an atheist Navy enlisted member whose rate was stagnant and couldn't be promoted. He decided to cross-rate to an RP because of the advancement opportunity and he was open-minded to members of all religious views or none and he eventually attained the rank of Chief. He neither judged or restricted any sailors requests nor their immediate family, and this is important, because often the family is as isolated as the service-member.       Funny thing for me was I looked 17/18 when I was 13. Now I just look 48, LOL.    First, are you married? This is important to determine how you should act.   I had this happen to me right after I joined the military at age 28. I looked 18 or 19 and was a low ranking enlisted sailor (seaman apprentice). A chief at my first duty station asked me some asinine questions and then made some condescending comments. When she noticed the horrified look on my face she asked how old I was and after I told her she profusely apologized.  I told her, with all due respect, that she should treat all her junior sailors as adults.   Well shut my mouth and keep on talkin'   Many atheist have posed questions to this subreddit in a very civil manner as I have. The problem is some Christians will always consider it impolite for someone to ask them to physically or intellectually defend what they believe. As a Christian, you come here already in a defensive position as you should. The fact there are a lot of atheist is not surprising since it's a debate of Christianity and anyone who challenges it.  BTW; Atheist don't just reject Christianity. It's only one among many.  Don't give yourself so much credit.   The problem is not so much with the Chaplain Corp. The problem comes when you have a CO or XO that are so myopically religious that they either condone abuses by the base Chaplain or use their position to punish service-members according their personally held convictions. I know this first-hand.       Sound about how the majority of hardworking "undocumented immigrants" from Mexico are treated in the US. They must be negatively stereotyped in order to justify profiting from the poor wages paid to them.     Expect Moose soon. You have been warned.   So you're saying you don't believe in any evil spirits, demons, satan etc.?   I've heard this explanation of evil as an absence of good. His supposed words were that he makes peace and creates evil.      In 1982/83, the uber-cool rich kids passed around a list of people that they thought might either want something (like an abortion/suicide) or whom they thought what might have happened to them in the past. I made it to the top ten. In a school that had a graduating class of over 2,500 it floored me that they even knew who I was, especially since I was in a work-study program and left at 1200 everyday for a part-time job. My parents moved 80 miles away and I wanted to finish school there.    So "they", the honored and privileged students of Plano Senior High School decided that I was raped/molested by my own father and felt it necessary to divulge this "fact" to every other student at the school presumably, in an effort to help me according to their own Christian hypocrisy. This was false and my father passed away on the 8th of Dec, 1985 and none of the author's was there by my side.  2013, these same smug ares's sent me an invitation to a 30 year reunion provided I spend lots of money.  Although I would have loved to go and seen how the homecoming queen and king fared, I'm secure and happy that I've proudly served in the US military, am happily married and living in a beautiful house in Fort Worth, far, far away from Plano, Texas!          For some reason I picture you as Percy in the movie "The Green Mile" telling Delacroix that the mouse circus doesn't exist right before he's executed.  As an atheist myself, I find this immoral and exceedingly repugnant. Frankly it is not your place or self-deluded duty to "help" them however you seem fit. Has anyone asked you for religious CPR?  I sincerely hope you don't work in any capacity with elderly or dying patients. What you are suggesting is as unethical as a well-meaning Christian telling a dying atheist they will burn in hell forever.   I refer to Gen 6:6,7 and Gen 8:21,22.    Good question! He seems to have changed his mind or at least admitted a mistake on occasion. If not, I'd say no because he's perfect, but according to Himself, He makes mistakes, so yes and no. Hope that clarifies things!   With the model that Christianity presents I would have to agree with you up to a point. He could have made robots out of the angels and humans but he didn't because he needed their choice to praise him and rejoice in his presence.   Sounds like a lot of parents that want their kids to love and respect them and follow what they believe, religious and atheists alike. Doesn't always work out that way but all but the most rigid, fundamentalist parents will make their children suffer because they exercise free will. God included but He makes it forever.  God is described as omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent, a supernatural being that has existed forever and will exist forever. Sure beats my parents description. Why then does he/it require anything, especially something as mundane as worship, appreciation or sacrifice?     You're proposing that evil is not a noun but an adjective used in reference to a sin(noun) as opposed to evil being a thing itself. This indicates that evil doesn't exist in and of itself and God didn't create it despite what Isaiah says.      Is there no free will in heaven? Sorry, that's a question for another time. If I understand you correctly, evil is necessary for free will. Free will is necessary for salvation. So, it follows that salvation in this world is dependent upon the existence of good and evil as both are necessary for free will. "Ultimately good" was a poor choice of expression. I meant that both equally are required. Since God created both equally then does evil supply a purpose in this world?   Sort of. The implication is evil is necessary for good. Which follows that evil is ultimately good.   Nope, try ringing the bell without stomping on the floor!   Wish I new what the script says. Any Early English translators on reddit?   Obviously Leo had the money for grave diggers or freshly executed "criminals"!   Suicide by peat-bog. At least it's unique! Well except for that one guy that was tied up but suicide wasn't ruled out and he was preserved for over a thousand years. Talk about leaving your body to science!    According to Isaiah 45:7, God created everything including evil. If not directly, he, at least, created the opportunity for original sin to be committed.    I've never met a fox in a foxhole that had any opinion on the matter and I been serving for 18 years.   You obviously never served in the military but no matter. Service-members do not have to follow unlawful orders and, in fact, are required to report any incidence of violations of the UCMJ whether or not they were involved. Furthermore, if they participate in an unlawful order, they can be prosecuted under the UCMJ and civilian authorities. That's right! double jeopardy. Also, many, many decisions are made by junior personnel on their own, so far from being the drones you speak of, the military requires that they possess reasoning skills instead of the "paint it or salute it" response you believe the military wants.     You had me until the Muslim professor smirked quite jewishly. Is jewishly even a word? LOL   From what I'm seeing, did the guy get pulled over by the police? Also, does everyone in Europe have dashcams?   Great question! Most people think that a species is defined by its inability to interbreed. Close but not quite. Loosely, a species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. In the case of closely related species or subspecies they can interbreed but the offspring are generally, but not always, infertile and are referred to as a F1 hybrid. Peppermint is the plant equivalent to a mule, zorses, and ligers.   Biology is a hell of a study!     My grandmother's home had three people die there. Her husband from a heart attack, her son from complications of cirrhosis and her grandson, my brother, from a heroin overdose.           I have a Sony VAIO K series laptop that is running XP using linksys wifi router with an external linksys receiver.  My son cleaned up my hard-drives and installed Avira as virus protection but now my computer slows down and locks up on certain times. It seems to be in conjunction with Avira downloading files up to twice a day.   Is Avira something that is causing the problem and/or are there better protections I can use. He volunteered this as a free but I don't mind paying for something better.       Whenever I highlight something to print as a selection on my HP Deskjet it prints it out as "run-on" linear text instead of a screenshot type format. Any suggestions please???         Mine are my brother(45) and uncle(59) that haven't worked for over a decade except sporadically and are both felons. They lived with my mother until she died Dec 11 and because of her reverse mortgage have been able to con them into staying there over a year.  The property has now been sold and they're just squatting waiting for eviction.  All this while I was in the military and sending money home to help "mom".  Received 90% disability and husband and I bought our first home.  Now, in not so disguised pleas have asked to come live with us.  Hell no!!  I still feel bad for them though. What do you guys think?            A local church has bought up property, 50+ homes that paid property taxes (5,000 a year avg each), in an old established neighborhood, to build a mega-church which pays zero taxes, with 5,000+ members.  Parking is at a premium so they want to nudge more "neighbors" to sell their homes to build more parking thereby lowering property values even more.  I don't mind a M-C building on undeveloped land but to reformat a neighborhood and essentially force people to sell who have lived there 30+ years doesn't seem Christlike nor neighborly.     My suggestion would be to eliminate the tax exception for M-C's like this because they use the existing infrastructure (roads and road improvements) and all other forms of taxpayer subsidized things like police and fire protection, public schools, libraries, weather alert systems, snow and ice removal, street lighting, storm drains, and even animal nuisance for free. These M-C's bring in a lot of money.      They act in effect like a corporation with no rules. I think they need rules. I think the time has come to take a hard look at churches that are *wink wink* "non profit" and tax them! Reddit help!!!                         My uncle (57) and my younger brother (46) are soon to be homeless. They're both felons and haven't held a real job for the past decade. In addition they both have heavy drug use in their past. My uncle shows signs of his meth use even though he no longer uses. My brother has stolen from me and has never even filed a tax return. They've both lived with my grandmother and/or my mom from 2000 till they both passed. She had a reverse mortgage and they've been able to stay in the house for almost a year without paying a cent except utilities, ins. and taxes which are now due.  I was in the military until 2010 and for the past ten years sent money and gifts home to help Mom.    I bought my first home after being rated 90% disabled. My husband and I are happy except that these "freeloaders" want us to subsidize them because "they're family".    I won't jeopardize my own family, mental health or happiness to anyone that won't help themselves and they've had a year to figure out what to to but haven't. In one month they'll be on the street at Christmas time, no less. This depresses me to know end. The only thing I'm trying to help me out of this funk is Meals on Wheels. Wish me luck!  If anyone out there has had similar experience please share. I can't imagine it's not uncommon.      	111
 **W**ednesday **H**as **U**nlimited **H**ints  We will find out all we need to know on Wednesday. Confirmed.   You did it. You uncovered it. Congratulations, my friend.   http://imgur.com/YuptFyN  WHAT'S THE HIDDEN CODE!?!?!?  **EDIT 1:** Darby said "whuh". What does it mean!?  **EDIT 2:** Darby McDevitt is the creative scriptwriter at Ubisoft. He was the lead writer of ACIV. He will most definitely know about ACV.  **EDIT 3:** People...I know it means what/huh. Please just relax and have fun...and decipher the code...   Okay. Okay. I've got it...  **UBISOFT IS SPEAKING THROUGH DREAMS NOW!!!**   In fact, I went to my local Best Buy today and asked if they had a shipment of ACV posters come in. I was told that they haven't arrived *yet*. YET!   That being said, I don't think posters are going up tomorrow.    The letters are not highlighted anymore. Did a mod just troll us hardcore?   FRENCH!? ARE YOU HINTING AT SOMETHING!?!?   "I don't know if it worked the first time. Will you baptize me again?"   Is this even possible now?   Thank you both. I'm over-hyping myself. Sorry.   What. Is. Happening.  Has the spoiler box always hidden the words "Something is coming"? I don't think so...   **UPDATE:** I went to Best Buy and asked if they had received a shipment of Assassin's Creed V posters. This is what I was told:  "We don't have them in *yet*..."  Yet. What does yet mean, guys? Yet. Is there a shipment on the way? Yet. Do they have a date that they wouldn't share? Yet. Is it just some ambiguous in the future kind of yet? Or is it a specific kind of 'we know the date' yet? YET!!!!   Absolutely. I've bought hamburgers for $10. An 8 hour + game is worth the money.   I'm stopping by Best Buy tonight to see if I can bribe an employee for any information. If they don't have promotional posters, they are getting them soon. Wish me luck.   Seriously. Give me anything. Assassin's in Space. I really don't care. I just need something to soothe my stress.   Hi, my name is /u/test_subject861, and I'm an AC addict...  This is a safe place to share your addictive habits concerning Assassin's Creed. Go ahead. We are here for you.   It has long been confirmed that Ubisoft is making a yearly main cannon release for Assassin's Creed. We are, in fact, expecting two AC-related releases this year, my friend.   I don't care as much about the poster as I do about the trailer.    ACIII was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 5th.  ACIV was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 4th.    So, do we possibly see ACV's trailer on Monday? Here's to hoping.   Hmm...  If this is the case, we might have all been right in connecting the boxes between Embers and Freedom. If this is the case, the clues really have been in front of our face the entire time. But something in me is saying "no".   Nonetheless, this is really the most evidence we have for any particular game. China.   All of these are great finds. I've read many of them. However, I have heard that there has been confirmation that we will not return to Shau Jun's story. Can anyone corroborate that with an official link?   Great find! I'm going to include this in my post above so we can keep them all together.    We do know that sometime this year there will be a major installment. All of the others have progressed 1-4. I think it is safe to assume that one of the releases this year will be V.   I too like where this is going. I don't have much to add right now, but maybe we should start looking in this direction.  The only thing I want to stress if that the clue(s) are "right in our faces", we just don't know it...    It is crazy to believe that they can keep it this tightly sealed. There have got to be some assassin-like people in the organization that are willing to lose their job and then go into hiding for a leak!   But, I agree with you.  The absolute least we have to go on is that there are hints in both Black Flag and Freedom Cry. Why can't we at least decipher those?   I guess I'll start and just edit in additional ones I find here.  [**(2.23.14) Jade Raymond**] (http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/meet-woman-behind-assassin-s-creed-155897) - Her favorite era and not samurai age Japan.  [**(1.28.14) Darby McDevitt**](http://www.edge-online.com/features/black-flags-red-herrings-assassins-creed-writer-darby-mcdevitt-on-whats-next-for-ubisofts-flagship-series/) *from /u/Khal_Drogo_Baggins* - Ubisoft builds games (decides locations) based on technology. The technology to climb and walk around on dynamically moving objects will return. In-game email location hints were just for fun.   [**(12.09.13) Wesley Pincombe**](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-09-assassins-creed-4-dlc-new-locations-and-ac5-hints) - Freedom Cry contains hints that are "in your face" but will take "hardcore fans" to understand them.  [**(11.05.13) Gabe Graziani** ] (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pz0j2/iama_developer_on_assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/cd7ip5r) *from /u/Khal_Drogo_Baggins* - It sounds like they don't have any plans to continue Shao Jun's story back in China.   Post links below. With all of our powers combined, can't we decipher hints as to where AC5 will take place?  There have been leaks or hidden clues for almost every other AC game. Why haven't we figured this one out?   I am answering   PLOT TWIST: The protagonist is actually Lucy Stillman from the previous games. SHE ISN'T DEAD!!!   For upgrades, you must invent new things. New to kill someone slowly? Invent fire. Need to set a trap that will crush someone? Invent the wheel.   I can imagine two hidden clubs strapped to both arms. I like where this is going.   Yes. More of this please.   Let's just say I work at Best Buy...   Everyone has their opinions on the era/setting of the next Assassin's Creed. Here are mine and the reasons why:  * **Assassin.s Creed Transylvania** - There are, like, no video games set in spooky mansions with blood suckers all about. Assassins already wear capes - check. They are in search of blood (for animus stuff) - check. PLUS, final target - Dracula himself. Okay. Done. Give me money and I'll sign over rights Ubisoft.   * **Assassin;s Creed World War 3** - Take out Hitler. Easy. How you ask? Shoot him. Use a gun, the staple weapon of the whole AC series. Bring in a tank. I don't care. Kill the guy and save the Jews!  * **Assassins Creed Over the Boarder** - Now listen to me and listen well. Every year there are tens of billions of Mexicans trying to cross over the U.S.of A. boarder to steal our jobs. Imagine an assassin that runs along the line stabbing illegal immigrants right in the throat. Nothing screams AMERICA like this game would!  * **Assassin-s Creed Baywatch** - Try and tell me this wouldn't be the perfect setting. I dare you! Tons of assassination opportunities from the sand, in the water, and under the docks. You're really going to try and make me believe that thousands of people die because of stupid SHARKS throughout the year? Give me a break. Two of 'em idiots.  AND, last but not least...  * **Assassin^s Creed Reign of Terror** - Uh, hello. FRENCH REVOLUTION ANYBODY!? No one has thought of this one yet? Are you kidding me! I know this will be it. I saw an email Easter Egg in ACIV (hint hint). Guillotines, Robs Pierre, and Marie Antwofreakinette!!!! And who wouldn't love hearing fake French accents for 20+ hours!?!?  Just a few ideas floating around in my head. If you want some more just ask.   I definitely see the Hundred Years' War being a great possibility. Rich with history and events, and an extended timeline to traverse through (which they seem to like doing with one assassin character).  I never was trying to rule anything in or out. I simply wanted to make some widespread observations and see if they come to pass.    I did mention this under the **Egypt** heading. But this is a video game that is talking about a First Civilization, a world catastrophe, and magical items spread throughout the world, I think they can create earlier assassins if they so desire.   Thought I'd prepare a slightly different post sharing where I think Ubisoft will take future Assassin's Creed games. Most are concerned where V will be and could care less about VI or VII or how it will conclude with X. I clearly have no idea where they will go or end up, but here are some basic thoughts (in no particular order):  * **Medieval / King Arthur's Court**. I personally think this might be V. It has been mentioned in passing, but no one has seemed to carry this idea forward. I feel like it would be cool to have to eliminate the court members one by one, as obviously they were Templar scum. We haven't had straight up castles, moats, knights, and damsels in distress. I believe this is coming at some point.  * **French Revolution**. Whether you love or hate the idea, it's going to happen at some point. It's too good and too unexplored to pass up. I personally think it'll be a side game rather than a main title because I think it would have to include Connor to some degree. It might just mention or cameo him, but I think the time periods and characters are too close. The revolution, as far as I know, has not been touched in other games and would be a beautiful setting with an enthralling story for some future game.  * **First Civilization**. Haven't heard this discussed much, but I think it will a game at some point. When I first saw "Great Fall", I felt that this might be concerning origins. However, that "leaked" graphic might be fake. Regardless, I believe that at some point we will be in control of Adam and/or Eve.   * **Oriental / East Asian**. I think it is one of the more distant games, but it would be difficult to skip over these beautiful and unique settings. I know they have touched it some in extended content, but they will take us there in a future game. I feel that it will be early-modern Japan with samurai, but that is just a fun guess.  * **Egypt**. I saw fellow redditor suggest an early assassin that uses primitive weapons such as scorpions, snake poison, etc. The only problem I have with this is that the "realistic" order of Assassins were formed later in time. I'm not sure if Ubisoft cares about this, but it is worth mentioning.  I think that these are some locations that we will see, some sooner and some later, some in main games and some in side games. Here are a few game-changing systems I think will be added and explored at some point:  * **Character customization/upgrades**. This has been dealt with by other people and I think if they want it to fit into the realm of possibilities within the Animus, then they will make it do so.  *  **Player options**. At some point, we will be able to have a choice which assassin story to follow. In fact, I think it will be soon where we can play through a game as the primary protagonist (Assassin) or antagonist (Templar). The story will play out the same, but we will see both sides of the story, as they are already trying to get us to see in recent releases.  * **Single Assassin Missions**. This might get some negative feedback because it doesn't make sense in the current scheme of AC games. But, I think that at some point we will be able to jump into various stories throughout history and play through the assassination or assassination attempt. I don't see full games in more modern history, but I see single events where we can get a taste of those assassinations. For example: Abraham Lincoln, Franz Ferdinand, Adolf Hitler, etc. This will surely be side games or DLC/extended content.   So, here are some of my thoughts for the metanarrative of the Assassin's Creed franchise. What do you agree with? What do you disagree with? What sounds fun? What sounds terrible? Care to add anything? Thanks for taking the time to read.   No. I just know that if you are willing to work hard, there are jobs available. In fact, there are infinite jobs. You think I'm crazy, I know.   Write a book, start a business, learn a new trade, study design, go back to school. Do whatever it takes, but there are limitless possibilities for the one willing to sacrifice and do the work necessary to attain what they desire.   I agree with you in regards to the advantages we have been given. I also understand that there are many people without the advantages I have been granted, although they most definitely have some other advantages that I am not privy to.  I love Jesus. He was a great man as far as I can tell. He most definitely did advocate for charity and helping those around you, as I agree wholeheartedly with. I don't know where I would have given off the opposite impression. I also am not sure how that applies to the conversation at hand.  I do feel as though we might have gone into a deeply philosophical dialogue that I didn't intend for this post to go.  Once again, my main comment stands: Share your opinion. Vote. By all means. But if you don't like the way the Creator is running things, go play/do something else.    Absolutely not. But my point is neither for nor against anarchy or democracy for that matter. It is that the Creator makes the rules and we follow or don't. Enjoy the game the way it is being played or go play another game.   Respond whatever way you see fit. I could care less. My point is that the purpose of the project has not been ruined by the Creator's choices.    I reread my original post. Nowhere did I say that one couldn't give their opinions. Opinions are great things. Opinions are also monumentally different than attempts to overthrow the system and/or force the Creator's/boss's hand.  The Creator opened a vote. Voting is great. You are kind of making my point stronger (thanks). If people vote democracy, democracy rules. If people vote anarchy, anarchy rules. But the experiment doesn't fail with or without it. That is my point.  P.S. I live in a world where people whine and complain and do nothing to better their work situation. There are thousands of jobs available in the real world my friend. They are available for the hard worker, for the educated, for the faithful, for the ethical, and for those willing to go out and find a job rather than sit at home on their computer and complain that there aren't any jobs available.   Listen, how about we let the Creator do whatever he wants. If you don't like it or agree with it, stop playing along. If you do like, have fun and enjoy the process.  This kind of "educated whining" reminds me of fast food restaurant workers complaining about how much they are getting paid and so their solution is to go on strike.   Are you kidding me? If you don't like how much you are getting paid, go get another freaking job. There are many people that would work for how much you are getting paid. And there are thousands of jobs available for you out in the world. Get off your lazy butt and go find one.   Entitlement is a nasty monster. I truly hope that the Creator doesn't care what we think. It was his (brilliant) idea to begin the journey. He can affect it in whatever way he deems necessary. Everyone else can either play along, or politely GTFO.         Jake! Amir!  My wife and I (Dustin and Cara) are coming to NYC just to eat a quick lunch (or long dinner) with you sometime between Dec 26th   Jan 1st.   PLEASE, take a few minutes out of your day to get a FREE meal from us. Yeah, you heard that right - FREE. It will be worth it. I know you guys can't do this for everyone. But you surely can do it for us.   Do for one what you can't do for all!  	44
 "They were the reason we're *hear*" here.  Awesome story btw   He's unique now! He's a cutie! :)   For what? Seriously.  Its comic 75.    Its alright, point is, you tried to help.

They mixed up my real name (Baul Plart) anyways my mom just made some sweet potatoe fried so BRB.    Black cat passing, bad luck?    But your opinion on the subject would be appreciated! :)   No. There were no question marks. :)   Our government is the enemy. Wake up.    Why would we? (Sincere question)   A few months ago we could put things on r/worldnews and not get censored. Now reddit is just like every other website that doesn't want problems or to offend someone.

Destruction is a form of creation.    Is your boy alright?    I was on a bridge with my Mom in Uvalde Tx, we got rear ended by a semi and we hit the guardrail and the car kinda hopped over and fell into a lake i was like 14. She and i survived (obviously). I just broke my pinky.    Damn, your gramps hair was slick. i bet he had to get an oil change instead of doing his hair! mad respect.   So i live at South Padre, Tx. Meaning the border isn't far from where i am. Immigrants come over here daily. Most dont even get caught. My father is a Border Patrol and he said if Ebola gets out of control we're leaving because of how unprotected all the borders are. My older sister is a Nurse and they had a meeting with some of the representatives of HEB, Walmart, and other businesses. They had a meeting because they needed to know what to do if they had a case here Locally. The business had to give their plans on what they would do to protect employess, food, Etc. They said they were to close down. No food. No gas. Im just giving the View of lower Texas on Ebola. If shit hits the fan, Texas is down for the count.    Props. I would've done the same    Thank you i really appreciate it!    Thanks for all the info! :D   Thank you :)   Thank you.   Thank you, i appreciate it.   Think about it.      "we were young, we had our heads down, oh and i." Also is says "turn around" a few times. It was on the ending of Bojack Horseman episode 7 on netflix. PLEASE HELP.   Why do you guys like this game? Im playing Ghosts and this game is just so horrible. The mechanics are sluggish. Not to mention the graphics.  When the hell was this engine made? 2003? Why do you even play this shit?  	101
 well i had done it and i was looking for it and i found it kind of funny that they have optimized missions so much like the prelude of darkness mission and set ups for css and kyuubi naruto. and the optimizations for characters like fixing shigure and ten ten while keeping the initial idea for how they play   So im a fairly old player (started when the site started lost that account so tech around 2009ish) and i remember doing a certain mission a long time ago where you had to use every character to finish and it was just set up for sannin missions. and i wanted to know what it was and if anyone remembers what the requirements entailed ex. what chararcters were used naruto 10/10    I made a league video and i enjoyed playing creating and editing the video. So i have uploaded it to youtube i want to know what spots i can possibly improve on and such and i don't want to fall under a specific formula. anyway this is my video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P_jFc_XGaA   this reminds me of when i played banjo kazooie im not going to make a post about since i would feel like im ripping off your idea for this but maybe ill just make a video about it but really thanks for sharing this story reminds me of the days as a kid growing up with the better systems hope you can find some nostalgia again some day its the greatest feeling in the world to relive your past   	4

I dont always hit a women, but when I do I make sure I knock her to the floor no questions asked   Looks like a classy establishment y'all stayed at..   I like how it says, "Our Goal, Totally Satisfied" because when I get my car towed that is the complete opposite of what I am..   GOJO in the bottom right corner...they know whats really going on..   I bet they all rode their fixies there, and then smoked cigarettes.   Its funny to me that this person decided to take a picture at this moment.   and what was nailed now?   prolly huge..      It's Arizona to start..       God Bless New York City!      Thats how I look when Im standing next to my friends         well I appreciate you keeping me busy while I wait to do my rounds, but now I must go do them so I have to be on my way, but I am sure we will run into each other again on this here internet thing!   i wouldnt say people dont know what they want in life but it is more of a "how do i get there" problem, in my opinion   thats why you always gotta have your other shit to keep you sane, trust me if I just had this job, id kill myself bc overnights suck balls. But I know that this is just a paycheck for me and the real fun happens once I get off! its all a matter of tolerance   oh well yea man ride the college train as long as you can, no point in fucking up school for minimum wage anyway. Everyone says find a job you love and get paid for it, but thats kind of bullshit in my mind. Find a job to survive and do the things you love because you love them, even if it doesnt pay..   living the dream my friend, getting paid to troll haha...you are my age, why cant you find work?   to kill time during my overnight shift..ah win!

Too bad its a hoax...   At least wipe your ass with them first, put them to use for something         thanks!         Schnell, it could be worse      Thanks man, that's what we were going for!!  	66
    Don't say so! He will kill a Stark!   *nelsonvoice*: Ha Ha!   It isn't. Commercially available solar cells have an efficiency of 17 to 20 percent, so there is only one fifth of the energy going into electricity. This is even under laboratory conditions. Rawlemon indicates they already be able to achieve an efficiency of more than 50 percent with the glass ball collectors right now. On a squarefoot photovoltaic surface, the prototypes already produces as much electricity as conventional systems generate with a much bigger surface - they are four times as effective.

 IT'S WHAT I REMEMBER WALT!!   I did. Scroll down.   Walter, have you ever drank shots of liquid cocaine and Jack Daniels?  Walt, it was closing time and when closing time happens, legs open....   Da fuck?   I agree. I dropped the book when I glanced at the cover and said "What the fuck?" really loud. Yeah, I took the pic when I dropped it. Someone placed it in the Sci-Fi aisle.   What is your impression of the cover art?   I fucked a fat chick and didn't know until the next day. Woke up naked in the bed, used the phone on her night stand to call friend, message on phone said "Dial 1 and area code for the number you are dialing", jump up, find phone book from Kansas.  I live in Tennessee.   Long story short : It all started with a bookshelf and naked pics of them both.   That is weird as fuck.

See, you know how DC always fucks up the Archie superhero universe?  I had this crazy thought about rebooting Archie Comics into a superhero universe. Riverdale? Big as New York? Archie Andrews? Well, he is the Fly. The Golden Age,Silver Age,etc. All of the past Crusaders, Shield,Blue Ribbon Comics stuff has happened, but rebooting Archie would have him on par with Spider-Man as the Fly (the rookie superhuman dealing with experienced heroes).

So anyone whos been on the /v/ board at 4chan. probably knows about Mr. Bones Wild Ride. For those who dont, it was a ride someone made for Roller Coaster Tycoon. It was one of those really slow motor car rides but with a twist. It had 30,696 feet of track and a ride time of 70 real time minutes, around four years ingame time. In addition there were those props of the skeleton holding out his top hat scattered around here and there, as if to mock the customers. Needless to say, there were a lot of passengers screaming I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE! Now heres where things get really good. Once the ride came to a stop, the passengers found themselves on a long path that took about 2 hours to traverse. Once they reached the end, they found themselves facing a sign that read Mr. Bones says: The ride never ends! The path lead straight back to the entrance of Mr. Bones Wild Ride. There was nowhere else to go. In other words, they were fucked. Needless to say this gained a lot of popularity on /v/ and people started making their own Mr. Bones Wild Ride. I was one of them and made a version with the ghost train ride. You know the one thats usually a huge death trap. It didnt last as long as the original but it did have a twist. Near the end it launched the cars into a small shed with a sign on the side that said Enjoy your stay! I killed about 20 people with that ride and laughed my ass off as they each went one by one to their graves. Fast forward a few weeks and I was in Busch Gardens on vacation. I was wandering around trying to decide what to ride. Thats when I noticed a ride that hadnt been there the last time I visited. It was weird because it had never been advertised and there was nothing on the map about it. I figured what the hell and got in line. Surprisingly the line wasnt very long. I only waited about 10 minutes to get on. It was one of those motor car rides which is kind of weird because they already had one elsewhere in the park. Why would they open up a second one? After buckling in I looked up ahead and froze. There was a giant skeleton up ahead tipping a hat to me with a sign over his head. No I whispered. The sign read Mr. Bones Wild Ride. I struggled with my restraints but they wouldnt come off. I begged the employee contolling the ride to help and that I had changed my mind but he ignored me. My car started moving and I screamed in terror. Up ahead the track stretched on for what seemed like forever. I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!    [A FEW YEARS AGO A MAN WAS WALKING DOWN A ROAD BECAUSE HIS CAR BROKE DOWN AND HE SAW A CAR COMING UP BEHIND HIM SO HE STUCK OUT HIS THUMB TO HITCH HIKE AND THE CAR STOPPED AHEAD OF HIM.

(Comics, Metal Cassettes,etc.)  My local Craigslist isn't a great source for sports cards and I rather trade them through the mail. Local dealer here doesn't carry 80s-00s star cards and the rest of the local Craigslist guys highball their sports cards.   Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!          Has anyone bought any LED flashlights or EDC accessories on dx.com? Are the products just as good as their name brand counterparts?

Here is the pic:  http://www.gamesetwatch.com/magweasel/ugr04.jpg      I used to see the ad in Tip And Tricks and EGM/EGM2.

So, after finding some downloads of java games that can be used on older cell phones, the question is finding a decent used cell phone as a game device/pocket pc swiss army phone?

I need help making this crappy pc into a decent mp3 jukebox! May someone help me in my quest?   I am a huge fan of radio programs like House Of Hair,Wax Museum,The Tour Bus,The Rockin' 80's,etc. and cannot find a decent tracker with these programs in mp3 format.Anyone have any info on any sites with torrents for these shows?

 Don't construction works do stuff like this all the time? Just without the camera?    Some background information? What happened?     3 Japanese teenagers  Huh, that's Babymetal. They are pretty famous.   I discovered them though [this Fine Bros Reaction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeARpcDimx4) and was watching this [Gimme Chocolate Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIKqgE4BwAY) just yesterday.     My favorite is [fans singing Bohemian Rhapsody at a Green Day concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw4PS4HO2Dw) There's just something about that song.     [Hrithik Roshan](http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/1911564.jpg)   I want Negrotown to be a movie.    I must be bored too to keep this going, but.. 1. I mentioned milk from cows. Would have been better if you world have read my original comment in the first place. You are taking one single example and expanding it into a debate.  2. We humans still do not contribute to spreading their seeds when we have their fruits.  3. I'm not trying to contradict you. I agree with what you said about hurting and killing animals being unnecessary. The point I'm trying to make is there is more to it than you think. And that, in the grand scheme of things, none of it really matters.    1. Agreed. But that doesn't make it okay. Kicking a cat might also not kill it, but that doesn't make it okay.  2. The plant is not waiting there for an animal to come and pick its fruit. If you want to live a perfect vegan life, why not wait for the fruit to fall to the ground naturally then? And lets admit it, how many of us humans "spreed the seeds" of the original plant after having it's fruit? And that was just a single statement among others, so I suggest you to read the entire comment. 3. That is the statement I was looking for. The admission that we are biased towards animals because it feels "emotionally" wrong to hurt/kill them. Because we relate to them. So its okay to abuse/hurt plants, because it doesn't give a direct/immediate response to our physical attacks. It's okay to interfere with its natural evolutionary process, because hey, it doesn't seem to be crying or something.   This is not about my argument vs your argument. This is about how humanity works. How we function. It is indeed about the emotional connection, something that varies among individuals throughout the world.      I'm a non-vegetarian and have many a times considered becoming a vegan. Here are some thoughts I would like to share,   I agree that hurting/killing animals is unnecessary and can be avoided, but is it wrong only because the animals in question are also "conscious" beings like us? What about when we pluck a fruit from a tree? Is that okay because, as far as we know, plants do not have consciousness? The milk produced by cows is not meant for us humans, then why is it okay for us to use for our own benefit? Plants/nature, like us, have the life goal to survive. They produce whatever they produce for the benefit of their own evolution, not to fill our stomachs. Then why would it be okay to stop/interfere with this evolutionary process of any individual plant?       This can become philosophically very deep. Just because a complex system of atoms and molecules has the ability to make conscious thoughts and receive and responded to strong physical stimuli, it should be avoided from being interfered in its evolutionary process, while doing so to a similar system that doesn't have the ability to make physically/emotionally visible responses to a similar interference is okay?   And as a non-vegetarian I can tell you that it's not even about non-vegetarian food. We don't eat chicken because its chicken, we eat it because its  **tasty**. That's the main word. It's all for those little dots on our tongue that light up our brain when we have something tasty. If someone is able to invent a food product that is not non-veg and yet tastes exactly like non-veg, I would imagine humanity to probably shift to this new thing.   I have given a lot of thought to these stuff, and in the end I can only conclude that, in the grand scheme  of things, it doesn't really matter. The list of what is good and what is bad is created, controlled and expanded by us humans and is totally subjective, since it depends on what an individual or a group of people "feel".     I was not pointing to the FCC site. I was pointing to the Reddit posts that brought me and many others to the site. It was posted back in November.  ([r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2msdo1/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code/), [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2muc12/cautionary_tale_about_learning_to_code/), [r/learnjavascript](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2mknfp/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code_my_own/)).   Certainly all the commentators on those posts are not bots?    But if you are looking for something outside the site's domain, here are a few blog posts by some supposedly "bot" members of FCC:  1. http://www.terakilobyte.com/running-out-of-rocket-fuel/ 2. http://crisberrios.github.io/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/  And here is a post from the FCC blog shared on Hacker News : https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8965048  But if you really believe with your whole heart that all of this is "spam" then you always have the option to ignore it. Our goal is to provide a service, to help and give directions to a beginner in learning to code. It is not to argue with people on the Internet whether or not we are real.      I made that comment from my original account that was a year old. But for some reason my account was not functioning properly, so I had to create a new account to make that statement. If a skeptic is interested enough, s/he would check out those links I posted and find out that this is not even the first time FreeCodeCamp has been linked here. A smart person would take advantage of such a service instead of trying to resist/dodge it so much.   ITT: skeptic people drawing unnecessary conclusions without doing any research. FreeCodeCamp is not a spam, it's legit. There are no bots in this trend, just people who are not so regular on Reddit. Go ahead and [read this article by the founder of FCC from a few months ago](http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html).  This was the article that got me and many others started with FreeCodeCamp. And I found this article on Reddit ([r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2msdo1/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code/), [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2muc12/cautionary_tale_about_learning_to_code/), [r/learnjavascript](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2mknfp/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code_my_own/)).   And, yes, the curriculum links to other free learning resources on the web like CodeCademy, but we also have the Ziplines and Basejumps and Bonfires for practice, which we entirely built on our own. And we also have plans to build our own learning tools in the future.   I agree the title could have been a little less click-bait-ish, but trust me, FreeCodeCamp is legit and we would be glad to have you as part of the community. :)  	12
 origin story  you were born to be a super hero   "fear of shitting in public places"  So I can safely assume you're a guy?   I have observed many love triangles among my birds throughout the years, involving yelling at each other and fighting over the shared object of affection, but one triangle in particular was especially interesting.  Two male Parakeets (budgies), Jupiter and Misty, were romantically involved with a female parakeet, Aqua, and had also occasionally been romantically involved with each other.  This was an interesting bisexual love triangle, where one day you'd see Aqua (the female) with one of the boys, another day with the other, and another day the boys would be on each other; and the next day they'd be physically fighting over her.  It was crazy and intensely dramatic.   People who have multiple pets, breed animals, have farms, etc.  What is the most interesting relationship you've observed your pets/animals getting into?   The pen with which he'd sealed his fate; signing away his freedom, and effectively, his sanity.  He had, in his frustration, clicked it three times in quick succession, summoning this eerie visitor in the night.     I made it to my desk, only to find my computer already logged in, and my emails already answered.  No one else could have done this.  The only explanation was that I'd already been there.  I went to the bathroom, only to find that I no longer felt like I had to go.  I exited the stall just in time to see my back exiting the door.  I rushed out of the bathroom, only to find the figure had been lost in the large office hustle and bustle.  Thoroughly disturbed, I made my way back to my desk.  My coffee had already been drunk, and my report already written, with exactly what I was going to say.  I saw the me-like figure again out of the corner of my eye, a quick flash in the commotion, heading for the door to the stairwell.  I booked it for the door and took the steps two at a time.  Arriving in the parking garage, I heard a car door slam and an engine roar.  I ducked behind a black sedan just in time to see myself, driving my car out into the street, shadows flickering around it with static interference.  I began to suspect that I was seeing myself a few hours into the future; living two timelines simultaneously.   I lived with my ex for 2 and a half years.  We got officially engaged in the middle of that.  (To put it short and simply, I left because he stopped appreciating me and it seemed like I was the only one trying to make things work, and I gradually became more of a maid than an girlfriend.)  I'm not saying by any means that this will happen to you.  What I'm saying is that I agree with the others that you should live with him, because otherwise you won't know what it's like to live with him before you commit.  You could be perfect going out and basically being close friends, but you might find that you simply cannot live with him.  Just note, if you are always doing what he wants to do, and never what you want to do, that is a red flag.  To address the family problems.  He was white and I am not.  I was the successful one, he was not. His family loved me though.  My parents never liked him (we had already been together three years before I moved in with him).  They also believe the only acceptable way for a female to leave home is to go to school or get married.    It took about a year for them to come to terms with the fact that I was not (at the time) going to move back no matter how much they implored me to.  This is around the time my dad accepted him as "part of the family."  This is also around the time that I started going places with my parents, like to church on Sundays and stuff.  They'd pick me up and bring me back.    About 6 months later they became ok with including my ex.  So we'd all go on family outings.    Well things at home (with him) had gradually gotten sour (as previously detailed), and so eventually, when I got tired of trying to make it work, one Sunday night, I asked my parents if I could move back in with them, and the rest is history.  TL/DR (Case in Point):  PLEASE DO live with him or you may not know what you're getting into.  Good or bad, you need to find out before you complicate things further legally, emotionally, and with family.   Edit: replaced some unnecessary details with a generic line of advice.   I am in grad school, An American in England, and this is my first time truly on my own (I used to live with my ex).  I have been here for over a month, and I have not felt homesick yet.  I asked a friend if that was weird, and she said it's normal for your first time on your own, presumably because it is so liberating.   I get lonely sometimes though.  I surround myself with my friends, including skyping with my friends from back home when I am alone in my dorm room.    So, surround your self with good friends and have fun!  Take full advantage of the experience. That's my advice.   yes, and I kid you not, when I was in my early teens, I looked like I was in my early 20's (the reverse is true now, but I digress).   I was in the store with my dad and my (then) baby brother; my mom was at work.  An employee approached me trying to "sell" me on a credit card, and she thought my dad was my husband and my brother was my son.    I have received nice compliments from both guys and girls at various times, but there is one compliment that I will never forget, because no one else has ever said anything like this about me, and because it happened at an embarrassing time.   It was freshman year of high school (about 8 years ago now),  in gym class, we were doing free play and a friend (whom I had a crush on) and I were kicking a soccer ball back and forth.  He kicked it to me, and when I went to kick it, I was either too ambitious or it slipped under my foot just right, and I slipped and fell into a seated position flat on my bottom.  I was so embarrassed.    But do you know what he said to me? "I've never seen anyone fall so gracefully." No one else has ever called me "graceful."  I can be quite clumsy at times, so I will never forget that.    well, as long as each time isn't a monumental life-changing event, you should have no problem :p   you can be so tied to someone mentally/emotionally so sense when something important or serious happens.  Like when you just *know* something is wrong.     it will start happening again if you get adequate sleep   yes, all the time.  Everyone has them occasionally.  dreams are metaphors for/ based on the things that we are thinking about or have subconsciously picked up on during the day  / things we don't want to admit.   To be more specific, my most recent one was, interrupting the middle of a dream's usual craziness, I wound up at WalMart with my mom to return a pack of socks. When I woke up in the morning, guess what we had to go do?   now, in the dream, the socks were white.  The real ones were black.  But still.   making them do the drug they were up against while hammered could kill them.  that part needs to be taken out   concept is good, but I don't agree with your categories.  Why is Islamist up there with political ideologies?  It is a Religion.  If you want to include Theocratic governments, then perhaps your should include more than one type.   This may be cheating, but I would have a Perfect mansion, Pretzels, a Porche, Pet birds, Pretty clothes, Pistachio Ice Cream, Pear Cider, and Plenty of chocolate :)   that's a cultural thing.  Wet ones / baby wipes.  Use them   yes; I am on exchange in England and I tried them and they are so good I bought a jumbo pack.     That could be the "secret" she's taking to the grave.     I saw that video and read about this a few months ago.  That hotel actually has a whole history of strange events, and in the past was even known as a popular destination for those looking to commit suicide    Did anyone else think this was a woman until the "girlfriend" part?      I had a sore throat and an interview the next day, so I was concerned.  I was at my parents' house for dinner, so I asked for advice.  Me: what do I do if I wake up tomorrow and my voice is hoarse?  Dad: Just go  "neigh"   Don't you mean avian flew?   I will upload a picture to photobucket when I get home from work and link it here.  I designed it not around replacing all letters with different characters, but around replacing frequently used words with shorthanded symbols.  I did manage to put it in a chart in Excell, but I could not get the characters to save as a font.   I like the idea of another writing system.  I learned dwarvish runes from the hobbitt very easily, but I find American shorthand and the Dotsies to be impractical, because the characters are so similar in nature.  When the Dotsies are bunched up, they are hard to distinguish. With notecard situations, I usually write really tiny, and abbreviate.  I developed my own system of shorthand as well.  I wrote out charts for it, but I ran into some hiccups trying to program a font so that I can type in it and share it with the world.  Kudos to the Dotsies inventor for being able to do that so well.   a couple of years ago I found a tiny frog like this once.  I tried to take it home with me.  I have an insect container that would have made a great home for him.  When we arrived, he was just fine.  I washed the container out and put water and grass in it.  I went to put him in it, and he was dead.  I looked it up and I guess his skin got too dry.  :(   I just found out that the secretary at the office downstairs is pregnant and had an ultrasound yesterday.  It's a boy.  She came up here and showed us the pictures.  That is so freaky.   I'd had a baby and he was smaller than my pinky (about as tall as the first two pieces of the pinky, and slightly skinnier than it).  I don't remember much about the middle of the dream except that I sort of ignored him and just fed him and gave him occasional attention at different points of the day (like you would a pet bird for instance).  Then at one point, in the evening, I thought, "it's been a couple of hours, he's probably hungry."  So I picked the baby up.  He was wrapped up in a gum wrapper with a tiny tortilla inside, as if he was a trident-sized taco bell burrito.  I was intending to breastfeed him, but nothing was coming.  Suddenly, my mom was sitting next to me and she said to let her do it (and I saw her dripping milk - agh!).  At that point mine started working, so I fed the baby.  It was really weird with him being so tiny.  He looked darker than he did before at this point in the dream.  Then I woke up.  Bit of bg for the curious: I am engaged, but not pregnant.  I have no children.  Might be because we recently got two new lovebirds.   this was my reaction to this thread )posted on tumblr b/c I hadn't joined reddit yet.  Just thought I'd share them here without going back through the whole thread and finding each comment that I was referring to. http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/49332764629/peridexis-ocdplayer-sunwillswallow-dont   there's no telling if it was him or now; we can't verify who this guy really is, and who really cares?  It would matter if he was taking credit for something of at least a small importance, but this means nothing.   what an injustice.  Rape is rape.  Be it man or woman, done with body, objects, or mind.  Someone attempted to mind rape me once, but I mind kicked his ass.  I know this sounds like a joke, but I am serious.   it's just that you got used to it.  If you left for a few days and came back, you would smell it again.   I had the same thing happen with a vaccum cleaner that smelled like cat.  I spraed a Hawaian febreeze in it, and it never stopped smelling like a sickly sweet refuse.   Fruity febreeze is just bad period. Now there is a febreeze that smells like laundry detergent; that one is good on anything.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/23/dexter-finale_n_3975538.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular   I also thought Vogel would be the villan, because she was manipulative and appeared to be using Dexter as her next gimick.   That "flat, dull, unrelatable" ness is also how I perceived Hannah when she first appeared.  Bringing her back in this season, as Dexter's supposed "true love," and having him leave Harrison with her, was just completely wrong.  Hannah had proved herself to be dangerous and untrustworthy.  Not just with the poisoning, but she was also obviously ill prepared to raise a child.  It feels like that story line was thrown in as a means of slashing all of the other loose ends and wrapping it up.  As far as the other characters are concerned, most of them were fabricated for the show; based on what you said, you'd probabl appreciate the books better.  I have yet to read them myself, but I hear that they are much darker, and that Deb dies in the first one, and Dexter keeps Brian alive.  The ending is completely illogical.  "I don't have a life in Miami anymore, and I'm depressed about Deb.  I could go overseas and be with my girlfriend and son, and have a fulfilling future, but I'm afraid I'll screw it up, so I'll just abandon them and rot in this cabin."  Like I said before, it feels like they rushed to tie it together.  They definitely did not stay true to the series or its characters.   A lot, frankly, but I want to focus on the last few episodes.  He made so many little mistakes that had huge consequences, because he started thinking with his heart more than his head, both of which are flawed to begin with.  The ending would have worked out so much better if...  ...he let Hannah leave in that helicopter; he could have taken care of Daniel Vogel, and then decided, with a clearer head, if he really wanted to follow her, and once the heat died down, he would be free and clear to move on and have a life.  Debra would likely have lived as well, if Dexter was focused on Vogel (Saxon) and not distracted by being with Hannah and protecting her; he would have dealt with him sooner and Dr. Vogel could have lived also.  This one is not exactly Dexter's mistake, but had Hannah walked over and stopped Harrison from using the treadmill instead of just telling him and expecting him to listen, she would not have been seen with him at the ER and identified to the marshall.  If Dexter had not told Batista that he was leaving as early as he did, the marshall would have left Miami, as he had been about to do, and then he would not have heard about Dexter leaving and suspected that he was harboring Hannah.  Had Debra thought to move Hannah's purse out of sight before opening the door for the marshall, that would be one less suspison.  Had Dexter killed Saxon while he had him strapped down, Debra would be alive.  Once all of those poor choices were made, and Hannah had sedated the marshall and escaped, Dexter had no options.  The marshall would awake, and he had seen with his own eyes that Hannah was with Harrison, so Dexter would go down at the very least, as an accomplice.  Debra as dead; even if he could escape, he had very little will to do so.  I would have thought he'd want to live and be there for Harrison, but from the moment he brought Deb onto the Slice of Life, I suspected he wanted to kill himself. I'm glad that it didn't end on that variation of him riding into the sunset (in this case, hurricane), but him being alive, and his son and love being out there somewhere, is probably much worse.  Also, do you think Dexter the lumberjack (or lumber-yard-worker) is a killer, or just some empty shell wasting away?   it is also partially b/c of him that the confrontation after Hank's death went so badly; he added more and more heat to the situation.   good to know that there are professionals who are paid serious money and devote years of study to miniscule household pests.   not sure how specifically studying albino flies would benefit humans, but I guess people can get paid to study anything.  How do you land a job like that? "Hey, I was wondering how the genes that make fruit flies albino affect their healing." "Here's a grant, and some more money; go do tests to find out."   this happens regularly in my house.  enough said  	41
    This whole "neckbeard" thing seems to be a growing trend. Are they trying grooming their facial hair to look like this, or is it actually their best effort to grow facial hair?

 Why zero research skills? I'm looking for the stuff that is not easily found. Yea I've typed in "best beaches San Diego" in Google, but I'm looking for the local specialties.   Oh yea, I'm completely aware. I plan on attending all law networking events available. Are you in the law industry? Do you have any specific suggestions for getting a leg up?   Thanks for the laugh. I'm sure I'll hear them 1000 more times. +1   Hey guys, me and my girlfriend just moved to the area from Texas. We are both attending law school. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on pretty much everything: beaches to visit, clubs to see downtown, restaurants to eat at, and anything else you can think of. Thank you in advance, sorry to invade.   Even better there's a computer program that can draw districts in the "shortest spitline." It is completely unbiased and draws it where the amount of people fit in the lines.   Call up the contact from that website again and say you never signed a lease and request that the website requests proof of a signed lease and if none is provided then it be removed from your history. If you pay a lawyer a small fee, they will probably write it for you which will be a lot scarier for this website and likely make them more responsive.   Just in case adoptive kids read this part and see "chose not to abandon me when that would have been the easy choice," I would like to point out that many families who choose to adopt out their children are making the choice to do so to give the kid a better life, and simply don't have the solid family structure you were blessed to have. Most adoptive parents see it as their suffering for the betterment of the child.   www.bigwords.com and type in all your ISBN numbers, then click to include international editions.

So still don't go to a low ranked law school and if you go to a high ranked school make sure you go with a big scholarship. This is the same advice you would have been given in 2011. Would anyone here have told a student not to attend a top 30 school with a big scholarship even then?   TJ Grant   Go check out the discussion over on /r/MMA, this very thing happened yesterday with a male fighter finding his girlfriend in bed with another guy. Complete opposite reactions.   I'm sure most of the people here don't follow the sport mixed martial arts but just to fill everyone in, there is a fighter named War Machine (real name), who is dating a porn star and he reportedly beat her after finding her in bed with another guy. Over on /r/MMA, there has been lots of discussion of this and the consensus is it's wrong no matter what he found her doing. Anyway I just wanted to point out that the double standards are pretty sickening.   I would offer no more than 20%. I realize that is drastically different than what you were thinking, but realize that your friend is only bringing the good credit. That's nothing. You could find that with a Craigslist ad coupled with an attorney written contract giving you all the rights to revenue, and I assure you many people with only credit would take that.   Just curious, but what's the split?   George RR Martin is pretty unhealthy and will probably die before he finishes Game of Thrones.   Agreed. Let's look at 2 other scenarios: 1) Someone wants to frame him. If they wanted to frame him for cheating there are a hell of a lot better ways to do it than setting up profiles with his picture and fake names and minimal info (which is what he says is on the accounts) then just HOPING that his wife or one of her friends finds the accounts and rats him out. 2) It's some guy who thinks OP is of godly looks and is using his profile to pull in chicks. In this case, they got his pictures off FB. OK Cupid and such are LOCAL websites. What are the odds that this random dude using his random pictures would set up profiles within his same exact 50 mile radius.  On the other hand, if he wants to cheat while out of town on business, he would probably be setting up profiles in those cities, not his own. And it is possible that the wife's friend who "found out" set them up if she has a personal vendetta against OP. Or even that one of OP's friends set up the profile with his picture and is using it to bait in girls. I just think these are less likely than OP being a cheater.  Honestly, I have no idea, but I'm leaning more towards the fact that this post is just to get ideas for a cover up.   I just realized how much Zach Braff will look like Ray Romano in 20 years.   Whatever you're comfortable with. Extremely risky: 15%, average risk: 7%, super safe: 5% as examples.   Wouldn't it be even smarter then to make your whole ad 5 seconds long then just black screen the rest of the time? Then the person sees your whole ad but and will always skip after its over and you never have to pay.   Define the odd phone calls.  As for reserving a room, she was heading to the mountains, of course she is reserving a room. She's not gonna party out in the woods.   Why not just wait another few months until Aldo is ready and do Edgar/Swanson in the meantime for #1 contender?   You know it always really bugs me that they never count Aldo's defenses from WEC in there. I mean the WEC FW division became the UFC FW division and was seen as the premier place for FW's even when it was the WEC. They should say Zuffa belt defenses, or even UFC/WEC belt defenses, not just UFC belt defenses.  Aldo has held the belt longer than Jones and had more defenses. Granted the competition hasn't been up to par with Jones' but people always cite stats like these to show why Aldo is above Jones in P4P rankings.   Although I completely disagree with charging anyone for any crime here, if they insist on charging the underage boy shouldn't they also charge the underage girl with possession and manufacturing of child pornography especially since she started it?   I mean that one sounds pretty straightforward, no?  Theory: Girl invited to party, empties bank account b/c she's an irresponsible college undergrad, buys alcohol b/c of same reason, drinks on the way up, hits snow b/c drunk, tells person not to call police b/c she was drunk driving, then hitchhikes with the wrong person and gets murdered.  I mean they found red stains that they assume are from red wine. Of course she didn't want police called after she crashed while drinking and driving.   If it is truly valued at $200K now and $220K with $15K worth of work, but I doubt it. It's much more likely that $20K worth of work will cause it to sell for $220K. The market is very good at being efficient. I am a former real estate agent and my suggestion would be to sell it as-is, unless all other condos in the area are selling with improvements, and yours is not, then act accordingly.   "Proceed."   Exactly, Nader can warn all he wants against Clinton but I'd rather have Clinton than abortion made illegal again, no chance for gay marriage, no chance for further healthcare reform, less investment in green energy, and no minimum wage reform.   What country, or if in the US what industry?   Dana has routinely paid both guys if there is a last minute cancellation.   That's actually still not entrapment. The law defines entrapment as a police officer convincing a citizen to commit a crime they would not have otherwise committed AND that a reasonable person would not commit.  An example of actual entrapment: A police officer runs up to a person on the street yelling they have just been poisoned and there is an antidote in that store, but the store is closed and he must break a window and take the antidote. The citizen is arrested after he breaks in and steals the antidote.  A reasonable person would steal the antidote, but not buy crack even after being harassed.   Just read the whole story and watched your trailer. It looks really cool! Where will you be posting it? Like which subreddit?   These people probably shouldn't be driving...   Yea this was baffling. The dad disputes the kid did anything wrong then grounds him? Sounds like he's taking out his anger over getting arrested on the kid.   How did the dad support multiple kids with a job a McDonalds is the real question?   Technically, it means she would potentially sleep with any guy with a girlfriend, her boyfriend included, but not exclusively.   Yeeeesh that was brutal. The most interesting part by far was the fact that SPOILER ALERT: the guy's wants to kill himself after the accident and everybody's saying let him kill himself if he wants to die and is in that much pain, then he goes on to make a fantastic recovery with wife, kids, and attend law school.   Life and Death Decisions  Awesome teacher, awesome class, super interesting. Extremely informative. Easy tests. Opt out of the final. Man I could go on and on about that class.  Edit: And no presentation or speeches.   Incoming 1L taking this advice to heart right now. I appreciate the sacrifice.   If many people in the company are entitled to it then I think your best bet would be for you guys to all meet together with a lawyer and outline the story and see if you have a case.  Other posters are right, $400 for one person isn't worth a lawsuit, but for 20+ people, it is more reasonable.  Most of the time, a simple letter from a lawyer would be enough to scare the company into complying.   Hi.  I'll preface this with the fact that I'm not an excon and I only subscribed to this sub because I'm interested. However I am a undergraduate who is heading into a graduate program this Fall so I know things from that side a tiny bit.  I have been in the legal system for minor charges, some of which I pleaded not guilty and they dropped immediately after and one of which I went to court and was proven not guilty by a jury.  It was a minor charge that I beat in court and I was 100% guilty of it, and I was a 19 year old pompous kid, but it was a misdemeanor Minor in Possession charge so I don't feel too bad for misrepresenting some stuff.  The major fact I took away was, it's not what is true, it's what appears true. Like that Training Day quote where Denzel talks about "It's what you can prove."  Well, what I'm getting from your case is that there is little "proof" on either side. Do the discovery, find out what they have on you. Also did you take pictures or any proof of your injuries?  Now you go up on the stand, look as innocent as possible, seem exasperated and just be emotional and work in to the jury that you just don't want to go to jail for something you didn't do and the other damage it's had on your life. SEEM innocent.  After it's over 1 of 2 things will happen: Not Guilty, you walk away learning a valuable lesson or Guilty and you go to jail most likely and when you get out, you talk to any employers and tell them the full story and hope one of them believes your story. Now let me tell you what you get if you just plead Guilty. Most likely, employers will not believe if you tell them you are not really guilty but plead guilty because you were scared. Unless they are in the position, it's almost impossible for people to comprehend that people will plead guilty to a crime they did not commit. Again this is all just my opinion and you are free to do whatever you want.  Also, I don't know about you, but for me I would not be able to plead guilty purely based on principle. I would rather do a year I got sentenced to after a full trial than 6 months I plead guilty to.  I would like to add one last note that I am not a typical poster here and I have never been to jail/prison so I am likely talking out of my ass when I say I would rather do the year I didn't earn than the 6 months I condemned myself to, but this is all just an opinion for you to take into account and decide for yourself.  In any case, good luck man. I sincerely hope you the truth prevails.   Can you stop downvoting me just because you disagree?  And that's not a response. You're just dodging the question but whatever fine.   Just to be clear: you are saying you don't think he needs even a few thousand though in case his car breaks down or there is a medical emergency, because that is what I advocated for and you seemed to disagree. Is that right?   It would be naive to think his expense are $0. He obviously pays for lunch, most likely his gas and probably insurance, entertainment, etc.  He should obviously have money for the loan payments and/or a car breaking down AT THE MINIMUM. Are you advocating he have no emergency fund because we assume his parents can/would help him?   I disagree. I think 6 months of whatever his expenses may be is appropriate. If that is only food, gas, phone and insurance then I think he should save 6 months of that, which would only presumably be around $3500 or so. And everyone wants an emergency fund that size if for example their car breaks down or something of that nature.   I'm sure even you miss a line here and there when casually browsing reddit. Or no?   Just remember:  1) Make a budget 2) Emergency fund with 6 months expenses 3) EMERGENCY FUND WITH 6 MONTHS EXPENSES 4) Put all excess in student loans   So highly paid, elite athletes get paid more?   When they wrote "his address" in the article, those words were hyperlinked to his actual address.   Used to watch every UFC, the whole card through, every pre and post press conference, watch every interview, and even watch the 2nd tier promotions (DREAM, Strikeforce, etc) but now I watch only the main cards of some of the UFCs, not really the TUF Finales or anything like that.   Just to piggyback on the top comment, even if a drug with euphoric effects was created that didn't have any physical adverse effects, it would still have mental adverse effects.  Imagine a drug that produces a high and you never have to worry about ODing or having a hangover or any other health effects. Would you take it every day? Would you spend your last dollar on it instead of eating some days? Would you steal in order to get money for it?   It's better than the previous status quo. Pre-existing conditions and no medicare just because you don't have a kid, not to mention lifetime caps and being dropped by your insurance if you develop a condition.   More like pacman.   The salesman thing lines up with what others said in the other thread. Have him attempt to get a job at a home improvement store. As said in the other thread they like to hire older people and he has sales experience and they can teach him the tools part.   I don't understand how the judge could possibly deny the biological father the right to be named on the birth certificate.  I feel like that happens all the time in cases of straight couples using surrogacy.   They put their sperm with an egg of a donor woman, then implanted that fertilized egg in a 3rd woman.  Also, why do you not support it?   I'm pretty sure it's going to depend on the dynamics of the child with the parents. If the child is indifferent towards the dad but close to the mom, and the dad has full time custody then the child will be unhappy and vice versa.  My parents had 50/50 custody when I was in elementary school and it was the absolute worst. Literally every day I was asking who would pick me up and occasionally the parent who was supposed to pick me up would forget.  The only thing I can say for sure that if this is studied, 50/50 is most likely to be the worst.   Agreed. I think he could have beaten Texiera if he had his head in the game. He just got to overconfident, just like against Lyoto. Although I do think he would have lost to Lyoto even if he hadn't rushed in.   The Keith Jardine fight?  I don't recall them being legal, are you sure?  Edit: 1:30 mark http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hl475QNxCM Definitely illegal.   PS3 reporting in. Not gonna spend $400 just to spend $60 as much as I want to play this game.   staph, just FYI   No, nothing has changed. Can you provide a video or rough time period in a fight where an upkick that connected to the head of a down opponent was no called by a ref?   Hey, so you seem to have it down pretty well. But I have one last suggestion. Do your parents have bad credit at all?  If they apply for a PLUS loan and get denied, you are able to take additional unsubsidized Stafford loans in your own name only, and at a good interest rate (comparatively to private loans).  If not, then just go private loans with your parents as cosigners.   That was $12K each year. The guy has 2 years left, he should be able to take a break for 2 years before working the rest of his life.   Hey guys, I was one of the redditors who helped Tim Kennedy do his AMA.  Just FYI, he said they have about 30 fighters ready for DLC content and are just gonna be adding fighters as they go.   I'm not sure if /u/Mr_asdfghjkl was implying it was a bitch move because of the circumstances or just in general but I'll throw out my thoughts.  I would like to see soccer kicks/stomps legalized but it was still a bitch move because it was illegal, and the other guy knew it was. If it was legal, it wouldn't be a bitch move.   The Sims and GTA5  I want to lead a normal family life with a job as an accountant, then go out and rob banks with my crew on weekends.   There are 7 different last names in his list of grandparents, parents, and children.   You think Republicans will have a 2/3 majority in the House AND Senate? You're wrong.   I was the other guy who helped with the AMA at Tim's house. I asked for a pic and he immediately asked for a leg kick at "about a 7 or an 8" out of 10. Looked like it hurt.   Because Dems have the Senate and nothing Democrats really really hate would ever get through the Senate and thus he would never be able to veto it. Trust me, if they start passing stuff that the Dems don't want, he will veto it.   Still won't matter. Obama will veto anything that makes it through and R's don't have 2/3 majority in House and Senate.   Dude had some hilarious answers for his AMA. I was cracking up typing some of them.   Hey guys I was one of the guys he chose to help with his AMA just cause I live in Austin. He was a really cool dude! Me and the other guy just helped type up responses while he dictated, but we typed it word for word. He gave us each a signed glove and we got to see his dogs and meet his wife. He seems really down to earth. I got a pic with him, and the other guy asked Tim to give him a leg kick (there was a video, I'll let him post it if he wants).   The Republican nominee and Democratic nominee for this race are both teachers at the same college.   Out of the 6 people living in that house, 5 are unclassy and you are alright with 1.   I'm gonna be working there tomorrow from 7-7!  I get to serve the athletes and their families food.   I just saw the first showing of this movie today, opening day, and WOW it was a really great movie. Not what I expected. Tom Cruise actually played a type of character I had never seen him as before.  He wasn't the futuristic guy from Oblivion, nor the super-agent type from that one movie with Cameron Diaz. Cruise was scared, unsure of himself and a refreshingly great character. The movie itself shattered all of my expectations, which weren't great as I didn't expect much and went on student discount Thursday night as I didn't think it was worth full price, but oh how wrong I was.  Also, the comedy, my god I was laughing out loud at many parts in the movie and you will too.  Seriously go see it and thank me later.  Sidenote: There's another disaster movie coming out in a very 2012-ish vein and it looks even worse.

Edit: Came in right when the slave dude is in some basement looking thing and said "She will protect us."   I have loans from undergrad: subsidized govt, unsubsidized govt and unsub private. Will the subsidized ones continue to be subsidized while I am in grad school (law school) as long as I am full time?  I am going straight from undergrad to law school. Do I have to notify any of the loan servicers (even the private ones) that I will still be in school or will they be automatically notified so that my payment period does not start?         All my acceptances are starting to come in and while I have a great GPA, I only did decently on the LSAT and I'm looking at going to a lower-ish ranked school.  My question is: While looking at the ABA profiles of schools, I noticed some have really high attrition rates. They break it down by "Academic" and "Other" but also have Transfers Out. Are transfers out counted in attrition rates? If so, which category? Does Academic mean failed out or does Other? I searched google and the ABA website and could not find the answers to these questions.  I know it is generally frowned upon for 0L's to post here, but I think this question can help a lot of others. Thanks for taking the time.      Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place. Perhaps I could be directed to the correct place if this is not the right subreddit.  Here's my problem. Yesterday, all at once, the clock stopped working in my car (the little LED one that is right next to the temperature display, which still works), the remote that locks/unlocks the car no longer works, the trunk button in the car does not open the trunk, and when I turn my car off, usually I can still close the windows, but now I have to have the car on to close the windows.  I've checked all fuses. I've check the battery. Everything is good. The car is a 1998 Toyota Avalon.  Perhaps one of you more knowledgeable folks might point me in the right direction? I don't know much about cars and any help in appreciated.         I'm just confused, because California could have just put up a shitty defense, then the losing side would appeal up to the SCOTUS and they would be FORCED to make a decision. By striking down DOMA, we can ascertain that the Court clearly have the votes in favor of marriage equality.      Hey /r/MMA, so I'm in summer courses majoring in economics and currently taking an upper division Economics Statistics course. Well, my teacher assigned us a project (I only have a brief overview of it now, will have exact details of it tomorrow) to do a numerical statistics analysis on discrete numerical data in which our sample size is over 30. She specifically said we could do it in sports. Obviously as a huge MMA fan, I'd like to do mine in MMA.  So I'm looking for everyone's input on some cool statistics I could analyze and I will of course share the full results of the project with everyone here so that could be cool right?  To cover a quick few things: 1. it has to be numerical, not categorical so I cannot do things such as types of finishes; 2. it has to be discrete meaning a specific number (ex. # of strikes per round, not weight of each fighter- which fluctuates); 3. sample size has to be over 30 so if I'm analyzing one person's fights it has to be someone with more than 30 of them, but I could analyze all champions fights;  4. I don't want this to be a comparison across weight classes where there are already many predictable patterns; 5. don't pitch an idea that is insanely hard such as analyzing every single fighter in the UFC for the past 10 years; 6. keep in mind I can also analyze #'s that aren't takedowns, strikes, etc. such as viewers for shows, salaries and more.   Thanks! And I look forward to sharing the project with you guys!   Not sure if this is the right sub but.... I'm looking at law schools and when I see them according to US News, it show's the average indebtedness at graduation for each school. My question is: does this include undergraduate debt as well?  The definition provided on the website states: "Average indebtedness of 2012 graduates who incurred law school debt." As you can see, this does not clear up my issue. So if anyone with any insight can help, I'd be thankful.   Hi, I am a student and subleased my apartment for the summer. Over Craigslist, I met a Law Student (ironically) who agreed to sublease my room. He moved in and lived there from the 12 until 25th of May (today) and when rent was due, he sent me a text saying he has moved out. He said I could keep the deposit and left a $100 check for utilities from the time he lived there (it was only like $40). I immediately texted back asking if he could call to discuss it. He responded, declining.  I went to the apartment and found the check as well as him completely moved out. My question is, do I have legal recourse as he signed a lease in which I explicitly outline the deposit, rent amount, move in and move out dates, and he signed and sent a copy of his drivers license? He signed this agreement and I have emails from his official .edu email address in which he signs his full name and has his schools listed at the bottom. I also have texts confirming his move in date and confirmation that the lease was signed.  A friend told me that I could possibly be out of luck as I did not get the contract notarized. Is this true or does it simply decrease my chances of winning a judgement from him, considering I have the emails, texts, drivers license, and signed contract (signed by both of us)?  I live in Texas, and the reason he cited for moving out was originally that the hot water and dishwasher don't work (they do) and when I called him out on that he said the place wasn't clean (it was reasonably vacuumed, swept, and counters wiped when he moved in). He is now not responding to any texts of mine in which I ask him to call me. I have not threatened the lawsuit yet, but I plan on filing in small claims court as of Tuesday (Monday is a holiday).  Thank you all for your time and help.      ***Hi guys, I am an American student taking Danish here in Texas. I know lots of you have helped me before editing my papers and I want to thank you guys. I am now on my very last paper for Danish, and after this I just take the oral exam and written final exam and I am done with my Danish studies. I want to thank this subreddit as a whole for helping me learn Danish, and a special thanks to /u/Neovitami and /u/Solgudinde who have helped edit many of my papers. I just didn't want to keep burdening them, so I come to you all for my last paper.  The topic for this paper is about a vacation we want to go on. I went away from the topic a bit and wrote about an adventure I wish to have. If you just edit it by bolding my mistakes (spelling and grammar) I would be very thankful.***   Den ferie jeg nsker, er at bestige Mount Everest. Det ligger i Nepal. Det har vret min drm lige siden jeg var lille til st p toppen af verden. Jeg har planlagt denne ferie i lang tid, og det bliver meget spndende, nr jeg har penge til at tage. Jeg bliver ndt til spare op masser og masser af penge, fr jeg kan rejser der. Og s jeg bliver ndt til finde en guide, der vil hjlpe med at guide mig op bjerget. Jeg bliver ogs ndt til at trne.

I am looking for someone to proofread my paper for grammar and spelling mistakes. I would be MUCH appreciated if you read it over and just bold any mistakes and their corrections. Thank you so so much for your help!*    Jeg har boet i Austin hele mit liv. Byen er vokset meget siden jeg blev fdt her. Jeg elsker Austin. Jeg tror, det er den bedste by i verden. Den har alle fordelene ved at bo i Texas, men det er meget forskelligt fra andre byer i Texas. Austin er stor nok, at det er interessant, men lille nok til at det er let at kre fra den ene ende til den anden hurtigt. Austin er den mest unikke by jeg har hver besgt, og jeg er stolt af at bo her.  Jeg elsker Austin, fordi der er altid noget at gre. Der er masser af butikker for at kbe ting i. I Austin, kan du tage vandreture p Greenbelt. Eller du kan sejle p sen. Eller du kan kre rundt sporet p Town Lake. Der er ogs mange steder fantastisk til datoer. Du kan tage til Mount Bonnell og se solnedgangen. Eller du kan fodre nderne i Zilker Park. Hvis du nsker at feste, er der masser af barer p 6th street. Der er ogs masser af levende musik i barer og klubber. En anden aktivitet at gre, er at besge det Texas State Capitol og lre alt om historien af Texas.  Jeg elsker ogs at i Austin, der er masser af aktiviteter at gre p ferie. I marts kan du se live musik og film p South By Southwest festival. I marts kan du ogs flyve med drager p Austin Kite Festival. I juli kan du se fyrvrkeri p Town Lake for 4. juli fester. I september kan du tage til Zilker Park og deltage Austin City Limits, en kmpe musikfestival. I december kan du tage p Trail of Lights og se masser af juledekorationer.  Og sidst, har vi det bedste universitet i hele Texas, University of Texas, hvor du kan lre noget, selv dansk!   This happened about 4-5 hours ago. So here it is, several days after Valentines day and I'm walking on my college campus with my girlfriend to go pick up a package her mom had sent her containing lots of Valentines day candy and such.  Well we pick up the package and walk about 20 feet when out of NOWHERE a tall skinny kid about 18-20 years old comes running and grabs the package from my hands. But here's the thing, **he's maniacally laughing the entire time.** First thought that entered my mind is I'm trying to see if I know the kid from class or a club or something, nope. Quick glance to my girlfriend next to me says she doesn't know him either.  So then after about 20 seconds of trying to grab the package, he rips it open and candy goes flying everywhere. At this point, we are in the middle of the hallway in one of the busiest buildings on campus. The kid starts trying to wrestle me. Sweet. I trained in MMA for about a year, so I know some stuff. I immediately go for a trip takedown, and when he puts his hands on the floor to stand up, I sink in a rear naked choke. First  I'm not squeezing that hard, but then I get pissed thinking how much of a pain he caused me. By the way, I'm borderline sick today and the only reason I even went to school was because I had a huge test. Add this to the fact that I'm lugging around a 30 pound backpack with books, binders and laptop, and you could see why I'm pissed when someone tries this crap on me. So here I am, applying the choke, and all these college kids (about 30 or so) have formed a big circle around me and a bunch of girls start screaming that I'm gonna kill him, and I can tell I'm about to put him to sleep, so I loosen the choke.  Oh and I've got my 30 pound backpack on this whole time. I guess here is where I should mention that I'm about 5'7 and 130 pounds and this kid is about 6'0 and 200 pounds. Needless to say he's got some size on me. So I've loosened the choke, but I'm still holding it firm but not squeezing at all. The kids starts grabbing my hair and just pulling the crap out of it. The girls are still yelling that I'm gonna kill this kid. So I start arguing with them, telling them he's gonna run if I let him go. They keep screaming at me. Fine. I let go, and hold firm around his waist. He stands up and starts dragging me, while standing, trying to run away. I implore any bystanders to help, and these two big-ish guys help me hold him there.  Finally, an employee of the college shows up and informs us that the police are on their way, but he can't touch the kid. So this kid is still dragging the 3 of us around and we're trying to hold him. Finally, we agree that we'll put him on the ground. So we ground the kid and he just starts unloading punches at me, mostly top of the head, but some hit me in the jaw (which is now sore and slightly swollen). College employee jumps in and helps us hold him down til police get there.  They take, my, my girlfriend's and some other witness statements. At this point I hear a bystander mention that they know the kid and he's mentally ill. Crap, I should have realized earlier. Now the police pull me aside and start grilling me, asking me if I thought the kid was an imminent threat to me and actively trying to harm me. I point to the fact that he punched me in the head several times. Then the officer informs me that I could be arrested for applying "deadly force" in the form of the choke, which is a felony. Pshhh, I tell him, that's complete BS, dude tried to rob me.  So it ends with me telling the police that yes I'd like to press charges for assault and attempted robbery. And the police informing me that they will contact me and the kid may try to press assault charges on me. By the way, before someone complains, I'm only pressing charges because clearly this kid is either off his meds or on the wrong ones and they need to be adjusted. If his doctor informs me that they have fixed the medication and he is indeed taking them, and I get an apology from the kid, I will gladly drop the charges against him.  **tl;dr: Kid tries to rob me, I choke him, he punches me, whoops he's mentally ill, cops come and tell me I might be arrested for a felony in the near future; ALL LEGAL ADVICE WELCOME**   On my last paper I got a bad grade because my grammar was bad. Would anyone be willing to proofread my paper for mistakes?  Here is the paper:  Jeg s det program hedder Horisont: Liv og dd. Det var i fjernsynet p sndag, klokken 21:55. Det er 24 minutter langt.  Filmen handler om abort i Irland. Demonstranter der gr ind for abort er vist. Nogle kvinder er vist, som gr ind for valg. De nsker abort rettigheder, fordi der nu er ingen rettigheder for de kvinder til abort. Der er kun rettigheder for fosteret. Reporter interviewer en mand. Manden siger, at hans kone havde graviditet komplikationer. Manden siger, at lgen fortalt ham graviditeten var en spontan abort. S en lge interviewes hvem siger, at irsk lov siger, at lgen ikke kan abort et foster, hvis mors liv ikke er i fare. S interviewe manden, der siger deres lge fortalte ham, at de ikke kan abort fosteret, fordi det er live.  Reporter interviewer en kvinde, der er en anti-abort demonstrant. Kvinden mener deres protester beskytte ufdte fostre. Et fjernsyn interview er vist med republikansk senator Todd Akin. Senatoren siger, at han tror, hvis en kvinde er voldtaget, hendes krop vil aborterer fosteret.  Reporteren er vist interviewe en anonym irsk kvinde. Kvinden siger, at hun tog til England for at f en abort. Kvinden siger, at for hende turen var god.  Reporteren viser os et sted, hvor forldre, der ikke nsker deres brn kan opgive dem. Stedet har mange anti-abort plakater. Katolske nonner administrere stedet. Nonnerne stte brnene op til vedtagelse.  Et interview med en pro-choice kvinde vises. Hun siger, at regeringen i Irland gr love for abort og anti-abort love ogs. Regeringen fortstter med at forbyde abort, selv med mange protester mod abort love. Lge Peter Boylan siger, at han tror Irland skulle debat abort nu. Han siger, at for 20 r siden, ville regeringen ikke lytte, men nu regeringen skal lytte.  Filmen slutter med at vise den mand, hvis kone dde, fordi lgen ngtede at gre en abort. Filmen er meget trist og flelsesmssige, og sger at ndre betragterens sind, hvis de er anti-abort.    Just watching his interview (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/5/3734168/rory-macdonald-plans-on-annihilating-hurting-and-destroying-b-j-penn) and the UFC on Fox 5 pre-fight press conference (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/6/3732750/ufc-on-fox-5-press-conference-video) I can't help but get the feeling that Rory has the demeanor of Fedor except that Fedor actually smiles, and Rory is just... cold. I absolutely love his attitude and sincerely hopes he takes over at WW soon.      So I know it causes uninhibited growth which forms tumors, but how do the tumors kill you? Do they get large enough to block blood flow or what?   The limit represents the derivative of some function f at some number a. State such an f and a.  lim as h approaches 0  (fourth root(16 + h) - 2)/h    My answer: I got that a is 2, but I can't for the life of me get f.   So my internet is fine for everything but videos. On youtube, you know how it loads only the next 30 seconds until you press play, then continues loading? Well over that entire 30 seconds it maybe loads another 5 seconds, so I have to watch that 35 seconds, then sit there for another 2 minutes while it loads the next 30 seconds.  As you can imagine this gets pretty painful. But the kicker is I know its only my computer. My roommate's laptop loads the exact same videos fine with no pauses and we are both getting wireless off the same router.  So maybe, just maybe someone knows some easy fix to make my internet go faster or how to make youtube load the whole videos?  Additional info: I have Webroot and Malwarebytes and they both run clean scans so I'm pretty sure its not spyware slowing it down.  Edit: I'm on a Toshiba Satellite A305 laptop and am running Windows Vista if that helps anything  Thanks so much in advance for your help!   And I don't mean the historical explanation. I mean the "hey that actually makes sense" explanation. Seriously, our 12 hour blocks go from 12,1,2...11 It just makes no sense to me. Like maybe if it went from 12,11,10,9...1 then ok I get it, it's going backwards, but this go 11 numbers back then start increasing by 1 thing makes no sense to me.  And no I'm not high, I just finished my college semester and have 3 weeks to sit around before Summer classes start so I've been contemplating a lot of boring things.  	104

Check us out http://facebook.com/fullertonpike   People request to use our stuff all the time! Feel free to check it out!   Its a good lesson for all our boys. Take it in stride and be humble...that's the attitude that got us our Smythe!   They hate us because we are a top house at our school. It's pretty funny.   We got a lot of positive feedback, even from our rival chapter! We still get the hate but, hell, with enough Yaks you might see a second video.   The reaction has been incredibly positive by all sorority women as well as our rival fraternity on campus! It's a good idea, just make sure it's executed well!

Feel free to throw it in your playlist for when you're play Shaco!       Hi, Foxdrop. I'm a Shaco main, and seeing your opinion in the comments about how Shaco will receive an implied buff to his early counter jungling is very nice to see.  My question is, what, in your opinion, would you say is the best jungle item to build for Shaco? At first glance I thought it would be the one that marks an enemy, but I'm not sure if that would break his stealth, which removes his crit damage.     	4

 A tick killed my grandpa. Lyme disease is serious shit too.    I use brown sugar with alba coconut milk face wash to make my own scrub. Works wonders.    Uh, really??   Exactly. They pop off here just like there - only here it's usually a suicide shooter rather than a suicide bomber. Between stranger massacres and the nuts who shoot their families, we have our own terrorism in the US - nearly Always Christian.                      **repeat ad nauseam**  Fucking Stop This Madness. #notonemore   * mandatory background checks for ALL GUN SALES * mandatory registration and annnual inspection of all guns to ensure they are kept safe and secured away from children * hold gun owners accountable when their gun is used in a shooting; where did today's student get the gun? HOLD THAT PERSON RESPONSIBLE.  Cue the trailer trash yelling about the gub'mint in 5..4..3..2...   Arrest whoever owns the gun that the killer used. Until we do this, it will continue as an epidemic. **HOLD THESE FUCKERS ACCOUNTABLE.**    * Register all guns.  * Annual license renewals.  * Annual gun inspections.  * Mandatory laws about locking up unloaded weapons separate from ammo.             OP is clearly lucky.       Hope so. After that shit at the Georgia courthouse you have to wonder, is this a bunch of insane hillbillies popping off day after day? If so, please fucking take their guns. This is bullshit. Killing cops and shoppers?? This is terrorism.    This is the tea bag revolution isn't it? Shoot law enforcement and regular folks because we have a black president?    Lax guns laws in neighboring states are the problem.    The gun lobby is a powerful lobby.    Editing is such a crucial part of any creative process.    It's never too late with CSS!   Also known as  *why you hire a creative consultant*   They always have a gun.       Guns should be available at hinting and shooting ranges for use on the premed is. Aside from that we need tightly regulated ownership of guns with annual inspection and re-registration to ensure storage is secure and safe. This has gone past epidemic to daily terrorism. #notonemore               Seemed like an awful lot of detail in that article for it not to have been tried yet - discussion and questions by the girls during questioning? I am not sure I've ever seen that before.    Agree with you. I don't understand the concept of having a law that starts at a given age (18), and then based on the crime, changing the law to fit the crime. What the fuck is up with that?                     The average Midwest redneck does, too.    I've long pondered whether those folks really exist in the wild, or if they're simply the paid talking heads who mock responsible, Eco-conservative people as minions of their corporate masters (oil/ coal/fracking). It's fairly obvious they are; these are the same character-lacking folks who, for a paycheck, would've sold out their brother-in-law to the SS. Or done any dirty work for any dirty master. They're terrorists when you consider that their "side" is pro-pollution and anti-environment. They are the enemy of humanity.    No. The folks who do that are the dregs of society. Historically speaking they're nothing. Their paycheck today only shows they're successful whores. Not successes.    Suspicious Pimple? ...Freakin'!   Bedeviled.    No, I live next to a Native American named Random Words.    Mota FTW!    Grandpa eats mushrooms.  He's a fungi.    Jdate: go on a date, smoke a jay. Should be called THCdate.

Yep, she'll clean your ears, wax your bottom and smack your forehead.    Helicopter mom is a helicopter.    Downsampla'!   Lost in a grandstand No escape from orange sticky   Absurd. It's not unpopular. It's wrong. Look at Australia. They had a mass shooting. They altered gun regulations. They stopped any future massacres. We've lost thousands this year alone in America to gun terrorism.    That and a registration and regulated gun ownership. When someone is known to be disturbed and dangerous, he should not be able to legally buy firearms and ammo.    No, it doesn't matter if we know the name of the shooter. What matters is that he was known to be totally unbalanced and disturbed, yet was able to legally buy a fuckload of guns and ammo, and then keep those even when cops checked on him after tips that he was going to go off. What the actual fuck? Stop letting crazy people buy and own guns. Period.    Right?? Had the cops been able to reference registered weapons, they'd have been able to seize them once the credible threat of violence had been reported to them. Instead they talked to the psycho and walked away, making it possible for him to assassinate innocent Americans. If we simply had registration similar to vehicle ownership requires, this would enable law enforcement to act appropriately and remove the weapons from the crazy fucks who post threats.    The cops were at a house. He'd been reported as a serious threat. Had we some way to regulate gun ownership like car ownership, those cops would have known he had a fuckload of guns and ammo in the house when they visited. The fact that this isn't the number one issue discussed after this gun terrorism is another bit if proof as to how powerful the weapons dealing NRA is.    What are you on about? The progressives I am familiar with are typically a-theistic and see misogyny where it exists.    It's not the fact that someone voting GOP would not like Obama, it's that by supporting the GOP, they are supporting misogyny, racist policies and bigoted, homophobic policies.    I'm a progressive and I don't think people should accept the over-simplified and incorrect notion that criticizing a culture = racism. Oppression of women is a problem around the globe. Noting it does not make someone a racist. That's a red herring thrown out by actual racists!    Incredibly disheartening. I'm afraid our racist bigots in the US will find allies in these euro nuts.    Not OP but guessing he was relating to the "I'm against the government I now serve within" sentiment. We have many far-right in the US who continually talk shit about government in general, the federal govt in specific, and then run for office within that very government. And then attempt to destroy it as we see with the GOP and the baggers.    In the US we are currently fucked, absolutely fucked, by the far-right so-called-small-government fuckers who are simply whores to lobbyists and corporations. They tell their followers that they are against the federal government, then they do everything they can to help big corporations and fuck over ordinary citizens. The two-face nature is dangerous, as are those who believe it.    It's very disheartening. As an American I incorrectly grant Europe an idealized identity of progressive and intellectual greatness. While it does exist, they have the same religious / racist / bigots we do.    Election turnouts in the US are horrible as well, letting the bigots and racists win here as well. Until people are compelled to vote like in Australia or simply become more responsible and do their citizen duty, I'm not sure how it will get better.    Is there some resurgence if the kkk lately or wtf?    Show some respect.    Sick shit. Hope he gets no votes.    Of course, this is all too familiar: a young aggrieved male, mentally disturbed, threatening othersespecially womenbut still able to get his hands on a high-capacity magazine of the variety used in so many other mass murders. This doesn't happen in any other high income country with the regularity it does here; in fact, it almost never happens in any of them.  But here, in the good ole US of A, weve allowed a group of rich, entitled thugs who run an operation fronting for arms dealersguys who represent a minority position on pretty much every issue having to do with reasonable regulation of firearms even among gun ownersto dictate our policies to cowardly, careerist politicians.  Bingo.    I'm curious why you think so.    There are people whose lives have been beyond devastated, chain reaction fucked up, by the actions of bank fraudsters. It's not surprising people would be this angry. I don't condone the violent approach but I get why someone would.    That's totally my counter top.    It really sounded like he should have been considered an immediate threat to those around him. Would that plus the warnings from his family to the sheriff Not warrant a search and seizure of weapons / loss of the right to have one?   Quote 6 is a huge deal. Why wasn't he searched for weapons if this was a known concern??   Both kids were wealthy, clinically diagnosed to be disturbed, and able to acquire firearms. That's the one link we could break as a society. Stop crazy folks from owning and acquiring firearms. We must.    Where'd he get the gun???   But they don't have the UsA's Lucy goosey lack of gun regulation.    Think harder. It's the fact that the NRA and congress repeatedly block laws that would keep firearms away from people proven to be emotionally disturbed like this fucker.    No, it's the sanest thing he could say. To blame a gun, maybe a stretch. But the reason that certifiable nutters like the shooter can GET guns is the NRA and their beholden in congress. Just fucking make people prove they are not crazy before buying lethal weapons. What is so fucking hard about that concept? Yet the NRA blocks research, encourages insane responses from the fringes of their already-radical members, and fans the flames of these mass shootings. Fuck. How can anyone see this suffering beautiful father, his life FUCKING RUINED by a proven-crazy fucker who's family contacted the sheriff for fucks sake, and who was still, still able to procure a gun!- and argue against blocking crazy folks from buying and owning firearms?   More!^More!^More!^More!   :-()   Larva form of kangaroo = gnarly    All guns but muskets.    Sensationalists? No. Survivors. Once you've been terrorized by a gun fuck, you never forget.    No, it's just gun terrorism.    We do. Except guns. Time to start.    Nobody is going around spraying children with flying knives. However in the US we are sling people daily to gun terrorism. It's a plague we fight, despite trite trolls who claim cars kill people. In reality we license, inspect and keep a log of cars. If your car is stolen we can look up who has ever owned it, and trace via aerial number. That would be a great start to keeping track of the death toys.    Meanwhile in America...

In it there's a page showing the many ways an evil force's power is supposed to be infecting and corrupting the world. One of the images in it was a couple little girls putting their kitten in the microwave and being just about to start it.   Someone had taken a pen and just scribbled out that panel, but you could still see what was happening. It was the only panel they had done that for even though others featured people and other animals being murdered. I was bewildered that apparently someone out there was the kind of person who would react that way to the though of a kitten being killed but would still read overtly horrific comic books and get that far into it.   I've also seen a few Stephen King books with pentagrams drawn in them, but that just seemed like kids messing around.    What motivated you to start your own company?

Last night I went on a walk through the local park. At one point there was a  clearing with a fawn on it. It sprinted away as I approached by the path took a turn so I started to walk away and it stopped when it became obvious I wasn't approach it. Then it started to gallop after me. I thought this was kind of weird so I just sort of yelled "Hey!" when it was only like two feet from me and it stopped. I looked past it and saw that its mother had showed up and was eyeing me. After staring at me walking away a few more seconds, and turned and galloped in another random direction.   I certainly knew better than to touch a wild deer, but is it likely that fawn was going to do anything to me if I hadn't yelled something?

Which of these stories sounds like a more interesting game:   A. Twilight and the others of the Mane Six experiment with a spell Twilight Sparkle found in the archives to make them "more their cutie marks." Instead of making them better at those things, they end up literally turning into those things (Applejack becomes a pony made of apple, Rarity becomes a crystal statue, etc.) Fortunately Twilight had a book of cures on hand if something went wrong.   So the games are really minigames where you try to cure the ponies of their different states, with different levels of difficulty and different reactions from the ponies (i.e. Rainbow Dash could think it's awesome that she's a pony made of rainbow-colored lightning with a mane and tail of cloud and would try to avoid being cured.)    B. The Princesses decide to let the changelings into Equestria under close supervision to bring about peace between the two cultures. The idea seems to be going as well as could be expected at first (like a few changelings can't help but try to pass themselves off as ponies, but they get rooted out quickly.) Then Queen Chrysalis of all ponies reports that there seems to be an epidemic of it happening that she can't control. It's up to the player to get to the bottom of whether the changelings are really innocent, under something else's control, if it can be made to work, etc.   I'm loosely planning that it would be a matter of trivia games to sort out who's real and not and a point-and-click beyond that.

I developed a bad habit in middle school where if someone was busty and had a lot of cleavage on display, I would look off in some other direction or at some arbitrary other thing because otherwise I might stare. This might be a fairly rare reaction I have because I grew up often not looking at people's face when we were talking and neither did my brother, but if it's common, which is more annoying?     I had never hallucinated in my life before this. Ive rarely gone a night without sleep, Ive never had a recreational drug stronger than a cappuccino. Im not ill in anyway that Im aware of. The most severely Ive ever been medicated is when I got prescribed zoloft my freshman year at Pescadero High for about two weeks for mild obsessive compulsive disorder. Believe me, Ive gotten a second and third opinion from psychiatrists and neurologists and theres nothing wrong me. Nothing they can find, anyway.   It was a night three weeks ago. The moon was full enough that places without any street or house lights were dark blue instead of pitch black except for in the shadows when I biked to Moms. I always biked to her place because it helped reinforce the impression that I was trying to get in shape.   The layout between my Mothers place and my apartment is like this: her place, then down main street for a bit, then turn left into the dog park, up the big hill in the dog park, into the apartment complexes, through the smaller park, theres the post office, go along the beach path for a few hundred meters, then Im home.    Everything was unusually pleasant as I started riding from the home and down main street. I remember that I checked for my cell phone only to find it wasnt there. I recalled then that Id left it to recharge in my kitchen then and felt dumb for not taking it with me to recharge at Moms.    When I reached the dog park, I made my usual try at surmounting the hill, but as I said, Im not in shape and about a third of the way up I switched to walking the bicycle up its main trail on my route. That trail is surrounded by thick undergrowth and really pretty underlit, with just a single lamppost lighting it. Out of nowhere I heard growling in the undergrowth. I barely had time to look back and to my left to see a dog come sprinting onto the path. It was a German Sheperd breed and the most furious animal Ive ever seen. Its ears were flat and its fangs were bared and dripping, as if it was attacking out of hunger instead of just anger. It was on me in a second.     I was extremely lucky and apparently the dog was extremely stupid. When it leapt up at me, it got caught on the bike that I had been walking. Its jaw snapped close enough to me that a gob of its saliva landed on my shirt but it didn't injure me. I was just barely able to keep the bike upright so it stayed. Before it had a chance to back up and try for me again, I heard someone yelling "No!" in a scolding tone. A huge guy, at least a foot taller than me, grabbed the dog by the collar and pulled it away. He still seemed to struggle for a few seconds but then the dog sat and just growled and snarled at me.   As I processed what had just happened and then got a hold of myself, I saw that the man that had just gotten the dog under control was just staring at me. No look of worry that his dog had just attacked someone, no apologies, nothing but a blank stare at me as his dog growled between his legs. I waited a moment for him to say something or at least move.   Control your goddam dog! I told him just to break the silence. He didnt respond, although his dog barked stood again and tried to charge at me, but the owner held it strong. I climbed back on the bike and strained my way up the hill, not wanting to look too weak to pedal the bike in front of the guy Id just yelled at.   After something like that, I was on the lookout for stuff as I pedaled out of the dog park and into the apartment complexes. There was no one out walking but plenty of cars and trucks driving by. Everything felt normal, pleasant even, but of course I was still a bit shaken. I think I felt lucky for a few seconds there that I hadnt pissed my pants when the dog attacked.  As I pedalled past the first apartment building in the complex, I saw the first person Id seen just out walking that evening. It was a woman of roughly thirty with very deeply tanned skin and wearing one of those Islamic headscarves. Her eyes were very, very wide and her movements were unnaturally stiff. She looked at me as I approached her as if she thought I might be about to attack.   Feeling both still a little paranoid but emasculated I stopped and dismounted.   Maam, are you alright? I asked, thoughtlessly walking up to her, probably exactly wrong for approaching a scared person.   Oh, yes yes! she insisted with a rapid nods while backing away from me, making a big phony smile.   Are you sure? I said dully.   Yeah. Im fine. Thank you for asking. As she said that, she began to walk forward again, giving me a wide berth. When she passed me she turned her head round to look at me, her smile gone and her eyes still wide. When she did, her eyes... they seemed to elongate across her face. Her left eye seemed to curve up and around her temple and her right extended down and around her cheek, both the whites of her eyes and the pupils and irises with them. I would have just thought I was misinterpreting what I was seeing, but when the left eye elongated up to her head scarf, it went under it instead of being superimposed over it as I would have thought in a hallucination, She paused as this happened, letting me have a good long look at what I thought I was seeing. Much longer than I would have wanted. Then she turned and continued her awkward walk, looking normal from the back.   I didnt know what to do for a moment. Should I just run up and try to see her eyes again? As I said earlier, Id never hallucinated before. I felt lucid if extremely uneasy then. I decided to just keep going on my errand and then go home. I guess I wanted to continue thinking that it was an anomaly with my vision and that everything was normal.   I started biking past the apartments. Despite my apparent desire to continue as if things were normal, I was looking all around me for something else out of the ordinary. This unfortunately caused me to look in some of the apartment windows. Most of them had their blinds or their curtains shut, but every once in awhile there was one I could see inside. As unpleasant as it might sound, I looked into each one I could as I rode by.   I went by several open windows with nothing out of the ordinary happening in them, but something I think I saw in one window made me slow down. It was hard to describe, but I thought I saw two people that seemed to be standing back to back for some reason. But when I stopped and went back a little, I saw that the two were doing what looked like a regular dance of some kind, probably practice for some show. I dont know. I got going again, feeling like I was letting my wil imagination convince me to do some skeevy things. I tried to stop myself from looking into the next open window to give the whoever might be in there privacy. What I saw instead made me squeeze my brakes with a death grip.   There was an old, heavy man sitting on a couch. I remember he was wearing a white undershirt. Other than that, all I had time to see was what he was doing: He was cutting his face with what looked from the way he was holding it like an exacto-blade. He would push it against his cheek, chin, nose, forehead, twitch his hand and leave a cut, then slowly move the knife to another part of his face for another cut. He was looking off to his left with a contented expression while he did this like someone watching television without any particular interest.   I watched him do this for what felt like minutes on end but was probably less than half a minute. I remember twitching a couple times looking at this from how painful it looked. I have no recollection of having ever seen anything like that before. I was becoming sick to my stomach at the sight of his cuts and the blood dripping down his face and staining his undershirt. And I tried, but I couldnt convince myself I was hallucinating.   Out of nowhere, he turned and looked at me. He glared and made to get up, his blade still in his hand. I imagined he had to be getting up to come after me. I must have unconsciously lowered my feet to the ground, but I tried to lift my feet to the pedals. In my desperation to get out of there, I missed the pedals. I looked down, this time, and got a trembling left foot on the pedal. I looked back at the window to see if he was coming for me.   There was no sign of him. I hesitated for a second then. He might have been behind the door, about to get outside only a few steps from me. But I decided then that even if I was seeing things, I would need to call the police when I got home. Even if I was seeing something, there was a possibility there was in a man in that apartment that was on...I dont know. PCP, maybe. Or at least was a chance I was watching disturbed man hurt himself. So I looked quickly for the apartment number, which was 204, and then biked away. I didnt hear the sound of any doors opening or any feet pounding for awhile, so by around the time I got out of the apartment complex I felt safer.   That feeling did not last. There was nothing down Main Street that was out of the ordinary, so I think I slightly convinced myself Id just been seeing things again. Not enough that I didnt start to work through in my head what I would say to the police when I called. But when I reached the small park that would lead to the post office before the beach trail that went home, it happened.   I heard the rapid tapping sound of footsteps behind me. I looked behind me. Empty street, but I definitely could hear that sound. Then I heard a growling and snarling noise. I didnt see it, but I thought for sure that it was that same dog from the hill. Itd broken free from its strange owner and had tracked me down and was coming after me, still not visible even in the light of the full moon.   I started pedalling as fast as I could. The Veterans Park didnt have any hills like the earlier one, but that dog still seemed to be gaining on me. It was barking and snarling like it had lost its mind as it seemed to be going faster than me even as I put my back into it. I stood up on the pedals but the sound of snarls and growls just seemed to get louder.   I looked back behind me, and there was still no dog to be seen. It was only feet behind me now from the sound and getting louder. I remember for some reason why, after seeing those strange things earlier today, am I only hearing this goddamned dog? Still looking behind me I heard the sound of what seemed to be a dog jumping forward and the growling coming right at my face.  I dont know if my bike hit something or what happened exactly, but I found myself falling over and hitting the ground hard, my ears full of the sound of a dog attacking me. The snarls and growls made become so loud now that they hurt to hear. They were accompanied now by the sound of skin-tearing and gnawing, as if the dog somehow had my entire head inside its jaws, like it was killing me. I could open my eyes and see there was no dog, I could feel my cheeks and know there were no teeth sunk into them, that certainly the dogs jaws wouldnt fit over my head. But I still thrashed around and screamed on the ground and held my ears as tightly as I could from how painfully loud it was. I dont know how long I heard that dog attacking me, but I remember how it stopped perfectly. Instead of just stopping like youd imagine a hallucination to, I heard the sound of a dogs paws as it backed away. panted and lipped its lips, then sprinted away.   I felt around my head again, checking once more for blood. I wasnt injured, of course, save a bruise on my leg and elbow. But I checked it again before I tried to get my leg out from under the bike and sit up. It was dead quiet for awhile as I caught my breath and tried to get my nerves back under control. When I finally climbed back on my bike, I was trembling so hard that I immediately almost lost my balance. But slowly, awkwardly I got out of the park and continued pedaling home. Naturally I completely forgot to drop off the dvd at the post office.   I was on the beach path that leads to my apartment. It was still really bright for the dead of night. I mention that because theres sort of a beach of rocks about the size of office chairs that goes on for hundreds of yards between my apartment and the post office, and it was bright enough that I could see all the individual rocks. And I could really well make out what was in the rocks.   It was a little girl, like not a toddler but not quite at adolescence, that looked like she was in a floral print dress. She seemed to be just sort of climbing from rock to rock and her hands and feet. I was afraid and not sure what I was seeing anymore, or i probably would have called to her and asked who let her play in a hazardous place at an hour like this. As it was I was I didnt even want to look at her. I told myself she probably was taught not to talk to strangers or that she wasnt real to justify not so much as talking to her. When I glanced over and saw that she was waving at me, I turned away quickly.  HI! she yelled at me in that kind of insincere but chipper way kids do. I didnt acknowledge her. I was looking forward at my apartment. It was a deep bluish gray in the moonlight and it had never looked so much like home.   I heard her scream. It was not the sound of a kid yelling out of excitement or just for attention. It was a sound that was choked at the end. Something cut her breathing off violently and awkwardly. But I knew with the disturbed way my imagination was going at the time that I did not want to look over at what I was imagining was happening.  Helpfff! she screamed, something obviously muffling her ability speak. I wasnt  going to look. I heard something like a hideous collision against rock, a sound with a crunch like something was being broken and skin was being torn. I kept my eyes on home. My imagination wasnt going to hit me with some vision. Then I heard the voice sound as if she were lifting high into the air as she continued her muffled begging for help. I guess it seemed to me that such a thing couldnt look real, that it would probably look ridiculous. Whatever it was, my curiosity compelled me to look up where the sound was coming from.   What I saw was a puff of blackness against a cloud brightly lit by the moon. The blackness quickly dissipated as the scream abruptly ended. I was faintly aware of two objects falling to the rocks below. I couldnt make out what they were at all, but I had a feeling they were the worst part of all that had happened so far. That of all the things that Id looked at that night, those would two fallen objects were what I would most regret seeing.   When I got home, I called the police immediately about the man in the apartment, assuming it was the thing that would be most likely to be believed. When they asked me if there was anything else they should know, I bit my lip and admitted that I had seen a little unsupervised little girl on the rocks near my apartment. That was all I felt there was to tell. I didnt sleep that night but I forced myself to stay in bed with my eyes shut, not wanting to see if my imagination had something else in mind.   The next day, the police called. They wanted me to come in for questioning. What I learned down at the station was that there was nothing suspicious reported in Room 204, there was something of interest found on the beach. A girls clothes matching the floral print I had described were found along with socks, a shoe. A few questions later, they mentioned that they also found blood with bits of skin in it. I wasnt about to mention the things I heard and the small but unbelievable thing I saw, and I think I could tell from their body language that the police didnt believe me but they hadnt found any evidence that implicated me. So now Im under suspicion for the things I saw and the things I reported. But thats far from the worst part.   When I started this, I mentioned that I had never hallucinated before that night. Well, now I do, and I know I am. Ive seen my eyes twist around my face in the mirror but felt my face and realized its normal. Ive heard that dog growling around and chewing my head when Ive tried to sleep. Ive seen that girl again, though from a distance every time since I dont know what she looked like. I see the man with his face still bleeding through apartment windows. I had gaps between seeing and hearing them that were long enough in the first two weeks that I occasionally had hopes the sight and sound of them was gone, but in the third week its become constant enough that I know thats not going away on its own.   So thats why Im posting this online. If you know anything about any of this, who that person in that apartment might have been, who that girl was, any of this, let me know. I havent slept in days and I havent had much peace. What the truth is seems less and less important as time goes on. I just, I need to know why I saw what I saw during that night ride.

 We just have the anatomy of raptors in our heads from what we suspected them to look like millions of years ago.  Over that time I'm sure they have been able to evolve enough to put their long claws up to their mouths in order to think.   Like a whole bag of dicks!   And after too many uses you had to find just the right sweet spot on the switch to make the RCA input work through it.   That's because it's still the best multiplayer system to date!   I usually try to use a self checkout anymore so i can cram as much into as few bags as possible.  But you're saying that by putting my items together like this when going to a person would avoid the bagger person from using 13 bags for 15 items?   Oddly I agree with you here.  When I was in college and used a computer lab, cleaning the roller was one of the things I usually did.   The Big Lebowski is a good one to do this to considering how many times you have to watch it to get everything.   I don't think the success kid would hit the wrong link in the first place.   Goddammit!!  I lost!   Heck, everyone knows you can drive 5 mph above the speed limit and still not get pulled over.   I absolutely hate it when someone stands there and holds the door when you're 50 feet away yet.  It makes you feel like you should go faster since they are holding the door, but at the same time it pisses you off because you can't walk at your normal lazy pace!   You'll read anything on the cue cards.  And I mean anything!   If we were living 100 years in the past, then we wouldn't be able to read shit like this on the internet!   I'd say it's worth the risk of jail if it's already been censored for everyone.   So is the guy on the left his translator then? (I'm aware it's not Jackie Chan, so that answer is not necessary)   It definitely beats drinking at the bar the entire night.  Especially when you're going to be with the same group of people regardless where you drink.   I wonder how many facebook friends God has?   Bi-force?   You are very strong willed if you can wait until Christmas for all 3 of those games!   Is the guy in the bottom left supposed to be Canadian?   Team America!  Fuck Yeah!!   That would be fun to randonly run up to a mime like that and act like you ran into something.  Probably would catch him a bit off guard.   It looks like a shoe according to Family Guy.      I hear ebay calling for this little gem!   This is so true!  And then you don't even have to clean the dishes when you're finished!   I think concept 2 looks the best.   Wait, Gamestop was allowed to sell another game aside from MW3 during the launch?   Better learn some Austin Powers driving moves in order to get out of that situation!   And once one light goes out, they ALL go out!!   When my parents buit their house (in 1992) the entryway closet is where he put the switch for the outside outlets.  Although, they still take the lights down each year.   Yes, I'd say I agree that the method "works" better when working on inanimate objects.   He must not be very big.  Her mouth isn't open very wide.   So cussing up a storm to try to get something fixed doesn't work?  I never would have thought that.   Totally agree with this.  I've given up on even thinking that I'll actually do something in the morning before work.   With the lighting it sorta makes it look like a cult waiting for the time of ascension.   So the princess is in another castle then?   Some day I will have my own DK Arcade machine!   I'd say definitely good job for a last minute costume!   I like how the Rep says they have a rule saying they do not do refunds on downloaded games.  Then immediately following that statement says they will refund you with credit and remove the downloaded game from your account.   But it's always better on the original system compared to a ROM!   But it's worth it when you kill someone in a shooting battle with your last bullet that you just loaded into the gun!   Sorry, I meant it was after the system first launched, as in the first 6 months to a year.  Not just the actual launch titles on the first day.  Later in its life the prices decreased overall though.   I recall most 3rd party games being $70 when the system launched and 1st party games being $60.  May have been a few that I saw that were $80 though.  And later in the systems life these went down to $60 and $50 for the most part.   Good costumes.  Although you're missing the best driver....Donkey Kong!   Couldn't they have at least made the game a color version?   Hmm, so that explains why people have to wait so long to get actual assistance for Battlefield 3 problems.   It must come with free controller converter cables that aren't visible in the picture.   Oh, I see what you did there!   Same here.  Someone wanted me to join so i did just to check it out.  What am I supposed to do, write the same exact stuff that I put on facebook for the same people to read?   Looks like they just wanted to use you as a test dummy to see what would happen beyond the corner.   I can't stand it when people do that either, even when they aren't my games.  I'm glad I trained my younger brothers years ago that games need to be put back in cases and regardless how mad you get, you shouldn't throw a controller on the ground.  Or else you may face a week of not being able to play.  Now a days the game collection is in great shape and everything still works like new!   Is your wife's name Sheryl by any chance?   Holy balls, that is sweet!   Looks pretty interesting.  A slightly different take on a game that actually might require some thinking.   That is 2 1/2 minutes of my life gone.  But I'd say it was worth it.   More like a double crime since you technically took 2 great games down!   When he said 64, he may have been referring to a Commodore 64.  Either way....fail!   Must be a pretty exciting game if they don't even want to use the chairs right behind them!   Hmm, I must say that after almost 2 decades of playing the game I never noticed a difference in speed with the coins.  Of course I always use DK Jr when I play, which would be a faster top speed than most of the others to begin with.  I might have to do some testing to see if there is a noticable difference with coins now.   Sorry, only TWO people can have the same joke.  You're the third unfortunately.   That seems like the most logical way to go about this.   You just made me lose The Game! http://www.losethegame.com   You got me.  I guess you get your free punch on my arm.   Don't forget to wash your hands!  You wouldn't want those shit particles accidentally being posted onto reddit!   On the older versions of the game the blue shell goes after the person in first at the time it's fired.  On the Wii version it changes targets to who is in first when it gets up to the front of everyone.   I don't think the coins made you go faster if you had more.  The point of the coins was so when you got hit by another kart you didn't spin out.  Each hit would make you lose a coin and when you were out and got hit by another kart you would spin out.  	67
 That's hecka creepy. Imagine if someone hacked into a nanny cam along with the monitor. They could watch you and talk to you but you would have no freakin idea who/where/why.  	1
 I know about research on field-effect transistor, electrochemical, enzymatic and microbial sensors, but never heard about anything cheap, convenient and sufficiently reusable. Not that it can not be done, of course.    I like the design. There are other more interesting things to measure besides radiation. Say, lactose or gluten for those who are sensitive.            	5
 Probably you are right. As a proof, here is my photoblog from 2 years ago (while I had more time, I went outdoors and tried to capture some awesome portraits): http://tajchert.wordpress.com/   Mine app reviews were deleted, the scores however were left untouched. Do you experince the same?  Maybe a small revolution for app reviews is comming (hopefully they will decay with time).   Thanks, no it was taken in Warsaw at bowling center (at the bar). Details: https://plus.google.com/117068580552844915876/posts/ZV5qQNEuHXD  I would say that only downside of camera is a fact that it protrudes from body, so I often put finger on it - and then lens is dirty. So remember to swipe with t-shirt it before taking an awesome photo :)   http://i.imgur.com/sxzyGnj.jpg I still experiment with battery but I find battery life quite decent, and phone is awesome to hold (5" but still small and light).   Do you know any wireless charger (iQ, would be used with Nexus 5) with an extra USB port in it? So besides the phone (wireless) I can charge a mp3, or a tablet without getting under the desk.   Thank you - just rooting N5, and it is next thing on my to-do list.    Anyone can confirm that? I don't like spending about 3$ just like that... Because it is not visible in their screenshots.      Also in Polish.      You can use Dropbox API or SkyDrive. I don't have any experience with any of those two so I cannot be an expert.   Will it be live somewhere on the Internet?      It look like it was wrote for Android 2.X, for sure not with current guidelines. Otherway nice work.   But you need to give a gmail account as I understand, and later on there is no way to transfer this Google Play money between accounts...   Germany have them - code on each kitkat (outside) - bought 6 of them, and no prize.  Poland - they are but competition page says 1 more day and 20h to start of a competition. And code is going to be on a receipt/bill (so as I understand 1 per one shopping, not per bar).  Italy and Austria - I haven't seen them, when I checked 1 week ago.   I was staring at first two, and wondering what I'm missing...    Keep up with Google guidelines - for sure app using G+ multiplayer are not worst due to matter of used service. Take a look at Osmos HD multiplayer - quite nicely done!  I don't know how it is in your country/surrounding but more and more my friends started using G+ as it is more hmmm, lets say 'professional' (less family) and it is connected to your phone.   It is a preview of FPS made Blue Brick (polish game studio), Left mouse click to shot, right to drop a weapon. Simple as that.      [Age of Zombies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.ageofzombies) - shooter   [4 Player Reactor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coolcherrytrees.games.reactor4) - great to play with with friends at one phone.

I lost hope that it will be finally out, nice but somehow I enjoyed more 1,2, or 3 parts.   On what video? I'm asking how to implement such effect in my app, not how to turn it on in YT app.   Bought it in UK, regretted immediately...      Hi, latest update of YouTube app brings awesome feature of video over activity. Does anybody knows how they achieve it (or get similar result)?   S4 Mini, LG L5 II, or Samsung Galaxy S Advance.   Samsung S4 Mini -http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9190_galaxy_s4_mini-5375.php   Some story behind that gif: It was during EURO 2012 in Warsaw - when hosts (Poland) was playing with England - game was postponed. But there is a roof which (even despite that forecast was saying that it is going to rain) was left open. As a result of waiting for the game, two guys run on pitch - they were arrested, but later on (as I remember correctly) their charges were withdrawn.   Anyone have it to share apk file?       There  is a video of that gif: http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ih8dg/dog_jumps_on_his_shadow/   I got few pairs of headphones (always 'in ear' ones) which have same problem - one from pair is broken, in some of them it start working when you hold cable near jack (where cable ends, and jack starts) at special angle. Is there any easy way to fix them? So far I was always buying a new pair (all of them last around 5-12 months), but it's enough!     	34
 I have little knowledge on building PCs but my friend does I found this design on reddit and I want to know if it will work without anything else (besides a monitor keyboard and a mouse).    Link:http://pcpartpicker.com/p/2AYgk  Thanks a lot   	1

Posle Turnira americkog fudbala sve igraci svakog tima su stali u red prema publici. Medju njima sam bio i ja. Hteli su da prave talas da se zahvale publici. Ja sam bio prvi u redu gde bi talas trebao da pocinje ali ja nisam skonto sta sam morao da radim. Svi su bili pruzili ruke ispred sebe i mrdali prstima i cekali da prvi u redu (ja) pocne da digne ruke u vis. Suigrac mog tima koji stao pored mene gleda mi u oci i klima glavom. Tako da sam ja od jednom poceo da tricim ispred reda igraca jer sam mislio da oni dok ja trcim prave talas. Kurac. Posle 20m sam skonto da sam se osramoti~~j~~o ko budala. Svako gleda sta radi ova budala :D tako da sam usao negde u sredinu reda i to je to. Publika sigurno isto mislila da sam neki retard   Ali nisu to ovi bili koji se danas nazivaju... Nemoj se praviti blentav!    Pa tako ste se sami deklarilari... Glupost apsolutna...    Tu ste kao i tkz. makedonci... Dobro svakom svome. Ja ne bi mogao da zivim sa tim lazima.

Bosanci, bosnjaci, Muslimani su samo politicki izmisljeni narodi... Repa bez korena. Meni je veca glupost ako zbog religije mislis da si drugi narod. Budite Srbi muslimanske vjere i sve ce biti u redu... Btw. Ne zaboravite hercegovce, njih uvijek zaboravite :(   No   Otvorio sam ja jednom temu na tome   Svako od nas i na svetu ima dugme...

Recimo na primer da uplatim za mesec dana i da za to vreme imam neogranican broj MB.  Zelim da imam WLAN mrezu u kuci kad sam u Srbiji...         Pomoz bog,  mozda nekoga zanima: Slobodan Trkulja ce imati koncert 15. maja u beogradu. Zna neko od vas kako da dodjem do karata? PS: citao sam da u novom sadu ima neki snajperista koji puca po petrovaradinu? Da li je se moze do tvrdjave ili su zatvorili ulaz dok se ne nadje ludak?  Edit: http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015 mm=03 dd=20 nav_category=16 nav_id=970761   Cao ljudi,  sigurno ste pratili pad evra prema USD... ili rast ekonomije u evropi (osim u Srbiji) itd.  Kako profitirati o tome, kako zaraditi na tome?  Evo ja se bavim "Daytradingom".   To znaci ja spekuliram u kratkom periodu (5min do nekoliko dana) na pad ili rast Devisama (naprimer EUR/USD) ili pad ili rast Idexima (naprimer DAX30).   Primer: Recimo EUR/USD je u trenutku na 1,0560 i poraste za 10min na 1,0570  Znaci Delta od 0,0010 (cetvrta pozicije posle zareza je jedan "pip", u ovom slucaju imamo sada rast od 10 pipa)  Kako zaraditi pare? Ima nekoliko brokera na Internetu koji nude trgovanje s leveragom (ne znam rec na srpskom) jer bez toga ne bi bilo atraktivno.   Recimo ti kupis za 500$ EUR/USD i kazes da EUR/USD ce da raste (znaci EUR ce da jaca). Ako sada EUR/USD raste za 0,0010 ti ces na tome da zaradis 500$x0,0010 = 0,5$ (skoro nista ali risik je mali) zato dolazimo do leverega (poluga?, na google mi tako prevodi). Broker ti daje polugu od 25-400. To znaci ako imamo polugu od 200 i ulozimo 500$ mi trgujemo za 100000$ (500$x200). Ako sada EUR raste 0,0010 (10pipa) onda bi zaradile 100000$x0,0010=100$ i to u kratko periodu... ali pazite ako ide na drugu stranu (pad evra) onda gubite 100$  Ja to vec radim preko dve godine i zalim sto nisam jos za vreme studija ovo radio kad sam imao vise vremena. Ako neko ima pitanje slobodno pitajte. Na pocetku zavetujem da se u tome probate na Demoaccount i to radite sa nerealnim parama. Mnogo brokera to nude. (etoro je za pocetak nije los jer je veoma lagano napravljeno)  Ko od vas ima 200-800 (koji vam nisu zao ako bi izgubili) da spekulira to je atraktivna mogucnost zaraditi pare i da se edukujte na otvorenom marketu.   Ako imate pitanje slobodno pitajte      Yes Srpska will campaign for a referendum as we believe that the people in Republic of Srpska should decide their future in a democratic way.

 Can someone explain what he did? I feel like what he is saying is that the illegals that cross the border are bad people. Is it wrong to say because most of them aren't? Is there a border problem where drugs and gangs from Mexico are bringing crime to the U.S.? Is it dangerous for Americans living there now? He didn't call all Mexicans rapists like people want to claim. Did he cross a boundary by even bringing it up when it's not a problem at all? Where can I find this info?  	1
 Best bit of advice my parents have ever taught me was to "just ask", the worst they can say is "no" (I know thats not the worst but that was the general principle)  I've had this attitude since and its handy, its given me the confidence to approach new employers.. girlfriends..   Confidence to follow through with my plans.   try "I'm really confused by this assignment, how about you?" or "Hi, can I borrow a pen? I'm useless at being prepared...." or something along them lines. Then follow it up with "How long have you been in this class for? I've never seen you before?"     Oh yeh, like during the olympics  	4
 My vitals are good, no one's freaking out about how thin I am and forcing me in heavy clothing anymore..yet I'm still expected to gain *more*.  I know a BMI of 15 isn't healthy, but any further up, not being able to feel certain bones I'm likely to become depressed and maybe throw myself off a bridge. Don't worry, that's not a real suicide threat, I'm too wimpy and don't know any bridges.  I don't even get to be one of those Instagrammers who get motivation from other recoverers due to circumstances. *I. Have. Nothing.*  I wish this would've never happened, I wish I was still me instead of a beast that wants to destroy every bit of himself.    	1
 Accountants know which businesses are thriving and managed the best: which painter, roofer, plumber, electrician, dentist, etc.         Dear [test_subject937],  Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.  I oppose any form of censorship or discrimination. I believe those who pay for our web capacity must be able to recover their costs, or it won't get built.  Supporters of net neutrality argue that giving all internet users the highest speed and greatest volume of space available - whether or not they contribute to the cost of building that capacity - is the only way to guarantee that no one will be discriminated against on the basis of what they want to say. However, there is very little incentive for carriers to build infrastructure if they have no way to recoup their costs. Without such an incentive, many new high bandwith applications, such as medical technology and communications for emergency personnel, many not be feasible.  Simply put, I believe providers shouldn't be able to block access to any other providers on the basis of content, and access to the capacity that has been built by the public should be open to the public on equal terms. But, access to future capacity should be open on equal terms to those who share the cost of its construction.  Thanks again for caring enough to get involved, and please don't hesitate to contact me again in the future.  Sincerely,  John Barrow                     http://blacksportsonline.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/michael-sam-kiss.jpg   I couldn't find anything about it (and hope this sub is appropriate). Does anyone have any idea?  Will voice calls via Hangouts have to use a Google Voice number or will it use the phone's?   It's been posted on their Facebook page.  Thanks for all the great memories!                                             I'm hearing that the water tower by the ANGC busted due to the earthquake. It was leaking before then - big time. We saw water cascading out about 15 minutes before the quake.      And which is worse?               Apart from PDF Mergy, I haven't been able to find many apps that allow manipulation of PDFs. I'd really like to be able to split a PDF into two, rotate a page, and perform OCR.  Any suggestions?         I just received an email allegedly from Google (no-reply@accounts.google.com) stating that someone attempted to sign into me Google Account. The email has the standard blue button link to reset my password.  I was initially suspicious so I did a quick search and it seems bogus. Can anyone here confirm that it is not legitimate? I reported the email as a phishing attempt.  Thanks!      Is anyone else having this problem? My Nexus 7 (2013) randomly reboots at least once a day, but usually more. It's annoying and since I use it for work, it often happens at critical moments.  Also, I have Google Maps on the home row and it is removed every time it reboots. All the other slots are folders so I'm not sure if that's the cause or if it is something specific to Google Maps.      An earlier thread had a discussion about how we used to count by suns/daytime and nights. It makes more sense for a "day" to begin at roughly sunrise. Was this standardized by the same folks who standardized the calendar?            [Google Calendar Auto-fill](http://i.imgur.com/p6BYAd4)  Confirmed: [Google Calendar taps Maps for location autocomplete suggestions, and shows relevant events as you search](http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/12/04/google-calendar-taps-maps-location-autocomplete-suggestions-shows-relevants-events-search/)         We drove about 450 miles both ways. Using Maps, we were able to anticipate delays and find routes around them.  All told, we dodged 4 massive jams. It's hard to know how much time we saved but we figure at least an hour, maybe two.   For one, it assumes household finances are analogous to government finances. And it tells us _nothing_ important (because it's a low bar we all meet - to be a functioning adult is to balance a checkbook).  Is there a way that it is/can be used that is not a cop out? In my experience, it is usually said by someone who doesn't want to be tied to the social platform of the Republican party, but more so doesn't want to be thought of as a liberal or a Democrat.  I've thought this for years and am genuinely curious that I am missing something.                           I'd like to be able to give my boyfriend access to my reminders (and vice versa). When we are running low on, say, toilet paper, either one of us can say: "Remind me and [boyfriend] to buy toilet paper at Kroger."  When either one of us goes to Kroger... ding!  It seems like it would be easy for Google to do, and I'm sure there are other ways it could be used. Thoughts, /r/Android?            Both cheeks when the shadow covers the entire lane; left or right when it only covers the left or right portion.  I'm 31 and still love doing it. I tell myself it's why I have a bedonk.         I have very little knowledge of the net's infrastructure so forgive me if it's a dumb question. It just seems to me that the very nature of the internet makes it impossible to truly be anonymous.                                                            I apologize if this has been asked and answered. I searched this sub and Google but couldn't find an answer.  The sound works fine for seemingly everything else.  Thanks in advance, r/applehelp!                  Augusta, GA here! My boyfriend and I are planning a NYC trip during Masters weekend this year (April 12th to 14th). Neither of us have been there before and we need some help finding a hotel. Any reasonably priced but decent suggestions?  Thanks in advance!   Bottom line is as it appears: what can be done here? My cousin is such a good person - but she has decided that his lack of belief in the Christian god is a deal breaker.  I'm asking for effective advice... he wants to be with her. He does not want her to "convert" to his "religion"; but she is demanding the same.  Is this fair? And what can be done (in good faith)?   Karma is no more/less valuable than video game points. And the frontpage seems very similar to a final boss.  Does reaching the front page reduce this tendency? Front page fame is not worthless; fame a second time is still something.  Is a game any less valuable?          The good Senator is deleting all the comments because he isn't getting the response he thought he'd get.  It also appears he edited the original post (I have a screenshot).  Who's up for showing him how wrong he is? I bet we can post comments quicker than he can delete them!      What is the best way to verify the team of someone requesting membership on G+? I've seen people suggest requesting a screenshot of the comm with the invitee's name (and color) but I'm not convinced that is very reliable.  Thanks in advance!      What is Google's end game? What will a fully unified Google Account look like and how will it enhance your life?  Also, what are some product combinations you would like to see?         When the app loads and locks in on the player, does it zoom in on your exact location on the globe? It does for me (and I assume Google wouldn't choose my small-ish city as a default, hence the possible dumbness).      We were trying to destroy resonators by a museum around midnight. They saw my parked car and got out to investigate. At this point, I don't think they knew we were there.   We approached them and they asked what we were up to. We showed them the phone and explained that it is a global game of capture the flag created by Google. That simple explanation dropped the tension level down dramatically (they didn't know what they were walking into until then).   They laughed and checked it out a bit. Told us not to get "attacked" ourselves, and went on their way.   Overall, it was a good experience. We told them that they might start seeing more people like us and it's just a game.    From the letter posted on the investigation board:  SWEKU  XKCWDJHOYELFMSBZUQI  ARSMZEPIWOUK  QUESIWOYHPMTKBGR  KXUEGPMCOIW  YWQNEUIXBGKRZHAO  Does anyone know what it means? It doesn't seem like a alphabetical substitution cipher...   Where's the big surprise? Does anyone know if anything actually happened tonight?      Call it an embarrassment of riches but I am getting email notifications constantly (I pretty much own every portal in the area and you get one for every resonator destroyed).   Can we turn these GD notifications off? I suppose I can create a filter but that's just a work-around.      Check out the history map for a good overview of your work!  I've been active for about 7 days and... WOW! I've covered my area quite nicely.  (I'd post my map but it's all buggy this morning for some reason.)   Can anyone confirm (from an official source) that we are currently in beta?  And if so, what will be the major changes between beta and the official release? Obviously there will probably be no invitation process. What about items? Will they rain down from heaven like they do now (when turning in codes)?  I'd like to see this turn into a general "how the official release will differ from beta" thread if possible.   I have trouble pronouncing "pronunciation". Not because I wasn't exposed to or didn't know the correct pronunciation, but because a friend of mine hilariously mispronounced it one day while trying to defend his failure to properly pronounce another word (resulting in an ongoing joke that is over 10 years old).   Now I legitimately get the the two versions confused and have to pause and mentally say it before verbally saying it.            For me, it's the definition of despotism. The Civilization series introduced me to that word and it seems like a term that most people should know.  But I distinctly remember one of my best friends in college needing a definition from me when I used the term to describe Saddam Hussein's regime.  She is very intelligent and well-educated, which only made it that much more perplexing to me.  So, Reddit, what other examples are there?           	121

They claim that IE won't close properly and they can't open Trend Micro.  I was thinking I would run some antivirus/antispyware scans (AVG?), and I'm definitely going to install Firefox and plead with her to use that instead.  But I'm not especially adept at troubleshooting computers, and without more details, it's hard for me to know exactly what the problem is.  I'll be going to her place tomorrow to try and help, and I was wondering if the brilliance here at reddit has some suggestions for how I should proceed.   Dear Norway, Welcome to the 1990's.

 It would be fucking impossible to get Taco Bell at 3 am   I think you're on to something here!  The CDC *is* looking pretty dumb lately.    For all you know I myself am a stripper, or I have children that are and support them even if I don't agree with them. I've got an idea; How about we don't project our personal feelings on a given subject onto one another, insisting the other is wrong and we are right? Deal? *Hint* THAT is liberalism. Live and let live.   I find it very irritating how often the article referred to him as "the stripper".  There's nothing wrong with stripping, but that's not all he is.   Nope, those are the fallen angels. Cass is somewhere in there.   The things I've seen working at my copy shop (copying depositions from lawsuits and court cases mostly) have left me unable to sleep at night. I've met a few of the defendants, and I never would have known otherwise what they are guilty of. If ignorance is bliss, knowledge is a burden.    The biggest thing I think he's missing here is that just because his friend or people like him may not have laid a hand on an underage person, but someone else had to in order to create the content he's "harmlessly" viewing. He didn't do the abuse, but someone with a camera has to in order to catch those vile images. This perpetuates the market for such images and videos. Other sick people are fulfilling a need created by these 60 year old white guys. Cut off the demand, the supply withers and dies and no more children are harmed.  Edit: phrasing   He makes it seem so effortless he might as well be doing the waltz      "The 23 Slowest Snapchats Of The '80s" I'd click it   When i got the job offer for my original position it included a contract stating I would get a monthly bonus based off the store's income for that month. The percentage wasn't specified, but both myself and the business owner signed it. I've been with my employer for a little over a year and a half now, have sense gotten a promotion and 2 raises but have only gotten 3 bonuses totaling $200, the last one being over a year ago. We haven't posted a single loss since I've been here, and we just wrapped up our best month of the year. Well, I get my check today and...no bonus!! This is really starting to piss me off. I've talked to the owner about it before and all I get is "yeah, we haven't been doing very well. Not a lot of profit." But as the manager I have full access to our finances and I can see that we did *worse* those few times I did get a bonus compared to our lowest month this year! How do I approach this without calling my boss a liar or cheapsake? I really need this job but I'm completely being used here.   EDIT: Thanks for the advice! I'll that those wise words and see what I can make happen :)   "Don't mind me, sir. Just here to snake the pipes."   That is cool as hell, I'm personally impressed!       All jokes aside, this is a really beautiful photo   This creates a lot of pressure to make a decision when I just want an apple  	16

 Delete alien blue. Download Ruby For Reddit. It's WAYYYY easier to navigate. That's what I use for mobile   I don't watch tv a lot. When I do I watch, like, sponge bob or something. But I have seen a couple of old tv series and I don't think they are that great. I think that the tv series now are even worse though. They are just boring to watch :P   Why?   Haha that was me!   WHAT IS IT!!!! I'm old enough to know! We had our sex ed already!   We'll then.   Okay!!!!!   Probably. I'm not doing anything   What's that?   TWINS!!!!!!!   No, you creep!   Oh, and you won't be able to read any other book for a month because of the trauma :)   I can see why.   What's that?   Okay, well, how many twelve year olds do you know that do drugs and drink? And we can't be friends with your gamer tag, anyway.    No. I actually like archery and do not strive to be like Katniss.   I do. But I only browse subreddits that don't have . ..... Adult content.    Black ops 1, cod ghosts, terraria, minecraft, the walking dead video game series, etc.   I do not look at that adult stuff. Sometimes I do if it's not about, like , sex or whatever . But it's not like I intentionally go to bad subreddits. I never click "random subreddit" because I know what could happen.   I know that. I also know that r/watchpeopledie is not something I want to browse.   2002 may   I concur    Yes yes yes but NOOOOOO   Nothing   I have never watched it, but have been planning to. On school days, I wake up at six, walk to school, walk home, do homework, go to soccer, come home, eat dinner, shower , then go night night and repeat. Since I'm on break or on the weekends I visit my moms house the most I can, come home Sunday, go to sleep, play xbox, back to school. Consoles are only allowed on the weekends   It's Dystopian Fiction, which I like, set in the future where the world is split up into five different sections. Just find my xbox live account and my bio will tell you :P. Just read it. I have recommended it to all of my friends, teachers, my mom, and my step-mom. Although my friends haven't read it, 'cause books, everyone I know is obsessed and crystal at the end. It's really intense and action packed with people jumping off of moving trains. But then there's like a pinch of a crush turns into a pinch of a crush for him, but in the last book it WOULD not have turned out the same without him. It's just, amazing. Read it. Pm when your done   It's fun. I don't think I should be talking to someone with that username though.........   Archery is really fun, I read the hunger games and I was like, I wanna try that! But now I don't like archery because of the hunger games I like that satisfying thud when I hit a ten. And I know how reddit has a lot of gross stuff but I only browse sections that are the most appropriate for me. Of course there is that one post on here about penises or something, but in didn't click it!!!!! Eww! And I know no other twelve year old girl that likes video games and the color black, but then there's those idiot guys that are like " OMG I'm a gamer now!!!!! I bought (way outdated game like world at war)!!!"   Ooh good question? Was it about unicorns?!!   Coolio   If you are about to go to bed why did you post this? can you sleep-comment?    Hi I'm twelve and I'm really bored. I like soccer, archery, video games, laughter, and the Divergent and Hunger Games book series. AMA!!   I'm guessing it's about airplanes. I'll watch it sometime over break   I don't really care anymore since I purchased the xbox one, but thanks for the tip!   The only thing I can do is delete stuff, which I have tried and I want/need everything I have OR I can change the memory unit to cloud but for some reason that option isn't available when I go into Halo 4   Will do. Unless you are joking with me and the movie is unrated and I will get grounded.   I love halo, too. But when I bought Halo 4, you have to download all of the game types onto the xbox and I have like no storage left so I wasted sixty bucks on a game I can only stare at and say I have   I come home at 3:00, do homework, go to soccer at 4:00, come home at 7:00, eat at 8:00, shower and do all that good stuff, and then go to bed.    I really like those too,; I like pretty much every variety of games, but I recently got Ghosts for Christmas and thought it was a lot better then other Call of Duty's.   Or a phone. I see third graders with iPhone 5s gold's but I don't even have a firefly (a phone that only calls parents and home)   None of my friends have a bedtime. If they do, it's 11:00. It is now "normal schedule"  to have no bedtime   I love Ace Ventura. a little inappropriate, but alright   Lately, I have been obsessed with COD ghosts. Don't worry, I'm fine. My grades are very high and I love reading and I always find a way to get in good with my teachers. I say I like a certain series.... BAM!!!!!  A 4 on reading. And I'm only allowed to play on my consoles on the weekends, so I'm fine   My parents know I use reddit and I often tell funny jokes I found on here. My grades are fine, math isn't hard yet! We are only in algebra. I'm twelve. I don't even know what cannabis is.   SPOILERS****  I feel that tris is too pretty in the movie. The whole book series she is telling herself she is ugly and in Allegiant when the are about to have sex, she says that she is pale, weak, and flat chested. She is none of these in the trailer.   ALRIGHTY THEN!!!!!! - Ace Ventura   My bedtime is 9:00, but we are currently on Christmas break until the 9th.   I prefer xbox.   I recently got an xbox one, but I have an Xbox 360 and a ps3. I enjoy first person shooters, but I like other games like minecraft and Terraria   I'm twelve years old and live in California(U.S.) and I love playing video games! I have an update for black ops two right now so I'm really bored and it's taking forever so ask away!!!   What part of California do you live in?   In all capitals, type in SDRAWKCAB. Its in a snow biome, there is floating islands, giant hills, and much more! By far my favorite seed    GT: Jade Sueta. I will be on a lot the next couple of weeks and a lot of today.    Thanks! And for future reference, how many eight year olds go on reddit? I dont think thats a problem here.    Im twelve. Everythin i can get away with   I got so excited and then BAM! Rule one:  you have to be thirteen. I turn thirteen in 49 days. I have a mic. Can i please play?   So your saying i have to waste minecraft playing time by going on a website and signing up and THEN add you and play? Thanks, but no.   I just started a new survival world and you are welcome to join it! Im on right now. Its not very far in the making but i will be on for a few hours every day. Ill add you!   Do you play minecraft a lot? Are you host a survival world with other players?   Hey guys! Im going to start up a new survival world and I need players. My gamertag is Jade Sueta and im on a lot on the weekends but will be on every day for a few weeks. If you want to join  come add me and send me a message saying your from reddit. See you soon!   Gt: Jade Sueta. Im on tomorrow   You can make an infinite water source next to your moat. I dont know how to do a water pump but just make a 2 by 2 hole one block deep and take a water bucket and pour it in the corner. Do the same the exact opposite the corner with the water and Voila! Take water as much as you want from the hole    Hey i an help   Gt: jade sueta  I'll be on tomorrow   Can i join? I have a mic.    The main reason i hate the ending is because i fell in love with the series and i grew so close to tris and then she dies   I'll join. My gt is jade sueta   I'll play. I'm only on on the weekends and I have a mic gt:  jade sueta  	68

 You really don't want to fake it. If you feel you absolutely have to, you have to be careful so you don't get caught in a lie. But really, it's best to use your real experiences and just make it sound good. You can tweak small things. But don't ever put a job you didn't do! There are ways to find out if you actually did it or not.   By honors I just mean academic awards/achievements. Like does you school have an honor roll (distinction for making good grades)?   Those skills are a good start. Employers tend to want people who are excellent communicators and being able to speak multiple languages is a plus.   You can definitely include sports, especially if sports are really all you have. If you did get most improve award, that could show you can learn new skills quickly and effectively.   Think about the skills sports have taught you and how you can apply them to the work force. Were you punctual to all practices? Are you a team player / do you work well in a group? Did you learn excellent time management skills (having to balance sports with academics)? Are you dedicated / do you have a strong work ethic? Were you ever a leader - did you ever effectively communicate between all your team members? Did you ever have to solve conflicts amongst team members? Are you used to working under pressure? Can you work with all types of people? If any of these things apply to you, put them on your resume. Employers are looking for these things - they want to see that you can work with people, that you can solve conflicts, and that you are reliable.   Edit: also, if you have more questions or want to talk to more people, check out /r/jobs   It's been a year since I studied conditioning, but I believe an unconditioned response can be replaced by a conditioned response. An unconditioned response cannot be created. Instead, it is a reflexive response elicited by a stimulus without learning. For example, whenever dogs see food, they salivate. The salivation in response to seeing food is a reflexive response, thus making it an unconditioned response.   Now, a conditioned response is a learned response, and that can be changed or unlearned. In /u/tossedidiot's example, before the experiment the girl probably responded to the bunny with either indifference or by wanting to pet it - this is an unconditioned response. But then experimenters added a loud noise (a neutral stimulus) which would make the girl cry. Pairing the loud noise with the bunny made the girl learn to cry whenever she saw the bunny. The crying is now a conditioned response (NOT an unconditioned response). In this instance, the conditioned response COULD have be unlearned if the experimenter's were to repeatedly present the bunny without the loud noise OR they could use positive reinforcement (such as giving the girl candy whenever she went near the bunny or whatever).  **TL;DR** An unconditioned response is a reflexive response to something, but it can be changed in that a conditioned response replaces it.   Edit: Words   Ah, resumes. What fun! My husband graduated from college in May and I helped him with his resume. I took a class that helps with finding jobs, so I'll post some tidbits from a handout I received.   **TL;DR** - Objective is 1-2 sentences; Use standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial; Include information that pertains specifically to the position for which you're applying (don't put in useless information just to "fill" your resume); Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments; Show you're a "doer" by using action words such as "accomplished", "initiated", "established", etc when describing your activities; Make sure your resume format is consistent; Read the job description/advertisement for the job and use any words the employer used to describe the job; Grammar and spell check!; You can put a "spin" on things to make yourself sound better, but never ever ever EVER lie on your resume.   **The Objective** The objective is a concise, one- or two-sentence statement that appears as the first major section of  your resume. It communicates two things: what sort of job you are seeking, and what skills you have to offer.  There are many different approaches to writing a job or career objective. Most styles focus on elements such as  the position, the field, or the job-seekers particular skills. You may also choose to create an objective that is  made up of a combination of those elements. Your objective may be oriented to:  * The position  for example, A position as a social worker providing services for the aged.  * The field  for example, Desire a position in the social service field working with youth.  * Your skills  for example, A position utilizing counseling, research, and proposal-writing skills.  * A combination  for example, Seeking a position as a public relations officer in a medical facility. Wish  to utilize skills in communications, needs analysis, and photography.   Another option is to write an objective that states both a starting position and a long-range goal. Therefore, your objective may be written to focus on:  *Results  for example, A sales position utilizing strong organizational skills and the ability to work on a  self-directed basis, where I can develop a sales territory and generate new business.  *A long-range goal  for example, To secure a management trainee position with a large department store  with eventual goal of becoming a store manager.   **Font   Format** Font choices should be classic: Arial, Times New Roman, or Tahoma are traditional, professional, and easy-to read. Font size should range between 10- and 12-point, with the only exception being your name, which is usually written a few points larger. Bolding, italics, underlining, and all-caps can be used effectively to emphasize headings and create a visual break between information. There is no prescribed way of making these choices, but be consistent.  When printing your resume, use high-quality stock paper of at least 20-pound weight that is available at most print shops and office supply stores. Conservative white, off-white, tan or light gray are generally acceptable colors.  Your resume should be crisp and clean looking, and visually appealing to the reader. Use white space effectively. Avoid cramming and crowding. Use spacing to accentuate sections  and headings  Normally a one-page resume will be sufficient. In virtually no instance should your resume exceed  two pages. Make sure your descriptions of your work experience and/or extracurricular activities are results-oriented. Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments.  Make revisions, and make sure there aren't mistakes.  **Experience** Don't worry if you've had limited or no experience. By customizing your resume, you can present your accomplishments and experiences in an effective way in  relation to the position for which you are applying. If you have difficulty expanding upon your work experience, or are concerned your jobs werent glamorous or relevant, the following may be helpful:  * First, describe your responsibilities using action words such as created, planned, analyzed, or  initiated. Show you are a doer. You can probably find a list of words online, or I have one if you want it. *Next, think about the transferable skills you gained from each experience. Examples of transferable skills  include oral or written communication, interpersonal skills, working effectively in a team, leadership, and  research or analytical skills. They are transferable because you build on them and carry them with you as  you move from job to job. Employers often value these abilities as much as, if not more than, technical skills.  * Finally, ask yourself which of your job duties and accomplishments will matter most to the employers you  will be pursuing, and place those most prominently on the work experience portion of your resume. For each  job, develop (typically) two to four phrases or sentences, using your lists of action words and transferable  skills, which describe your key responsibilities and achievements.  * You will also benefit from considering the description or advertisement for the job to which you are applying.  Look for keywords that the employer uses to describe the skills and qualifications being sought for the position. Identify overlap between skills you possess and skills the employer is seeking, and be sure to emphasize those phrases and keywords in your resume.  Remember to include any honors you've received.  Edit: Spelling and nonsense.   Woo! I am about to graduate with a degree in English - Creative Writing. Have an upvote for busting the myth that all people with creative writing degrees work as baristas.  Have you begun the publishing process for your first novel?   Mr. Krabs: Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells... smelly... Anchovies. Squidward: What? Mr. Krabs: ANCHOVIES!  Also, the best advice from Patrick: When in doubt, pinky out.    Interesting. The coin is the same on both sides, which made me think it wouldn't be legal tender, but I wasn't sure. Thanks for the information!      I still have hope that we will see LSH on the show, and let me explain why.  Did anyone watch How I Met Your Mother? While the show was still on air, fans had a theory that the mother was dead the whole time. Then in an interview the actress who played the mother debunked that theory, saying it was just a ridiculous conspiracy theory created by fans and that the mother is not dead. Guess what fucking happened on the last episode? So, the actress lied about the show's ending!  What is the moral of this story? Trust no one. People who are involved with making shows lie all the time to throw off fans. Thus, I hope they haven't officially decided to not include LSH.  Edit: Stupid autocorrect.   My school's English club has had the same issue as you. Our member involvement has been very low. Last semester, we seriously only had about 5 active members. I know one reason why we've had low involvement is because very few people know we exist, and even fewer know what we even do. So first and foremost, I would say promote your club as much as possible! Hang up posters, ask professors in the English department to inform their students about the club, go where students hang out the most and hand out flyers, or even have tshirts made and have members wear them.  At my college, people love volunteering. I would considering finding a way to get your club involved with volunteer activities. For instance, last semester my club did a book drive. First, we had people bring in old books they didn't use any more, then we sold them for pretty cheap (anywhere from $.25 to $1 each) on campus. We raised about $500 and all proceeds went to our local children's hospital so they could buy books for their library. You could do some sort of fundraising event for local organizations that promote literacy.   Another thing you could do just for fun is a book swap. I know people want to read books, but books are expensive to buy or they just can't find something good to read. So you could throw a small party or something and have people bring old books they don't want and they can swap books with other people.   People love contests and prizes. You could hold writing competitions. My group is planning on holding a campus wide poetry contest and the winner will get something like a small gift card to a local restaurant or bookstore or something. So hold flash fiction contests, poetry contests, things like that and give away small prizes.  Our club also has it's own publication, a literary magazine which accepts and publishes the best analytical essays. We were able to get a grant to help with the costs of printing and whatnot since it's professional, but I guess you could do the printing and stuff on your own if you want to do it on a smaller scale. We accept submissions from late fall through early spring and publish the magazine late spring. Once submissions are closed, we read through everything and pick the best, then we do light editing (spelling and grammar). You could consider starting something like this, and you can publish any type or writing (creative or academic) you want. If you guys like creative writing, you could put together a magazine of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, novel excerpts, etc. People at my school love this. The group in charge gets to act as editors and students get their work published, both of which look good on resumes.  Hold open mic events. Invite people to come and read poetry or an excerpt from a short story they've written. Make sure to have popcorn or pizza to draw people in, or you could ask to hold the event at a local coffee house.   Do you have a local company that puts on plays? We have a local Shakespeare company, and every year we get together as a group and see a play.   People love free stuff, so offer free pizza or any free food or whatever at meetings.  That's all I can think of for now. In short, promote your club as much as possible and offer free stuff. Good luck!  Edit: spelling.     Me: Did you know euthanasia is pink? Husband: What do you mean? Youth in Asia are yellow.  Because apparently euthanisia sounds like youth in Asia... Face palm.    I originally posted on /r/pics, but this subreddit seems to be more appropriate...   As the title says, my parents called today to say they had to put our dog down. Sammie was 16; he would've been 17 in October. His health had been pretty poor for years now (he was blind and couldn't hear or walk well), but he was one strong pup.   My parents gave him to me as a Christmas present when I was 5 years old. Today, I'm 22, married, and about to graduate college, so this dog has been around for a lot of major events in my life. It's like my childhood officially died with him.   [A few pictures of Sammie.](http://imgur.com/a/0VvC0)  You were the first dog I ever had, Sam-Sam. Thank you for all the memories, for being a loyal companion, for teaching me responsibility, and for making me feel like I always had a friend. I am going to miss you.  Edit: Spelling   Thanks. I wasn't sure which place would be better... Perhaps I'll move over there.    As the title says, my parents called today to say they had to put our dog down.

Rob Schneider is Da Derp Dee Derp Da Teetley Derpee Derpee Dumb. Rated PG-13.   /u/sympathyboner is right about seeing the doctor and possibly getting a new pill.  I had a very similar experience with Lo Loestrin. I would have light breakthrough bleeding ALL THE TIME and I would miss my periods. My doctor changed my pill to Generess Fe a few months ago and everything is back to normal.  Also, since you mentioned that you were stressed, keep in mind that stress can screw up your period.  I hope all is well :)   "Irregardless" drives me insane. It's "regardless" you illiterate swine!

 I think the driver had his seat belt on, but he took a tree limb to the face.   An earlier post got me thinking. We know that they went to school together, was Petey sneaking up the stairs (boys can't go up the girl's stairs) as a rat to crawl in bed with Bertha?  It's my headcanon that that is how Peter piqued her interest in Albania, because they had known each other at school.  Pimp Daddy Peter.     I like the way you think. I think some of the other girls in the dorm might have noticed a large black dog or a stag coming in. Maybe not so much a rat that could sneak up and crawl in bed with.. I dunno, Bertha Jorkins perhaps?   ..and he put him through the motions three more times to try to show them how it's done. "Look at his eyes."   This is pretty much it. Riddle had to kill Harry in order to destroy his own bit of soul inside of Harry, essentially a creator destroying his own horcrux.  Albus has spoken a few times about certain types of magic...  Edit: I know that Harry was not a *true* horcrux, but he was still carrying a bit of Voldemort inside of himself.    [This](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cornelius_Agrippa) is another appearance of the word.               Was George losing his ear an homage to Van Gogh? It wasn't specified in the book as to which ear he lost, but the film had his left ear bandaged.      "Say, what's your name?" the bartender asked the first duck. "Huey," was the reply. "How's your day been, Huey?" "Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. What else could a duck want?" said Huey. "Oh. That's nice," said the bartender. He turned to the second duck, "Hi, and what's your name?" "Dewey," came the answer from duck number two. "So how's your day been, Dewey! ?" he asked. "Great. Lovely day. I've had a ball too. Been in and out of puddles all day myself. What else could a duck want?" The bartender turned to the third duck and said, "So, you must be Louie?" "No," she said, batting her eyelashes. "My name is Puddles."      How fcuking awesome was Minerva McGonagall? Such a powerful person, and the penultimate school marm.   3.. 2.. 1.. GO!   He's just a big stoned kitty.   Would have taken over the DADA position after the second war? We know the jinx was lifted when Voldemort died, so would it have been a student from Harry's generation or would Minerva have brought in someone from the outside?         When they're on the hut on the rock, Petunia says that her sister would come home and turn teacups into a rats. That's big magic for a young witch.  Do you think the *Fera Verto* spell in CoS film was based on this bit in the first book?   I know that we only saw them one time with Lockhart, but damn those fuckers can do some damage. I would hate to have a nest near my home.  Same goes with Doxies. How do they even get in your home to begin with?   A laywoman was driving down the street in a sweat because she had an important meeting and couldnt find a parking space. Looking up toward heaven, she said, Lord, take pity on me. If you find me a parking place Ill go to Mass every Sunday for the rest of my life and give up drinking wine. Miraculously, a parking space opened up right in front of her destination. The woman looked up to heaven and said, Never mind, Lord; I found one on my own.         It just seems like they should have had some sort of protection around their wands. Perhaps a magically reinforced thin piece of steel that slid over your wand, except for the handle and tip, to keep it from breaking. That would have helped Ron, Neville, and Harry at least.  Does this seem ideal for anyone else?         You can hang the picture with only one nail.   Obviously, Voldemort used him for his savagery. Do you think there was ever a time when, like Draco, he regretted it?   Seriously, that man was the foulest of the foul. Do you ever think there was a time Tom Riddle sat back and said, "DAMN!"?    That's okay, the right side was weak.   When I bought DH at the midnight release, I stayed up all night reading. Around 06:00, my wife was getting up and getting ready for work. She came in to the living room just a bit before Percy tumbled out of the portrait of Ariana in the RoR. At that point, I sat the book on my lap and started clapping, "YAAY!" She looked at me like I had a third eye in the middle of my forehead.  My question is, what was an exciting part for you on your first read-through?         Ready.. steady.. GO!   To cast Gemenio on a human?      Bitches hate that.      What are your favorite chapters of the series? and why?      Two guys driving through Texas get pulled over by a state trooper. The cop walks up and taps on the driver's window, the driver rolls it down, and the trooper smacks the driver in the head with his night stick. "Ow!" says the driver. "Why'd you do that?" The trooper says, "You're in Texas, son. When I pull you over, you'll have your license ready." The driver says, "I'm sorry, officer; I'm not from around here." The trooper writes the guy a ticket and gives his license back, then walks around to the car's passenger side and taps on the window. The passenger rolls the window down, and the trooper smacks him with his night stick. "Ow!" says the passenger. "What'd you do that for?" The trooper says, "Just making your wish come true." "What the hell does that mean?" asks the guy. "Two miles down the road, you were gonna say, "I wish that lousy asshole would've tried that shit with me!"   Half a dog.         I only have three jets recycling because only three of my 38 hero roster don't need training.               I think it's the Dakotas, Idaho, Alaska and Wyoming.   How do you plan on celebrating?         ..I guess it will be a silent film?            How jealous is Meg of Lily Mae?               Mine would be Beedle. I read them to my daughters as bedtime stories for a few months when it was released.         A 6-year-old and 4-year-old are upstairs in their bedroom. "You know what?" says the 6-year-old. "I think it's about time we started cussing." The 4-year-old nods his head in approval. The 6-year-old continues, "When we go downstairs for breakfast, I'm gonna say something with 'hell' and you say something with 'ass'." The 4-year-old agrees with enthusiasm and they head down stairs. When their mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6-year-old what he wants for breakfast, he replies, "Aw hell, Mom. I guess I'll have some Cheerios." Mom slaps him -- Whack! The older boy flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear with every step. She locks him in his room and shouts, "You can stay in there until I let you out!" She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4-year-old and asks with a stern voice, "And what do you want for breakfast, young man? "I don't know," he blubbers. "But you can bet your ass it won't be Cheerios!"       about bullshit?      How envious of Harry was Draco?   He seems like the sort of guy that would expect preferential treatment from his peers, then Harry comes along and produces a corporeal patronus in their third year, something that is seventh year magic or beyond. I bet there are some fics on this, but let's hear what you lot think.  Edit: Does anyone care to speculate on what Draco's patronus might have been had he not been branded?

One says to the other, "You ever been picked up by the fuzz?"  "No, but I've been swung around by my tits."      There is a time to put the pipe down. I'm on my fourth bowl of Jack in two hours.      My wife and I watched them all last night, and when it was over we looked at each other with confusion. We were trying to figure out how they would go back to jail, instead of just the ladies and Donna.   Was Carla's face while Perry* is trying to save his buddy that could have waited another month for a kidney in *My Lunch.* I always get misty watching that.   What do you buy?             Sirius or the other Azkaban escapees got their wands back?            Why did JK choose that name? Doesn't it translate literally to 'pretty sticks'?         As each book was coming out, I would re-read in preparation. After 07/DH I have read the series five or six more times, but it has fallen off lately. Now I just read for certain moments or excerpts, since I pretty much know when things happened.  I guess I am saying that I use the books as more of a reference point than reading cover to cover, unless I'm on a long car ride.  What says r/harrypotter? How many times have you read, and do you still?   A man lay sprawled across three entire seats in a theater. When the usher came by and noticed this, he whispered to the man, "Sorry, sir, but you're only allowed one seat." The man groaned but didn't budge. The usher became impatient. "Sir," the usher said, "if you don't get up from there I'm going to have to call the manager." Again, the man just groaned, which infuriated the usher who turned and marched briskly back up the aisle in search of his manager. In a few moments, both the usher and the manager returned and stood over the man. Together the two of them tried repeatedly to move him, but with no success. Finally, they summoned the police. The cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked, "All right buddy, what's your name?" "Sam," the man moaned. "Where ya from, Sam?" the cop asked. And with pain in his voice, Sam replied, "The balcony."   We know from *Snape's Worst Memory* that Remus was a prefect, and he sat and watched James and Sirius *levicorpus* Snape, and the hoopla with Lily, and Remus still did nothing.   Why would you give a werewolf a prefect's badge for starters, and do you think Severus ever held a grudge while he was brewing the wolfsbane?           How a phoenix is born? Are there a limited number to begin with?                  We know that Harry did a bit of magic during his primary school days, that must make a lot of work for obliviators. Some schools have over 3,000 students.   My daughter has a large stuffed chimp that she calls "Monkey" and all I can think of is Grandma's Boy. We just had a lengthy conversation about Monkey, and me being 8.5 I couldn't stop laughing.   Instead he made her a bunch of boats with barnacles and the smell of shrimp.

I enjoyed the bits of Grawp, especially when Harry found out during the Battle of Hogwarts the "Grawp was, in fact, an undersized giant."  My point is, was he unnecessary? Order of the Phoenix was the longest book, and I think it could have been better if JK would have left out the parts about Grawp.        Mine would be Half Blood Prince. What a total mindfreak that was, always trying to find out what Draco was up to, Snape killing Dumbledore, Bill getting mauled, Fawkes singing his lament to the grounds, and the part that always got me was Fleur and Molly at the end.

  DRACO  So, these only work on cells containing double-stranded RNA (it has to do with some very specific chemistry), so DNA viruses like HSV would not be affected by DRACO.  That being said, some of the big emerging viruses (SARS, MERS, Influenza, Dengue, etc) are great targets for this, so it definitely has very important uses - just not in the treatment of herpes.   I have heard of and read some literature to that effect, yes.  It has been studied, although it isn't my particular field.   It is one, but not the only agent which can cause viral meningitis.  Many viruses, through one way or another can cross the BBB, and basically wreak havoc on the brain cells.  It seems largely to be host factors, as in general the virus doesn't really "want" to kill its host.   It is dormant (we say "latent") in neurons in the ganglia of the host.  It never really goes away, but stays in these neurons until conditions are right for it to reactivate as Shingles.  Sometimes it is something as simple as the host's immune system being a little too weak, sometimes the immunity you developed from childhood just wanes.   Generally this is the case, yes.   Yes, it certainly can!  This is largely because steroids can hinder the immune system, and when you do that, all kinds of herpes viruses can reactivate.   This virus is entirely unrelated to herpes simplex virus.  Just for starters, HSV is a double-stranded DNA virus, whereas herpangina is cause by coxsackievirus - a single-stranded (+) RNA virus.  To compare it to something you've heard of: this virus is related to poliovirus.  These are not my specialty, though.   Keep up with your undergrad science classes.  Try to spend the summer between your junior and senior years doing research as an undergrad.  There are lots of programs, called Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs) that can give you an idea of what labwork is like.  It is very important to know if you really want this path.  In the fall of your fourth year, start deciding if you want to do graduate work and identify the areas that interest you.  Look into specific departments or programs offered in the big research universities.    It seems to be a kind of booster effect.  With a recent booster, the body is better at keeping the virus dormant.  Using the shingles vaccine has only been in wide practice for the last 10 years or so, though, so we are still learning a lot about its efficacy.   So, shingles is the reactivated Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, causitive agent of chickenpox).  So, I can't catch shingles from your shingles, but I could probably catch chickenpox from your shingles, if I wasn't already immunized against VZV from earlier in life.   Redditor for 3 years.  Yep, this one checks out.   Figure out if a graduate education is something that you really want to do.  If virology is what you really want, identify some schools with a good reputation for virus work and see if you are interested in those programs. You can even send emails to PIs and ask questions of them, directly, and some will reply.   The very first stimulus can be a number of things, including but not limited to:  emotional stress, menses (in women), local sunburn or normal burn, injury, other infection, etc.  It is thought that each of these stimuli triggers the neuron in one way or another, likely through some signal transduction pathway.  The virus appears to be attuned to these as well, and "recognizes" that, due to the insult, it might be an advantageous time to reactivate.   That is indeed the generally accepted definition in the field.  The definition of "latency" is currently in a state of flux, and we are trying to come up with something more clear.   The "Chromatin Remodellers" which I mention seek to act in just this fashion - perhaps interfering with the enzymes which make a more active or open epigenetic state for the virus, which is essential for reactivation.    Look around at some of the graduate schools that have a very good reputation for virology if you are unsure of what precisely interest you, or if you know what specifically interests you, look to specific labs and see how their program works.  I believe that a standard vaccine will likely have a hard time being 100% effective.  I think other options may prove fruitful, however (see top comments for these ideas)   Check one of the top comments, I link some Lysine study, and other share their stories, as well!   This can and does happen.  It is more likely if the second person is female, but can happen regardless.   That is *definitely* one stimulus.  Others include sunburns, other infections, local injury (burn / cut).   Exactly, we talk about the virus "wanting" and "realizing" and "acting", but it is more accurate to say, "The virus has evolved to react to X stimulus in Y fashion".   PM me or reply right here, buddy.  I can help you out at least a bit.    I like your questions!  i)  I use primary neuronal cells in culture in order to study latency.  Immortalised cells lines aren't great for modelling latency.  ii)  I am not sure about the level of innate immunity with regards to HSV, but I am sure it plays at least some role in controlling the virus.  iii) The primary cultures which I use develop fully-formed axons and network really effectively.  iv)  LATs are the big question - what do they do, how do they do it, etc, etc.  My group is in fact looking directly at the epigenome of latently infected cells, and there are some great stories.  It is clear, for example, that HSV does not control expression through direct methylation of DNA (CpG islands, for instance) but from specific post-translational modification of histone tails!  So, during latency, there is H3K27me3 all over the lytic genes, but more active marks around the LATs.  It has been proposed that the LATs act in some way to direct chromatin remodellers or Polycomb group proteins to epigenetically control the virus.    In another thread I mentioned being in attendance at a workshop where issues of latency were discussed with the very top scientists in the field.  The issues were introduced by having each scientist write a question on a 3x5 card and placing it in a hat, and we drew questions and posed them to the group.  Anyway, my boss asked your question!  The general consensus was that all latently infected neurons probably do not die upon reactivation, but we didn't know for sure!   It is even more than that:  Of the women who have showed no previous symptoms (i.e., had no idea they were infected), 43% (in this study in Canada) had HSV-1 previously.    I mentioned the link to dementia in another comment somewhere.  And there are definite neurological effects:  viral meningitis is possible (very unlikely, but possible)   This kind of depends on what you mean by "cured".  But I have an answer anyway:  Smallpox was "cured" when an effective vaccine was developed and widely distributed.  It is now eradicated in nature and exists only in laboratories (and maybe frozen in some corpses in the arctics).   1.  The virus is generally thought to stay in the neuron where it is latent, but a smoldering cell to cell infection is also possible in the ganglia  2.  Auto-innoculation is definitely possible and happens often.  3. It is possible, but there is not much known about genital - oral transmission rates.  Suffice to say it is likely nonzero, though.  4.  HSV and VZV belong to the alphaherpesviruses.  I think what you are looking for, though, is "neurotropic".   Did see it;  the virus does not exist outside of the host for very long at all, as it is enveloped.  If it dries out or is treated with alcohol or something it will be dead.   I would not worry at all.  The virus you have described has no replication genes, will cause no disease, and likely couldn't infect you unless you injected it directly into your body.  It is now nothing more than a tool for understanding the answer to your question.  It is basically a hammer.  While it is possible to hurt yourself with a hammer, if you use it wisely and correctly, there should be zero issue.   A similar drug Valacyclovir works similarly and has similar results, so that is something else to discuss with your doctor.   Yeah, I really like the epigenetic remodeller approach as well, and I mentioned it in a couple of other comments.  The fact that there are different, competing techniques really leads me to believe that a lot of good work towards a cure (functional or actual) is on the way.   You should be able to find the answer to this elsewhere in the thread.  But, in short, it tricks the virus into using it instead of Guanosine when the virus is replicating its DNA.  This is a problem, because Acyclovir is a chain terminator, and no more bases can be added to the growing chain.  Hence, no more viral DNA replication!   Prions just seem to be protein which encourage other proteins to aggregate in a dominant-negative fashion.  I am not well-versed in their biology, so to speak, but I do not consider them living, although I have not looked into the subject thoroughly.   if ALL of the neurons harboring virus were destroyed, then yes that would likely cure the infection.  But neurons do not grow back, and it seems technically difficult to target only infected ones.  Plus, you may end up needing to destroy a significant number of them.   Such an understanding is exactly what I (and many others) are working on, and I can say with some confidence that we are definitely on the right track.  Some stories I can tell involve signal transduction alerting the neuron, resulting in a remodelling of HSV chromatin into a more active state and then general reactivation followed by the more canonical IE, E, L transcription, but a lot of the research is very new and needs to be further developed before the idea of a complete mechanism is developed.   In between you have the virus laying dormant (latent) in the neurons of your body.  It is not entirely well known why the immune system fails to repress the reactivation of the same virus, but some believe that the new infection along the entire dermatome introduces local inflammation leading to the pain from shingles.  It could just be that the antibodies are very old and you need a booster to help stave off shingles, and this is why the chickenpox vaccine has been recommended for people in their 60's (which I would highly recommend).   It is possible that you were infected in utero, if your mom was experiencing an infection during pregnancy.  This happens with CMV, another herpes virus, for instance.   It is likely a combination of several factors, including:  the strain of HSV, the capability of your immune system, the site of infection, etc.     I don't know the answers to all of these things, but I know some of them, but only in a relative sense.  In general, the more protection (barriers and prophylactic medication) is used, the less is the transmission rate, but it will never be zero, unfortunately.  It appears that female genitalia are more likely to become infected during oral sex than male, likely because the epithelial skin of the labia is more conducive to microabrasions than the skin of the penis.    Bottom line:  there do appear to be differences in the rate of transmission, but it is hard to be absolute about these.  Suffice to say, your risk will never be zero.   Possibly.  I know it is also being undertaken as a method for reducing the latent reservoir of HIV.   Yeah, you're fine!  Don't worry, there's plenty of herpes questions to go around.   First, delivery to these neuronal tissue would likely be done through tissue-specific viral vectors.  Labs in the field have shown that a particular AAV serotype can deliver a transgene to sensory ganglia with 80% efficiency, for example.  Further, once there, it isn't really well known how much of the latent reservoir would be needed to significantly reduce reactivation.  It may prove true that removing even a modest number of latent genomes could tip the scales in favor of the immune system, or other, commensurate treatments.  I am not saying that it will 100% work, as there are still immense theoretical barriers, but I think there is a good enough chance to be excited about it.   Unfortunately, I do not know why that would be the case, as that isn't really my field.  But,  I once trained under an amazing ophthalmologist who specializes in viral infections of the eye.  I will ask if such a thing has been observed before and get back to you.    This is exactly it.  The VZV virus is latent in a ganglion, and when it reactivates you get shingles on the skin surrounding that dermatome (the area where those nerves go).  Because the nerves start near the spine and go around, that is why it is usually only one side.   1.  I think the best answer is that we know some of the receptors that HSV binds to on the cell surface, but not all of them.  Heparan Sulfate, for example, is known to be one HSV receptor.  2.  I answered this elsewhere, but essentially this class of antiviral is a chain-terminator for which the viral polymerase has fairly high affinity, resulting in a retardation of viral DNA replication   There is lots and lots of research investigating what triggers herpesviruses coming out of their latent state, but much of it is very technical.  Suffice to say that the virus needs to do all of these things to enter a lytic cycle:  1.  Switch from condensed DNA to more open, active DNA 2.  Stop latent transcription program and start lytic program 3.  Make new virus in the neuron. 4.  Travel to the end of the nerve (axon) and enter the skin cell at the periphery 5.  Start an entire new infection in the skin cell.  And, each of those steps has MANY things going on.  I was at a meeting specifically devoted to studying Latency in HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV (chickenpox), and there were talks which ran the entire gamut!   I have answered #1 a couple of times earlier.  #2 - I am excited about drugs targetting Chromatin Remodellers.  Basically, chromatin is how DNA is compressed down small enough to fit in the nucleus.  And, in order to reactivate, HSV needs to unravel its chromatin in very specific ways.  New drugs are being discovered which prevent these things from happening.  Maybe we can arrange it where the virus is still always in you, but cannot reactivate at all!   I have posted an interesting study in another l-lysine thread.  Go have a look!   This is very close to true.  I have cited specific figures in other answers, but suffice to say that HSV is a very common and successful human pathogen.   Self-innoculation is pretty common, and can occur.  You may show some symptoms, but you could definitely be asymptomatic, as well.  If you already have antibodies from a previous infection, it is less likely that you get infected elsewhere, but is still entirely possible.   I have mentioned this elsewhere, but here is a note from a workshop where the investigators looking at developing an HSV vaccine discuss the current state of knowledge, the problems, future goals/solutions, etc.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14000917   I really like /u/MentalMarketer 's answer, and can second much of it.  I have known people who did PhD work in virology and then bail to do something else, and I have seen Post-docs join my lab who came from non-virology backgrounds, too.  I agree that it would be easier to do more advanced virology work (Post doc in academia or industry, for example) if your PhD thesis was at least related to virology, but it is not 100% necessary.  In reality, if you do good work as a graduate student and have the applicable skills, most virology labs will insist that they can teach you the virology.   Soap will probably not help.  And, bottom line is that condoms will make transmission less likely, but they will not reduce the risk to zero.   Acyclovir and Valcyclovir both work in essentially the same way, and I think once I explain their mechanism of action you will feel better.  These drugs are known as nucleoside analogues.  This means that they are VERY closely related to the nucleosides which make up the bases (A, C, G, T) of your DNA and, more importantly, the viral DNA ( in particular, these are analogues of the "G").  But, there is one important difference - when these agents are used, they **completely terminate** the replicating DNA.  Hence, they are "chain terminators".  The reason they are effective antivirals is that the viral protein which replicates DNA is *more efficient* at using the analogue than is your own protein.  So, the virus uses the chain terminator better than you do, basically incorporating a broken part into its DNA, preventing viral replication!  As to side effects, there are always going to be some, but the appear to happen fairly infrequently (1% of patients).   The Shingles vaccine is not effective at treating HSV outbreaks, unfotunately.  While VZV and HSV are related, they are different enough that you don't really see protective cross-reactivity between these viruses.   I have not personally heard of HSV infection of the retina, but infection of the cornea is a fairly common occurrence (See [Herpes Stromal Keratitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_of_the_eye))   I was not aware of this particular treatment, but maybe I should have been.  Here's an abstract from 1987!:  A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of oral L-lysine monohydrochloride for the prevention and treatment of recurrent herpes simplex (HSV) infection was conducted. The treatment group was given L-Lysine monohydrochloride tablets (1,000 mg L-lysine per dose) 3 times a day for 6 months. A total of 27 (6 male and 21 female) subjects on L-lysine and 25 (6 male and 19 female) subjects on placebo completed the trial. The L-lysine treatment group had an average of 2.4 (p less than 0.05) less HSV infections, symptoms were significantly (p less than 0.05) diminished in severity and healing time was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05). L-Lysine appears to be an effective agent for reduction of occurrence, severity and healing time for recurrent HSV infection.  TL;DR - A 1987 study ([here] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3115841)) shows that l-lysine appears to be effective.   This has been mentioned in a number of the other comments, but it is definitely possible to transmit HSV despite having no symptoms.  This is because it is becoming clear that infected individuals often shed the virus without clinical signs of an outbreak.  Since there is less virus being shed during this time than when there are visible sores, it is less likely to transmit while "dormant" compared to durin an outbreak but it is still possible.  TL;DR -  You most definitely **CAN** transmit the virus even if it appears to be dormant.   /u/Felonessthrowaway and /u/ReneeAraneae have great answers to this question.   HSV seems to be a reasonable oncolytic agent, likely as effective as poxvirus and adenovirus ones.  It appears to me that depending on the particular cancer, one of these viruses may be the most effective agent to develope/use.    For gene vectors, I am less sure.  It seems difficult to get transient expression for the life of the host due to the virus' ability to nearly completely shut down its transcriptional profile.  I have not done research on EBV, largely because that is a gammaherpesvirus, and is just very different.  I am not very well versed on EBV's oncogenic capacity, but I know that KSHV is very, very oncogenic.   Valtrex for the symptoms is the best thing that I can recommend.  There are a lot of anecdotal treatments like ice cubes or certain foods or whatnot, but I can't say for certain that those work.     IT is largely the strength of the person's immune system.  Also, it is pretty clear that some HSV strains are far more pathenogenic than others.  So, one strain may more effectively go latent after a very modest acute infection - while another strain may cause more damage.   There are investigators out there who think that most of the time HSV reactivates and tries to undergo a reproductive cycle, the immune system catches it and everything is fine.  But, sometimes, it appears that the virus overcomes this, and is able to productively infect again.  It may be related to more individual reactivation evens (so, 10 neurons pop off instead of just 1 or 2, for example).   You can certainly acquire the virus in the absence of visible outbreaks.  There is always a non-zero risk associated with sexual contact.  I believe that since many people are asymptomatic, and generally handle the infection and outbreak fairly well, that there has not been much of a push to practice safe oral sex.  In fact, oral sex is considered inherently, "safe" - but that is likely not the case.   I think the greatest misconception likely involves the social stigma that many associate with HSV infection (1 or 2).  HSV is a very successful pathogen.  As I mentioned in other posts, ~54% of Americans were found to be seropositive for HSV-1, and ~16% for HSV2 (taking 14-49 year olds) in America.  In addition, even taking *only women who have shown no signs of HSV infection, ever*, a study in Canada showed that 45% of the women were HSV-1+, and 2.5% were HSV-2+!  Hence, the virus infects most people, and many of them are not even aware.  There can be complications associated with HSV infection which are pretty unfortunate, but largely the stigma associated with a diagnosis is far out of proportion.   I gave another answer similar to this, but yours has an extra element.  I think that reforming the definition of life to include viruses would be a meaningful endeavor.  It would be very tricky, though, as viruses are very different from the other organisms that we classify as "living".   There are lots of studies out there with regard to how many people have HSV.  The most recent one performed by the CDC (hence, looking only at Americans) can be seen [here] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24136792)  TL;DR - using 2005-2010 data for 14-49 year olds, they found that 53.9% were HSV-1 positive, and 15.7% were HSV-2 positive.  I believe that the "most accurate test" that you describe was an Antibody-based Western Blot test (which are pretty expensive).  These do have false-negative rates, but they are fairly low, as the Western Blot is the gold-standard for HSV seropositivity testing.   The answer to this question is not entirely understood, but I know the general hypotheses:  1.  The immune system may become better and better at controlling reactivation events over the life of the host.  2.  Reactivating virus may damage the neurons, to the point of reducing the latent reservoir over time.  3.  The virus may become less sensitive to reactivation stimuli over time, possibly due to #2     It is possible that he contracted it from the girl, and it is possible that he had HSV asymptomatically beforehand and he is experiencing a reactivation event.  It is really hard to tell which of these is the case, unfortunately.  I would think that the former would be more likely, but it is near impossible to be certain of such things absent some epidemiological investigation of some kind.   This is WAY less of a stretch than you seem to think.  It is very possible to become infected through contact with someone who was shedding asymptomatically.   I am on the side of the debate that viruses should be considered living organisms.  There are plenty of higher organisms which require others to reproduce or live (any obligate parasite, really).  In my view, viruses have simply perfected this to the point that some are capable of existing and reproducing despite their modest genetic load.  As for how they came to exist, I believe that very early on, one group of "organisms" came to parasitize another group - taking advantage of the "host's" cellular processes.  When that was enough to reproduce, there was no reason to continue coding for its own versions of these processes.  Here's another wild idea:  what if virus are so ancient that they were a primary evolutionary force in the development of the rest of life, as we know it?  In essence, what if being targetted by one kind of virus versus another lead to the Eukaryote / Bacteria / Archaea split?      This is not my area of expertise, but it appears that there is some correlation between particular infectious burdens (IB) and Alzheimer's Disease, including a couple of herpesviruses like HSV and CMV.  [This] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910016) recent publication shows such correlation, for example.  The hypothesis is that infection and/or inflammation could be and underlying cause for these kinds of diseases.  However, as many have noted, correlation does not imply causation.  In addition, since seropositivity to these viruses is greater than 90% in the older population, it may be difficult to parse this out in this fashion.  So, for my money, the jury is still out on this question.  But, I am sure more studies are being undertaken, as this is a very important question.   Link:  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/28vuzr/science_ama_series_iama_virologist_who_studies/   So, viruses are awesome. They are little bundles of genetic material that only really care about making more little bundles of genetic material - and some of them do it really, really well! Take the herpesviruses, for instance: it has been suggested that this family has existed for over 100 millions years, and different species have evolved to infect most mammals, some fish, and even bivalves. This amazing evolutionary success is likely due to a particular infection strategy: all herpesviruses have an acute (or lytic) infection where they replicate and cause some damage to their host, but they also have a latent infection where they stop replicating, and basically just chill out undetected until they want to wake up again. For my virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2 (and to a lesser extent, the Chickenpox virus, VZV), the infection follows this basic narrative:   1. The virus infects mucosal epithelial (skin) cells and replicates, destroying the cells and causing lesions.   2. New virus enters into the nerve endings nearby and travels to the body of the neuron. Here it will become silent, ever waiting until . . .   3. The virus reactivates! It will replicate in the neuron, travel back to the nerve ending, and re-infect the same site of the initial infection - and then maybe someone else.   4. Rinse/Repeat!   With those basics in mind - what have you always wanted to know about Herpes? What about Chickenpox / Shingles? Or about studying them for a living, navigating a Ph.D., giving talks at international meetings, or anything else that comes with the life of a Virologist? AMA!   EDIT:  I had a great time answering questions and discussing aspects of the study of viruses.  I think it is incredibly important for the general population to have a good grasp of the basics of virology, as it is an important research topic that oftentimes feels very intimidating and scary to a layperson, so I am always happy to discuss virology!  I spend a solid three hours answering your questions, and thoroughly enjoyed it!  Thanks to the Mods at /r/Science for the opportunity, and thanks to all of you who showed interest!  EDIT2:  I would also like to point out to other virologists how popular this AMA was, and suggest to them that the readers of /r/Science would likely be interested in their work, as well.  I got questions about HPV, HIV, Chickengunya, Ebola, Flu, and others!  If you are studying a particular virus, consider what you can teach an audience about your pathogen - it benefits everyone!

Sometimes, I try to figure out my favorite Simpsons' jokes that fit a very narrow description.  One day, I came up with this one:    What is the best joke in "The Simpsons" where the punchline is only a single word or sound?  Here, I have an album with a few of my suggestions:  http://imgur.com/a/nlNif  (Homer's, "Uhh . . . yeah!" may be stretching the, "One word" rule, but it is close).  Any other submissions?         Here's how it happened for me, Patriots fans:  The Broncos win their first two Super Bowls, and I am on cloud nine.  The next few years are kind of a bummer as Elway retires and Terrell Davis suffers an unfortunate injury.  Boo-hoo, I know.  The Rams win the next Super Bowl, and by the time they make it back, it is as gigantic favorites against your home team.  By then, I have grown tired of the "Greatest Show on Turf", I dig that the Pats just sent the Raiders and Steelers home crying, and I just want to see a good, close game.  I didn't really think that the Patriots could win, and when they did I was very happy for them.  Good on ya, Pats!  Then, if you'll remember, you guys missed the playoffs the next year before going on to win two more Super Bowls.  You guys instantly became the thing I was always rooting against:  a dynasty.  I am not happy about dynasties (unless they are Broncos one, obviously).  I hated the Cowboys in the early 90's, and if I would have been conscious in the 80's, I would have hated the 49ers, too.  So, when the Pats became the early 2000's dynasty, and you all felt like they were God's gift to football, they instantly became very easy to hate.  It was part jealousy, 3 SB in 4 years is incredible.  It was part begrudging respect.  And it was part disappointment for not being able to field a team which could contend with you.  That changed soon thereafter.  In 2005, the Broncos gave Bellichick and Brady their first playoff loss, and it was SWEET!  Clearly, the Broncos flubbed the rest of that post-season and were downright mediocre for a long time afterwards, while the Patriots took on a new, more sinister feel.  They set records, and sneered at people while doing it.  They had the gall to try to challenge the '72 Dolphins.  And so forth.  They were so easy to hate.  I am not ashamed to say that your first loss to the Giants was my favorite Super Bowl I have ever seen, except the two won by my Broncos.  And it never changed' the Patriots were always near the top, always contending, while by boys were stagnant.  I hoped that stealing McDaniels from you would help, but he turned out to be a smarmy fratboy who was better at fist-pumping and X's and O's than he was at running a team.  Even through the whole Tebow fiasco it was clear that you were the superior team, and I loved hating you for it, despite how rarely I got to celebrate a win against you.  Now, to the reason that I decided to write this little diatribe.  New England Patriots:  while I may despise the way the media gets all over your genital region, and hate the way some of your fans handle themselves, I have so much damn respect for your organization, win or lose.  You play football the right way, and even though you might be The Evil Empire, I would be proud to have Bellichick as a coach, or Brady as a quarterback.  I feel like Kraft and Bowlen are two of the best owners in sports, and I think their respective records support that opinion.   Honestly, this QB rivalry is in its winter years.  I don't know how much longer Bellichick will continue coaching, nor how similar our teams will look down the road.  But let me tell you this:  We will play many times in the future, and I hope many of them are on the way to the Lombardi trophy.  Because it is a damn pleasure to be tested by the best franchises this league has to offer.  I am glad that we came out on top this time, but I fully expect that it could be different in the future.           In the first 3 quarters, the Broncos have outscored their opposition in the playoffs 37-3.  Keep on it, Defense.  You guys have played your hearts out.

All over the place, I am seeing plenty of analysis talking about how the Chargers have a very good chance of the upset, how they are the nightmare match up for the Broncos, how Peyton plays poorly against them, etc, etc.  I think there is a big piece missing from this analysis, and I hope to point it out here.  Largely, I will show how the game in Denver was basically a perfect storm for a Chargers victory, with factors which will likely not be present this weekend.  Let's begin with the premise that the Chargers are the team with less talent.  I think even the most die-hard Chargers fans would agree with that premise.  Of course, this does not mean that the Chargers can't win or wont win, just that talent levels are skewed against them.  So, if that is the case, how do they win?  The answer has already been given, although not in these terms.  When you are the less-talented team, it is to your advantage to do whatever you can to prevent that talent gap from being exploited by the other team.  As such, you want to shorten the game by running the ball and having a high TOP. The Chargers are excellent at this, as we have seen in the two previous meetings.  Unfortunately, this only works if the Chargers score touchdowns, not field goals.  Taking 10 mins off the clock to score 3, only to let Denver score 7 in 3 minutes accomplishes nothing.  Another option is to use non-traditional, low-percentage/high reward play-calling.  We have also seen this (fake punt in game 1).  I would predict a great deal of this coming up.  Expect surprise onsides-kicks, going for it on 4th down (especially in the "Maroon Zone", the area between the 20-40 where distance of the 4th down try may make going for it advantageous), and maybe even a couple trick plays (be on the watchout for Ronnie Brown-led HB Passes, especially).  Finally, another way to shorten the talent gap is to put both teams in a difficult scenario.  The more-talented team is dragged down to the other team's level (or closer to it, at least) in these kinds of scenarios.  Example of this could be inclement weather (very cold, snowy, windy, rainy), very bad officiating going both ways, playing on a short week, etc.  You could also place injuries to key players in this category, if you wanted.  So, let's look at the games vs. the Chargers in greater detail.  Game 1 had the Broncos, relatively healthy and of a bye week.  TOP was dominated by the Chargers, who extended drives with 4th-down conversions, but their first two red-zone trips ended in FG, and a third at the end of the half resulted in a missed FG.  Manning and Co. easily put up 28 points and the Chargers had to play catch-up.  It is clear that in this game, the Chargers failed to abrogate the talent gap.  Their tactics to do so were not effective, and they didn't get any help from the schedule, injuries, referees, or anything else.  By contrast, look at the game in Denver.  Off the bat, there were only 4 days between games for each team.  This clearly helps the less-talented team.  In addition, the Broncos were playing their first game this season w/o Wes Welker, necessitating adjustments for the offense.  Additionally, on defense we were forced to but Kayvon Webster as one of our two cornerbacks.  The Chargers were able to extend drives and score touchdowns, and forced the Denver offense into three straight three-and-outs.  Denver had season lows in both possessions and rushing yards.  This, along with a very timely interception, allowed the Chargers to prevail.  I submit that the game this weekend will more resemble the first game played than the last game:  the Broncos are off a bye, with Welker, and relatively healthy, whereas the Chargers have played recently and are a little banged up (starting Center and RB, esp).  In game, it will be key for Denver to get the Chargers off the field on third downs, especially in the Red Zone.  If the Chargers are forced to kick field goals, they will lose.  Building an early lead, or at least offensive rhythm will go a long way towards keeping the defense rested and keep good flow to the game.  If this is the case, the Broncos should be able to play with the lead and eventually force the Chargers to take additional risks.  At that point, a single play could bury their chances.  tl;dr - The Broncos are the more-talented team and must realize that the Chargers will make a concerted effort to reduce that gap through their preparation and gameplay, in effect replicating the second meeting between the two teams.                         I am lazy, so I was scrolling through Netflix the other day and came across Jumanji. Having not seen it for years, I decided that I could watch it while relaxing on the internet. By the end, I was horrified and confused and disturbed by the power of this game. Not because it can materialize infinite creatures, but because it is basically a time machine a la Primer.  Basic plot: Kids start playing Jumanji game in 1969. Sarah is bad, Alan is worse. 30-ish years later, Judy and Peter start playing. They are a little better, continue through the game. There's monsters and baddies, etc. Game ends. Then what? We are back in 1969. Alan and Sarah are young again, the entire world is exactly as they left it, with one exception: they still have all the knowledge that they acquire in the previous timeline (evidence by the fact that Alan attempts to find Judy and Peter).  This makes Jumanji, the game, a very powerful tool. Imagine being able to continue life over and over again, changing your course each time. All you have to do is start the game with a roll:  Player 1: First roll. Game start. Time-0 established.  Wait X years  Player 2: Throw dice. Game continues  Player 1 and 2: Finish game quickly. If you survive, return to time 0, with all the knowledge of the world acquired since time 0. We know that each new roll will supersede the previous roll, like when Judy rolls the dice to stop Alan from drowning in quicksand. Also, the track is very short, only 30 spaces. Since the average die roll on 2d6 is 7, you should finish in 4 or 5 moves, very easy to do with two people.  We know that things play out essentially the same way the next time through the timeline, because Peter and Judy almost have their parents killed in the same way. And we also know that things can be changed, because Alan's dad is still living in the second timeline. Thus, you are perfectly capable of making lots of money (think Biff in BttF:PII) and / or just trying out a different life.  That game is NUTS. Why did they throw it away?  Edit:  The words of the Jumanji game:  Jumanji:  A game for those who seek to find *a way to leave their world behind*.  You roll the dice to move your token.  Doubles get another turn.  The first to reach the end wins.  Adventurers Beware: Do not begin unless you intend to finish.  *The exciting consequences of the game* will vanish only when a player has reached Jumanji and called out its name.  (italics mine)  To me, this shows that:  a).  The game creates and alternate reality. b).  Finishing the game collapses the alternate reality, returning the players to their state just before the game began.  tl;dr - Jumanji is OP, should not be thrown away.    I am lazy, so I was scrolling through Netflix the other day and came across *Jumanji*.  Having not seen it for years, I decided that I could watch it while relaxing on the internet.

While we were expected to work hard during the week, the program planned a fair amount of excursions into the surrounding areas.  We went canoeing, took trips to springs and estuaries, and even drove down to the Florida Keyes for a long weekend trip (a future story).  One trip we had planned was for a snorkeling trip off the gulf coast of Florida, a place called Cedar Key.  Unfortunately, the Cedar Key trip overlapped with a very important date:  the midnight release of the final Harry Potter book!  I had already planned (in secret), to head out to the local Walmart with Geode and Browneye, two **huge** Harry Potter fans, in order to get ourselves a copy.  When we learned that the Keys trip would interfere with us, we needed a new plan . . .   Be me, three days before Cedar Key trip.   Read details of trip in email from chaperone  drive two hours on day 1, stop at such-and-such hotel, etc. etc.   Cross reference route with booksellers   [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Animation3.gif) Walmart *across the street* from our first hotel!   Inform Geode, Browneye of the plan:  get to hotel ~ 8pm, eat dinner, camp in Walmart to get book @ midnight.   Theyre in!    Trip is getting started, we are taking two large passenger vans.    Beginning of trip uneventful, Browneye lets our plan be known.   No one else in our van is willing to stay out until midnight at Walmart, but one girls asks Browneye if shell pick her up a copy.   Pull into Sleep-Easy motel, can spy Walmart across the street.    Location is your basic hicktown stripmall.  Grocery store, a few restaurants, Walmart, etc.    Dinner is consumed, Geode and I head to the grocery to get snacks for the night and next day.   [orw] (http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/high_five_snl.gif) We find *Harry Potter Cupcakes*, six-pack.   We figure we have plenty of cupcakes and food, and return to the hotel to show BrownEye our terrific find.   I am carrying most food, Geode has cupcakes in the see-through tin.    Knock on Browneyes door.    Knocking continues after I have stopped.   Getting faster.   And closer.   Could a jackhammer have fallen over in a bowling alley?    Nope, just Hamhock, stampeding towards us.  It could be me, but I think she is getting heavier.  About one month into our REU, and I dont think Ive seen her do anything exercise excepting the futbol game.    Hamhock:  Ohmigawd, I thought you guys were going to leave me.  I heard about your Harry Potter plans from Fitgirl.  I wanna come too!  Its been forever since I hung out with you, test_subject9587!    Fucking Fitgirl.    Okay, fine, come sit with us.  Whatever.   Unload the food in Browneyes room and show everyone the cupcakes.     Each cupcake has a Harry Potter plastic ring on it, embedded in a thick frosting of two colors (Gold/Crimson for Gryffindor, and Purple/Green for Slytherin).   Hamhock has to have one now.  Argues, Itll be like pre-gaming the snacks!    Sure, whatever.  Mention to everyone not to eat the plastic ring.    Hamhock opines, Ha ha, test_subject9587.  Youre so funny in between bites.    We decide against eating the rest of the cupcakes, and will bring them to give out to someone else in line.    Bring a few other snacks too.  I carry some, Hamhock has some, and Browneye and Geode have blankets/pillows.  Head to the Walmart.  Hamhock bringing up the rear.    Harry Potter line is very short, we are one of the first ten people.  They even have the special edition available!    We start chatting and munching.  Talk about predictions, which books/movies we liked the best, etc.    I say, Goblet of Fire was probably my favorite, but that last book sure had a great ending.  Ive got a friend back at school who even thinks that Dumbledore isnt actually dead . . .    Hamhock slaps my knee and leaves her hand there:  OHMIGHAWD!, ME TOO! See because you never see the body and where did his ring go and why would he say this and R.E.B stands forandDumbledoreisawesomeand . . .    Tell her to calm down, and scoot out of her meager reach.  She scoots too.   Geode gives me a queer look.  Kind of like [this] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tumblr_md5h6phUZY1rnvwt1.gif).    I head off to the bathroom, wander around the store a little after I am done (scoping out movies and videogames and such).    When I get back, it is only Geode waiting in line; other people have wandered off.    Geode:  You will not believe what Hamhock just said.    Let me guess:  Shes hungry, and if off buying deep-fried something?    No, close though.  She says shes into you.    [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NeoNo.gif)     Why.  **BUT, WHY!!!**   Geode explains that we got off to a bad start, but since then:  1.  I defended her during soccer game, 2.  She only wanted to watch movie because I would be there, 3. Realized after getting mad that she was fucking it all up, so got much nicer.   I suspect some new horror is in store, but I am not too troubled.  Afterall, shell get the idea if I make it clear enough.    Hamhock returns, sits down.  Geode and I have hatched a plan.    Geode, So, test_subject9587, how is your girlfriends summer internship going?   Hamhock turns her head way too fast; is clearly taken aback by this.   test_subject9587 . . . you have a g/f?   Yes, I explain.    For the next half hour or so, Hamhock makes vainly subtle attempts to learn as much as she can about my relationship back home.   Oh, that sounds interesting.  So, what kind of internship is your g/f working at?   She sounds nice, howd you two meet?   I am trying to picture what kind of girl would be able to nab you  whats she look like? (**seriously?**)   I say, Oh, shes pretty nice.  A little shorter than I am, weighs a little more, but pretty athletic.  One time I nailed her in the eye when we were playing racquetball.  It was definitely her fault.   Oh, so shes one of those exercise is life kind of girls, huh?   Not sure how to respond to that, change subject.   Some little kids (maybe 7 and 10 years old?) walk by with their mom, and they are *adorable*.  They are both dressed in robes and have hats and wands.    I start talking to them about Harry Potter, and ask them if they are excited.  Shocker:  they are.    I tell them, Well, if it is okay with your mom, we have two extra *Harry Potter Cupcakes*.  Would you like them?    They look up at their mom, who nods to them and has a very appreciative look in her eye.   Hamhock:  But, test_subject9587, we dont have those cupcakes anymore.    Me:  Why not?  I know the answer before I finish my question . . .    Well, I ate them already.   [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dean-what-gif.gif)   [little girls fw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/unfair.gif)   [mothers fw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/maad.gif)   Kids are crying now.  Mother says, Thanks a lot.  And I mumble and embarrassed apology.  They head back to their spot in line.    I turn to Hamhock, What.  The.  Fuck.  Why did you eat the other cupcakes?  When?    I ate them on the way over, after you said you were giving them away.    Yes.  **To other people**.  Not to you.  You already had one.  Then you just scarffed down two more on our way over here?  And then you didnt even tell us?    I didnt think it was a big deal  . . . my blood sugar was feeling low and I was hungry    It wouldnt have been a big deal, *if* you had told us.  Then I wouldnt have accidentally tortured an entire family!  And how were you hungry?  We had dinner an hour earlier, and you already had one cupcake!    Silence.   She blurts out, Fuck this, I am going back to the room.   At least five separate children gasp at her outburst.    Hamhock struggles to her feet and waddles away in huff, without a book.  Everyone in the near vicinity who witnessed the event feels terrible.  Except for Geode, who is smiling.   Whats so funny?    I wonder how hot she is for you now . . .    Get bent, Geode.  Get bent.  tl;dr  I promise cupcakes to pre-teen wizards; Hamplanet has already inhaled them.  Be sure to join me next time as I tell the story about the trip to the Florida Keys, and how three of the girls get a man fired in, Episode V:  Thin Privilege is Enjoying Paradise          Episode I can be found [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fh79x/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_or_how_i/) and Episode II [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fqn6d/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_episode_ii/).  Also, this story is very movie-centric, and so may contain spoilers for: Fargo, The Departed, and minor spoilers for a couple more.   A few days after the events in Episode II, I was regaling Geode with the story of how Hamhock announced her retirement from the game of pick-up futbol, and she smiled and laughed more than I had ever seen as we both continued eating dinner.  See, at this particular REU, there was something of a campus, where the students lived.     There were four apartments, a few trailers, and one set of dormitories.  Roomie and I, being the only two guys, were given one of the four apartments, and the girls each got a dorm room to themselves.  The dorms had a common kitchen, and a common entertainment room with a TV, where our apartment had its own kitchen, and also Roomies TV and PS2 in the living room.  Honestly, Roomie and I **really** lucked out.   Geode and I had started hanging out more, and when it came out that we like the same kinds of food, we made it an ongoing plan to cook food together in the apartment kitchen once every few days or so.  This was extremely helpful for her, as she was already getting tired of the dirty dishes, messy counter tops, and food pieces in the communal kitchen.  She also had a sneaking suspicion that Hamhock was taking small portions of food from her, and maybe from everyone.  Also, it is much easier to cook portions for two people than one person for some things.   Later in the evening we were watching a movie from my collection, something with either Alec Baldwin or Mark Walhberg.  Eventually, I said, This movies fine, but if you want to see a *serious* movie with this guy in it, you should watch *The Departed*.  When she said she hadnt seen it, we resolved to watch it sometime over the weekend.  It turned into an event by Friday, as almost no one had seen the flick, and a couple of girls who had wanted to see it again.  One of those girls was Hamhock.  Greentext, go!   Be me, ready to blow some ladies minds with *The Departed*.  Take movie, drink, minor snack from apartment to dorm common room.  Avengers assemble!  It is Geode, Browneye, Footsteps, Hamhock and myself.  Footsteps is a very average-looking girl with brown hair and one of those almost-pretty faces, probably 55, 170lbs.  Her mother is a researcher at the university, and she has always loved helping out in the lab.  Definitely not Hamplanet status, and I don't think I ever heard any Fatty Logic, but maybe a little overweight.   Browneye and Geode greet me, are excited for the movie.  Hamhock says nothing.  She has two bowls of popcorn, one on the arm of the sofa, one on the coffee table.  Also a bag of chips.  Hamhock looks a little steamed.  Well, maybe not steamed, that would be too healthy.  Deep-fried.  Whatever.  I sit next to Geode and prepare the movie.  itisawesome.mp4  Opening lines from Nicholson moves me from six to midnight.  Hamhock is basically double-fisting chips and popcorn (drink kind, not sex kind).    Hamhock is the woodchipper, and chip crumbs  / popcorn are poor Steve Buscemi from *Fargo*.  random chattering occurs throughout the movie, but mostly people are paying attention.  Hamhock tromps away to the restroom or something.  I notice that the popcorn and bags are miraculously not empty so I elbow Geode and make a hand motion to them.  [hfw] (http://i.imgur.com/FmwryTi.gif)  She explains, Those are ALL Hamhocks snacks. She made a huge deal about how she wasnt going to share them because she paid for them, and she thinks that someone already ate one of her popcorn bags.   I bought a pack of eight, and I had one Saturday, two on Monday, and then  . . . etc etc.  Whatever, no big deal.  Hamhock returns, flops back into position, and the force of her sitting down propels a single kernel of popcorn into the air (she must have dropped it somewhere on the couch).  Movie continues, gets to some really good part where Leo is chasing Matt Damon through the streets.   Browneye says, God, Leo is so hot in this movie!   I say, Well, obviously!  Hes so attractive that **I** might fuck him!  But seriously, as long as youre not watching *Whats Eating Gilbert Grape*, when is that NOT true?   At that moment, there is a small gurgling noise, as if a mire somewhere is bubbling up noxious fumes.  Maybe someone in the distance emits a screech, maybe claws draw across a chalkboard.  Maybe fuck yourself.   Oh, its just Hamhock, working up some angries.  I have misspoken, and Hamhock is pissed.  A central character in *Gilbert Grape* is a morbidly obese woman who cant even leave her house.  Obviously, I intended this comment as a slight against Mrs. *A Fridge Too Far*, here.  She says, Oh, so now youre going to make fun of fat people **and** retarded people, huh?  justajoke.zip   Well, it isnt even funny.  And why is it Leonardo Dicaprio who is hot?  That kind of physique is only available to like 1% of people, if that.  Its *gen-et-tics* (she enunciates very clearly and slowly, like this is a foreign concept to four biology majors).  And to get it, he had to diet and work out and basically torture/starve himself.  Then people like you call it, attractive, like your opinion in the only one that matters.    Look Hamhock, says Geode, Were just watching the movie and talking.  No one here is attacking you or anything.  Just relax.  Have some more popcorn.  Possibly the wrong thing to say.   Hey, Twiggy, I am not taking eating advice from a stick like you.  I am just fine as I am, thank you.  People back at my school LURVE MAH CUHRVES! (okay, maybe she didnt say it *exactly* like that).  And you know what?  This movie sucks anyways because  **LEO DIES AT THE END!!!**  [are you fucking kidding me?] (http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/288/304/2fe.jpg)  Upset with *Forest Gunt* for her ridiculously petty outburst, I say, Well, thanks for ruining the fun.  You sure seem to be good at that.   Its your fault.  You dont know how hard it is to have bad metabolism genetics, so you go around insulting bigger people like me and Footsteps.   Footsteps:  Watch your mouth, I aint nearly as big as you, and I dont think he was being mean.  Just trying to be funny.  Like all of us.  God, chill out!  With that, *Assablanca* heaves herself up, knocks the half-eaten bowl of popcorn off of the chair and onto the floor, and leaves for her dorm room.   Watch another 10 minutes of movie in silence.   *Apollo 13 Tons* comes out of her room in a huff, takes her snack bowls and chips, and retreats back to her dungeon of shame-eating and self-loathing.   We vainly attempt to stifle our guffaws until she is gone, but eventually burst out laughing.   Geode recovers first and deadpans, Does Leo really die at the end?    Oh, be still my heart . . .    Finish movie.  *Everyone* dies.    Browneye is upset with the movie, does not approve.    Also, pissed that Hamhock fucked up the ending  Browneye was waiting for the Leo kill, and it took her out of the movie.  prettyreasonableopinion.txt  have 10-15 min discussion about the merits of movie.  I love it, so does Geode, with Browneye hating it and Footsteps lukewarm.   *A Clockwork Orange Chicken Bowl* emerges from her room, still upset.    I say, Hey, Hamhock, were kinda split on the movie  . . . Did you like it?    She completely ignores me as she is looking for more food.   I say, Fine; but you really should come over here and clean up your mess.  This is a communal room, and I have come to understand that this popcorn is ALL YOURS.   [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif) Okay, yeah.  Sorry about that.  I think I over-reacted a little bit.  Ill clean that up once you guys leave.  And, test_subject9587, sorry for exploding on you  I am sure you wouldnt mean to hurt me.   What new devilry is this?  Hamhock's adventures are not over yet.  Join us next time for *REU:  Episode IV:  Hammy Planet and the Deathly Hollows Cupcakes*, a story of the midnight release of book seven.  tl;dr:  Fatty inhales snacks, flips out, ruins surprise ending to movie as retribution.    Part I of the Hamhock saga can be found [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fh79x/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_or_how_i/).  There was only minor fallout from the events dramatized in Episode I.  Since everyone had just met, most people were quick to give the benefit of the doubt to Hamhock and me regarding our exchange at the pizza night.  Basically, the other students in the program didnt want to judge either Hamhock or me too harshly for what they thought was just a misunderstanding (or, at worst, a good ol foot-in-the-mouth kind of thing).  That is, of course, except for Geode.    A few days after I arrived, I ran into her in the common kitchen, cooking some noodles or something, and I asked her if she was okay after what had happened.  She said that she would be fine, but that she had been thin-shamed by people like Hamhock before, and it was always by a person who turned out to be *very* shitty, so she wasnt holding out hope that Hamhock would just be a benign presence.  She also thanked me for standing up for her, and the resulting conversation established her as the person with whom I was most happy to spend time.  The first couple of weeks of the program move on without a hitch, everyone getting established into their labs and projects.  Then came the fateful afternoon when we learned that the permanent residents of the facility (grad students and some faculty), would get together for a little pick-up futbol (soccer) on Tuesdays.  With that, we engage greentext.   Be Tuesday.  Spend 8 hours in lab. Email checking at end of day.   email from another student, says there is futbol game if folk are interested  Be not good at futbol  Decide to go anyway.  What the hell, it is just for fun, right?  Somewhere, there is a rumbling, a massive hungry stomach, a portent of just how un-fun *some people* can make something as casual as a pick-up game of anything.  Head to the field where there is futbol.    Set-up is low-key.   Some of the grad students are from Europe, Africa, etc.  Point being: they have played futbol often in their youths, they have made small goals out of PVC pipe (think, Hockey or Lacrosse sized), they came to game.   other students arrive, I shall introduce a couple more here:  Be not BrownEye, an athletic brunette who played futbol in high school.  Kinda fussy and bitchy, but a nice girl overall  Be not YoungGirl, a rising sophomore who somehow managed to get accepted to this program despite having very little experience in biology.  Also a very nice girl, not so into sports, just having fun with new people   Be not Fitgirl, who just got back from some kind of jog, saw we were up to something, and wanted to join.   In addition to these folk, there were grad students, a couple of faculty, and some lab techs.  11 folk in total   uneventeams.sadface   Oh wait, maybe this bus in the distance will contain a player to join us!    Wait a second, Jurassic Park ground tremors register in our bones    The bus is moving too slow.   Thats no bus.  Its a ~~space station~~ hamplanet.  Hamhock walks up and asks us what we are doing.  [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bert-n-ernie.gif) Oh, Hamhock, were just getting a futbol game together!  [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/1LuJmS0.gif) is hear her say, Oh, that sounds fun, I want to play!   No worries, maybe it is good that she is trying to exercise?   Maybe she just wants to have fun and bond with others in the program?   Maybe this will be fine.  [Maybe] (http://i.imgur.com/seh6p.gif)   Teams are picked, and Hamhock is on my team.   westillgotthis.pro  The game starts, and I am pretty horrible.  I cant really dribble, I have a hard time guarding the better players, and the ball rarely goes where I want it to when I kick it.  But, I have always been minorly athletic, and begin to turn a figurative corner.  Hamhock slowly jogs in the vicinity of where the ball was less than 15 seconds ago.  She is not fast, she is not coordinated, but if one squints you could convince yourself that she was trying.  I decide against telling her that she should pretend the ball is a cookie or wafer or something.  Also, bonus points for not bitching.     This is hard, it is so humid out today!  Well, scratch that I guess.   One of the better players on my team puts a centering pass about a foot off the ground in front of the goal, and all I have to do it stick my foot out and the ball easily deflects into the goal.  fuckyeah.mp4  Hamhock has gotten tired; she makes no pretenses about vaguely following the ball around.  Now she stands in the middle of the field, walking back and forth about 10 yards, depending on which team has the ball.  She is content simply encouraging her teammates.  Sometimes, if the ball/people happen by her, she will vainly flail the lower half of one of her legs (seemingly chosen at random) until the ball goes away.    [hfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/oh-you.gif) one time, the ball ricochets off of her shin, providing her with the delusion that she is helping   Two goals scored on our team while Hamhock is a glorified cheerleader who is also in the way.    During a rest timeout, she says, Guys, this isnt fun for me.  I cant run like you can.  It isnt fair!  I should be goalie so I dont have to chase after the ball all the time.   Say, Dont worry, I am pretty sure you havent chased after the ball yet.  Beady little hamplanet eyes glare at me.  Her face is almost beet red, and she is sweating profusely.    BrownEye pipes up, Relax.  Hamhock, you can be goalie.  Remember, dont use your hands (house rule we were using due to the small goals), and trying to stay in front of the ball   Hamhock answers in the snottiest tone, Well, obviously.  Thats helpful.   Game starts up again, we score a couple of goals, going up 3-2.  Weve got about 10 more minutes.  [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Joel_McHale.gif) Hamhock stops the first shot   Of course, [this] (http://img.pandawhale.com/63225-if-you-think-this-has-a-happy-ruVi.png)   The next shot goes in, Hamhock didnt even touch it.  She is frustrated.    The shot after that she tries to stop by stretching out her gigantic clodhopper, but instead she misses the ball and falls over    Frustration is increasing    Next ball is kicked up high. She non-chalantly catches it with her hands.   [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bridesmaids.gif) Oh, I am not supposed to do that, huh?   For brevity, I will omit the other FIVE GOALS scored on her, before the end of the game.    By then, Hamhock has completely stopped caring, and our team is hopelessly behind.  It is still all for fun and games, though, so only BrownEye is taking it badly.  Muttering things like, Unbelievable, and Seriously? under her breath when Hamhocks latest slight lean to one side fails to prevent another goal.    Near the very end up the game, BrownEye makes a bad pass, (to this day, she swears it was an accident, but I have my doubts), right to the best player on the other team, about 10-15 feet in front of our goal.   He has a point blank shot that he puts a little too much leg into.  Meanwhile, Hamhock is LITERALLY ducking, not caring about giving up a goal anymore.  But, because she is ducking, her head is way closer to the ground than the shooter thought it would be.  [ofw] (http://www.gifbin.com/982989) the ball pegs Hamhock right in the fivehead, rebounding up and out into the parking lot, putting her flat on her back and angrier than even that time when they told her she could only have one banana split.   To be fair, it was easily her best save of the day.    She is PISSED.  She rolls herself up to her feet and starts screaming, You asshole, whyd you kick it that hard?  Didnt you see I was giving up?  And you! (to BrownEye), did you give it to him on purpose? Are you trying to get me hurt, bitch?   He says, I didnt know you were going to bend down and try to stop it with your face!  Relax, it was an accident.  It is just how things happen sometime.  If you dont like the risks, then dont play   BrownEye says that it was just a bad pass, that she was frustrated that they were losing, and made a bad play;  it happens.  No need for name-calling.  Hamhock starts to calm down a little bit and says, This game is stupid, I dont want to play anymore.  You ath-a-le-tic people can play soccer all you want, I am done with this.  I am going to go cook dinner.   I dont know what made it so funny: the ball off her forehead, the explosion followed by Hamhocks retirement from the game of futbol, or the fact that as she gave her little speech at the end, there were visible imprints from the ball on her forehead.  probablyallthree.justice  Hamhock will be back in: Research Experience for an Ungulate,  Part III:  Rotten Hamhock, the Tale of a Spoiling  tl;dr - Hamplanet wishes to join pick-up futbol.  Is terrible, takes ball to face and bitches/moans. Update:  Episode III is now available [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1g9xds/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_episode_iii/)   Okay, I have been lurking through fps for about a month now, quietly snickering to myself and silently wishing that I had a story to regale all you loveable folk.  Yesterday, I mentioned this sub to an IRL friend and he sent this text later:  This sub is hilarious.  So, are you drafting up a story about Hamhock?.  I immediately felt my pulse race. OH. MY. GOD.  I had forgotten.  I not only had a story (one in particular is the episode that I tell most friends), but a few other isolated incidents.  So first, some background.  About six years ago I was just about to finish my junior year at a small liberal arts college in the midwest.  I was actually pretty skinny and small (59, 140 lbs).  Most of the credit for that goes to a friend who was into lifting weights and running, and one day I asked him if he would buddy with me and teach me things.  Since then, I focused much more on how I ate (got into paleo, although only moderately, because small school cafeteria, read up on the science, worked out, etc).  I had decided to apply for summer undergraduate research in molecular biology (experience in a lab is BIG for applying to graduate school).   We will pick the story up there.  Engage greentext (first time!)  Be me, applying for REU (research experience for undergraduate) programs all over the country.  eyeofthetiger.mp3  [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/original.gif) Florida e-mails:  Youre In!  Weve got a roommate set up for you!   Florida  Iowa (possible oversimplification).  Email roommate, asking what kinds of things he is bringing.  Roomie responds, seems cool.   I confirm the things he is bringing.  I dont want us both to bring TVs or something. Jokingly, I say, It would be stupid for both of us to bring our rock tumblers to the beach.  Roomie ignores comment, well figure it all out when were showing up.  End communication.  Be next month, on my trip to Florida.  fuckyeah.jpeg  Get picked up at airport by cool old guy.   [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/what.gif) he tells me he is the MAYOR of the small town where research facility is located   Hour later, we arrive at facility.  My school is in session until late May.  I am last to arrive.  Just in time for a pizza dinner, get-to-know-the-students kind of thing.  Pizza is laid out on picnic tables.  time2meetpeeps.heregoes  See only one other guy.  Assume it must be Roomie.  He informs me that we are the only two guys.  Among 10 girls.  Is this real life?   sit down, talking to Roomie, things are warm, happy, sunshine.  Meet the girls.  Sit next to one, I will call her Geode.  Geode is pretty tiny.  53, maybe 110.  Fit-looking, with red/auburn hair.  Very cute.   Start to feel funny (a bad kind).   Things feel darker, sadder, less sunshiney   The joy seems to dissipate, casual chatter becomes strained, and the sun visibly darkens   Tectonic plates groan, shift, and barely hold  Is this some ominous cloud, a harbinger of the troubles to come?  Well, kind of. But no cloud.  A hamplanet.   [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/no.gif) behind me, there is a squat, brunette girl built like a bowling ball    Girl sits down across from me and Geode, next to the Roomie, introduces herself    She is slightly shorter than I, but at least twice my weight.  I think 55, 280 is probably about right.    Person-in-charge says, Lets wait until everyone shows up to start the food, well give em five minutes.    Thank all that is holy that this man didnt physically get between Hammy and the food.   Seriously?  Just because a couple girls are late I have to sit here starving?  This is bull.    At this point, girl sits down, clears throat, and spits one of the nastiest loogies I had ever seen (or seen since), over the side of the table, into the grass.   [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yuck.gif)  We shall call this planet, Hamhock    Geode says, Umm, what the hell?   Oddly, Hamhock is apologetic.  Says, I am not used to being around people who care about stuff like that.   Geode, Roomie and I look to each other for the meaning of this comment.  We do not find the answers in each others eyes.  weareallgoingtodie.yup    everyone arrives.  Pizzatime!   Hamhock grabs half of a pie, folds it over itself, creating some kind of unholy pizza-sandwich, and starts digging in.  [ofw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imgur_9CUtI.gif)  Its easier to eat this way   Easier than [what] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mend69jUi21rtvqzco1_500.gif)?   Anyway, we start doing some basic introductions.  The girls are oddly aware of my rock tumbler email.   Roomie tells me that he wasnt sure if I was serious, thought maybe I was some kind of rock-hound super nerd, so he told all the girls about it.   Regardless, Geode thought it was funny, and told me she was into rocks, had a geode she brought with her, etc.  Hence, her name.  Hamhock, done with her first half pizza, gets up to scour the boxes for seconds.  I am quite full with my two pieces, and Geode has nibbled away only about half of hers.    Hamhock returns, and plops several of her folds on the picnic bench.    This is pretty good pizza, but back home they have better kinds    Were eating chain pizza.  Well-known chain pizza.  Of course there is better pizza.  Words begin to fail me.    I say, Yeah, it is alright.  I usually dont eat so much but I had a short connection and missed lunch   [hwf] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/0c6649ef147636b8d42d00fbf72b4fe8/tumblr_mfr5qk00QA1riiw1do1_250.gif) she is trying to work out if I meant that as an insult (hint:  I didnt)   Well, test_subject9587, I think that some people dont eat enough.  They starve themselves and try to look all twiggy and they think its pretty. But it isnt pretty, it is sad.  They should just be happy with what they have.  I may not be super-healthy, but I feel good about myself, at least.   The table realizes that I have said something to set off these interminable whale sounds, which only through retrospect I identify as Fatty Logic    But next to me, Geode is tearing up.    I catch her eyes with a slightly quizzical look.  Realization must crawl over my face, because she looks down quickly   uhoh.mpeg    Geode stands up and says, It isnt always that simple! in a real shakey voice, and walks away, over to where the dorm rooms are.  hellodarknessmydearfriend.mp3  Hamhock has the nerve to say, What the hell is her problem?  This sets me over the edge a little.  Jimmies, they are a rustlin.   Are you serious?  Obviously, she has dealt with an eating disorder before.  You cant possibly think it is okay to shout bromides about body image at a table full of girls.  You never know what a person has been through  especially with a group you just met!    Oh, I guess she is really skinny.  And she wasnt eating much.  How sad.    [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/HV7Z3JG.gif) THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING POINT!     We at the table start to try to convince her to apologize, goes over poorly.    Well, make test_subject9587 apologize to me first!   I tell her, I am sorry if you thought I was implying that you ate too much, but I was just describing my own eating habits.  There, happy?    She grumbles something that cant quite escape the event horizon that is her mouth, and truffle-shuffles off to the dorms, obv carrying her pizza with her.    Roomie looks at me, Holy shit, man.    I say, Yeah, 10 girls in forced proximity for a summer in Florida.  Forget TNT, were about to know some *real* drama.  tl;dr - Hamplanet disgusts, shames ex-anorexic girl, feels nothing.  Update: Episode II can now be found [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fqn6d/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_episode_ii/) and Episode III [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1g9xds/research_experience_for_an_ungulate_episode_iii/).    As the title suggests, some friends and I will be spending about two days traveling the Bourbon Trail.  As of now, the general plan is to arrive on a Thursday night, and then spend all day Friday and Saturday stopping at distilleries and having a great bourbon-fueled time.  Does anybody have any recommendations from their own pilgrimage on the trail?  Something that we absolutely must stop and see?

Just saying is all.    I am going to try a fish stew tonight, boiling up the heads and fins for a nice stock and then just basically throwing in the things that we got on hand.  So far, I am thinking about tomato, celery, onion, green peppers, maybe sweet potato.  Fish will be bought at a nice local fishmonger, so I can either get the whole animal or some fillets + offal (do they call fish heads/fins/etc offal?).  But, I don't have any specific plans or a recipe.  Does anyone out there?   March Madness, Simpsons style.

While I plenty enjoy seeing Simpsons images and relevant quotes taking up the majority of this subreddit, I'd also like to see people arguing/discussion/quoting their favorite episodes.  Now, I am aware that plenty of threads exist for that, so I wanted to do something a little bit different.  With March Madness right around the corner, I started thinking about a Simpsons-Themed 64-team tournament.  When I looked into it more, I realized that in three of the show's best seasons, seasons 4-6 (some would say the shows THREE BEST EVER), there are 69 episodes (ha ha, I know).  If you remove Treehouse of Horror episodes, and the two clip shows during those seasons, you get EXACTLY 64!  With that in mind, I plugged all 64 episode names into a bracket generator, randomized the seeding, and BAM:  March Madness, Simpsons style.

I have been a Reddit lurker for quite some time now, but have clearly never posted before this time.  My wife-to-be bought be "The Ultimate Bar Book" as a Christmas present, and I am not entirely sure she knew what she was getting into.  Whereas before I was basically a Wine drinker who would stay stocked up on Kahlua and Vodka for White Russians (inspired largely by my love for a certain Coen Bros. film), now I am stocking up a nice bar to try all kinds of things.  So, yesterday I came home with a nice grip of liquor, including a pair of whiskeys which were recommended by those posting in this subreddit:  Maker's Mark and Buffalo Trace.  Yesterday I tried the Maker's Mark clean, and found myself to really like it.  I have yet to try the Buffalo Trace, but I plan to try that in the next couple of days.  Then I want to try tastes of them side-by-side, to see if I can distinguish between them.  Interestingly, I basically grew up in a family that loved to drink Jack Daniels (and sometimes Jim Beam), so I am familiar with the whiskey milieu.  I even got to drink some as a youngster during sporting events (Whenever the Avalanche would score a goal in the Stanley Cup).  So, I am excited to branch out a little more, and try some different things.  I was fortunate enough to try some Pappy Van Winkle 15yr last week when a bunch of coworkers went out to a whiskey bar, and I think that is what finally convinced me that I might like whiskey as an adult (a few years back, I tried some Jack Daniels, and didn't much care for it).   In the nest week or so, I expect to get a shipment form Amazon containing some Angostura Bitters and cherries, so that I can make some Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.  In the meantime, I just wanted to pop out from lurking, thank the posters in the reddit for good recommendations, and introduce myself.  Thanks again!  	105
    Hmmm Because Media realy Do that and Claim on Innocent People !!!     	3
 If you're rooting the thing then 99% of everything I said is of moot consequence.  The hardware of the device is pretty much badass. .... with the one exception of the speaker.  the speaker sucks. it's on the back of the phone, easily covered up, is about as 'generic' as possible, and pales in comparison to even an average 'other' device.. let alone HTC's speakers... which are even better than my 14" Asus laptop...  leaving one of them playing music on my counter and walking around the kitchen serves almost the same function audio-wise... with the M8 actually edging out on certain aspects because the case of the laptop 'rattles' a bit on the higher notes.  the M8's speakers are great. I'll oftentimes have music playing on my phone when I get in my car and just set the thing in my cupholder and forget to even turn the radio on... just keep listening to the phone.  there are limitations, i mean, they *are* tiny speakers ... so, road noise can drown it out but.... my point is,  they're pretty freakin' awesome speakers.  aside from that... from everything I'm reading about the rumors with the G4... the only real difference will be the octa-core proc... and, the speed of both the G3 *and* the M8 are more than fast enough, imo.  ...hell, at that, from what I've been gathering on the chip specs/performance, the 4 main cores of the Snapdragon really aren't that much faster than the 4 cores in the 801. ... slightly but just barely-so... albeit, greater efficiency in layout of the chip, and smaller wiring.. so less battery drain *when* the 4 'main' cores are in use... ...as well, the ability to not only drop back to the 4 'half' cores for easier tasks... drastically reducing power consumption, but *also* the ability to utilize all 8 cores at once... ...and, if what I was reading is correct, better bandwidth from the ram *to* the proc so that all 8 cores don't experience bottlenecks in memory access.  but, again, really is a pretty moot thing. speed gains would be minimal, and I've never had a speed problem on either device (nor a ram-problem.. and the G3/G4 both are 3gb ram... M8 = 2gb).  battery life may increase... but, since it looks like they're sticking with a 5.5" screen with the g4.. but going for the increased resolution (3k vs 2k) ... it may be a wash... ....if you chose to keep the settings to 'max output' all the time....otherwise, if you keep it variable, the battery life would prob be just-slightly gained with the G4 over G3.  Kinda moot talking about or comparing given the G4 isn't even announced yet, let alone available ...   but, my point is... even if waiting for the G4, the only real difference seems to be the jump up in proc-type (like the M9) and a slightly increased screen resolution (but the G3 *still* has higher res than the M9.... ....and, even my M8's resolution is more than high enough imo. te increased resolution of the G3 has never really been a noticeable 'thing' to me).  um... rooting   roms.  to each their own. I'm on sprint so I can't even root my G3, let alone load a different ROM on it.. but, I'm not sure I'd (really) want to anyway.  the only thing i'd really want to root my phone for would be to make it a wifi-server for my laptops and tablets.... and, at that, I use EasyTether on it with no problems... ...just requires a usb cable which, also, keeps it charged... using the phone as a modem drains the battery like none-other... esp with heavy usage... so, keeping it plugged in is something I do anyway.  that's actually where I keep my phone 99% of the time... in the back of my car plugged into an old laptop that's, in turn, plugged into a 12v power outlet in the back and all shoved into a side-net deal....... and i use the laptop/G3-combo as a mobile hotspot for my laptops   tablets while I'm in or around my car.   The downtime is minimal, and the G3 seems perfectly 'happy' plugged in back there.  I only really ever remove it when I'm going away from my car and need to grab it to use as a modem wherever I'm going... assuming that place doesn't have wifi.  ... or 4g/LTE so my M8 can't serve both functions (modem *and* phone).  anyway, I've never had problems with my M8 in the nearly 2 years I've owned it. I consider it one of the best devices I've ever owned. but the G3 is still a solid phone, and any of the (not really existent) 'problems' with optimus will be replaced with the ROM.... .... I'm not *against* the G3, hell, I'm even *for* it... again, Infiniti makes a damn nice car! ... I'd be glad to own one. not just happy, but happy+.... but, vs an Audi?  that fucker's *fun* to drive! not just a pleasant drive when going somewhere, I specifically intentionally *make up* places to go with my Audi... just so i can drive it... ...same deal with the M8.  ...can't say that about my G3.  ([this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA15T2MC0213 cm_re=acer_switch_10-_-9SIA15T2MC0213-_-Product) is my other 'favorite device' I have.  it's slower than my laptop, definitely *not* my desktop... but, for $200, I love this fucking thing!)    maybe I can add BlackBerry as being Jaguar  that one makes perfect sense! used to be great, now is just a Ford. Has less problems than it used to, but still costs an arm   a leg and gives subpar performance relative to the competition.   Nokia (Microsoft I guess) can be Volvo  another perfect fit! definitely not the 'best' out there, but certainly still a great device... and those old box volvos from the late 80's-90's were super popular (like that old school nokia phone that *everyone* had and seemed to last for.f'ing.ever with no problems... could be dropped (wrecked) repeatedly and just. keep. going.  kinda boring, but an otherwise solid device.  perfect comparisons   imo, the M9 is just HTC catching up with what LG provided with the G3 a year ago.... actually, the G3 has a larger battery... that's swappable!, higher res screen, and a camera that's probably better than the M9.   the only real loss with going with a G3 *instead* of an M9 is the new processor... but, proc speeds are way faster in smartphones than most people could ever demand of them.  that just leaves price   ui.  personally? I'm a really big fan of Sense. period.    Optimus is great, but it isn't Sense.  I have the M8, I have the G3.  I can use both interchangeably, just gotta go in and adjust my google-voice settings to forward the calls from one to another.  at that, I almost never carry my G3. I've made myself for a month once. I grab it every once in a while and use it even now... forceably. begrudgingly.   I just ... it isn't that Optimus is '*bad*', by comparison to every other UI that's out there (except sense) it's great! ...but, it lacks the simplicity yet functionality of sense.  I know that sounds horribly semantic   anal but... it's just how I perceive it.  at that, between the M8   G3, I'd take the M8 any day of the week and twice on sunday... ...*despite* it being a 'lesser phone'.  it has less ram, smaller screen, less battery/life, non removable battery, etc... but, the ram / speed is plenty and I'm pretty liberal with the number of apps i install and keep on there... keep running in the background, etc.  The only real limitation to the M8 vs the G3, imo is the camera. the camera absolutely blows in the M8. i mean, for basic shots? it's 'fine', but, there are many pictures that I've tried to take and been disappointed in.  The G3's camera is great.  on the other hand, cameras are much less important to me so this limitation (though supposedly 'fixed' in the E9... *not* the M9... that camera lacks image stabilization and, from what I've seen, it's a major limitation... the E9's is strongly rumored to have it)... ...where the M8 absolutely monkey-stomps the G3 on... and, most other 'devices' that I own (laptops, tablets, etc) ... is also one that's much more important to me to begin with: speakers.  the G3's audio is paltry to begin with. Compare it to the M8 and it's like listening to.... a shitty pair of stock earbuds vs a really nice set of headphones that cover the ears entirely.    singular low quality speaker on the back vs dual high quality speaker*s* on the front.  it makes a huge difference.   but, again, Optimus vs Sense. it's subtle. And, LG clearly did a very thorough job going through all the other handsets   tablets out there and narrowed down the best features. they did a great job at 'capturing the essence' of each out there... iOS, TouchWiz, Sense, etc....  and, did an awesome job programming it into Optimus... but, there're just a few features they lost, and, in day to day functionality, it makes all the difference in the world (to me)   Why not use them en mass? Why not keep the data indefinitely? Why not create tracking patterns of vehicles? Time/date/location/license plate # etc?     I have both the M8 and G3. Much prefer my m8...shy of the camera.  Get an m9, or, better, hold off until the e9 is available.  Sense blows optimus away, imo   They'll get over it. Most already eat bugs all the time, they just don't realize it.  The environmental footprint/impact is certainly drastically reduced from my understanding.  I'd give it a few more years to get testing and widespread approval. But I'd imagine that by 2020 even t.supply    rural king will be selling the stuff   /r/drought cares. /r/californiadrought *really* cares. Like, cares so much it's its only reason for even existing      Having both as G3 *and* an M8 for nearly a year now has made me realize I'm a bigger fan of HTC than I am LG.  I liken HTC to Audi, Samsung to BMW, iPhone to Mercedes, and LG to an Infiniti/Lexus hybrid.  I've always been an Audi guy. HTC the same.   but, I've also owned a few Samsung devices (and bmws... and mercedes, and audis, and toyotas, and nissans... never a lexus or an infiniti.. though my parents   sisters have) ... ...it's a great device, for what it is... but, I'd much prefer the G3 over any samsung I've owned (tv's included).   ... but, even at that, HTC beats it. ...esp with the M9 essentially being a G3 with a newer proc (a year later *after* the G3 came out first).  the E9 on the other hand.... now *that*'ll be the device to have!   Sense beats Optimus hands down. Optimus beats TouchWiz hands down. all of them beat iOS hands down.    I like mercedes, comfortable ride and will certainly get you there but... bah. boring! power? sure. those v8's are like tanks on crack... but, still tanks. the still-heavy but lighter Audi? granted not as fast as a BMW for the most part, but with the quattro? the handling blows it out of the water. throw on a supercharger for $5-6k on top of the naturally aspirated 4.2L v8 audi makes? ... combined with the handling on any road but a pure circle track and BMW can suck it.   sure the gas will get'cha... charging my HTC is about as common as filling an Audi up with gas but.... well. fucking. worth. it.  and, come on, how far away is the average person from a car or wall outlet? and, even if they are, [these things](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2600mAh-Portable-Mobile-External-Battery-USB-Charger-for-cellphone-Power-Bank-/251719067117?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 var= hash=item3a9ba025ed) are $5.... and give nearly a 100% charge in of themselves.   The G3 Optimus interface makes it cater more towards kids as some sort of 'toy' ... the HTC Sense is much more to the point, imo.... ironically, my business number is on my G3 and my personal number is on my HTC. luckily, google voice works with both and forwarding phone calls from my G3 *to* my HTC is just a 5-10 minute configuration issue.  that the HTC cost me $100 and the G3 $0? and that the G3 has basically the same specs (if not arguably better in some ways) than the just-announced M9? hell, even the yet-to-be-announce E9? ... all the more impressive. Infiniti makes some pretty bad ass car designs with some pretty advanced configuration-types. ...oftentimes *years* before the competition catches up.  Unfortunately, it's an Infiniti, not an Audi. 'cause Audi's fucking rock! that's why the bad guys drive 'em! ..and Tony Stark.  'RDJ' also does HTC commercials. This *isn't* a coincidence, fwiw    then the risk goes up exponentially as you increase the odds of a drone and an airplane trying to occupy the same space at the same time.  but the likelihood of this happening is so minimal...  I mean, airports with 'no drone/no fly' zones alone would drastically reduce the risk.  I mean, how often is a plane really flying low enough to hit a drone? ... take off   landing... that's about it.  initial ascent or descent but... again, 'no fly zones for drones' (said [Soup Nazi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVqBzP0xdKk)-style) would seemingly reduce this drastically.  That leaves small planes   helicopters ... and, again, the likelihood of this is so minimal, in my imagination, any helicopter that hits a drone... and... anyone that lets their drone be hit by a helicopter... was essentially asking for this seemingly nearly-entirely avoidable incident from happening.   it doesn't *just* bring down the price of feed, the birds are seemingly a lot healthier, happier, and grow more protein-dense meat, as well have the capability of growing 'plumper' in the process. ... depending on what *else* its fed, it can have a lot of meat. it can have a lot of fat. or it can have a lot of meat *with* a lot of fat.  insects tend to be really lean. they don't provide a lot of 'fat' to the animal, but... again, it's just a *part* of what's fed, not the entire thing.  but, better, they can be fed live, dead, or can be processed into various forms... kinda like soy basically. lots of potential here.   Why not do both?  Insects for humans *and* livestock?    If we allowed men a similar choice: before the fetus is too developed for a legal abortion, the father can choose - just as permanently and irreversibly as an abortion - to forever surrender all parental rights and responsibilities - without the consent of the mother  I've been arguing this for *years* now. Guys always cheer it, girls always think I'm scum.  ...but, within '30 days of notification' ... be it that the girl is pregnant or that a child even exists. ... so, some mother couldn't have the kid, struggle for years not having notified the father, get into some financial problems, then come back against the kid.  ... maybe even less time, but I feel '30 days' is a good amount of time in such that a 'rash decision' isn't made. 90 days depending on term of pregnancy would be even nicer...  but, the point is, guys have essentially no control over this. It isn't 'fair' really. I'm not arguing that it's 'right' or that it's a responsible or moral thing to do, but I think if an option for such a thing existed, there'd be a *lot* more thought towards having a kid with the idea being in the mother's head that she could always go after the father.  the question comes into play with what to do in the case of an unknown kid coming back against a parent for back child support.   but, then, that would still apply, imo.  the father would have '30 days to decide' and, during that 30 days of finding out about this 18+ year old child of theirs, they can make the call on whether they want to try to be apart of its life ... ..or, say 'no' and keep going their own way.  if the father said 'yes' then never paid and the mother never came back for child support due to *not* wanting to play some sort of custody game ... that's different, the father has responsibilities and *didn't* follow their duty ... but, '30 days' (to 3 months) would be really nice.  ... and fair, imo.  granted, again, women the 'world over' would think of any father that does that as complete scum and 'not a man' but, whatever. that's for that father to deal with on an individual case scenario.   but, you're absolutely right... something like what you typed would totally offer a way for this' monstrous crime' to have been prevented   ethanol from corn is stupid. Stupider still is that the US lets ethanol *only* come from corn (a few notable exceptions aside).  I'm not knocking ethanol (though it's clearly not as energy dense nor cost-effective as petroleum-based gasoline) ... I'm knocking ethanol from corn, esp when it's *only* from corn.   x-post: /r/economics   x-post: /r/Documentaries      They are working to scale up, and currently have a facility able to produce 17t of wet larvae a day, from 110t of organic waste.   is there a sub for that?   yeah, doesn't seem like you'd be able to (sue).   I don't..  *sounds* like you *should*!   I shouldn't have to  totally agree   RO system  they're expensive. esp for farm-scale operations. you *may* want to look into 'alternative' methods vs RO for that size of an operation. ....but, for the house, RO is prob the best way to go.  still expensive though!    x-post: /r/health  [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/2ywbfc/66_of_people_diagnosed_with_cancer_survive_at/)   /r/composting  /r/vermiculture   I'm a mod of /r/drought. :)  I'm pretty well versed in it. I keep up with it daily.   There are multiple approaches, technologies, implementations, etc that could drastically alter it.   check out /r/agronomy   /r/agriculture ... as well /r/biochar, I post there pretty regularly.  as well /r/soil and /r/water. there are lots of links relating to this... ...and how to adjust around it.   you don't filter your water before you use it??  obviously it doesn't remove *every*thing, but... you can get a lot of it out of there.   but, that they're doing that sounds f'ing criminal. seems like you could sue?     I wouldn't volunteer to die today for it  well, if you change your mind.... you know where to find me :)   I would gladly endorse feeding bugs to humans  I've posted *many* articles about this. I'm super-excited that this 'movement' is finally starting to pick up some steam.   Insects are an excellent source of nutrients   protein.  Extremely efficient converters of resources, have an incredibly low pathogentohuman rate, and are incredibly fast growers. Of course an 'insect burger' would be about as delicious as a veggie soy burger deal the hippies eat ... so I don't see it replacing a big juicy cow of buff burger or anything... but, vs the 'whatever-tf-mc d's sells?' it'd probably taste *better* than what they try to pass off as 'beef'.  though, maybe better to start with the McD's in India first .. before taking it elsewhere. esp the US   Australia   I've seen aborigines eat bugs before. living ones at that. it wasn't for me but I was definitely offered.... I'd much prefer them cooked   seasoned than live   squirming    other perversions  again, don't disagree... as, again, I've posted many articles about insect eating.   overpopulation  I think that people are too up in arms about this whole overpopulation water deal.   .... at least from the perspective that it *isn't* a 'solvable' problem.  as is? it's absolutely one. but, I've spent the past few *years* posting on reddit *various* ways to both address *and* mitigate the current problems.  I see no reason why the carrying capacity of the planet couldn't be 25, 50, maybe even 100 billion people.  though it'd get a bit crowded   uncomfortable at those levels... i see no reason it isn't *plausible* at least ... if not fully *possible*.   hopefully by then we're off the planet and terraforming Mars or Europa or something though... and/or have figured out some way to build land from water or something.   ... graphene-islands would be neat :)  but, *on* the over population deal... again, if you change your mind, you know where to find me ... :)   The Likud party is even worse than the US's neocon wing of the republican party.    there's too much here to respond to atm... and, thus, I'll probably never come back to it *to* respond to.  but, in short: if you're so gleeful to reduce the population by eating humans, I'm game... ...and, you seem pretty healthy. hit me up and we'll work out the legal and butchering arrangements so I can get you in my deep freeze. I'm assuming, of course, that you're willing to volunteer to be one of the first towards this population-reduction you seem to think we need   it's in the bond-type of the atoms.... as well what they're bound to.  in SOC (soil organic carbon), the carbon is usually bound to other types of atoms ... these molecules are more easily broken down.  In biochar, the carbon is (for the most part) bound to other carbon.  and, *usually* not just with one electron being shared, but two or more sometimes even...  here're some links that may help  [Total Organic Carbon](http://soilquality.org/indicators/total_organic_carbon.html)  [Wikipedia: Soil carbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_carbon)  Also, try google-image searching: '[biochar atoms](https://www.google.com/search?q=biochar+atoms newwindow=1 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=4mwCVaHbJcS6ggSw-4HgCA ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ biw=1745 bih=814)' and looking at some of the models/representations of the atomic structure.  note that in, say, [this one](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UJf2hWRhpFc/Um1ScIcwuDI/AAAAAAAADYs/tNZBI8r2rYk/s1600/composition.jpg) some of the hexagons will have a 'second line' next to them.. ..this is to imply that it's a [double bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bond) between the carbon atoms there.  Double bonds are, as I think is pretty easy to imagine, twice as hard to break as.. single bonds.    in the above link, take how the ethylene pic has a C=C bond but the acetone has a c-c-c with the middle c having a = to the o ...    next up, check out a google-image-search for: '[graphene double bond](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1 biw=1745 bih=814 tbm=isch sa=1 q=graphene+double+bond oq=graphene+double+bond gs_l=img.3..0i24.31078.32651.0.32852.8.8.0.0.0.0.77.444.8.8.0.msedr...0...1c.1.62.img..7.1.54.MzZWQLXoT3M)'  ...now, [graphene](/r/graphene) by default will have a double-bond... it's kind of inherent to its structure ... but, in the 'chicken-wire-like' structure it makes... as you can clearly see, each (carbon) atom has a double bond with each carbon atom that surrounds it.  graphene is also stronger than diamond.  there's (most likely) a *lot* of naturally occurring graphene in biochar. ...and biochar could serve as a source-material of carbon *for* graphene ... if-ever 'they' can figure out how to produce it in the quantities society would 'gobble it up'.   in graphene, the electrons are, in fact, shared among *three* carbon atoms. ...though this still makes a double-bond between each individual atom to the next, but, in 'properly made' graphene, the electron would be shared '*equally*' between the 3, with no single-atom having more of a 'hold' on the atom than either of the other two. ... think the whole 'turkey wishbone' deal ..  the more controlled the graphene is during production, the more 'balanced' or 'equally' the electron will be shared between each atom.  'grades' of graphene will undoubtedly be a major component within the manufacturing business ... with cars requiring a 'lower level of refinement' than, say, 'airplanes' which in turn will be lower-still than, say, a space shuttle.  but, on the other end, cars would be *higher* than, say, the graphene used to make a kids latest transformer toy. ...*despite* the latter probably being subjected to more abuse during its life *than* the car!   but, backing out to biochar ... again, it's (almost) all in the pics! biochar isn't *just* carbon-carbon bonds, it's *mostly* carbon-carbon bonds...  but, due to its 'lower refinement' than, say, graphene, more 'impurities' are intermixed within the bonds... and, these 'impurities' (read: other elements) break down easier over time and, thus, the biochar itself does as well... the 'stuff' that usually lasts 100+ years is where the 'everything else' bonds the carbon're bonded to have broken down and... ...you get ever-smaller pieces of biochar that're the stronger c=c bonds.  there's nothing about this that matches the ELI5 but... i highly doubt that you're 5 either :)  oh, edit: the carbon in [compost](/r/composting) is 'organic carbon' ... as such, most of the carbon in it is bonded to 'other things' (atoms) than carbon... and, when it *is* other carbon atoms, they're usually single-bonds. (single electrons shared).  ... and, even if they aren't, even in the extremely rare cases where it's a double bond... and, even, 3-4 of them... (3-4 carbon atoms each double-bound to one another) ... it's not biochar.   biochar is that 'huge honeycomb-like chaotic pattern of porosity'.   ...well, for the most part. I'm pretty sure the IBI's definition of biochar was kept pretty. freakin'. vague. for a reason.  but, either way, compost = organic carbon. biochar = inorganic carbon usually where the carbon atoms are connected with double- to triple- bonds.   'taste tests' are often done on feed-types. I can't remember if I posted one or not, but there was a study done on feeding [black soldier fly](/r/blacksoldierfly) to both fish *and* cows, pigs, chickens... ...they could go as high as 40% and no taste difference was detected in the flavor of the meat. BSF, to focus on a specific one, are essentially neutral on flavor.   But, in *one* of the studies I read on it, they specifically stated that they were following the protocols set out by the feed industry specifically *for* this type of 'taint' in flavor.  Animals eat bugs all the time. Chickens, fish, etc seem to go crazy for them in fact.   Think about it, what's more unnatural: a cow being fed grains that it'd unlikely ever have access to in the wild or a cow eating a ladybug on a blade of grass?   now, obviously there's a difference between a few random bugs here   there vs a diet based on a high percentage *of* bugs.... but, insect eating is pretty dang common.  and I'd be really surprised if someone actually showed me a study where the results showed a statistical increase in feed-type (in the wild!) of corn over, say, cockroaches.  now, obviously your message (which I had to interpret because it isn't the most clearly written thing out there) states that you don't feel like feeding things that the animal wouldn't normally come across naturally ... ie, grain-fed cattle (or sheep or goats) *aren't* something that you really support *either* ... .... totally agree. I have anecdotally tested grass vs grain fed cuts of meat on people and 7x out of 10 (which is about how many times I've ever actually personally tested this... ie, 10x) the person can taste a difference between the two ... *despite* my attempts probably half the time to lead them to the other.  again, anecdotal and probably has just as much if not more on my *extremely* ***non***-scientific way of testing this... but, in the way the flavor, texture, overall experience is describe, grass fed wins more often than not.  but, again, I imagine there're some bugs in there.. obviously not at the scale that they suggest here, but there nonetheless   why burn when one can pyrolyze?    x-post: /r/microbiome   Much less of one than Soviet Russia ever was  Read: no. It's Israeli propaganda   It would seem like the best way to approach this would be to determine what the markets he's able to sell to are most-demanding.  If he's going to stick with the local market, then figure out *who* locally he plans to sell to. If he can arrange for product to be shipped, then that will of course expand the markets   demand-types that he can cater towards.... but, again, demand will more often than not dictate what's grown and, as such, is probably best determined *first*?  at that, you may want to look into SPIN farming. One of the more foundational things about that is intensive monoculture.... with crop rotations that cater to what the previous crop-type(s) *didn't* take from the soil... and, thus, what would be the cheapest to add *to* the soil to cater to the next season's crop-type.  You'd be surprised how much can be grown on a very small area that way ... and with the proper rotation schedule, how long one can go before needing to add much to the land to keep it producing.   x-post: /r/biochar  x-post: /r/soil   x-post: /r/biochar  x-post: /r/soil   x-post: /r/materials   x-post: /r/agronomy   x-post: /r/soil   In over a billion years, the only thing microorganisms have managed to evolve as a resistance to iodine is increased biofilm production   slower metabolic rates. Evolving a resistance to it is pretty unlikely if it hasn't happen by now   Ran across [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20675020) the other day... and a few others of similar nature... while doing some research on the use of iodine for footrot on cattle.  Basically, any 'excess' iodine in mammals is excreted through their fluids (saliva, sweat, semen, most-often urine ... but also milk). It's been long-used (or had been, the increase in antibiotics has decreased the use of iodine for livestock, unfortunately) with great success towards a *medley* of infections in the livestock industry.   I'd imagine that the increased iodine in the milk would help to sterilize *many* pathogens that could find themselves in non-pasteurized milk.  ...and, I, for one, am a pretty big fan of iodine... I'd imagine it'd go a very long way towards helping to cut back the use of antibiotics ... saving them for all but the most severe of cases ...  or, at least, more like with humans, instead of giving them by default as a daily additive, only when the animal is actually *sick*.   It may help them to stay effective a bit longer, reduce antibiotics in groundwater, and, if nothing else, cut the cost of them to the farmers.  Iodine is generally *much* cheaper than antibiotics... and, not just healthier, but actually a necessary 'thing' for the health   well being of the animal... as well those that consume their products   [wikipedia: PSEN1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSEN1)   [wikipedia: Presenilin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenilin)  [wikipedia: Gama secretase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_secretase)   [wikipedia: PSEN1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSEN1)   [wikipedia: TREM2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TREM2)   [wikipedia: TREM2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TREM2)   [Wikipedia: RBM9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBM9)   I'd think that there are much better things to do with the poo.  anaerobic digestion comes to mind ... sterilizing it then mixing it with land *not* intended for food purposes. etc  but, poo-char has always just seemed like a silly idea. I mean, on the one hand, great.. sterilizing any pathogens in the waste... and creating char .... but, on the other, poo just *doesn't* have the density that wood does.   same with chicken litter, etc.  It just seems... like a poor choice of resource utilization. There are lots of minerals and other in the poo... again, anaerobic digestion then a steam sterilization ... then utilization on non-food-intended lands.   just seems... smarter.  neat they're using solar to provide the heat though ... leaves more storable gases for energy production later on... like, during the night :)   x-post: /r/biochar  [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BioChar/comments/2xiwm1/major_water_saving_initiative/)   check out the link to the Rice U article at the bottom of the sidebar... it should help clarify things a bit.  But, higher temperatures generally *do* produce a higher quality char... stronger carbon-carbon bonds, higher porosity, greater activation, less VOCs, last longer, higher surface area (same as porosity but feel it should be worded that way too), etc.  There *is* a bit more crystalization in the bond-types, from my understanding...   as well, you'll (usually) get less char per volume of feedstock (there are 'tricks' around this but they're usually 'trade secrets' ... understandably so).  *at* the higher temperatures, more of the elements *not* bonding together will leave the system .... the heavier minerals tend to stay behind though.  The 'ash' from biochar serves well to mix *with* the biochar, imo... just to help add back *some* mineral content or value, but, really, it's not enough... *esp* with the higher porosity higher-temperature-produced biochar tends to have (feedstocks *do* alter porosity).  technically though, it *is* gasification *via* pyrolysis that *makes* biochar ... so, your question is misworded a bit.  Maybe more fast vs slow pyrolysis?  higher temperatures, of course, allowing for faster pyrolysis.  but, again, the Rice U article... pretty much the silver bullet to this 'debate' imo.  as well the evidence that has been shown again and again that until the VOCs break down (which lower-T chars have more of) ... they'll act as a *repellant* to the char ... and, it is, in fact, the 'explosive removal' of these VOCs *from* the char that *adds* to the increased porosity.  Higher-T's char needs loading all the more though... ...it isn't just because the higher porosity 'pulls in' and 'on' nutrients in the soil (kinda-sorta 'robbing' the soil from the *immediate*-availability of these nutrients) ... or that it pulls in *more* of these because of the higher porosity... but, the higher activation also means that it can pull them in faster, deeper, and hold onto them a bit stronger.  Really critical to preload the char first ... and, sometimes just blending with compost-alone isn't enough ... though it certainly helps.  I've found that adding additional additives (seems redundantly worded) are necessary ... SeaAgri, Azomite ... simply rock dust, bone meal, etc are great, imo.   ... as well lots of microbes.  don't *just* blend it with compost (and minerals/additives) but add microbes ... even if it's simply adding back compost tea brewed from the very compost the char's in... ... I've played around with adding molasses   sugar to char ... but, that was a pain in the ass ... though, the theory still stands: the sugars in the char ... *along* with the minerals... would attract the microbes from the compost tea *into* the char ... but, again, pain in the butt... even hot molasses (or warm) was just a sticky mess.  but, compost tea the hell out of the char *while* it's mixing with the compost ... it'll help to both 'load the char' as well drastically reduce the lag-time before planting once added to the soil.  but, looking at your question again ... it isn't *just* about temp, it's about speed as well .... *too* fast and there's more crystalization, too slow and the bond-types break down and much more of the carbon will simply evaporate.   /u/eosha /u/turtleislandcastaway   might want to look into SumaGrow.  there are some great videos online that talk about the channels in soil that the organisms in their mix create *in* the soil ... as well the fact that they sequester carbon at about a 2:1 ratio that they sequester atmospheric nitrogen.  ....so, not *only* do they (both) help to increase soil N levels * * SOC-levels, but they *also* help to sequester the excess (fossil) nitrogen being put into the atmosphere from the pumping/mining of fossil fuel sources.  This, in turn, helps to build the soil and do so in such a way that it helps the soil to increase its holding capacity .... and, in a form (N2) that the plants most benefit from.  building [soil](/r/soil) is the main way this will be 'contained' ... it'll also help to sequester carbon, reduce the run off of *other* nutrients, and increase the bottom dollar to the farmer who utilizes it.  really a win-win all around.   and Bush will lose to Rand.  It's a shame really. I'd prefer to see her serve at least one term... *then* Rand do a double.    [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWqwSlZPcO4) may help offer ways to help said 'drought tolerant plants' be even *more* beneficial to the soil   A short video that may help [Mycorrhizae Helps Reduce Nutrient Run Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uukhM3-feQk)  now, this is a promo video put out by Mycorrhizal Applications, Inc ... but they are by *no* means the only company out there selling mycorrhizal products ... but the vid does a great quick job at showing the 'mechanisms' behind it   I think it's deeper than that. They're only the crusty surface. ....but, nuclear energy is essentially infinite (for all intents   purposes).... Doesn't play well for the artificial scarcity of fossil fuels when it comes to keeping fossil fuel prices up and limiting the industrialization of countries you otherwise want dependent on *your* industry   to continue this line of thought is a waste of both of our time   you got it! nail right on the head!  edit: ???   they don't need to know me to be glad to see that I'm getting off a plane and (presumably) with money their area didn't have before I brought it with me :)    and the United States still doesnt know what to do with more than 60,000 tons of radioactive waste that has accumulated at its reactor sites. Then theres the issue of nuclear weapons proliferation and national security to worry about, not to mention the environmental toll of mining for uranium.  hate to just straight knee-jerk respond to the opening paragraph but... well, like the rest of the article pretty much indirectly points to: that 'waste'? its *only* '[waste](/r/waste)' because of politics!  It's still radioactive *because* it has harvestable energy!   To have that stuff just sitting there *waiting* for an accident or theft to happen is .... is just sloppy freakin' politics!  To *not* .... to not *just* utilize it for energy.... but to *not* 'burn it up' to reduce the radioactivity of it, to reduce the threat of it... ... from both a threat level *and* an environmental-disaster-waiting-to-happen level is sloppier *still*!  There's *more* than enough energy (in, arguably, the 'waste' *alone*) to power *all* of humanity at levels advanced nations have grown accustomed to over the past century  .... for.... well, for longer than we've been an 'industrialized species' .... reprocess it in breeder reactors and we'd have all the more time to more-easily endure any dry up in available fossil fuels.  It's beyond ridiculous that this has gone on for anywhere *near* as long as it has. If I were apart of *any* 'nuclear movement' ... pro- anti- or otherwise, I'd be on this like white on rice.   ...instead it's apparently better to push solar   wind and bitch about carbon.   ... or nobody?   It's always nice to have some place to go...get away from it all   x-post: /r/BioChar     Why even bother posting this crap?  *for* the specific reasons I'd already stated elsewhere in the comments here over an hour before you posted this comment.     Not sure I'm entirely 'missing the point' .... just didn't choose to type out my entire thoughts   feelings towards it.   This is dubious and reveals the bias right off the bat. I'd argue that we're healthier and have better food availability than ever before, but we can let this slide.  ... well, I *did* state that I thought the article itself was 'bullshit' ... for what *that's* worth   Sounds made up.  probably was. again, 'bullshit'   name/number of the patent?  the op didn't, the one I liked to in the comment that you're applying to ... as well made a separate link to it... [did though](https://www.google.com/patents/US20040161440?dq=paul+stamets hl=en sa=X ei=8dLrVL2XLcOeggTOsISIDQ ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw)   How exactly would an insecticide eliminate the need for round-up ready crops?  the very text you quoted above it says 'biopesticide' ... and, later, 'pesticides' ... ...nowhere in the text you quoted does it say 'insecticide'   Cheap, maybe, but nothing is free.  of course not initially .... but, I know plenty of people who give away compost tea left   right after brewing huge patches of it. I'd see no reason these same types of people wouldn't be willing to give away spores and 'concoctions' containing these 'biopesticides' would feel any sort of conservativeness towards going the same with what's talked about.  I, for one, have 'compost tea brewed' SumaGrow's diazotrophs out with seemingly noticeable results. ... as it was the only thing I threw in the brew and it created something pretty similar looking to compost tea when I've brewed it, as well worked pretty effectively on the areas I used it.  ..albeit, not as well as the original product itself, but enough that I've done it more than 'a few times'.  so, of course not 'free' ... but, who knows what can be figured out from it down the line?   ...unless you're including the cost of the gas to get supplies and such into your calculations?   pesticides aren't just for insects  Again, the author is arguably an idiot. .... and the article itself (arguably) 'bullshit' but, when I read this article, pretty much the first thing that jumped to mind was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krk2CoE2FPs) and, with it, the fact that it doesn't really seem like Tradd Cotter is referring to 'insectes' *either* when he's talking about 'personalized mycomedicine'  .... so, author may be an idiot, but I seriously doubt the sole thing the Stamets approach would address would *be* 'insects'  ..and, probably instead a host of other 'infections' that plague desired yields of the crops of focus.  Also, you're responding to my comment, not the op itself... and, in it I feel I decently-enough covered financial elements of the bullshit ... i mean, article   effective fungal based insect deterrent sounds great  again! so much emphasis on 'insects' when the text you specifically quoted above not just used the word 'biopesticide' but also was completely lacking the word insecticide! don't get it!   If there were an unbiased and factually accurate article about it I would do some more research on it.   don't worry, I did it for you.  hence the link to the patent. Research away from there ... ..unless, of course, you think patents are junk too?   This 'journalism' is  .... bullshit. again, I feel I covered this in the comment to which you reply.   but, still a really 'neat' approach ... ...and, along a line of thinking that may either yield a biological approach ... or, a chemical one from the compounds produced via this route ... and, I really see no reason *both* routes can't be possibilities.   .... I'm no mycologist but from what little understanding I have (and from videos I've watched and articles I've read with or written-by Stamets himself ... as well other mycologists) , I see no reason it isn't a possibility?   [this site](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) has it in an easier-to-read format... fwiw   [An easier to read format of the same article](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/)   yeah, won't surprise me in the least.   I found it [here](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) in an easier to read format. Think I'm going to delete this one and repost it. That other site's layout pissed me off while reading it. I almost didn't myself.    I also think the article itself is kind of bullshit, personally .... but I really like the idea Stamets is working towards.  A *ton* of potential there ... ...and, it doesn't necessarily have to be an 'either/or' scenario either.  Also, the way the article ends... ...the 'knocks them off their fictitious monetary pedestals they believe to be sitting on' is a bullshit line.  they don't *believe* they're sitting on it, they very much so are... ...and, 'knock them off'?  Ha!  ... they're loaded. They have billions at their disposal. There is *nothing* to stop them from redirecting (some of) it from their current line of investments and *also* directing it towards *this* line of research as well .... and then patenting the hell out of as much of it as possible and burying anyone who comes close to challenging those patents under mounds of legal paperwork that even the best law firms in the world would have trouble wading through.    That's the thing about money: the more of it you have, the more you can throw in various directions.  Not that this is necessarily an easily-patentable thing, if at all in certain approaches ... but, the 'filth of idealism' of certain aspects of this article are vomitous ... *at best*.  ...and downright bullshit in other aspects.  Either way, really cool line of research   thought Stamets   Co are doing. 'Infinite' potential there.    However, the sunlight needed for photosynthesis could not so easily be multiplied. Instead, the process would require artificial light, which means enormous amounts of energy  even if efficient LED lighting could be employed.  The question is where you would get that energy, he says  grow switchgrass for energy   biochar. the gasification of the switchgrass provides a syngas capable of either blending or straight-replacing n.gas.  thus, again, providing both the energy   the biochar to power the leds and densify the crop growth.   cultured meat  If the words of [Allan Savory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI feature=youtu.be) are to be believed, removing livestock from the land is a *horrible* idea .... from an environmental perspective.   ....my taste buds probably wouldn't be fans either   Dietary Changes In general, meat has a higher environmental footprint than a vegetarian diet, says Winiwarter. It takes more area to produce feedstock for an animal than it would to produce vegetarian food for humans.  switch to (human consumption) insects for basic protein needs in blends for the less adventurous, and in excellently prepared dishes for those who like great food!  switch to insects as a feedstock for livestock. not a straight-replacement, but a supplementation. Insect farming takes up much less space and provides a helluva lot of nutrients for animals that seem to have [*no* problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSOdfSNxxKA) eating them.  (obviously do this on a much larger industrial scale would be required than this 'backyard approach' ... but there're *plenty* of unutilized [wastes](/r/waste) that [black soldier fly](/r/blacksoldierfly) could help turn into a valuable commodity for the businesses that produce it.  (the stockyards   butchers that process said livestock's probably a pretty great place to start).   There is no silver bullet to resolve the environmental damage of agriculture, Winiwarter says. Instead, future innovations will need to be carefully monitored and evaluated for potential environmental effects, in order to minimize damage of nitrogen pollution and maintain livelihood on earth.  the sentiment of this part is b.s.   Agriculture can *solve* a lot of civilization's environmental problems ... if done properly.   ....and very much so on an industrial level that is both easier *and* more profitable for the farmer.  biochar production, water filtration, retention, soil building, carbon sequestration, ....

I have some friends that work (or have worked) for various refugee programs/non-profits ... great work. awesome programs. I really like that Louisville is so active in that area..    ....and there definitely seems to be a good deal of them, but I'd've been surprised if the number was at *seven percent*, let alone seventeen .... I wouldn't imagine refugees accounting for any more than 2% of that.  I'd like to find a statistical breakdown on zipcodes, ethnicities, sex, etc ... ...I'll try to remember to do a search for it when I get a chance.  ...just to satiate my personal curiosity.  It's unfortunate either way. I like the seed/garden idea. I ran across [this video](http://www.ripeandready.com/2015/02/gangsters-veggies-farmin-in-the-hood/) the other day ... ..it's kinda long and I'm not sure that it's *entirely* applicable to Louisville... I really don't think we're *that* 'hardcore' here but I couldn't stop thinking about a lot of the condemned homes in the west end ... ...or abandoned lots... benefiting from this.  ..really *any*where benefiting from this. I own a few vacant lots scattered all *over* town... southend, out bardstown rd, lyndon, etc .... I suppose I could start something on those instead of just watching it on the webtube.  thing is, you can't (easily) grow toilet paper... so I'm not sure it'd really reduce the number of people on the stamps.  ... just maybe help them have a better something to trade 'em in for (seeds).   Oh I didn't doubt the number, it just shocked me that it was so high.  Crazy that Jeff co. is that busy (period, let alone) compared to the rest of the state.    That 17% of the city is on food stamps is definitely a statistic I didn't imagine I'd read today.  ....even *seven* percent would've shocked me.   /r/Fluoride will prob have some pretty good info on it.  um, could search /r/conspiracy for 'fluoride' and I'm sure some results would pull up *there* as well.  um, could google: 'fluoride controversy', 'fluoride awareness', 'fluoride conspiracy'    ... then, to make it simple, there's always the ['Water fluoridation controversy'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation_controversy) wiki article.  but, the shortest way I can try to explain it is basically... the body needs fluoride, but only in trace quantities ... microgram quantities, and, very low ones at that. Fluoride is the lightest element in the halogen group, it chloride   bromide (elements the body *also* needs, but *only* in trace amounts) block the iodine/iodide that the body *really* needs vs those.   Iodine is needed (iodide is just a different 'form' of iodine) in *gram* quantities, not milligram, not low digit microgram, but double-digit gram quantities.  ...and it is not only super low in our diet, the RDA (recommended daily allowance) is 100-1000x below what it should be (150mcg ... vs the japanese, in contrast, consume upwards of 50mg and above a day.. every day. and also have just about the lowest rates of disease in the world.. .... from brain disorders to cancer to infectious organisms like viruses, bacteria, etc)  Even the ADA (american dental association) states that there's more than enough fluoride in our water for their purposes ... let alone our toothpaste... that any additional is toxic. We consume huge quantities of fluoride, daily. it's all but unavoidable, even if you're trying to avoid it (fluoride-free water, whole house fluoride filters, etc).  Many communities around the world (canada, europe, japan, etc) have looked at the evidence and voted to *remove* it from tap water ... and... well, they're fine. better than fine in many ways.  but, maybe the *best* way to explain it would be [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr2bSL5VQgM)   well, the 2% is what you do per weight of feed ... and I was more saying per 100# of body weight ... ...   two different 'things' for it to apply to  but, you're absolutely correct! 2% of 100# *is* 2lbs! :)   I've read about 1 tablespoon per 100lbs of weight .... would that be about the same as the 2% ratio you're getting?    Diatomaceous earth is silica dust, and can cause silicosis or lung cancer.  so *that's* why you mentioned the respiratory bit.  it seems almost *too* 'miraculously effective' *not* to use, from everything I've been reading.  Kind of makes me wonder why it's not used a lot more ... having only recently read about it.   I just ordered [some](http://www.amazon.com/Diatomaceous-Earth-Food-Grade-10/dp/B00025H2PY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1425267327 sr=8-1 keywords=diatomaceous+earth). I couldn't find any negative accounts with it ... and even the comments   such I *could* find weren't knocking it but more just saying it didn't meet the expectations they'd had ... but most of those even admitted that the bar was pretty high relative to all the positive things they'd read.  I might even try eating some myself ... it doesn't seem to do any harm and who knows *what* it'll drag out of me!    The video's where the *real* 'magic' is!   anyone have any experience using this?   *will* be ... this *will* be so cool :P   It also has a *lot* of fluoride. (yes, I'm one of 'those').   x-post: /r/Libertarian  [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/2xdbi8/darpa_nears_completion_of_advanced_voice/)   this sounds pointlessly expensive.    /r/Agriculture,      I removed this post. I understand that this could look like some sort of malfeasance or even capitulation towards the (incorrect) statements that /u/JF_Queeny has presented concerning me. This post clearly has nothing to do with the focus of this sub/r and I felt that it not only detracts from the quality that we've all worked over the years to achieve here, but the reduction to name calling and slander is clearly against the T.O.S. of *most* of Reddit in general, as well a reduction to the most petty of behaviors.    Thankfully throughout the years /r/Agriculture has (almost-) always managed to stay above lesser approaches such as this, and has, in my opinion, proven itself to be one of the highest quality social 'groups' across the *whole* of the internet. With subscribers and active users seemingly wanting to progress the field of agriculture, sharing ideas, expanding knowledge, and helping one another towards whatever goals we may have.     I apologize for not acting on this sooner, and I hope that the past 15+ hours that this post stood active before it came to my attention didn't detract from what has otherwise been (and, hopefully, will continue to be) a positive and progressive community.    It is unfortunate that /u/JF_Queeny has both chosen this course of action, holds these beliefs, as well, has chosen to step down as an acting mod of /r/Agriculture. His contributions have been both beneficial *and* much appreciated throughout his short course here. ..and, as he stated, can be seen continuing over at /r/Farming.     I, for one, am glad that there are *so* many gardening and agriculture subs on Reddit, each with their own thriving communities. I feel that each has their merits, points of focus, and hope to continue to see Reddit grow and prosper as a community.    Again, apologies for any detraction or discomfort anyone may feel towards this situation and the already public information it has brought forth, and hope that /r/Agriculture can continue to move forward as the beneficial community I feel it to be.  Sincerely,  /u/test_subject9670    According to studies cited by Seneff, glyphosate engages gut bacteria in a process known as the shikimate pathway. This enables the chemical to interfere with the biochemistry of bacteria in our GI tract, resulting in the depletion of essential amino acids .  Monsanto has maintained that glyphosate is safe for human consumption, as humans do not have the shikimate pathway. Bacteria, however, doesincluding the flora that constitutes gut bacteria.  anyone have any links to the studies 'Seneff' cited?   makes perfect sense to me. was more just sarcasm to their wording choice   yeah, that's what I figured ... it was more just a quirky way to word it    SRIs process uses plasma arcs to facilitate reactions between molecules of hydrogen and titanium chloride, a chemical produced from titanium ore. Arcs, like lightning bolts, crack the hydrogen, producing atomic hydrogen that can readily react, says Barbara Heydorn, senior director of the Energy Center at SRI. The reactions produce titanium vapor that quickly solidifies and forms titanium powder.  anyone care to explain what 'atomic hydrogen' is? isn't all hydrogen atomic? even when it's a part of a molecule it's still... an atom... right?   x-post: /r/materials   Acme is by far the best. others are great, excellent-even maybe, but Acme's the best.    you didn't know it was electric so you just assumed. typical.  the gas   oil used to fuel 2-stroke motors can also be made from carbon negative biomass feedstocks. ...even easier since they aren't considered transport fuels so a larger depot has the capability of distributing them as such.

I'm not super concerned about how much power it's using.  I also highly doubt that an electric leaf blower generates as much pollution as several automobiles.

But, what gets me is the inclusion of Tim Flannery in the article, but the *lack* of mention of [biochar](/r/biochar) in the article. I was under the impression that Australia (in general... though, more NSW specifically) was one of the most progressive places in the *world* actively utilizing   incorporating biochar into the soils.  I'm really surprised that that hasn't carried west and been more of a 'hit' in Perth... ....it'd definitely go a long way towards both building soils as well limiting water requirements for the area.  (Tim Flannery is *well* aware the [potential of biochar](http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2611906.htm) .. (search: 'char' ... he calls it 'charcoal' but same difference, it's introduced in the interview *as* 'biochar')   There are other documentaries related to weather manipulation.  In those documentaries there are scientists that *also* 'study these sorts of things for a living' ... and, in their cases, *specifically* study the systems   approaches being utilized. As such, many of their testimonies or accounts would beg to differ.  I read a lot of medical-related things. One of the things I come across quite often is where a general doctor (be it M.D., PhD, or just someone labeled as 'doctor' in a generic sense from Newark's College of Medicine   Taxi Driving') that will completely contradict what other MD's, PhD's and just hardened researchers will specifically focus on. Talk to the researchers, you quickly realize that they have a rich understanding about the topic being discussed, talk to the 'general doctor' and ask them the same questions and they either respond with the more 'general line of thought'... aka, the 'popular opinion' or 'what they were taught' ... or simply don't respond at all.  The contradiction is what's funny to me.   I ultimately don't have a clue what's going on... I've read many places that the energy equivalent of even a simple jetstream is orders of magnitude higher on a daily/hourly/minutely/consistent basis than all the nuclear weapons we've ever created.   At the same time, influencing, manipulating, or slightly adjusting something requires a lot less energy than containing it altogether ... ...and, as such, can still have a cumulative toll down the line.  Anyone who's ever stuck their hand out the window of even a slower moving car and 'ridden the wind' can attest to the idea that a slight move of the hand, bringing resistance to the wind, can drastically alter the placement of your hand, wrist, arm, and focus very quickly afterwards.  Maybe 'slight adjustments' are all that are needed to make a system bring on dramatically different results?  Unless your focus is specifically on systems of this nature... and, by 'systems' I mean ionospheric heaters and technologies of that sort... not to dismiss your experience   expertise but... in the relatively-random environment of reddit ...where 'streed cred' is a bit harder to verify, [links](http://weatherwarfare.worldatwar.info/2013/11/can-facilities-like-haarp-be-used-to-manipulate-the-weather/) help provide support to statements, claims, and positions.

I think you pretty much hit most of the problems right on their head...  those that have the money/resources don't know, and those that know don't have the money/resources. ... or don't care. ... nor do they really *have* to, unfortunately.  Going to bullet point 1... I'd imagine that it'd prob be better to work for someone else for a bit than try it on your own. Maybe get some experience with people   places that're already doing it .. ..then branching out from there?  ... vs trying to tackle it on your own right from the start. That sounds like a surefire way to find yourself stuck in a really troublesome and demoralizing situation ... really fast.  maybe work with some of the permacultural groups or do a PDC this summer or something?   Sounds like an awesome non-profit! ... and you definitely seem to have great ideas towards it...  my next question is: why just a dream?   why don't you?  (don't read that as my being snarky... it's a genuine question)   [Microbe-Wiki: Borrelia](https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Borrelia)   [biochar](/r/biochar)    back! that! shit! up! now!!!!   I have a very basic electric car but it still requires a lot of energy.  The point of my snarkiness is... you'd be better using a [Kill-a-Watt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt) to get a measurement on your power usage ... I'd average it out over something like 30 days.    Just plug the same devices you plan on having in your cabin into a power strip that is, in turn, plugged into the Kill-a-watt and take your measurements at regular intervals to get an idea of your average usage.  From *there* you can start to design your system.  But, as others have said here... well, two things 1) H.Freight makes crap quality ... ...and I *really* wouldn't want it coming down to a h.freight--quality product. Not that you can't always swap it out with a higher quality one once you get the money or narrow things down ... ..you'll obv be saving a *lot* living off grid like that ... ... but, some things are worth spending a little more up front on.  2) batteries. Solar panels are awesome, but they're only as good as the batteries storing their juice.  You'd be best getting a system that allows for *multiple* inputs ... that way if you add more panels, wind, etc... you can plug them in... but still comes back to the batteries being charged.  Also, a generator. Obviously you won't want to use it often... it kind of defeats your purpose ... but, you can (most likely) find a great quality generator on c.list ... something that runs both 120 *and* 240v is my recommendation ... you never know when you'll want to weld or power something a 120v alone isn't going to be able to ... I have both, and they're both heavy... at that, I find myself throwing my 240v into my truck more often than my 120 just 'cause... well, they're both heavy ... ..and, being stuck out w/ just the 120v and unexpectedly needing the extra power, the longer run, or the higher voltage just isn't worth the trek back when throwing the 240v in in the first place would've done it.  240v's also tend to have more power than 120's alone... though I've seen plenty of just-120's with way more power output than some 240v's i've seen.  either way, the point is, a generator is a great thing to have... and the ability to have both it *and* solar charging your cells at the same time is going to be all the nicer. ...albeit, costlier too.  a nice inverter run directly off the battery/alternator is nice to have too... ..again, power distance becomes an issue .. ...if your cabin is in the woods, far from where you park .. ...but, I can power my [13 amp chainsaw](http://www.lowes.com/pd_36_0__?productId=3009620) off of my truck alone... as well my 120v generator ... and make quick work of branches, small trees, and brush w/out having to pull out my Stihl.   ...which leads me to... ....you can also get into [pyrolytic](/r/pyrolysis) [gasification](/r/gasification) of [biomass](/r/biomass) whereby you feed the [syngas](/r/syngas) into your generator and... well... being a cabin, you'll have plenty of branches or brush I'd imagine ... ....and you can just use *that* to charge your batteries for a peaceful night's sleep.  but, as great as H.Freight stuff is... I'd really opt for some higher quality products .. ...esp if its going to be your sole system that you're dependent on  .... w/*out* other back up sources of energy   [This one](http://www.nomorerack.com/daily_deals/view/2102406-asus_transformer_google_android_4_4_quad_core_1_33ghz_16gb_10_1__dual_camera_tablet_pc_with_keyboard) may've been a better place for your $200  edit: [or tis one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834314777 cm_re=acer_aspire_switch-_-34-314-777-_-Product) ... I own both. I know this is /r/android much, if forced to choose, I'd take the Acer Aspire Switch any day of the week and twice on Sunday.   ...but, both have their strengths   weaknesses ... mainly the OS. Android is just better as a 'tablet-tablet' than Metro is... but, then, I never use the Switch as a Metro-type tablet .. and though the versatility of Windows 8.1 allows android to run inside of it isn't something I've messed with, it allows for it... which may account for something if I ever got around to trying it out on it   the video at the bottom is fun!

While driving down the road, just grab the number off the side of a truck (or google their business name if their number isn't there) that you see loaded down with wood chips. I've never met a single one who *won't* deliver for free when they're in the area.  Where I live, they're required to dump in yard debris dumps (at a fee) or have to drive out to surrounding counties (traffic, time, energy, distance, etc) to dump on someone's farm... ...so they're almost *always* glad to deliver for you.  .... though they don't like to drive off the driveway (understandably) so if they dump them on your driveway, lay down a tarp or two  (the more layers of tarp, the less likely it is to tear when dragging it... Harbor Freight has coupons for free tarps *all* the time... and I've never had a problem with tearing when I triple-layered up)  um... but, yeah, awesome stuff!  The crews around here will usually use two different teeth-types for their chippers.... ... one that does chips, and one that does shreds.    The shreds breakdown a *lot* faster... have a *lot* more 'green' (aka: nitrogen) in them, and are better for composting with.  The chips (usually hockey puck or fist sized) are from the trunk and larger branches... *excellent* sources of carbon... .... but they take longer to breakdown.  If you can build enough of a relationship with a grew... or just pay them (they'd be getting *paid* for something they usually have to *pay* to dump so... $10-20 is usually more than enough) ... they'll separate the loads for you... ...esp if you're close enough to the job they're working on.  At that, the chips make excellent mulch for walkways and such... ...but you'll need to add a *lot* of green to them to get them to breakdown in a timely manner.   You can spray them with compost teas, that definitely seems to help... if you brew any, just spray any excess over the piles .... works great for speeding up [composting](/r/composting) anyway..  ...or, if they've separated them for you, or dumped them at separate times... just be sure to mix a higher ratio of shreds to chips ... so the nitrogen will aid the breakdown.  If you're feeling *really* adventurous... but a bottle of SumaGrow (shelf stable for I believe 5 years.. so a gallon will last you for multiple seasons) ... and use a little bit to breed it out (compost tea-style) and spray them with it... .... add in some extra sugar (or molasses) to the water at the last minute so they'll have something to eat once the get on the woodchips (literally just using warm water (not tap! has chlorine!) and mixing organic sugar into it in a separate sprayer works... and apply before/after/during)... ... either way, the diazatrophs in the SumaGrow will breed out, fixing nitrogen, and helping to accelerate the breakdown all the faster.  Awesome stuff... tons of nutrients... and multiple purposes.   excellent source of carbon.  on the black walnut? ...

I've definitely had moments of waiting (too many tabs open, so it's my fault...I know better) where I've thought about removing the chip that's there and soldering on a 4gb one in its place. :)  edit: I'd typed $250 in my first post... I actually paid $225  (I hunted   waited that bitch down like a fucking pro for it to drop below $250 refurb'd.... free s h too!)     [NewEgg's now selling it for $200](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834314777 cm_re=acer_aspire_switch-_-34-314-777-_-Product)  ...which puts it in price with the OP's price-paid.  being said... .. I'd buy the thing again   again.  Of course I have a few 'things' I'd prefer be different about it, but for $225?? or $200?  ...I like it a *lot* better than the Asus equivalent (which I was looking at beforehand ... and my laptop is an Asus ... as well my Android tablet.. and most of the components of both of my desktops)  it's better than the Asus in formfactor though... and price... and battery life..     the screen flips... i mean, its detachable but you can reattach it 'backwards' and fold it down so that the screen faces up... in the same direction as the keyboard .... ...well, like the pic in the link above.  or just use it detached from the keyboard altogether.   My 'complaints' about it ... .... I really really like windows 8.1.  Of course I tweak the everliving shit out of it... mainly using Classic Shell ... and have it set up so that I never *have* to use Metro... and rarely do even by choice.   ... unless really really bored and don't have wifi so I'm kinda just killing time.  The 'complaints'   1) the ram ... 4gb would just be much awesomer ... the ability to upgrade to 4gb would be totally sufficient... esp for the price. it doesn't have to come with 4gb... but to have it configured in such a way that it could be increased...  2) if the USB port were 3.0 in such that I could use a usb key to increase the ram-ability of it. I've never done that whole use a usb-key as ram before but I've heard/read good things and... would possibly suffice *not* having 4gb of ram  3) the screen's capacitive touch is really really nice. I really have no complaints... .... again, I use it in desktop mode, not metro... so any quarks are probably relative to that but... there's something about how it reacts that's different than, say, my Asus tablet or HTC M8/LG G3 phone's screen.  but, again, probably a windows thing and possibly something that windows 10 will improve upon.  ....not an issue one way or the other, more just a 'quark'  4) I'd *really* like if the keyboard base had the ability to put a battery in it.  As is, the keyboard is totally *not* necessary for function... charging, etc. I oftentimes use a full sized keyboard with it ... if i'm sitting at a desk ... despite that the keyboard is surprisingly nice... esp for one so small.  but, if the keyboard has the ability to slide in an extra battery... as well, that extra battery to charge the device... as well, be able to *be* charged independent of the device ... in such that I could keep it charging ... carry the screen around... and then plug the screen-keyboard together to charge the screen... as well to give juice to the screen... both, at the same time. ...that'd be nice. I'd pay extra for that.  I feel like there's another thing that I'm forgetting but... *that* I'm forgetting it means that it's not only not really a big problem... but is an even *smaller* problem than the already mentioned small problems above.  the ram is the main issue.  and it isn't even an issue, I just have to remember to keep my tabs at around 10 or less.   ...and I use OneTab for chrome so that makes it pretty easy ... as well as the 'get pocket' extension ... so, moving tabs from various computers/devices ... as well collapsing open tabs into a onetab tab if it gets slow is only a problem if I have something I'm working on in an open tab... say a reddit comment that *won't* back up... and then I just need to move that tab around so that it doesn't collapse into the OneTab consolidation.  With that... for $200? fuck yeah. If it had android it'd be all the cooler... but, only in a dual-boot configuration. ..  ...oh! the speakers!  It has *better* speakers than my LG G3 (paltry) but *not* as good (nor as loud) as my HTC M8 ... ...that's second to the ram. They're not bad, they're just quiet   it has bluetooth 4.0 though so that and/or just normal headphones let me get past it but it'd be nice if they'd increased the volume on that a bit.  apologies for the full review of it. just really a big fan of the thing.. esp now that it's $200   I bought a refurb'd Acer Switch 10 for $250 off of newegg about six months ago... I haven't had a problem, and for a tabletop convertible deal, I love it.  Would buy another in a heartbeat ...and without a second thought if anything happened to it.  It's only real limitation is the 2gb of ram. 4gb's would've been nicer, or at least the ability to swap the 2gb chip out for a 4.  It isn't android...but I like that it has Windows on it. If I could dual-boot I'd set it up, but I imagine I'd rarely use the android boot just because it's a full version of Windows (i detest metro and never use it).   	199
 I watched Sunset Blvd for the first time a few months back and it didn't really do much for me. Maybe it's because I've seen bits and pieces of it used and parodied over the years, but it seemed mostly silly and hokey and old fashioned.  I watched Double Indemnity after that and I was like, "Holy shit, why did nobody ever tell me this movie is so good?". That whole film is so good from beginning to end and it seems much more modern, if you can say that about movie made when Hitler was still a going concern.   The show has been in repeats for a couple years now, but this is still very sad news.   Nothing like driving around on the weekend, running errands and listening to the Tom and Ray yak it up on the radio. He will be missed.   I think Will will eventually out himself, maybe after another suicide attempt.   Please add me. test_subject96   For me, Cloud Atlas was a movie that tried too hard to be clever and ended up being much more clever than good.   For example, the idea of having actors portray several different characters in the movie, some of different age gender, race, age, etc probably seemed really cool on paper, but I found it distracting and often silly. A lot of times when the film moved to a different time period I'd spend a good amount of time trying to figure out who was who and what that meant. When your effects and makeup get in the way of your story, you've made the wrong choice.  Which is really kind of sad because I did like a lot of it. I found parts of the stories very compelling and a lot of visuals were interesting, but in the end the whole thing just didn't hang together for me.   Dude, seriously? You're working fifteen hours a week and your boss thinks it's some kind of long-term career for you? How could anybody expect anyone to live on that?  Get a solid start date from your new job and two weeks before that walk into your boss's office and tell her you're giving your two weeks notice. Thank her for the opportunity and ask her what things she'd like to finish up/document before you go.  If she gives you trouble, just tell her how sorry you are but the position offers more money and the opportunity to transition to a field you're more interested in. You can also offer to take on freelance work if they're stuck, especially since the new job isn't F/T. Just remember that your freelance rate should be at least double your W-2 hourly rate.  Lastly, don't worry so much about what other people do can do or can't do or make or whatever. Focus on yourself and what you can do and what the value of that work is.  Good luck!   Yeah, maybe part of my problem with the movie is that the trailer raised the bar so much and the film just didn't deliver.    The Papa Johns one was the worst. The others (Cinnabon, eHarmony, etc.) passed mostly under my notice, but the Papa Johns really pulled me out of the film.   I hope this is not too basic a question, but does anyone have any simple tips for taking pictures of merchandise for sale online?  I have a client that own an antique lighting store. He has hundreds, maybe thousands of items in inventory: chandeliers, floor lamps, table lamps, etc. He wants to take pictures of a lot of his stock to put on the new website that I'm building for him.   I've done a lot of searching online, but nothing I've found really seems to address this specific thing.    The thing is this. Wind turbines kill about 500,000 birds a year. Cats kill one to four BILLION birds a year. If the people complaining about this were truly concerned about bird deaths, instead of looking for a reason to criticize wind power, they'd be pushing to ban or at  least restrict the cat population.  Also, wind power is about 4% of US energy production. If we built enough wind turbines to power the whole country and the bird death rate per kwh remained roughly the same, wind turbines would be killing around twelve million birds a year, still less than ten percent of the number of birds that die from just flying into buildings.   Yeah, this.   I got two TouchPad's during their $99 fire sale. I used the native WebOS for a while. It was slick. Better than Android in a lot of ways. But eventually not having any apps made it less and less useful.  I eventually installed CyanogenMod on both of them.    I imagined the title of this thread being read Werner Herzog's voice and it was glorious.   I wouldn't feel all that broken up or morally conflicted about taking the better offer.   The smaller firm obviously thought they could hire a new employee at well below market rate if they put in an offer very early on in the process. It's a negotiating ploy. You don't have to fall for it.  FYI, $6.00 an hour is roughly $12,500 a year if you work a 40 hour week. That's a huge sum of money and something that will likely influence your earning power for the rest of your life.  Take the better offer and don't look back.      The Last Starfighter is still one of my personal faves from the 80's. How can you beat the great Robert Preston as a interstellar con-man/recruiter?  It's a decent film, although it's hampered by a muddled third act and some pretty unimpressive villains.    6/21/04 for me. 26,351 e-mails in my account.   Borat. I find the whole concept of the film, tricking average, everyday people into looking stupid or foolish or racist or whatever so that other people can laugh at them to be morally reprehensible.    I can't speak to your specific experience, but if you feel you've been misclassified as a 1099 worker, then there are steps you can take.  http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-should-you-do-if-youve-been-misclassified-independent-contractor.html  The IRS does often bring the hammer down on companies that improperly classify their workers as independent contractors.   Thanks, Remo! Went to bed and woke up with a pile of donuts and other goodies.   You're the best!   You can't just declare employees independent contractors to get around minimum wage laws. The IRS has [fairly strict rules](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses- -Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee) about this and they're more than happy to rain fire and death on you if you try to play cute with them.

Nothing that you would find very interesting, most likely. At that stage, the only real differences you would find would be typos, misspellings, grammar, punctuation and maybe some word usage.   A DAW editor gave it to me back when the book first came out.   I do web sites for small, local businesses. An issue I've been running into more and more is that the business will have a Google Places listing that was set up for their business by someone else some time ago. They have no control of it and have no idea who might.   Right now I have three clients who are in this situation, a small HVAC contractor, a pizza place and a lighting shop. The pizza place is really in bad straights because the Google listing points to a domain that is now owned by a domain squatter.  I have submitted the recovery form and then followed up with an e-mail, but no luck so far.  Any help or directions would be appreciated.   So I'm decluttering and getting rid of a bunch of old stuff I don't want anymore. I have the original bound galley of Name Of The Wind with the note from Betsy Wollheim  on the cover.   I know that this was considered quite the collectible at one time, but I can't find any listings for it online.   Where would I find that phone number?   The show been soapy for a while now. I'm just waiting for someone's evil twin to show up during sweeps week.   On a related note, has anyone had luck recovering a Google Places/Google Plus listing for one of their clients. I do mostly small, local businesses and it seems like a lot of them have a listing that was set up by someone else and they have no idea who it was or how to get control of it.   Women received over 57% of the bachelor degrees awarded in the USA in 2012. Can someone explain why there should be general, women-only scholarship funds at all?   The crickets in the comedy club audience made me laugh.   Here's some pictures that I took this morning. Thanks for your help.  http://imgur.com/a/hN3vA   I live in a 60 year old house in Long Island, New York. It's a two story house, 1400 sq ft house with a single zone and 13 cast-iron radiators for hot water heat.  When we bought the house in 2010, one of the first things I had done was to replace the old, oil-fired burner and cheap , gas hot water heater with a new Burnham Alpine Condensing Boiler and a Buderus S120w indirect hot water heater.  Now when the system works, it's great. The house stays nice and warm in the winter and my gas bills are low.  The problem is that during the transition from heating season to non-heating season and also from summer into heating season, I get a lot of air in the hot water system. The system gets air bound and I have to turn the system off, close a valve and open the water spigot and let water run through a hose into a bucket until all the air is out.  This obviously creates several problems. One, I have no hot water. Two, the circulator runs and runs until I fix it, which can't be good for it and third, when It's cold out I have no heat because the burner is programmed to heat the hot water before it heats the house.  The guys who installed the system don't seem to have a good solution for me. The added an air eliminator right above the hot water circulator, but that didn't seem to help.  The system was fine all summer, but then it got a bit chilly, the heat kicked on and now I'm down in the basement bleeding the system on a daily basis.  Today I tried running the heat and then opening the bleeder valves on the radiators to try and clean out some of the air. No joy there. The problem remains.  If anyone has any idea of how to either  1)    Keep the air from getting into my system or 2)    Have it be automatically eliminated or other wise dealt with  I'd appreciate it   There's no requirement under the FLSA to pay you extra money for working a holiday, so, by that metric, you were paid 7 hours at your OT rate, whether they call it holiday or OT is probably not relevant.  Although I can say that when I get extra pay for working a holiday, I also get OT if I go over 40 hours a week, holiday hours included.   You might want to look at your company handbook and see what it says on this subject.   I doubt that FX is going to cancel it, given all the positive buzz it's been getting. It used to be that all that mattered were ratings, but I think positive critical acclaim has a lot of value these days and I can't see a cable channel like FX ditching a show that everyone is writing about.  I loved Legit, but pretty much nobody wrote about that show or even mentioned it, especially during its second season where it may well have been in witness protection.   The bad guy is kinda meh and that hurts the movie quite a bit, I think.  When your big bad is a sleazy defense contractor whose evil plan is to just continue ripping off Uncle Sugar by making defective/substandard weapons, it takes some of the juice out of it.  Otherwise it's a fun flick. The Remo/Chiun stuff is great. I loved Kate Mulgrew's snarky femism.   It's interesting also as an example of how movies have changed. There's not much in the way of a big action setpiece. And there's no way they'd cast a white actor as Chiun in 2014.   The comments on that page are priceless.      I did work for ZapMyTax.com and I also used them to file a grievance.  My taxes didn't go down, though.    It's like what Michael Mckean has said about Spinal Tap in concert, "We pretend to be a rock 'n' roll band, and they pretend to be our fans,"   Wrong. You are never allowed to make employees work before punching in. Never.  If they show up early and you're swamped, have them punch in early. If business rules prohibit this, then they can not work.  All hours worked by an hourly employee must be be paid.   I wish I could upvote this comment a zillion times   I have the same issue on my Galaxy S2. I have a ton elixir to spend now too.   Yeah, the game kept crashing on me this morning and now I can't get to the game at all. It keeps bombing out.   The thing about Babylon 5 is that the idea of it was just so much greater than its execution.  J. Michael Straczynski (the show runner/creator) promised a strongly serialized show with a predefined, complex, multi-season story arc about war and politics between multiple, star-spanning empires.  There show would have compelling personal drama and an emphasis on hard, science-based SF.  What we got was, more often than not, a muddled mess with terrible dialogue, lazy plotting, poor acting, cheap-looking sets and a giant helping of sledgehammer o' message on a regular basis.  One thing people may not know is that not only did Straczynski create and run the show, he wrote 92 of the 110 episodes of the show.Apparently, even the 18 episodes that were done by other writers were extensively re-written by him. There's a good reason why that kind of thing isn't done.  Nobody can  produce content at that rate (and run the show too) and maintain any kind of quality.    There's a great quote from, often attributed to Mark Twain but actually penned by Edgar Wilson Nye, "Wagner's music is better than it sounds".   This kind of sums up my opinion of B5. When I watched the show back in the day, I was often unhappy with what wss on the screen, but there were hints and shadows of great things just around the corner. There was, I think, a much better show hidden inside, but Stracznski's limitations and his control freak nature basically smothered it.  What's interesting, looking back, is that B5 was in many ways a prototype for modern, serialized, mystery-driven, genre TV shows like Lost, Battlestar Galactica, etc.   Even with an epidural, jiggling your diaphragm with your uterus cut open can be pretty painful.   Hodor?   My wife had a c-section, so she couldn't see the baby right away.  "Hey, she looks like your dad."  "Really?"  "Yup, bald and angry"  Pro-tip, don't make your wife laugh when she's just had a c-section.   It's kinda cool, but what would you use it for?    It's important to understand that employers are liable for all hours worked or suffered to be worked by all their employees. If you worked overtime, even if it of your own volition without any direction from your manager, you have every right to put it on your time card and the company must pay you for it.  I'm not sure how long ago this was, but the company owes you this money and you can file a complaint or file suit to recover it.   I've been on Ting for just over a year now. The Missus and I both have Galaxy S2's that I scored on eBay.  My wife's major issue with the S2 is the camera. Her friend showed her  all the great pics she took with her S5 and there was much envy. I can't really swing $600 for a new S5 now, so I'm looking for an alternative that might serve.   Did you watch the video? Obviously you can only afford this if you already have a BMW.   My dad always had dreams of being a Jewish cowboy.   When I was growing up, my house had tons of western memorabilia.       I really should know better than to read the comments at espn.com.   While I'm not particularly interested in taking sides in a squabble between Katy Perry or Rhianna and the NFL, it's hard to overstate how tone deaf this is.    You have some of the biggest, most popular acts in the world and the NFL is not only asking them to play for free, but to actually pay for the privilege like they were some garage band at a bringer show.     Seriously. Why not just auction it off to the highest bidder?   That could end up being a lot of fun.      The key with using CraigsList is persistence. You have to look every day or even several times a day and then jump on things when they pop up. Don't dither or fart around.  I got almost all my home gym stuff on CL. 500 pounds of Olympic Plates, rack, bench, treadmill, elliptical, dumbells, floor mats, etc. The only things I've bought new are an incline bench for situps and some smaller plates to round out my collection.   Pro-tip, you can set up RSS feeds of specific searches and view them in your favorite feed reader. No need to even visit the site.            I have one. I've been using it since I joined Ting a year ago.   I like it fine. I play some games on it and watch movies (Netflix/HBOGO) and it works OK. It's gotten a little wonky of late and I think it needs a factory reset.  I've been thinking of getting an S3, but honestly I prefer the S2's smaller size.       On the one hand, that's horrible and disgusting, but on the other hand...you do have to admire their dedication.         Um...isn't it obvious?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIVe-rZBcm4   I have a Sprint-branded Galaxy S2 that I bought on eBay and brought to Ting. Lately it's been acting up and I'm thinking I'll reset it to factory before considering a new phone.  If I do this, is there something I have to do to make it work with Ting? I remember entering some codes that Ting sent me when I first acquired it. Do I have to do that again?   Umm...it's like...a joke.   It's not like he's working much since they wrapped production on Serial Apeist 2      He was out.   Thanks, man!   I just know, deep in my heart, that if I'm not being charged a convenience fee, I must somehow be being inconvenienced.   I bought two S2s off of eBay last year to use on Ting. Pretty good deal and no problems so far.   So, I've been on Ting now since August of 2013. Before Ting I had VZ and I was paying over $160 a month for me and the missus, with a preferred employer "discount".  I don't make a lot of phone calls. I rarely text and I almost always use my phone somewhere where there's WiFi.  So I was a little shocked the first time I got a bill from Ting.  Twenty six bucks and change.  Not twenty six bucks per phone. Twenty six bucks total for two phones. That's...kinda crazy, isn't it.   I almost want to call them up and say, "Are you sure that's enough? I can pay a little more if you guys are strapped."   Still no actual trailer for Tyrant? Seriously, this thing starts in just over a month. Shouldn't they have some actual footage from the show to show us by now?   [Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band](http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The_Beatles_Sgt_Peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band_hi_res.jpg)  Now I really feel old.   http://www.wpthemedetector.com/ works pretty well, I've found. But, as noted above, this site is not a WordPress site.   Seriously? How many options do you think the average person has for internet access? Most people have one good option and maybe one or two more increasingly crappy ones.   I myself have Optimum Cable Internet. If I wanted to switch away from that, my only option is a craptastic DSL line. A lot of people don't even have that.  How can you have competition without any competitors? Do you think, in the absence of government regulation, companies will spring up to run fiber to my house so that they can go head to head with my cable company? They'd be better off piling their money in the middle of the floor and lighting it on fire.   Looks nice.   Could it be easily modified to work booking appointments in a nail/hair salon?   The real key to this is not that the sequel was so, over the top, bad. I mean, it wasn't good, but there are certainly worse sequels.   The key bit is that ads for the sequel started SIX WEEKS after the original movie hit the theaters. The sequel itself was out just a few months after that. B2:EBOO represents the epitome of a sequel for sequel's sake.    I've used this in the past and it works pretty well for what you want  http://wordpress.org/plugins/catablog/  It requires a reasonable amount of work to bang it into shape, though.   Job Manager.   The last site I did for, which was not a WordPress site, him had a nice, job board feature that I custom wrote in PHP/MySQL. I figured I'd save a little time this time around and use a pre-existing plugin.    Long story short, I created a site for a client last year using a free plugin from wordpress.org/plugins. I evaluated a bunch of premium plugins, but the free one was clearly the best for my needs.  After setting it up and turning it live, I noticed that there was one bit that wasn't working correctly. Going back to the support forum, I then read that author had moved on to other projects. Now I'm concerned that some future WP upgrade will just break it completely and my client will be unhappy (to say the least).  Has this happened to you and what have you done about it? I could maybe switch to another plugin, but it would require a fair amount of work setting it up, work that I might not be able to bill for.   I've also considered trying to fork the project myself. I've never written a WP plugin, but I've done a lot of PHP work over the years and I figure I'd be up for it. Has anyone else done this? This is a fairly complex plugin   WP-Client looks like a useful bit of software, but I don't think I can give money to any company that autoplays a video with audio right on its front page.  	84
 YES get one! There are sales all the time, online and in stores, just keep your eyes peeled. Black Friday and Xmas are coming, so if you really want to get one cheap, wait until then. Also try to get one of the better brands so that your hrm doesn't pick up the signals of others around you.    Just try to match handle heights. Do pause drills at different places in the stroke.   Try focusing on dropping it in quickly and then applying pressure right at the catch. Are you using your arms too much? Focus on driving with the legs and hips.   Is there an actual sciencey reason or is it just tradition?   	4
    It's how the North Koreans do it!   Meet the new bugs, same as (or worse than) the old bugs.   What a mess. It's almost as if EA/Maxis is actually a bugged out specialization building in the game itself, and you just want to demolish it and rebuild again to fix it. Or at least unleash a disaster on them.   So we'll have to wait until they fix the new bugs introduced from their attempt to fix the old bugs? Definitely gonna take a break from the game to wait for more fixes ... hopefully the wait won't be indefinite! Sigh ...  	5

 Kaiser   Metamucil FTW!   more beanz!   1 thing I don't see mentioned about 4HB is how cutting out dairy has affected people...for me it was a life-changer.  I've been a huge milk drinker all my life but also suffered from gross psoriasis on my scalp, elbows, and knees.  I'd say within a month of starting 4HB, I was completely psoriasis free.  All those years that docs had me on creams, steroids, lotions, whatever....crazy.   if 2 glasses of red wine per night is ok - I'm calling 2 beers a night ok too...      Amazing.   SKYDART FTW!!  You had me at "oh my Cthulhu"   oh stop it.   \m/   FTW - Fuck The World!   I made a girl vomit w/ a fart once.      Man, I never talk about it....when my daughter was 2, I was out front flipping my 800lb strongman tire in front of the garage.  I had been drinking w/ friends and was showing off.  I was just finishing a flip whe I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye run right under the tire just a fraction of a second before it smacked down on the concrete.  She would have been crushed to death.  That was 8 years ago.            Vermiculite.

Shouldering a 235lb stone is no joke!   a friend bought it from an old Navy guy - they were piled up in his front yard.   I started w/ a tire - any place that has big tires will be happy to get rid of one.  Then take it home...and flip it.   330 stone...  http://i.imgur.com/gnasRTb.jpg  the grass gets mowed w/ stones, sleds, chains, and tires...

It's always good to switch things up...whatever your goals are. A 180lb stone would be awesome...it's hard to train for much volume w/ a 300+ lb stone.    Thanks man!   I was thinking the same...give me 10 years or so.  He's already the biggest 1st grader around.   You'd be surprised, not everyone in strongman...is strong.  You can still train light.

    Forgot to read the rules stating images must be posted in self post. So here it is again http://imgur.com/gallery/H7njA                        Usually teams would do sales to get rid of their old stocks.  McLaren has the best value for monies currently due to lowest needed for free worldwide shipping  http://www.mclarenstore.com/en/restofworld/sale/icat/sale  http://shop.mercedes-amg-f1.com/c/6/sale  http://www.williamsf1.com/Team/Shop/  http://www.redbullshop.com/redbull/en/rb-racing/exclusive-shop-offers/c/rbr-sale  http://www.redbullshop.com/redbull/en/scuderia-toro-rosso/exclusive-shop-offers/c/str-sale  http://www.forceindiaf1.com/shop  http://shop.caterhamf1.com/  http://store.sauberf1team.com/en/  http://store.ferrari.com  http://www.lotusf1team.com/lotus-shop/  Notes:    Williams online shop are still closed   Marussia don't seem to have one   Lotus don't seem to care that 2013 was last year   Red Bull/Toro Rosso's "sale" is not really cheap, especially if you want the free shipping   No sales for Force India nor Ferrari   Merc price is quite good, but no free shipping   It's cheap to use RM to buy in the Caterham shop, but sadly their paypal account won't accept RM for some reason. I had to contact their sales to get my payment through            Got F1 2013 during 75% sale. I am more used to the gMotor2 engine, so this one feels a bit weird  1 - How do I lessen tyre wear? In career mode at China, I noticed that my tyres were wearing out faster than other cars, even tho I was using throttle modulation to make sure there is not tyre spin out of the corners  2 - Why does the car feels like it's understeering? At Spa I am loosing time entering Bruxelles and Pouhon waitng for the front end to grip, even when the AI can just accelerate out from there.  3 - Any wheel setting guide? There is not much feel when the tyre is losing grip  4 - Is it normal that the AI are different from each track? I was winning around 40s at Melbourne and Sepang, but Hamilton was right at my tail in Shanghai no matter what I do or how much I push         http://imgur.com/a/hksEj            I collected F1 Racing Magazine since 2007. But some were lost as I move a lot. One of the issue that I lost was the October 2008 issue where it had the Italian Grand Prix highlights by Maurice Hamilton. In it Maurice explained how Toro Rosso had been much more clever with the brake choice (choosing a brake that heats up faster in the rain), and if not for Bourdais's stall at the grid could have easily won 1-2            2014 is an interesting time. New rules, and except for Mercedes, other teams are still struggling to understand how all it works. In this time of chaos, many ideas are thrown around trying to find something to "Spice up" the race again. One of this was "raise the fuel limit so they can go flat out from start to finish"  Now this might seem logical at first glance. This season, cars are limited to only 100Kg of fuel (or ~140litres, depending on density). This means that teams are forced to save fuel and can't push as hard as they like. More fuel = less saving = faster racing right?  But what if I said that idea is not accurate? Remember the fuel limit? It's kind of helpful that the FIA uses "100Kg" as it shows that the fuel is actually quite heavy. C'mon, try dragging 100Kg around and tell me it's not heavy. And if you were in any physics classes during your school days, you know that weight does influence things.  First, let us refresh back on what extra weight can do to a race car. Extra weight means that you will have a higher lap time. Also tyre wear would be higher due to the grip needed to fight the momentum of the cars in during cornering. Another thing is braking point is also extended, due to momentum of a heavier car.  There is also the repercussion of driving flat out all the time. It induces unneeded wear on the parts of the car, and also puts strains on the drivers as well. Tyres wears out faster as well due to overheating.  Now let's imagine a race, where one car is given a 200Kg limit and another is given a 100Kg limit. During practice, the car with the 100Kg limit could lap an average 0.4 per lap faster than the one with the 200Kg limit. Just 0.4 per lap. Not much faster. They entered a 50 lap race. The 200Kg limit car is pushing all out, while the 100Kg car is saving fuel.   Since the 100Kg car is saving fuel, the lap times is now actually similar. There 200Kg car is pushing and pushing. But wait, by lap 12 the 200Kg car needs to pit since the tyre is now toast. The 100Kg car meanwhile eaked out to lap 18 before pitting. A classic case of a 3 stopper vs 2 stopper. But since the lap times are similar this actually means the 200Kg car already have a 20s disadvantage due to an extra stop it has to make  The race goes on and both cars are now lapping faster. But the 200Kg car still needs to make up that extra stop. Having nothing to loose, it keeps pushing full throttle, now lapping a tad faster than the 100Kg car  Final stint, and now sprint to the finish. The 100Kg car is now pushing more due to saving fuel at the start. But since both have now used much of their fuel, the lap times are dropping to a similar level. The 200Kg car is spewing brake dust everytime it's brakes for a corner though. Due to the heavier car, the brakes were working harder and is now nearly finished. Things does not look good in the engine side either. A decision must be made, and the pit called to the 200Kg car, asking him to slow down to save the car.   The above example might not be accurate, but it does gives an idea that more fuel does not really mean better racing. During the days of yore, teams usually underfuel or use the minimum fuel that they can to have a lighter car that might have to save fuel at the start but could push at the end. Upping the fuel limit it worthless if the teams themselves does not even care  The only way around this in theory is to introduce back refuelling, which would mean the cars could still fuel low, but does not have the danger of running out of fuel. But this does introduce another problem. Cars that are already fast on fixed fuel like Mercedes, could end up going faster than they are.  In the end there are no easy and simple solution for better racing. It's made even harder now that armchair fans are more vocal with ideas that they have no idea about using social media. Nothing is as simple as it seems, especially in the complicated world of Formula Racing               Due to the sad case of the missing flight MH370, where the majority of the passengers were Chinese, some of the Chinese citizen has taken among themselves to blame everything that has happened on the Malaysian Govt.  With Caterham lead by Tony Fernandes that has ties with MAS (Air Asia and MAS swapped some stocks) and Merc is sponsored by Petronas which always proud of it's Malaysian root,they certainly won't be too popular in China during the GP weekend            For me it was an ironic thing of can't affording a console. My family never even had a NES or FAMICON or anything like that. It was after I got into secondary school (or high school in relevant countries) that I first came upon a computer, in the lab, with Starcraft on it. And a friend of mine taught me how to play it. It was not long before we joined a computer club, and spent the evening on 8 player LAN playing starcraft and need for speed.   A few years after, while the playstation is considered affordable, I still can't afford it. Thankfully cheap Cyber Cafes were popping up, and we were then introduced to the original Half Life. It was not long before we discovered it can also do multiplayer. When Counter Strike came into the picture, consoles are long but forgotten.  So thank you console for being so expensive that I had to play the PC. It introduced me to Multiplayer and better graphics            Here's something to chew about. Kevin Magnussen's top speed of 316.9KM/h at the Australian GP was a massive 6KM/h faster than last years's top speed of 310KM/h managed by JE Vergne, and at Australia where the straights are quite short, this is quite an acheivement. It also proves that the straight line speed is still there for the new car, and the only thing that is holding them down is the harder Pirelli tyres and lack of aero grip through the corners.  As the years goes on, engineers and designers should be able to claw back some of this deficit. Although how long do you guys think they can acheive 2013 lap times? For me personally I think it could be as quickly as the Japanese Grand Prix, or as late as middle of next season. But one thing's for sure, the "the cars are 3 seconds a lap slower" would be a thing of the past before long            Have you ever went back to look at the old pictures that you took, and thought to yourself, "Man, I was crap back then".   For example some of my earliest ones:   http://i.imgur.com/ua5k3hA.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/vHae0XP.jpg  I actually cringed and wondered how on earth I thought it was good back then     I was really hyped to play Titanfall, but after two days of playing, I am back to BF4. Reasons?   Smaller maps and less players. While I have nothing against small maps, the 6 vs 6 kills me off after being used to 32 vs 32   Less emphasize towards team play. Everybody just plays for themselves. Even on a small scale server BF4 has more tactics   You can spend 15 minutes just waiting for someone to join in for campaign. You have someone leaving the lobby? Resets everything.    Multiplayer server search is also broken and unbalanced. Level 1? Let me lump you with other level 1 players, while the other side consisted of level 20++ players.    Also, you can stuck with six players on either Militia or IMC, and you can't send half of them to the other side. Honestly battlelog is miles better than this   Hit detection is much worse. You can run into things that is not really there, and swear you shoot someone just to see him one shoot kill you back. And this is with low ping and feels much more worse than BF4's "netcode"  Welp, as shit as BF4 is, it's still a better game for me honestly   Might be my location (SE Asia) but trying to play campaign, it's like I have to wait at least 15 minutes before I can even play as the server tries to find players. And when we do find players, we have to wait 90 seconds, and as the clock counts down, someone disconnected, and the counter resets.   Not only that, for other modes, EVERYONE is on attrition that I waited for 1 hour at the CTF mode without anybody joining. Heck, I was lumped with 4 people in IMC and we were perplexed as why not split two and send them to Militia.  Also network needs better hit detection. I was killed countless times by someone that I shot first but when I look at the killcam, I was not even moving or shooting the other guy. This is with ping lower than 20 at all servers.      http://imgur.com/a/8KldJ  Intel Core i7 4960X  ASUS Rampage IV Black Edition X79 Chipset  G Skills Trident X 16GB  OCZ Agility 3 SSD  Western Digital 500GB Sata 3  Asus R9 280X DC Platinum Matrix (Crossfire)  Cooler Master Nepton 140XL  Cooler Master V1000  Cooler Master Cosmos 2 SE  All parts are sponsored by PC.com Malaysia, ASUS Malaysia and Cooler Master Malaysia for their Super Rig article       For the past two days now, randomly when I use mortar, there was no kill confirm even tho I kill someone with it. The kill does count towards your total kill in the scoreboard, but you won't get the 100 points for killing a person. All the other bonus, like Kill Streak End, Multi Kills, Squad Wipe, etc are shown, hence how I know I was killing with the mortar most of the time.          Ever since BF4 was updated to be able to use Mantle, I've been running the graphic overlay command to tell wether or not I am running D3D11.1 or Mantle. One of the information that the overlay tells are the Job Thread, how many threads that are being used by BF4.  Usually BF4 will use threads half the number of your CPU's core, for example, a quad core CPU will use two threads, while an 8 core CPU will use four. Mantle usually use one extra, so this means 3 and 5 respectively.  What I notice after that fucked up February patch that lead to some maps (Dawnbreaker, Locker, Metro) crashing is that I won't crash on a PC that are using more than two threads. I have three different PCs, an Intel i5 2500K, an AMD A10 7700K Kaveri, and an Intel i7 4700K. Only the i7 does not crash on DX11.1 mode, since it's an "8 core CPU", thus BF4 are running on 4 job threads.   I will however get crashes on the i5 and the AMD A10 on DX11.1 mode which are running only 2 job threads. Using Mantle which bumps the Job Thread to 3, game runs fine without crashing.  Might be something to look into by DICE      While this beta test is to stress test the servers, we are also in a way testing out all the other features of the game itself. Now what do you guys feel that need to be added/changed in the full game once it comes out? Balances or fixes?  For me  - I prefer the hold to zoom for iron sight and the press once to engage feels too like... COD. I hope there is an option to turn this off (either that or I did not go through the option long enough)  - Matchmaking should be done by player rank. I hate when one side is full of level  10 while the other sides are full of 1s and 2s. I was lucky that my first few rounds were with high level players, but after that I grew frustrated quickly when I was thrown in with lower leveled players. This was worse since Respawn turned off chat in beta so I can't tell them to spawn the titan at the same time.  Other than the too COD like feel of the game, I have nothing much to complain. I do miss a game that is larger and more tactical but I am saving my views on that after the full game comes out      Tested on my rig, and I can confirm that this is a D3D error. Was using SLi GTX680 and keep crashing at Locker, Paracel and Dawnbreaker after the update. Changed to single card and it did not help. Changed to borderless and it did not help  Swapped to an R9 280X, and still crashed. So I changed to Mantle, and restarted the PC and now it works. I am still not amused with DICE tho. What I can surmise is that their Mantle compatibility fix is map specific, and it broke some Direct3D setting         The built in team balancing options for servers right now is quite basic, and once it detects that one team has a number of more players, it will take the first person that has been killed on the other side and bring it to the unbalanced side.   This, while is logical sometimes can be infuriating, moreso in RUSH and OB. Three times in Rush, I died after arming an MCOM to see I was moved to the other side. There was an ironic moment when I died arming the last MCOM with the ticket count is less than 10, and I was moved to the other side to see my arm lead the other side to victory, while I was given a lost, even tho I was the one that armed that last MCOM.  For me, this is what I think should be done for team balancing  - No player movement should happen in RUSH once the tickets are are low enough (15 or less) - Players who died PTFO (capping, arming a bomb or MCOM) should not be moved - Players that has a high number of captures/MCOM arming or defending or bomb arm should be given "less priority" to be moved  Feel free to add your idea, or fix mine                     Remember when the time that mortar was really overpowered? Dice patched. Now mortar can't be reloaded by support pack, and surprisingly, whomever using mortar can't reload grenades. I kinda understand that logic of losing mortar would loose it for that life. but not having the ability to reload grenades as well is kinda annoying since once your mortar is dead and you are out of grenades, your options are limited to your primary and secondary weapon. There are times that I can't even help my teammate who is in a pinch since I don't have any projectile weapons anymore.  So Dice, please give back the ability to reload nades. I will do anything for you. I will even post good reviews of BF4 on youtube if you want me to      I am amazed not many people are asking for this to be fixed. As seen here: http://imgur.com/3bYuffE there are quite a few broken things, for one mortars stats are still not shown unless you click on it. Also some vehicles are given more service stars than they should, while in this case the mobile artillery is not given even tho I have more than 100 kills using it already       Usually I will get this error when the PC has been turned on for a while. At first I did as what it was said, using Task Manager to manually kill BF4.exe, but one day I realised that it was actually working, and if you wait a bit longer, the game will run as intended.  Just a heads up for anyone getting annoyed with this error                        As title. As it seems, there seems to be no easy way for the attackers to counter this tactic. The defenders can have two or three engy to fix the MBT and the MBT could cover any threat going down the mall                                       Encountered this problem when I can't join any server that is hosting China Rising map, even tho I am a premium user when I am using my laptop.

Heck, it won't reload my nades even, so I feel it's more of a bug than a nerf.   Ammo reload is fine for some reason   Sorry if anybody posted this issue, but everytime I kill using mortar, it just put there [] enemy name with the [] should have the weapon name inside it. And even when I look into my stats, my mortar kills are still 0, even tho I have killed quite a number of people with it.   Anybody else have the same problem?                  Since the Recon class in BF4 has the PLD, as well as the ability to "zero" the optics, I wonder how long does it take til two recons work in tandem, with one using the PLD to gauge how far the target is, and the second one will snipe accordingly.   This combo in theory would be faster (since only one recon is scouting, so there is not time wasted between switching from the PLD to the rifle and then adjusting the scope) and much more safer (spotter can also watch out for other threats incoming)                     forgot to take a pic of it but you can see the giant screen at C briefly showing BSOD before th building collapse. gives a new meaning to "computer crash" eh?   Usually when I join a server, it will auto give me the assault class, and even if I have changed class, if the round ends and we start a new one, I am still changed to the assault.   How do I stop this? In BF3, the class chosen is the last one you used in the round before, which is what people usually would expect            Newbie gamer here. Basically, why does game titles from Activision rarely have any price drops, if at all. I've seen many games, sometimes even new ones that were being sold, usually during "sales" or "promotion" periods for just the fraction of the original costs. I remember buying Tomb Raider (2013) during a promotion period for just 10 bucks, and yet I rarely seen Activision's game drop near this price range. Was hoping to see an at least 75% discount on the Activision sale this weekend but the most was only 50%, and even then it's only for one title per day.   Is it because the games by Activision deserve the price that they are selling them at?                                                      	139
 If there was, I guarantee that not a single attractive man on there is actually a virgin and is there just to pick up chicks they can deflower.   Tech support associates see that kind of shit all the time. They'll laugh about it behind the scenes and then forget it the next day when something weirder happens.

If she was dressed provocatively, sure, she is more at risk of harassment... Should she be harassed REGARDLESS of what she is wearing? Abso-fucking-loutely not. I would be pissed, too, but I'd see it as an opportunity to educate your girlfriend on why that kind of thinking perpetuates that kind of problem rather than just getting confrontational.   Tell the difference between "should of" and "should have"   My mother is bipolar and an alcoholic. She abused me growing up until I was 14 and reported her to my therapist. I went into the state's custody and bounced around from home to home. It was hell and I was completely fucked up from it but I became stronger as a result and after a LOT of hard work and seeking therapy/medication/help and not holding grudges or pointing fingers, I'm starting to really like who I've become. It isn't easy because I'm a very sensitive person and certain comments and events will trigger knee-jerk reactions where I can act emotionally or get angry at someones insensitivity but I think if I didn't persevere, I'd be a completely different and much sadder person...

Perhaps a raw honey and avocado mask left in your hair for a few hours will help.   I meet amazing people all the time just by being open and not intrusive.... Just the other night I met someone who I talked to for 3 hours and he told me "I'm telling you things I don't even tell my closest friends!" I just am really open, honest and curious about people and what they do or what makes them tick, so asking about their life and being genuine has always been what works for me.  I also draw or write whenever I sit at a bar, which usually instigates people to inquire what I'm doing and it just kind of goes from there...   Believe it or not, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc are all fruits, despite being regarded as veggies.  Vegetables are basically lettuces, root vegetables like carrots, etc as their seeds aren't contained/protected by the fruit (save for a few examples like strawberries where the seeds are outside)   It's $28 for 4 fl. oz... I believe $90 is for the 16 oz.  e: It's so dense and rich that it really only requires a small amount of conditioner.

You can rinse your hair with raw apple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon to 1 cup water) and massage it into your hair and let it sit for a few minutes, rinse with water and apply conditioner... Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils which causes your scalp to try to compensate for the lost oils and also the shampoo just dries out your hair follicles...

He was 9 pounds at his sickest and now he is a healthy 13 pounds (which for his size is appropriate). He also never meowed or made eye contact when he was at his sickest but now he is quite talkative and is a big happy goofball :)      You look stunning!!!!    That's reassuring!

 Kill everything? That could be one   On Page 13, Phillip's Dad says "Roll it around in your hand. *You've that thing* for nearly two years, Phillip." As you can tell, you're missing a "had"   This is my favourite one XD   For me it was SneakerHeadInTheBay, he would end his videos with Cocoa Butter Kisses.      I was waiting for someone to request Baby Blue lol. But it should be done by tommorow   Are they different? I just say "ediring" to make it simpler to understand is all.   It's there now lol, sorry   Lol, thanks. It's there now   So, in this [picture](https://www.imgur.com/4y36GGP), the left side of the plant is dead, while the right is alive. But they're connected at the root. Why?      I said to give me suggestions for songs to edit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2y0wdw/give_me_suggestions/) and I did them. Here is [Iconic](http://bit.ly/1APkSZl) (only a DL link) and  [Long Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxLKumuzQI), Give me some more! I can do any song!   nbsp;  EDIT: "Iconic" got taken down from YouTube for copyright, so I will just have the DL link there.   I have never agreed with something more. Please Stu, please.   So, a while ago, I edited the song "Confident" by Justin Bieber   Chance The Rapper to *only* include Chance's verse [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2x8eto/justin_bieber_no_more/). Give me suggestions of songs to do this with! Any song that Chance is in, and you want his verse singled out, I can do.   I have watched FMA once over, and I don't really wanna get into Brotherhood cause I watched some of it and it looked *veeery* similar to regular FMA. (I know, I sound ignorant) but, just give me reasons to watch it, I'm interested on what you all will say.   Tony Bennett, The Ink Spots, VI Seconds, CES Cru, Logic, Frank Sinatra, Avenged Sevenfold, Sleeping With Sirens, Vic Mensa, Mac Miller, and like all of OF.  I'm a bit varied.   I edited the song "Confident" and took out most of the Justin Bieber. Only the bridge + the hook is in there.  The link: http://youtu.be/ElIhcW-kkaY   This makes me sad.   My pleasure man.   As promised: http://youtu.be/ElIhcW-kkaY You are all welcome   I really wanna play it, and I see others have access to it as well.

 You definitely will have to choose between being a computational expert, or a synthesis person or a characterization expert. If you want to do 2D materials do apply to Penn State, Berkeley, GaTech and Rice.   1) No. You won't if you are doing electronic materials. But having a solid state physics course will be worth its weight in gold. A big misconception about MatSE is that it is chemistry heavy, but unless you are doing polymers you don't need to worry.  2) Many EE profs are in the fab side - ask them. Also do NOT go by US news rankings - they are utter shit in MSE.  3) I am male, but several of my friends are female in MSE, and they mostly say the atmosphere is collegial apart from the obvious overwork aspect.  4) If you really want to go for MSE - I will say go for it. But your GPA will be counted against you. It is hard to get into a good program below a 3.5 unless you have some really good experience that a PI wants or you have publications during your undergrad.   Do you have a good friend in your group? If possible try interacting with this lab tech along with your friend. And email EVERYTHING. Before you meet him, after always. My rule for interacting with difficult people - take your notebook, and jot down stuff while interacting, and send an email immediately after confirming all the things discussed. Always helps.   There was a similar study in Economics - where Harvard, MIT and Chicago produce the bulk of new faculty. Same in my field - materials science where the top 10 schools (top 10 is a bit debatable though) produce the majority of faculty.    Could you ask the company for a deferment of the job till your PhD is done?    Have you taken the physics GRE? If you are looking into physics schools that counts much more often.   For me it has been working with an untenured faculty in a big, prominent department. They are scared, and under pressure for tenure, and all that is transferred to you with a vengeance.    Yes, I buy the cheapest beer possible. Every night downing a few while chain smoking is my new "me time".   Same here at Penn State. The campus is now dry. The school has even rescheduled its Spring Break to coincide with St. Patrick's Day so that undergrads are out of town then.   Yeah I was a lurker, before I decided to take the plunge, and I will learn a bit more before posting next time :)         I know, but as girls are bombarded 24 hours with photoshopped washn\board abs, even those comfortable in bodies feel inadequate. Just my 2 cents.   ya, pirate drones!!    Several years back, when cleaning out my grandfather's stuff we found his old Omega watch that everyone assumed had been lost for 60 years. And my first reaction was how small men's watches were back in the day!  	15
 I didn't even know what one of those was until right now and mine is raging!   Yeah I think it was captioned something like that but I thought it just seemed a bit random in comparison to the rest of the documentary. Wasn't sure if it was actually a younger family member or something.  Still, wish I was taken under Jack White's wing when I was that age!    That bit was awesome! But who was the strange orphan boy that followed him everywhere??   Really?? I always assumed it started using the necks of beer bottles but that's way more disgusting and cool!  And I found the album on spotify so I'll check it out, cheers for the recommendation   Check this out, it's what made me have to buy one  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZlCz1hH-io   I've got a tuner so I'm just messing around with a few and seeing how they sound. Got it tuned open D at the moment but my capo is fast becoming my best friend for switching to open E   Man I used to love those songs a few years back, good choices!   Just started off with A Boy's Best Friend, nice and simple but really satisfying to play! Thanks!   After watching "it might get loud" last night and watching Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White do an awesome bit of slide improv I headed straight out today to get a slide.  Anybody got any good song recommendations for me to learn? And perhaps more importantly are there any drills I should practice with it?   Well that was easy!   RIP this subreddit    10 hours a day?! That's insane! I might break this into 1 hour a day for a month or something    While I admire what he achieve with his body, this guy is a massive douche and represents everything wrong with male culture today.
